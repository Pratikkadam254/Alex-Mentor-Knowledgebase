If you want to make more money tomorrow?
The number of things you can do is very limited.
If you want to make more money in 10 years, you take a very different play.
It's just like that building.
I explained to the beginning, if you want to build a 10 floor, building, you build a Currently, then, if you want to build a hundred floor building and guess what, it takes longer to build, 100, story building.
22:47
And so, to have the expectation that you're going to build 100 story building, in the same time, it builds 10 is unlikely and more realistically, the amount of time it might take to build 100 story, buildings Foundation might take the same time.
It takes to build the entirety of a tenth floor building which means that above the surface.
23:05
Somebody else building a 10 million dollar or ten floor building might happen way faster than you because you start seeing them a wreck this This building, right?
Red.
As yours is just continuing to build this base before you start building up, right, at that perspective that I'm telling you.
23:20
After having seen many, many, many, very successful entrepreneurs, nine-figure plus that perspective is arguably the single most valuable thing you have, which is, if you are not, if you are in a rush, it takes longer because you have to start over again.
So number one is, what problem are we solving?
The second is, we like, let's play it out, right?
23:38
So if you take your current agency or whatever business you have, you take it to the Nacho extreme.
There's usually a cap on it if you play out, multiple scenarios the next question, which is question 3 that I like to ask is which problem will be prefer solving or which problem?
23:53
We feel like we're more equipped to solve or which problems easier, because if you start framing it, in terms of the problem that you're gonna have to solve to be successful, it actually makes it much more controllable for you.
And this is how we solve problems in terms of businesses that we invest.
In acquisition.com.
We talked about multiple paths for each of these companies, right?
24:10
We'd have to pick one and If we're picking between, do I have to find somebody who has this experience, or do I have to negotiate, a slice of the companies I have I would say well which of these do we feel more equipped to do?
Now, I am not calm, we are really good at recruiting which is how we scale.
24:26
All the companies we have is that we recruit Talent I've already been there, done that.
And so we'd probably say hey we feel really confident that we could recruit somebody in and put seed capital N to get it going and then we do the whole pie.
And so for us, that would be a problem that we feel very confident solving and gives us the most upside.
24:42
I'd but you have to answer that for you, given your skill, set your resources and your experience, the main takeaway that I want everyone to have, is that there's constraints and there's leverage properly.
Identifying the thing that's actually limiting your business, not what you think is limiting is the one of the biggest unlocks in business.
25:00
It's how sometimes we can tedx a business in a year simply by reimagining what problems were solving.
And the reason we get that kind of growth is because when you focus on the constraint, you get the most leverage which means you get the most out for what you It in and I will restate this because I think it's so important people who are wealthy acquire or accumulate wealth faster than you not because they're moving faster but because they're doing more of the right stuff and less of the wrong stuff and when they do the right stuff they get paid disproportionately more per unit of effort.
25:30
And if you look at the doing this of each of the entrepreneurs, if they owned an HVAC agency, could probably the easiest one for you to visualize if they're running ads for 50.
Local markets for 50.
Different customers that At doing this is more or less the same as running 50 different.
25:46
Local markets ads for one company, arguably, it's even easier to do it for one company in 50 markets, because you can standardize everything on the back end and you only have one point of contact, you have to do it rather than 50 and she actually become even more efficient in that setting.
And so, the doing this is more or less the same, but the reward for the work compounds and that's how they become disproportionately wealthy compared to the one that just immediately wants to sell the Quick appointments, all the quick leads if you have a longer perspective and say, I want to build 100 story building, then you might be willing to take a little bit more time to find that partner, find that deal Strokes that works.
26:23
So that all of the work you do from now for the next 10 years stacks on top of each other rather than having to start at square.
One every month to figure out how you're going to pay your bills.
So just like I'm advising you to find somebody who has been there, done that and note I was like ten years of experience who has built in this industry.
26:42
The reason I'm saying 10 years is because in 10 years, you've lived through Cycles.
You've seen different interest rate environments.
You know what?
It's like, when things go up and go down, you've lived through lawsuits, you've had employees come and go like, you've been through some Cycles, right, you've Scar Tissue.
If I'm also now, talking to that industry expert, who's like, I've spent ten years in HVAC, how do I know this kid?
26:59
Who's trying to take a third of my business or offer to take a percentage of mind is legit?
I would say the same thing back to you which is go with somebody who's been doing it for a while who has metrics who who can demonstrate Forties with experience rather than with the words they say.
27:15
And so the real ideal seen here is that you have two people who have been building deep expertise in complementary, skill sets that fit within a larger boxer opportunity to capture something together.
And the reason I'm pretty passionate about this is that y combinator's done a ton of research on this, but they found that three founders is the optimal amount of Founders for a company.
27:35
Now, mind you, that's the most expensive split you ever do, is that first day, you split the pie into thirds, if the most dilution you're ever going to experience, As in one day you already own, you already gave gave away two thirds of the company.
But typically those three people will fit within core very deep responsibilities, you'll usually have somebody who's very good at operating businesses.
27:55
Usually if somebody is very good at products and the actual delivered like the Deep industry expertise and then I'll usually have somebody who's good at marketing and acquisition.
So one guy gets customers, one guy delivers, the things that this guy promises and this guy keeps the other two out of prison and make sure that people get paid that Raise funding that they pay taxes, that they actually run the business and manage people and recruit, and all of the other things associated and mind you by.
28:21
Carpenter is a vest, a lot of multi Deca billion dollar companies.
And so, again, if you're trying to build a very big building, this kind of the African proverb.
Like if you want to go fast, you can go alone if you want to go far go together.
And so you could reasonably develop each of those three skill sets and have a hundred percent of the pie.
28:39
The question is, how much life do you have to pay in order to To get those skill sets and if you measure over a ten year time Horizon, if it took you ten years to get all three versus three years to get your 1/3 and then you had seven years of building with the other two horses, where would you be at your 10?
That's the decision.
28:55
We all have to make and that's not one that I can make for you.
That's an individual decision.








0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with this.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star review.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
It is the Cornerstone Upon which every single top 100 or even top 50, billionaire has built their wealth.
0:36
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe in this video.
I'm going to walk you through the four scarcest highest value, skills that exist on Earth.
0:51
It is the Corner Stone upon which every single top 100 or even top 50.
Billionaire has built their wealth and before I've been just as a heads up, if you're new to the channel, my name is Alex.
I'm ozi own acquisition.com.
It's a portfolio of companies that is about 85 million dollars a year and I have nothing to sell.
1:08
You are the reason I make this channel so a lot of people are broke and I want to be one of them.
All right, so let's dive in before we get into each of the four skills.
All right, an important distinction.
I need to make here is that when I'm saying these are the scarcest skills, it is because of two major things.
One is that the assumption is that we are doing these skills at maximal scale.
1:26
All right, number one, and number two, is that These are not binary skills.
It's not.
I have it.
I don't have it but it's to what extent do I have it or to what degree?
Do I have it?
How masterful am I in the skill?
All right.
And so these are the four skills that exist and you will see a clear corollary between the four ways to create leverage.
1:49
All right?
So the first and easiest one for everyone to understand, and that's why I'm going to start with it is the ability to raise and multiply money, which means you have the Skill of getting money from other people and you can allocate that money in a way that it multiplies at a higher rate than anything else, right?
2:08
If you have that skill, you can create endless, unlimited fortunes, all right?
And again at scale which means you can get lots of money and you have and you can handle mask, massive sums of money and you can multiply it because of how good you are at the skill.
2:25
Alright.
So that is scarcest high value skill.
Number one, these are not an order.
These are just the top for any of these four, if you have them, can build you to a billion dollars plus.
Alright, number two is the ability to capture and multiply attention, all right?
2:45
And so think about a Joe Rogan for example, right?
He's able to build this, this Empire that he has because he's able to capture attention and multiply attention, which is a function of media Mark Zuckerberg, he was able to capture attention.
Get Go to look at his app and then tell their friends multiply attention, right?
3:04
And so the ability to capture and multiply tension, is the second scarce and high value scale that exists.
So, right now, if you're not making the money that you want to make, or you were poor, it's because you're usually not allocating your time to the highest value.
3:20
Scarce has skills that exist and oftentimes, these skills are not skills that can be taught, but they are skills that can be learned, which is a quote that guy from of all rock on which I like a lot and often, Times you'll note that it's not just one component of this.
It's not just being able to raise money, it's being able to also allocate it and multiply it.
3:37
It's not be able to just capture attention.
You have to be able to use that attention to, then multiply the attention on its own organically at no incremental cost.
All right?
That's the key point is that you have to be able to multiply at no incremental cost to you.
That's how you get unlimited, leverage.
3:53
Number three and this is one that a lot of people are going to trip up.
So I'm going to probably say this a couple different ways.
The ability to return time to other people at no incremental, cost to yourself at scale.
So for example, if I can save everyone on planet Earth, 10 minutes every day.
4:12
I will be a billionaire think about that.
And so the way to deconstruct that is to think, what is something that lots of people put spend time on?
Is there a way that I can automate this?
And again, zero incremental cost?
Which means this is often going to be some sort of technology or software solution.
4:29
No incremental cost to me, which means that if I build this thing, one time I can save everyone time forever.
That is a way to build a fortune.
That is a way to build billions and billions of dollars of wealth.
That is scarce.
4:45
High value skill.
Number three.
Alright.
So you can return time to other people.
You can decrease the effort of sacrifice that they experience in their lives that they do not want to experience.
And Cuz it's at no incremental cost, you can sell that thing to everyone because everyone will pay something for their time.
5:06
Now the amount may be met, you know, widely varying, but if it cost, you almost nothing, you can capture an entire Marketplace by giving them time back.
What did Google do gave everyone time back?
Now, they obviously multiple the average they monetize through advertising, but everyone was looking for something.
5:24
Normally, it would take longer to look for something and then they Consolidated in one place, they saved.
One time.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
5:39
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
6:00
Number four.
The fourth high-value scarcest skill on planet Earth is to be able to influence the behavior of others at Mass scale at no incremental cost to you.
6:16
So you look at someone like Jesus or any profit.
I'm not saying he's a prophet that's not my point here.
My point is, if you look at the mass leaders, probably shooting brought it up.
Otherwise people could trigger point is that there are people who have walked this Earth.
Thomas Jefferson.
You know what I mean?
People who have had massive influence over other people and and their subsequent behaviors, they take as a result.
6:41
And so this is the ability to change people's minds.
If you can help people change their beliefs and change their thoughts, you will change the way they behave, which is why when people come to a New Faith, all of a sudden, you see this massive change in Behavior.
6:58
It's because the operating Them in the lenses through which they see the world, the perspectives that they weigh their judgments using have shifted.
And so if you change the decision-making calculus you change all of the downstream behaviors that happen as a result.
7:13
And if you can do this in concert at scale, you can a change the world be.
You can also make a ton of money, all right?
And so if you look at the best persuaders of our era, their ones who for them, I would argue aggregated power.
7:30
Because some people at a certain point, you run out of needs for money.
You start looking for power.
And so if you have the ability to massively influence, Other people at scale at no incremental cost to you, you have the fourth scarce, high-value Roi skill that exists.
7:49
So right now Mosey Nation would it.
Do if you're looking for ways to increase your wealth, you can see that all four of these things work, our corollary to the four types of Leverage that exist.
These are how fortunes are created.
8:06
Leverage number one is on labor and actions on on on behalf of other people towards your goals.
So other people do stuff for you.
That was the fourth one I just mentioned.
All right, that's around labor work and basically actions other people take When I talked about money multiplying, right.
8:26
That is leverage using Capital.
So the ability to maximally raise and multiply Capital at scale.
Is a high-value skill.
The third is being able to give people their time back.
8:42
What we're talking about.
This is a good friend of mine.
Who's a technologist?
He says all technology.
Ottomans luxury and luxury is typically a function of convenience effort and sacrifice.
And so we look at the places where people spend time and spend effort and sacrifice and we return it back to them.
8:58
At no incremental cost, that is how you create scale using technology, all right, and the key resource for getting people back It is time.
All right.
And then the fourth and final one is Media.
All right?
And so using media and being able to multiply media via the capturing and multiplication of attention, because ultimately media is just the substrate through which impressions are conveyed to other people signals that they are interpreting through their senses.
9:29
The idea is, how can we capture as many senses as we can?
And then get those senses to get other people plugged into our thing.
And then, In so doing, it will compound.
And so one of the Keynotes to note about each of these four things that I just mentioned, is that each of these skills compound?
They are not multiplicative.
9:46
They are not additive.
They are not incremental.
They are compounding, which means they are exponential in nature.
A lot of people say, it's an exponential growth.
They don't even know what exponential means, but it means that it multiplies unto itself.
And then each time, it multiplies itself, bigger upon itself, not just like we to ex every year.
10:06
But it would have to be when we incrementally go, ten percent 10%, ten percent growth that is where is compounding.
And each of these in the form of Labor, people are influence.
People tell other people, people tell other people, they do the thing for you.
And it compounds with capital the money that you multiply get you more money, which you then multiply it compounds the time you save people more time which then gives you more people to save time for and it compounds with attention, you capture the attention.
10:36
Didn't you multiply the agenda because those people tell other people and then the attention comes back.
And so each of these are quadratic in nature, in terms of the skills and those, my friends are where you focus your time if you want to create a fortune.
And so you can look at your skill set right now and say which of these skills do I lack or which of these four buckets?
10:54
Do am I currently at least working somewhat directional?
Each words and then we can again think this is not a binary checklist of, I have the skill or I do not have the skill but to what degree to what extent am I a master?
Of this thing.
It's a lots of love Mo Z Nation keeping awesome.
11:09
I make this channel because a lot of people broken, I don't you be one of them.
I think I said this earlier, but my name is Alex.
You Mosey own acquisition.com.
You know, all the dollars things like that.
I'll see you guys next video.
Bye.
Of this thing.
It's a lots of love Mo Z Nation keeping awesome.
I make this channel because a lot of people broken, I don't you be one of them.
I think I said this earlier, but my name is Alex.
You Mosey own acquisition.com.
You know, all the dollars things like that.
I'll see you guys next video.
Bye.








0:00
People are making podcasts and thinking in 90 days, they're somehow going to blow up in the beginning. 150 episodes is just me talking about how to run a gym better.
I got a DM, the other day.
Somebody who's like yeah it's easy for you to build this brand because you already have this big audience.
I was like, dude just start.
0:15
He was discouraged by the fact that he had no following.
You had no audience etcetera, 99% of people who are watching this, do more crochet and then you'll have cool shit to talk about rather than regurgitating other people's stuff.
But for everyone who sees the overnight success, right?
Every what I want you to do is go to my podcast.
0:31
And look at the time stamp on my first episode is 2017, five and a half six years ago, it just now hit the top ten.
And in that six-year period, I did not miss every week.
One, two, three podcasts for six years and so people are making podcasts and thinking in 90 days, they're somehow going to blow up.
0:52
When the reality is that, you're finding your voice for the first year.
You're figuring out what way you communicate, your learning, how to teach you, how to entertain you, how to present your I'm going to speak and you're also learning about the stuff that you're learning, meantime, right?
Like in that period of time, I might not have had as much stuff that was as cool in the beginning that applied as many people because the first 150 episodes is just me talking about how to run a gym better right around 150.
1:13
I start to talk about Marketing in general because that's what I was into at the time and then I start talking about sales that I start talking about business in general and Ma and things as they evolved over time and so the subject matter as well as my skill and delivering it both improved over that period of time and now the podcast is top 10 on entrepreneurship and very high ranked in - next the names that I looked up to my whole career.
1:33
I'm like, holy cow, Mike Weir.
Wait, we just went about this guy that I've been looking up to my whole life.
It doesn't take 90 days.
It takes years.
If you thinking days, the time is going to pass, no matter what.
But if you can think in decades, when you make your goals, when that decade does pass, it'll show that you were thinking that way, right?
1:52
Not the outcome of go make the action, the goal, if the action is, did I make the post?
Did I make the reach out to every day?
Then you're a success.
You check both boxes.
Want to take a quick story.
So there was a guy who started at the first gym with me.
Same day.
Alright, and we've been friends since then, and I started my gym and he started his gym and he started change him.
2:10
So we went in parallel.
All right and he ended up selling those gyms and he wanted to go online.
He was like dude I need to build like a brand.
I was like dude you just need to start posting you know short form stops making stuff that's valuable.
He posted every day for six months and then one video took off and then the next video took off in the next video took off and then of all of a sudden now he's making a hundred thousand dollars a month from the content that he was making here.
2:38
I've been doing business for nine years and then all of a sudden it took off and you and you message me is like I'm super grateful that they told me to do that and so he did the post, he did the reach outs and what ended up happening is that earlier on he would he would have videos that would start taking off.
You start doing reach out to start making sales and then you'd make some money and then you would slow down and then all of a sudden you get in scarcity mode once.
2:59
I was like, oh shoot, there's no money coming in.
There's no money coming in and then you start making content, which are doing shots again and you make money again.
And he was like, dude, how do I break the cycle?
And what we did was we shifted, what he was focusing on because you're focusing on the sales use making is focusing on the money, he was making rather than focusing on the process.
You are not successful in my eyes because whenever you see some outcome, you stop the activities, which means you don't have the trait of consistency.
3:22
That's like the reason you want where you want to be is because you can't do things repeatedly.
And so most people can't do one thing over and over again.
You need to be be able to do the doing without seeing the result of you're doing.
And you have to keep doing it.
And if you can keep doing things independent, and this is both ways.
3:38
If it goes really well, you keep doing the thing that got you there.
And if it's not going well comma yet, you keep doing the things so that you get good enough that one day it will.
And that's the shift that most people don't make.
And I think that's why most people just a poor.
When the reality is that if you can commit to the actions and behaviors and traits that you will grow through doing then at the end of this process, a decade later, you will be the Type of person who can do something for a long period of time and wait, and I promise you that, if you have that trait money will never be a constraint of your life.
4:06
And this is from Atomic habits every winter and every loser have the same goals.
So when you measure Yourself by having this external thing and grew like set goals, everyone wants to be rich.
Everyone wants to have a six-pack your goals, don't make you unique.
It's the activities that you do.
4:23
That make you unique, the goal of the winter, sticking it to the activities.
The goal of the loser is taking me to the goal 52% of 18 year, olds High School seniors.
Think they're going to be millionaires by 25.
The world is going to be shook, many of you will fail and that's because most of you have the same goal of 50%.
4:38
You think are going to be mine are right?
It's just math.
'The but only a small percentage will because if you want to be a millionaire, you're not going to focus on making a million dollars, you're going to focus on the stuff that makes a million dollars.
And so when you can divorce the activities from the outcome, then you can focus on the doing which whether your income does this over that period of time.
4:57
Your self-esteem Remains the Same because you're committing to what you can control.
If you can make that shift, it will change your life.
So I started making podcast six years ago, I committed to that process when I signed on with a you YouTube vendor a few years ago on the first call.
5:13
I said, I'd like to have this channel, be something in 5 to 10 years.
I was like, look at it then and see if it was worth continuing to do.
I was like, but I'm in for a decade and he stopped me afterwards.
He was like, I've literally never had a client, say that to me, ever.
5:29
He's like, they're all, like, how can I get leads in the first 90 days from YouTube and like all of those, like, if we're making progress I'm good, I will commit to that.
I think that if you can think that way you will get what you want and then people will ask you a decade from now, man.
How did you have this overnight success and blah, blah, blah.
5:46
And aren't you like don't the followers and the fans like how does it not get to your head?
You're like, because it was never the goal.
And so I feel just as good at your one as they do at your 8 because the activities that I committed to remain the same.
If you can think that way and you can shift your perspective, it will it'll decrease your emotional ups and downs and I think we all need ways to decrease our emotional ups and downs in.
6:05
The game of business because like, we need to have s lives that their lives in the fourth lives.
And the way to do that is to not put your life, your game playing life in something that you can't control.
But putting all your game playing life in the things you can.
Right now we just crossed our 400th episode 400 episodes.
6:24
Like if I did one a week, that's 52 48, one a week for a year that'd be eight years of doing that.
If I had 400 episodes I'm at like dr6.
If you make Did long-form pieces of content.
I guarantee that you're following would be bigger than it is today.
6:40
Well how long is that going to take as long as it takes?
Because the goal was never the outcome goal was to do it.








0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast on everybody.
I have my new Walking guest and I'm super pumped about it anyways and hopefully, you can hear me better from this mic.
0:36
So just let me know.
But how did take money from broke people?
Which I apparently did in your solid at that later babies how to take money from broke people.
I want to use that title mostly because I figured it was incendiary, if you feel like you take away from those people, well, I'm gonna give it to you.
0:52
And so sales really about taking fun.
So I wanted to basically talk about something, we hear all the time, which is My market is broke.
My people are broke people coming in, don't have money by mobile robot, right?
And I want to tell you a story about what we did with our sales team to fix that.
1:10
So a couple things one that is 100% of belief, right?
For me, the belief that I adopted that transformed my life happened when I was in selling in the ghetto.
And I mean we're talking like Downtown Hood of Washington, d.c., when I was selling as a done-for-you service, I fly out to someone's gym and then I would sell 100 people at 500, 600 bucks a head and then I would keep The Upfront money.
1:36
They kept the Background and I was in downtown, d.c. and I was like, man, this is, I was like and I started getting into my own head and like, and no one here is gonna happen.
Money blah, blah, blah.
And so then I was like, you know what, we're selling it for 600 and I'm going to do it for more.
1:52
And the belief that I that I had to adopt was the reason that people are broke is because they don't know how to hold on to their money, right.
Which is true.
The reason people are broke because they don't hold on, hold on to their money, which means But if someone's broke, they should be easier to sell because they're easier to convince the depart for their money than somebody who's waffle, that's what made them up, right?
2:17
And on the flip side of someone's wealthy, I'm like, then they got the money to afford, right?
And so, that was a fundamental belief for me, that help me dramatically increase.
Increase the amount of clothes, I had four people.
When I was like, man, I don't know if they have the money around the someone, well, then it should be easy.
So, so walks in the door and I immediately start judging them and think.
2:34
Oh, okay!
Should it be?
Should be Easy.
And I will get Eve all excited to get.
Right?
And then what do you know we close this many people at 600?
As we did at 500 400 is the biggest price.
They have to break.
The change is in your head.
Not only consumers that they don't know if I supposed to be right.
2:50
The first step second thing about how to sell or take money from broke people when we had our Mobile sales team.
So after I did that, I was like, okay.
Let's see if other people can do that.
And so we had a whole sales team so we have don't know this.
So used to fly guys out to other peoples Jim's.
We had eight guys.
3:06
With fire for us and then they would post up shop and they would sell, right?
And I had to do with the same issues with them about the broke mindset etcetera.
So what do you got?
It, got so broken down because the guys would just, you know, they just wanted to get the yes, right.
Just like anyone just like a gym owner.
3:22
What?
You just wanted to get the yes.
And so, after one of the months early on, I looked and I was like, man, I was like, why are you sorry?
Why are these deposits small?
I was like, what is going on?
And I look through all the contracts that come in and like eighty percent of them had Like delayed first payments, all sorts like horrible payment plans that kind of guy.
3:41
And I was like this is not going to cut, it does not compare bills, right?
And so that's how I call the sales team up and we have our normal Daily Tech and I was like guys like no more payment plans, Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
3:59
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
4:22
I was like, it's either it's 250, 250, 14 days from now.
I was like, or nothing.
Like, if you sell them great, but you're not getting Commission on.
And then overnight do one payment plans.
Same clothes, and percentages as.
The only thing is, is if you give yourself the opportunity, if you give yourself that out of like, well, maybe I could drop them down to this or maybe I could give them this other offer, or maybe I could split into these types of payments almost invariably the only person that you're convincing in your own head as you It's not affecting the prospect, that's why so many people.
4:54
If you see them and sales like I don't know if you've ever had this happen but someone selling me something.
And then I ask you a question and they're like you know, or we could just do the stupid thing and I was like, I mean, I didn't even know that existed.
I was going to say yes to the other thing.
I was just asking a question and then they just gave me something.
5:11
That's a third, a third as much.
And I was like, huh, how about that?
And so he sometimes got to catch yourself.
Like are you doing and the final piece about like how to take money?
Broke people, is that you have to genuinely believe that their life is going to massively improve by having Fitness and discipline and consistency, and somebody who loves on them every day in their life, right?
5:36
You have to believe that and if you do believe that, then you can really transform someone's life.
I mean, I've seen, I've had a girl come in, put the entire thing on a credit card, all right, and then lose 100 pounds.
Get a new job.
5:51
Job transfer more life.
And you just have to believe that this is going to be that person, right?
And this is a girl who had no money and then because of that at the confidence and then was able to move on and then start like, it became the Cornerstone that she built her routine off of was first thing she does.
The more she comes to, Jim Rice, comes the gym.
6:07
And after that she goes and she does her her intentions in the car and she listens to an audio book, right?
And so it's like you're building this lifestyle for these people.
So they can improve themselves.
And this is just one aspect of that Improvement.
So how do you take money from broke people?
First, you got to believe That they're going to be better off from it.
6:24
Second, you have to believe that they're bad at managing their money, which is why it can be easy for you to get it from him.
All right?
Third, you don't need to make payment plans and always try and down.
So stuff.
All the time slot times objections are just questions.
They're not actual obstacles, they're just curious.
They're just wondering.
6:39
It's not because they don't want to buy.
You don't automatically start bouncing yourself for making payment plans and don't give yourself those options because if you do the only person you're hurting is yourself and not them cool because at the end of the day, here's one really good one.
For you, for all my gym, owners who have trainers at your gym is right now.
6:56
Who, you know, are broke.
You're like, I paint you like I know you.
I know what you mean.
You're broke, right?
How many of them do you see dropping 500 $600 a month?
On supplements, Lululemon other gym, memberships, other swag, other stuff workout programs, nutrition?
7:13
Programs coaching, right?
How many of them have you seen do that all of them?
Why?
Because it's a priority for them.
So, just never ever think that any of these people walk in the door can't afford it.
It's just like, it's just, it's just easy.
7:29
Reminder, for yourself to look at your own stack, and think.
Okay, if these guys are doing it, everyone has the money.
Everyone has the money for whatever they want.
I had a girl who used to just drive, Uber, two days a week, so she could pay for a gym membership.
There's always options, right?
There's always ways to pay for stuff, right?
7:46
It's just, can I really convince this person that I'm going to try From their life and because they are broke that I'm going to help them get out of that, too.
Because of these skills in the character traits that they're going to learn as a part of our program, right?
Brooke Bieber.
The easiest to take money from because they don't have good mindset surround them.
8:05
Alright so anyways guys thanks so much for the day.
I'm just super excited.
I'm celebrating my fast Wi-Fi.
I'm pumped about it and hopefully the audio is a little bit better with this Mike.
Give me a favor.
You're like taking friend made your sales manager about how no one's broke.
They were just broke of mind.
8:21
And not of wallets.
Alright guys, have an amazing day motivation.
Monday.
Nobody's broke Monday.
I'll talk to you guys on foot side, boys.









0:00
When I was in my 20s, I wanted to be a millionaire and when I was a millionaire I wanted to be in my 20s.
And so the idea that my future self would trade all the money.
He had to be poor in 20 again made me really reanalyze how I saw living life in the moment.
0:19
Welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Now what's the difference between someone who's selling all the time and someone who's never selling and doing a disservice because they don't offer someone to buy something when they know like, okay, I have this coaching program when this course for this thing where I know you could get value, if you took action but maybe they shy away from it because they want to focus on brand so much and not be the salesperson, but again it's actually doing a disservice.
0:51
Yes, you guys are not in your program.
So I think it actually has less to do to with the ratio of how much they're selling versus.
He's serving in their content, but more so the ratio of selling and serving overall, because most times because of this, we were talking before, this about the internet marketing space.
In general, is that most people's products are not survey.
1:09
They're not good terrible, right?
They're terrible.
It's so, it happens is like it is the most right hook of right hooks possible because like you just lose a ton of Goodwill with the thing.
Apple doesn't lose Goodwill when they come out with an iPhone.
Everyone's just excited about it and they use the iPhone.
They tell their friends.
So the difference is in the Goodwill that comes with the quality of the product.
1:27
And so I think that's where the issue is.
It's not like do I sell or do I not sell?
Its just is the thing that I'm selling and the vast majority of people are putting all the time our natural promoters not product, right?
And so like most times, the greatest product people, like Nepal had this quote, that I really like you said, you're only selling cause you don't know how to Market and you lie mark because you don't know how to build a product mmm, because like, the best products market and sell themselves now.
1:48
Obviously, if you're Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, it's like you build amazing products and then you back them with unbelievable marketing.
And then you have an army of salespeople that that, you know, are thing for you.
So it's like, then you have them all and then you have, you know, it's really dark of.
Yeah.
But like just being acceptable, any of those will make you money but you get the multiplicative, you know, compounding effect.
2:07
If you're good at two or three of them, right?
Were you always good at making money?
Or was there a time where you were like, man, I'm just broke struggling and trying to figure this thing out even Zone.
Like how much we're defining, you know, me?
Like, right out of, I finished, I finished College in three years and then did the management consulting path.
And so, like, out of college, I was making like 50,000, right?
2:24
Right.
And I lived in Baltimore.
So, like my, the cost of living.
At $5.
And so I was able to save a bunch of money so I saved 50 thousand dollars in two years.
Wow living there.
And that's what I was able to start my my gym with did you understand money when you were in your teens or growing up, or did you feel like you are scared of it or it was scarce?
2:44
Or are you thinking on this?
I'm not really worried about money, it'll come when I'm ready.
I was always, I've always been a saver.
What was going to savor?
Not a huge spender.
I think part of that is because I don't get a lot of like when I pay a dollar, I feel something different and much.
Most times if I buy something, I don't feel any different.
2:59
So I don't get a lot of utilities, best thing ever.
I just don't get a lot from it.
I think I've been aware of that for a long time and so, like if you don't spend a lot and you make even a normal amount of money for a decent amount of time, you end up having a lot.
And my income went up.
I would say that there's definitely elements of scarcity that I believed in, for a long time.
3:17
Yeah.
I mean, a real competition Was Won.
Tell me about it.
What was that about?
So, like when I had, you know, when I had my gyms, for example, this is, you know, almost a decade ago, you know, I was so concerned with the guy down the street, He who does marketing is, he copying my ads like I used to get so obsessed with this stuff and like it's just so doesn't matter.
3:34
Like at all.
Like you he could copy and we could both have really big successful Jim's.
It's not like there's a lack of people who need to get a check.
Right.
And then even then it's like we're only talking about a five mile radius, not like the rest of the world.
Like it's there's just let you two orders of magnitude of thinking in terms of scale that I was just like, completely like aloof to what happens when we focus on competition so much, what happens to our ability to scale?
3:57
Grow our creativity, our money, making abilities.
I think you become emotionally reactive to the activities of the other person and so you're truly focused on nothing that adds value and so it's because of it's not the competition like competitors don't put you out of business but you obsessing over competitors does.
4:13
Right?
What what should people be doing instead of obsessing over competition?
It's all customers.
It's all just too.
Because like if you can get, you know, there's a billionaire in my, in my building who he was asked on TV, he's like, if you had one thing that you could tell someone, If they wanted to build a company like yours, he said your customer must absolutely love your product.
4:32
A lot of people just underestimate the amount of effort it takes to go from good to great in a product or service.
It's like the difference between a five star restaurant and a four-star restaurant, you know, looks like 20% but it's 10 times the effort.
You don't have made a difference to me like a one Michelin star in a two Michelin star.
Restaurant is an ocean, right?
4:49
Right.
And so, I think, like, I use the book as example, because it's an easy one to reference, most people try and just write a book.
And then once the final word, Stand there, like, send it to the editor, edit it, cool, and let's ship it out, but like that book I rewrote five times and to end the whole thing and each time the goal was to make it short.
5:07
It's like how can I say this in fewer words?
How can I say this one, less words and, and in doing that, and the same thing happened with Jim won't with that product, is that every time we created a 2.0 3.0 4.0, we made it shorter how can we make it easier to consume and then also I mean I was reason we both wrote the book about the value equations.
Like what is value right?
5:22
How do we Define that?
And so if we're customer-focused we can obsess on value and then have a very iterative Approach.
And I think that you came from the internet marketing world.
Like, and I talk, I, I've given this in, like, a couple of, like, closed or masterminds from, like, guys, like you all say that your products, amazing.
5:38
I'm like, what's your CR, say?
What's your say Jess?
What's your NPS scores?
What are your tea TVs?
And they're like, I'm like, well, if I asked you, your CPM your CPL, your, your coffee black, all your cost of acquisition.
Like, all of these things, you could rather was off in two seconds.
I'm like, so you guys say that your products amazing and yet you don't measure a single metric around product.
5:57
Wow, if so focusing on that, right?
So they just don't like things, like we can get that part right.
Then you get so much because if we can just get each customer to get one more customer, our return on adspend doubles, right?
But if you think about what your contribution margin is on that extra customer, if you don't have to spend the cost of acquisition, so much of that drops to the bottom line.
6:16
And then the company just becomes so much more profitable.
Yeah.
Just by like tiny levers that we do here.
Like, how can we take, you know, with think we were talking earlier about our publishing business.
We're like, okay, publishing you something.
It takes a long time to do.
How can we figure?
About TVs, time to Value.
So how can we figure out some sort of experience or some sort of wins and one can have in the first seven days?
6:34
Like how can we get them A dollar?
Is there anything that we can do to launching their book?
Yeah, exactly.
Like something some proof of concept and we were able to figure out how to talk about minute.
You know, many book get that going in a very short period of time so that people could just enter like, hey guys, this is an MVP, this isn't your perfect product, we just want to prove to you that it works and so then they get $1 and their account.
6:53
Like we're like you are now an option for momentum and now you have that identity shift that happens just like I just mean During the internet.
Like, yeah, you did now.
Let's do a real book.
That's like really good.
Like we know this is not the product, with this is proof of concept and so that was like a more creative when we had to do.
But like, you know, their businesses, it's like, how can we always drag forward?
7:10
At least some sort of big wins.
We get the emotional Bayan to them fit, you know, fall three.
Like, when we had the gyms we back in the day, I would run people through like a, six-week really aggressive died in the beginning, and that was.
Because even though the sustainable weight loss is it takes a much longer period of time, you know, Etc.
7:27
The The slower.
You lose it, the longer it sticks off, but the faster you lose in the beginning, the more likely to stick with it.
Interesting.
So you get this emotional by in and you're like cool.
Okay.
We just did a lot of weight loss in six weeks I need you to chill for sex, right?
And then they're like but now they believed us because we had just delivered you know a big win.
7:45
Kind of got results.
Exactly.
Yeah and so it's like we know how to do it but now we're like you can trust that we do know how but now let's just maintained for six weeks.
Get your hormones back make sure everything's good hunky-dory but a little more muscle because you lost them during this Of aggressive cut.
Yeah, and then kind of, then we'll get into a more sustainable phase, right?
8:01
So it's just how, can we drag that forward?
And I think that level of obsession the way people obsess about promotion.
If they obsess the same way about product, the amount of profit thing, Nick is a result of that.
It's just like, it's huge.
And those are sellable businesses, the marketing driven businesses do not have nearly the Enterprise Value that the pollen driven businesses.
8:17
So, would you say the key to going from?
Good to Great?
Is obsessing on product.
Great product greatness 100%.
What if someone you know, they have any product to physical It product coaching a software and they're watching and listening.
What should they be thinking about?
To making the product that much better?
8:34
They've put a lot of time and energy launching.
A building at that.
Got sales, maybe they've had it for a year or two, how do they break it all down?
And it says it is that 20 different factors?
Is it like just do these three things and it's going to improve the quality of product.
What should they think about?
It's a really good question.
So there's like three different angles I want to take this is hopeless so one is like what I talk about the book which is like the value equation.
8:55
So what is that?
So there's Or variables in value equation.
The first one is the dream outcome, which is is the thing that I'm delivering fundamentally valuable, and this is specially for people, probably more.
So who are trying like starting out in there in there, like entrepreneurial career, when a map drawn out for me, but if you want to sure?
Well, hold it up for people.
9:11
Yeah, so you've got, you've got your dream, I'll come so I just put dream here, right?
You've got dream outcome, which is the first variable, second variable is the perceived likelihood of achievement.
And so the idea is and I'll give you an example of this.
If you have, let's say you wanted to get plastic, surgery, whatever.
And is that what you did with your cat?
9:31
If you want to get plastic surgery and you had the option of two guys who are going to do, the surgery, one guy is on 10,000 surgeries and one guy is fresh out of medical school.
This is his first surgery.
Which guy would you go with?
Probably 10,000?
It might even take this guy, half the time to do.
The surgery, is this guy?
And so double the price, right?
9:46
So we might and it's double the price.
Why?
Because of the perceived like that of achievement, we believe that when we pay this, man, we are more likely to achieve what we want even though the work is the same probably longer on this side, but our perception of What we were going to get in a real way increases prior to purchase, which is the same reason that if you have like 20 people who told you that this restaurant is amazing, you're willing to pay way more, even though you haven't experienced yet.
10:09
It's the perceive likelihood of getting the outcome to rewind on the dream outcome.
This is more a commentary that how is it that you have a 50,000?
You cannot you can solve the same problem.
It's a weight loss because everybody understands own, if I'm trying to help somebody lose weight, there's 50,000 our Solutions and there's $5 solution.
10:25
There's free Solutions, right?
50,000 or solution.
Get liposuction, right?
And get a full body lift or whatever.
I had a right or you can get an e-book, you know, for five bucks.
So the question is, why are these two things, you know, more valuable and that again goes to perceived achievement.
10:40
But if I went from the weight loss to let's say making money, if I two things in general, all the things in the making money category will be will be priced higher because there's a more direct Roi.
Yeah.
So that's why between categories dream outcome as a category can be higher or lower.
But then once you're within a category as the other three variables, so perceive likely to achieve Edmonds.
10:58
Number one of the other three variables.
The next variable is underneath, which is the time delay.
So between when I pee and when I get, what's my delay there, right?
So if I were to say using the weight loss example, if you swipe your credit card and you look down at your stomach and you just have abs how valuable a lot for that.
11:15
Exactly.
All we did was just decrease the time delay it.
So if let's say in a B2B example if you had a marketing agency for example and normally it's like okay you guys need to send me all this creative and we got to get everything spun up and it's going to take us, you know, for Five days to really get everything.
You know ramp, we got to build a funnel and had a lot of follow-up, right?
11:32
And then, let's do a different example.
We're on the same call.
You guys says, cool.
We're going to get you going, and you hang up the phone and your phone rings with the prospects, pretty big, even if it's the exact same thing, the price 45 days from now, your phone rings, the prospect today, your phone rings, the prospect, how different is the perception of value phenomenally different, which is why the time delay is such a huge piece, which is why time to Value referencing earlier, such a huge part of increasing, the perceived value of the product.
11:57
Hmm.
And so that's the time delay, that's the third.
Yep.
And then, the fourth one is effort and sacrifice and so effort, and sacrifice are two sides of the same coin.
So effort as I defined, it are things that you must begin doing that.
You do not want to do that.
You did not have to do prior to the purchase.
Give me an example.
12:13
If we have to wake up early to go to the gym, that would be effort.
That is something that I never have to do, is that I do.
It's a sacrifice, I uses the equal opposite, which is what do I have to stop doing that?
I want to do.
Yeah, that I that I would continue to doing continue doing it.
Didn't have to stop beating milkshakes at midnight.
12:29
Or?
Yes.
And even in the B2B example, with a marketing agency will now, what do I have to do?
I have to start making this content?
I have to start hopping on meetings every week.
We have to start looking over these metrics like the Hardys root ball.
I got it right.
And so oftentimes especially like businesses.
They think that their price is the most expensive thing that they have in the cost.
12:46
And it's not so think about this if you've ever ask someone, hey I'll give you my service for free and they said no it's because there are other costs that you're not taking to consideration which also means a lot of times your prices.
Ice has far more wiggle room in it than you think it does.
And if you can decrease a much bigger hidden cost by asking for more money and you can solve a hidden cost, you can make more money and improve their experience at the same time, right?
13:11
And that's when you just make noodles and Oodles of money, when does someone know?
So, this is a good to Great concept, right?
Where we should be focusing on it, kind of these this me analogy and Factor.
When does someone understands a lot of people talk about?
They're worth like, I'm worth this.
13:26
I deserve this weather.
An employee or they're not tripping or, and they want to price something.
Yeah.
When should they be thinking about their worth and increasing the rates, whether as an employee, or as an entrepreneur?
How do they know?
Because the only worth what people are willing to pay.
13:41
So how do you get people to pay what you believe you're worth?
I think there's three variables that come into like how much you can charge right?
The first one is value or perceived value from the prosperity value.
Yeah.
So perceived value, the second one is how good you are at negotiating.
13:58
Which would become, which I put that are persuading you probably put that as persuasion in general.
That's a good.
If it's if it's a job, you might be negotiating or if it's a customer you might be negotiating to, but it's persuasion in general.
That's a whole skill to develop on its own 100%.
And the third one is how unique it is, so that there's no easy alternative, right?
14:16
And so if like, for example, let's say I provide something that's really valuable.
I'm unbelievable at and selling rare.
And then another guy is willing to just do all the same stuff for just less right, right.
And so, It's being D commoditized, or talk about in the book too, is that people have to be able to they cannot and the goal should be with our, our services that we have that no one can hold up, our service and somebody else has to say these two are similar enough, I'll pick the cheaper one.
14:41
And so the goal is, how can we differentiate ourselves in enough Ways by looking at the value equation?
And thinking, what are all the things that are making this take longer?
And how can I remove them?
We're all the efforts.
And sacrifices, even these micro things, these nuances that make things more difficult.
And so, like the kings of this, if you look at like Amazon, Right, like the biggest companies, the world, I'll reverse the small companies that are out there.
15:02
They always focus on the first two things.
Let me let me promise something really big.
Let me show you all these testimonials and that's all they do just promote these things.
It's amazing.
Listen, Sammy that's amazing.
Listen to Tommy, right?
That's all they do.
But the biggest companies are World folks on the bottom side of the equation, which is, how can we make things faster?
15:18
And how can we make things more effortless, like Netflix destroyed Blockbuster, not because they fundamentally change the product at all.
All they did was, they made it happen immediately.
And from the comfort of Home, right?
And so they just dramatically decrease the cost and effort that was associated with watching movies and boom, they blew up.
15:34
And so like Jason flatly and his a friend, he said, you know, one of the easiest business models in the world, is just look at whatever else is doing and do it in half the time, right?
Like this is a simple like people.
Like what do I do for business?
Just look what it like if someone comes you know like can cut your lawn and whatever months hours, you clean houses.
15:50
So you can clean houses and less time because it's just less inconvenience when people when you're there in their house less time and less money or same money, save money.
Yeah, or more money, you know, like it depends on what are the what are the hidden costs?
So like probably like with cleaning, what are the headed?
Where all the things that people hate scheduling is, probably a pain, right?
16:06
Hearing the noise is probably a pain, like silent cleaners, right?
Like, what are liking you you list the sound.
That's we all I know in the book of like the process of thinking through this book, what are all the pains and problems that your customers complain to you about?
And so, like the goal is always in the support tickets.
16:23
So when you talk about like obsessing about a customer, right?
It's let's go through all the comments on.
The videos, right?
Let's go through all of the support tickets that are coming in, in those complaints inside of the complaints.
Sure.
Like you don't want to do is say like all these guys are all victims because then you lose all the power as a business owner by just blaming that.
16:40
So if you just accept all of it is like these are all like as long as the thing that they're saying is not false.
If it's unreasonable then, let's see if we can figure it out.
Maybe no one else has figured out it is.
But we might as well try.
Yeah, right.
And so I think if you can approach it with like a very open hands of like when you accept the feedback, it gives you the gold to really Create huge breakthroughs in products and services.
17:00
Were you always open to the feedback from customers or when on jewelry be like, why did you learn to be like, okay, this sounds like a victim conversation but there's something here where this person struggling, and if I can make it more effortless, it's gonna be a better product for that person.
I think it's just taken time and I think it's, I think a lot of it I think is is really beating down your ego and it's like in a lot of ways with business in my opinion, ego is the enemy because it gives us too much confidence when we don't deserve it.
17:27
When did you start beating down?
Here we go.
I mean, I've been trying to do it since I was 19, it's just been a very slow process.
I just I just realized that it was the root of all the unhappiness and like, everything that I have was in comparison to other people with, for no reason.
And like, you know, I've obviously adopted some perspective, probably get into later, but that are contrary.
17:46
And in nature, in terms of like how we live, just, there's no benefit to you go, there's just none.
And then I have a different thing that I've been thinking about recently, excited to share with you, sure.
So there's you've probably heard this.
But there's a lot of evidence that points to with mitochondrial DNA that we go back to.
18:01
Like one one woman birth like the mitochondrial.
DNA of all humans is comes like tracks back to one on woman, right?
And so I think that that's interesting within the context of Legacy because people talk about Legacy and they want to like, like, leave something for their progeny and we love our sideways family members, right?
18:19
What do you mean?
Like all these like you're turning from?
Yeah, exactly.
But like if we all came from the same mitochondrial DNA, right?
Then we like Got to be like, weird and Huggy Huggy love you but like family members 100%.
Of course, I find that really fascinating.
It's just like, it's like, it's super distant cousin.
18:35
And why is why, when I met you for the first time?
Yeah.
What did I do when I met you deep?
Long.
Hug, deep long, huh?
Oh yeah, I do this for the Triple hug with the triple.
Could you you high Brigade, Brigadier breath.
The reason I do that is because, oh, that's the thing I didn't know there was.
18:57
I mean, I mean that's it.
So let's sit somewhere where it's like maybe someone who's older that's doesn't want to be hugged?
Or are you know your wife I'm going to give a quicker hot.
I'm not going to be grabbing so yeah but it's you know it's a respectful understanding the human being in front of you.
Doing your best respected but with you I knew I could just hug you and it's going to make you uncomfortable and it's gonna make you uncomfortable.
19:16
But but for me I don't know if I'm ever gonna see you again.
I don't know if I'm going to see you tomorrow or anyone tomorrow.
And so why not Embrace people with, you know, three to five ten Awkward hug and let people know that you really appreciate the moment, your present.
19:32
Yeah, that's what I try to do.
It's what I try to focus on, but, you know, and if we're all distant cousins, then why not treat each other that way the best way possible, you know, and I didn't, and I didn't mean to launch all the way there, because I'll go way back to Ego.
Yes, curious.
Otherwise we'll go that direction.
But yeah.
19:48
So I think because all this comparison is like, with are comparing myself to a family member, when I feel the same way.
And if all these people were on the same side as me because we're all family.
When I still feel like how because I've just tried to attack it from.
Logical perspective of like, how many different ways can I try and defuse this bomb?
And I think there's a lot of keys and you just unlock tiny Pizza fit and you can just cut.
20:04
Try, you know piece by piece and I don't think anyone ever conquers it.
But yeah, you know just hopefully I can over time can better and this I used to be very competitive as well as an athlete.
That's all I thought about was winning.
It's like I had to win to feel like I was worthy or I was good enough or I was talented enough or if I didn't win that.
20:21
I wasn't reaching my goal of winning the championship or the prize or whatever was and I took that into Business source for many years.
And I felt like I needed to compete with other people and then it's funny when I started this show, almost 10 years ago, I was like, it can't be about me, and needs to be about collaboration.
20:38
Yeah.
In order for this to really grow in scale and change lives, and impact, people can't just be the Lewis house show all day long one.
I'm not smart enough.
I don't have all the answers.
I'm not as talented as you shorter, guys, are way smarter than I was, that's why you're so before, brilliant, you know?
20:54
And I was like, I got to bring on the smart people and create a safe space.
I ever all the tall guys.
All right now, just not catch it, right?
Like every time I owed it to get taller as a result there.
But it's funny because when I started to shift that the eagle goes back into still comparing a rankings on these things, and I was like, okay, when I sort of shift that it's when I say, you know, the platform in the community started to expand because I made it about shining, the light on others.
21:17
Yeah.
You know, and doing my best to shine the light on others and when you do that, when you shine the light on an idea or a mentor that taught you something, usually good things come back.
So that's interesting.
So when did you start to shed this ego mentality?
But I started attacking when I was 1919 and help me now 3232.
21:35
Yeah and I think I have like 40 percent less ego that I'd.
So, how did and how do you have?
How do you diminish the ego as you continue to scale and exit.
These big companies and build your brand and get more and more attention and known?
21:51
How do you bring it back down to the community?
I think it's linking the two.
So it's trying to link these good things.
Are happening because I'm decreasing this thing that's smart.
And so that way, I can associate, I can have a positive reinforcing association with the success.
That actually, that would normally amplify the wrong character.
22:07
Yes.
What do you think?
Would happen if your ego was at the highest level right now?
I think a lot of people would I mean a lot more people would not like it.
Like I mean, I don't think the message would get across because to be fair, I think the message would stop it.
Would the spread would happen much slower or not at all, because the message would change because the message wouldn't be about the message would be about me.
22:28
And I think that I think that probably the reason that this has grown so much is because you've you've tried to quiet yourself in so that the message in the idea can spread to as many people as possible and you put the message on the pedestal rather than Lewis on the fiscal course.
And I think your audience realizes.
Yeah, that's interesting.
22:43
So what do you think you were making 50k the first couple of years out of college you save 50k within two years?
Which is amazing.
So, you were discipline.
What was the habit for the switch from one year to the next that started to bring?
NG in more abundance financially, not in the incremental 20%, but it was like, boom, this was 5 x 10 x.
23:03
What was that habit?
Or mindset shift for you?
That started to develop more income.
So there's like the the science and the art kind of both sides.
So like the science side is just the leverage.
So, the amount of money you make is proportional, the amount of Leverage you employ in your life.
And so, you know, for types of Leverage does not mind the system all raw pecans, but I'll just say that.
23:22
So you've got labor, I call collect I use for C's because these are for me to remember.
He says Labour is a collaboration, so Funny that you said that earlier, but it's just getting other people to basically use their time right for your.
Cause the second level of Leverage is other people's.
Money is getting people to invest in your thing and then the next two are so these two are permissionless.
23:40
The first ones like you need to.
So it gets most permission to work for you.
And you get someone's permission to get you.
Give you the money.
The other two are permissionless so you can do them on.
Your own.
One is Media, which is what you have here, because the cost of making one video and having one person, see it versus a million.
People see is the same cost.
Yeah, right.
And then the other is code, right?
23:56
So I say content.
In code.
So there's one for C, so collaboration, Capital content code and both of them.
Those are not binaries.
It's not.
Am I using other people?
Am I not using other people?
It's to what extent am I using other people?
Am, I do I use other people's money?
Yes, or no.
No, it's how much of other people's money am I using?
And so each of these are continuum's not binaries.
24:13
So like somebody could just use other people's money and be a billionaire because of the extent that use it.
But those are the types of levers that exist.
And so as my income went up, it was by proportion of the amount of Leverage.
I was Employee.
Really how are you would have these four, were you leveraging the most?
So in the beginning, I had Leverage because I was unemployed, right?
24:29
I was using my own time.
The next thing that I started doing was I became self-employed right?
So I had a little online training business that I started in between my quitting, my job and and starting the gym.
And so when I started the gym I started getting labor.
Was the father people.
Yeah.
Not a lot of it.
But I got some direct and so that gave me that first.
24:45
Next here, I went from making time interns.
Yeah, 50 went from five thousand dollars a month to I think about thirty thousand dollars a month.
So that was the that was the big job but it's just, I had a team, you know, I mean a small team but a team right now that's overall in.
I know that's not your take know the exact sales.
You might have been losing money or whatever we make.
25:02
We I made I made.
I was probably making 20,000 a month at that point for yourself.
Yes.
After expensive team and everything, yeah, that was the.
And then what about feel like going from five to twenty two?
That make you feel something different?
Was there a shift inside of you when you took that action because for me, what I started this it was all about vanquishing my father.
25:20
So it was all about Middle Eastern, father, only child.
So like I was raised by a single dad, it's just me and him.
That was it for the vast majority of it.
And so he's Middle Eastern came here.
The thousand dollars became a doctor.
He was a doctor.
Came here learned English from watching television, you know, I mean has the American success story.
25:36
Absolutely, that's amazing.
And so I was born here, though.
Speaking other language to friends was my first actually there's a whole story around it but anyways, but yeah, fragile here, yeah.
How many languages you speak?
That's the best one.
I just leave it at that but all of it was about making him proud.
25:52
Right.
That's what you did.
You set out to do that, was trying to do.
And then I think that That throughout my like adolescents I realized that it was something that was always going to be withheld from me.
So it didn't matter what it was.
The goal post would always move so that we never be proud enough, right?
And it was just, it was because he wanted the most out of me.
26:09
And so, like, if I got, let's say, you know, a 99 on a test.
It wasn't, congratulations.
Is what you get wrong, but that was always what it was.
That's okay.
Like I'm, yeah, local.
I'm very happy with my life and I realized that.
And so this desire to gain approval turn into a very deep anger.
And so, Ford's the world him yourself, Other people mostly him mostly him and most liked him and myself, probably split roughly 50/50, you know?
26:36
And and so it was like Mike earlier, I'll say quote Success was purely fueled by rage, like it wasn't.
It wasn't like it was rage, you know what I mean?
And I'm in the same boat.
Yeah.
And it was like and I but there was probably some element of me that's like almost enjoyed the suffering because it like, I just would get in the space.
26:55
When you ask like, how did I feel?
Yes I Getting the extra 20,000 a month.
First, my goal was to make as much as my dad and then it was to make more than my dad, and then it was to make more than my dad ever made us whole life.
Oh wow.
And so once I had done that, the I wanted the success to be unquestionable like I couldn't there couldn't be a, but there couldn't be an asterisk.
27:17
It had to be so undeniable.
That been vanquishing was the word, right?
And so for a five-year period, after I quit my job, my dad did not support.
He didn't support me.
Quitting my job.
Even though they were all making money and building a business and because he didn't, he's like, your what are you?
27:32
A gym owner?
Like, he's like, you went to Vanderbilt, you were on a management consulting, craft youth, like, you got, you know, you got above Harvard's, Miss Gore for your.
You could have had him a credible, career course, right?
Right gym owner doesn't sell well cocktail parties, right?
What do you say?
You know, he's, he's figure himself out.
Yeah, let's do this.
Little gem as a side.
27:48
That will step out, right?
And so, I mean, I made plenty of mistakes too, when I had the gym.
So it wasn't like all, you know, sunshine and rainbows for me.
Like, I had a lot of mess ups that I did.
I got in bad.
So I mean like all the things you could possibly do and over that five-year period of me, scaling to six locations, with my, with my facilities at the end of that whole thing I ended up losing, oh, really yeah lost everything.
28:09
Six locations lost the whole business.
Well, I sold it.
I sold five of them.
I shot one of them down, so I wanted to start doing the stimulus thing which would be like flying around doing turn around because I started that's when I met Lila.
You find a gym.
That's kind of like not succeeding.
It turn it around Wyatt.
Yeah, when you do a makeover, hold the exactly Bar Rescue sing Like same exact kind of TV, show it.
28:31
Believe me, if any whatever the many regrets I have, right.
That would have been an awesome what we did 32 turnarounds.
Wow, it was almost two years.
Yeah.
And so we started doing that.
Anyways, I lost everything because I took all the sale money, and I put it into my last location and then the partner that I had, their siphon the money out because I was like, yeah, like, well, I'll put all the money from the sale of these gyms into this thing.
28:51
Like, it doesn't matter.
It was my mistake is on me, even then it was, you know, we'll see, you know, we'll see how like this isn't real.
Like And then once I started once Jim what's really started taking off?
It wasn't until I think we did like 17 million and ibadah like profit.
Take home in one year and one year that my dad I was 27, that's crazy.
29:11
My my dad my dad called me.
He's like are you sitting down?
I remember like at this point like we were like not talking too much maybe a few months I'd be like a five minute phone call and so I was like sure.
Yeah I got time what's up?
He's like you're gonna want to hear this and I was like okay what he's like Sorry.
29:28
And it was my first time we'd ever apologize to me in my life and what's interesting to me though is that it didn't feel like anything.
I didn't care, why not?
Because I had stopped caring about what he thought about me a long time ago and it was like when I quit my job was the day that I like I accepted dying to my father because because very much to me at that point was I was I was really, really sad at that point in my life when I had the job because I had really done everything, if he'd wanted me to finish Vanderbilt in three years.
29:51
As president fraternity, I had one writing Awards.
I don't like a bunch of, like, I'd done everything, you know?
I was in I was vice president powerlifting theme like yeah I recall of all the stuff I did it in three years right?
Holding job.
30:07
That was like good job had all the credibility and it just I knew it wasn't enough and I knew that.
And so I knew that the choice for me was that I either had to die to him, or I had to die to myself.
Wow.
And that was ultimately, like the choice that I put in front of myself and that was whenever I was like, maybe I should just get I was like, died hammered audio and so that was what gave me?
30:28
Confidence to break that.
And then I physically moved because I couldn't be in the same area.
Wow.
So I actually what 23 at this point.
And so I called my dad when I was like in Ohio and I'm from Baltimore some like how they Spawn from for you?
Yes, I called him when I was there and I was like, hey, by the way I'm doing the gym then it was like okay like won't you come over?
30:48
We'll talk about because he knew because he knew that it like if you came over with enough battering I would be like fine and now this is smart thing.
I'll take the gene you know, apply to You know, booth and Harvard whatever and I'll get the I'll do that whole thing and that because I was a cycle, I just kept doing that and I was just like, no, I'm not going to do it.
31:03
So I was like well I can't let me know.
Hi, oh, he's like, what do you mean?
And then the tone totally shifted and I was like, you always do these crazy things and you're always like, he's like you've never balanced.
It's always extreme with you.
There's no middle path, follow.
And so anyways I you know, I did that five years, Jim's, lost it all anyways and then it started demoing and then that's one.
31:21
And then that really took off, sure.
And then, but when he called me and he apologized, and this is where I like, you know, I'm ashamed of myself.
But like, I could have just let it lie and been, like, thanks.
Appreciate it.
You know what pool instead?
Instead I said I was like, you know, when people get up on stage and they're like, hey, you know, they get Awards know like hey Mom and Dad.
31:40
I just want to say thanks so much for always believing me.
I was like, I won't say that.
Oh my gosh I was like because you never did.
I was like the only time you accepted me.
I was like, is once every other person on this planet had accepted it to all my gosh man.
And that's so I said that tense on the phone.
He said that, what do you say to that?
31:56
He said well, we'll see how long.
Last.
Oh my gosh.
So that was still kind of a competition with.
Yeah and I and to be fair when he apologized, he said, you know, I'm sorry, he said but in my defense, if it had been in my time I would have been.
Right?
And so yeah but all that's a like I should have just said like appreciate the apology, you know?
32:13
Thank you because you know Tony Robbins said something that I thought was really impactful was like for the vast majority of my life.
It's been like how my father shaped me or whatever but rather than thinking like what what can I use from this Dynamic?
Like what gift What have ya like fuzz mother?
32:29
Yeah.
Kind of like eating ham or whatever.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Like what do I like?
What do I you know, they're blaming for the good.
Right and so like I have so many things to blame for good from that and I'm very very happy with my life that is why twenty thousand dollars a month, didn't feel significant to me because the goal that I had my expectations weren't to make money.
32:45
My expectation was that I had to make more than he'd ever made.
And so I had a very big vacuum to drive towards which I think in a lot of ways was a gift because like I blew past 100,000 and 500,000 million a month, like I blew past those things.
Because like it was never about having enough money.
For me, it was about feeding this monster, but once I got there, I realized that what I had done was set up a game to win by my father's rule.
33:07
So and so then I and you could never win, right?
And to be fair, what I want to win a game that I wasn't for me, it was making you suffer.
Sure you're playing the wrong game, playing his game, it's our did what I wanted his game, not my right.
And so that was kind of what I think making that realization was, it was kind of a slow shift that happened from there.
33:26
So when you won the financial game, A more the game of like I've made more than you in a month or year than you made your whole lifetime.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
33:42
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out.
34:03
On it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast so that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
How do they make you feel?
And when did you realize you need to start playing a different game and what would that game become?
Okay, there's three questions.
There was personal, how do they make you feel the moment you cross the finish line of the game of making so much more than he'd ever made in a short amount of time relief because we actually got a relationship.
34:28
Not like you know I wouldn't say we're have like sunshine and right.
But but like we have a functioning relationship.
I would say it's role-based.
Like I'm a fucking, you know, yes.
But what happened was we are both very like, strong personalities and it wasn't Till I think that he accepted me as often our relationship that we were able to kind of like move forward again because before that might because my dad's he's a doctor.
34:50
So he's always had, you know, like decent money.
And I wanted to be beholden to no one in or excluding, including him.
Like I didn't want his money and right, don't want anything, you know?
And so I think I had to establish my own.
I'd like really plant my own flag to be seen as a man in his eyes.
35:06
And so, I think once that happened, I think I thought there was some level of like there's no conflict here anymore.
Like this is undeniable.
Yeah, this is beyond reproach.
Yes.
I've attractive wife, who's really nice and awesome.
I have a business face shape and if you think about it, like, the way that, I mean, I'm just being really wrong with you.
35:24
I blame my father for the many things that that I have become in a lot of ways.
Right?
Because everything, that was not perfect, was criticized, right?
And so like, I've had a six-pack since I was 15.
Wow.
And it was because he used to always criticize everyone who is overweight and being that they're undisciplined and they don't, they don't Right.
35:41
And then I've, you know, like and then it was like, about having pretty good.
Nice everything, perfect women.
Right?
That's not just pretty, but like, everything has to be perfect, right?
And then, and then, making lots and lots of money.
It's like all of these elements.
I had to max out to again, win it that game, and but my whole life was designed to be bulletproof, was that?
36:00
So that I just wouldn't be criticized.
And so that was because that was what.
I just I knew that if I could criticize myself harder than anyone, could then if they did say anything, it was Never as mean, as what I would say to me.
What's the meanest thing?
You say to yourself?
Like, it's all around, just not being good enough right now.
36:17
Women do not know, but I was little.
Yeah, 100%.
And it was, it was about being to be fair, though.
The actual thing, which is he being weak and Suzhou about strike, mentally, emotionally, physically weak are financially, we're everything just week.
That's how you tell us.
Yes, you felt powerless for your mustard, 20, teens and 20s for sure.
36:34
Huh.
And so everything that I did was to counteract, right?
Like, what can I do?
Big and strong as I can get.
Yeah.
But to make as much money as possible, have all the women I did.
Yeah.
I never said that was.
And so I pushed against that to try and to quell that, you know, that that neat or that desire that feel get it satiate that need when you had all those things.
36:55
Yes and no.
Yes because when I got there it forced me to change my perspective.
Perspective is what changed the way I felt basically realizing that those things were never going to solve anything is what allowed me to.
But in less Browns, I think says this recess, like everyone knows that money doesn't money, Doesn't make happening.
37:11
But everyone's like I'll see for myself here.
And so I think it was one of those like I had to cross all the like and I'd say this not as a slight anyone else.
But like I did check off the easy ones from the list, which is like for getting in shape, getting The Good Wife getting the money, the business, all that stuff like those are circumstantial, that means I can push with enough effort.
37:28
I can change my conditions, I can change my surroundings in my environment.
If I can change those things, will they make me feel better.
And so, I think once I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that that couldn't that didn't work, right?
Maybe they helped me to maybe they helped in some way.
Is, but not the internal ways.
So what did you have to shift your perspective, or what was that shift, where you could still have it all and then have it all internally as well?
37:49
I think that the whole ego death concept that we were talking about.
The very beginning, I try not to talk about this too much, because I think it's a lot of people find take offense to it, and I don't mean it that way.
I showed this is just what worked for me and not as a criticism of anyone else's beliefs.
For me, the idea that there was no such thing as Legacy that when I died eventually, everything that I had would become Um, dust and that anything expanded over a long enough time Horizon disappears, right?
38:14
Which if you are like Christian, for example, it's the whole book of Ecclesiastes and I think the realization of that allowed me to quiet my ego a lot.
So that I could be more present in the idea that like this moment will only be here in my mind.
And anything that I do here will not last and so it shifted, how I worked shifted, how I saw relationships and a lot of my thinking is around, like, my 85 year old self.
38:39
I feel like the Number One, Mentor is like my fictitious 85 year old self because it's the only person that I really believe.
Has my best interest at heart.
It is no ulterior motive.
And so there's this, this tweet that I had that went pretty viral but it was like listening to a billionaire or a millionaire.
I'll just use that like when I was in my 20s, I wanted to be a millionaire and when I was a millionaire I wanted to be in my 20s.
39:01
Mmm.
And so the idea that my future self would trade all the money.
He had to be poor in 20 again.
Made me really realize how I saw living life in the moment.
If I literally in the future will value my present moment more than the achievement of the thing that I'm I'm seeking right now in the present, then something's something's off because even my future self knows that because right now, I would pay all the money.
39:26
I have to get 10 years without even thinking about it.
And so, then all of what I'm going to achieve in the next 10 years.
I would happily give up to be right where I am right now.
And so I think thinking about that really shifted a lot for me because it helped me quiet.
I'm not saying eliminate, but quiet, some of the That are more ego driven because the ego is wants to like separate and isolate from others and prove that it's better and if I know that it will all be dust, there is no better because we're all going to be destined.
39:52
So in that same way if like if we're all going to be dust and we're all siblings like to very strong frames for me, at least it helped me quite that aspect.
And I think in that way, I was able, I think ask my people but like I think I was able to show up at her as a leader, there's no nipple shot better as a husband show up better, like to make content things like that.
40:08
I don't think I could have made the stuff.
I make now five years ago because I still think it would have been more.
It would have been to proving something.
Yes, do a perfect.
Number is proving proving, proving someone, proving a fictitious fo wrong.
Right?
Right, right.
40:23
They're all talking about, right?
No one cares about you.
Exactly.
And so that was really, it was like, I had to shift from like, no one cares about you too.
I really want to have a shirt that says no lives matter but I feel like it might be a way to yeah.
No, no, no one cares about you, but I feel, but I think there's like a lot of like meet today.
40:40
Where it's like if we can.
Because in that way we are all equal and so as I think it's almost the most egalitarian perspective, is that like in the end we will all be dust.
And so I think in that way, that's like we have these exchanges that we have and in some ways it makes it more beautiful.
Why do you think so many people care about power and respect so much usually was withheld from them with it.
41:00
I think the things that we are that were withheld from us or the things that usually we see most mmm I think how many how many really successful guys have daddy issues you don't mean?
So many and so it's like, okay, well I didn't get his respect.
So I'm going to have to compensate with my circumstances, my environment, so that everyone respects, and some people do that through fear.
41:20
Some people do that for violence and be able to that through success.
It really just depends what vehicle you choose, but like, I feel like the Deep need is the same.
Yeah, there's something like a camera with a statistic, but a number of u.s. presidents, a big number of them, like, grew up without a father or their father died, early in their life and there's, I can remember the status like 30 or 40 percent or something.
41:40
Like the US presidents lost their father.
I didn't have a father or something like that early on and it's like, well, you know, now they're going to go prove something or go to be something.
Yeah, out.
What about the habits that you learned of the wealthy?
People went through started to really earn it, and scale, your wealth, or you studying wealth, or were you just fixated?
42:01
I like, how do I get one more customer and increase, my prices make better product.
What did you learn about the habits of the rich?
I haven't learned much about the habits of the rich at all.
To be very candid with you.
I think that maybe There are some beliefs that because, like my dad was a doctor.
I must say he was like, you know, ultra-wealthy but like we lived in upper-middle-class, you know, lifestyle, but in terms of like wealth is, I think you and I would probably understand it.
42:19
I didn't know anything about that, and I don't think I've ever really studied it very much.
I would say that my heroes.
Now, like, I started studying wealth after I became wealthy, mmm, so like, what did you learn about it afterwards?
And what a wealthy people do that.
You think or people don't do?
They pick higher leverage opportunities in a sentence.
So like Port Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
42:36
Like Poor Dad says, get a job or dad says get a higher paying Like rich said, says like and the thing is, there's so many in a beliefs that seem commonplace like, well, of course you don't really well, of course, you know, and you know, you buy some real estate.
And you know, I do appreciate over time before she investments in stocks like yeah of course.
42:52
But like portends.
Just don't say that.
And so you have to like learn that I think and I didn't.
So I'm grateful in that I didn't have to learn that because I heard that just was, of course.
Yeah.
What's you have some money?
Like, of course, you don't spend your whole income, of course, you don't.
And so there's a lot of, of course you don'ts that I think I inherited just by being in like Like a saving father but there's also some upper middle class people who don't save anything so like right.
43:14
But I think my dad did a lot of.
I think he helped a lot with like, money hygiene.
They got.
I've had a lot of really good money.
Hygiene from my dad, the big, the big breakthrough that I had for me, was when I stop focusing on, and this is going to sound backwards.
But when I started my gyms, I was all about building the business, right?
And when I built the biggest companies that I've had and now recently, sold, and now we have our portfolio.
43:34
It was about how do we make the most money?
And I know that sounds completely backwards, but the only way that you can make the most money Is to provide an exceptional valued service and charged a ton of money for it.
And because I optimized around making money, I started going through for low Capital expense businesses, because I had lost everything after that five-year stint and so I was like, never again.
43:55
Am I going to reinvest every dollar from the business back into the business?
Because I've lost it before, when I started the, the next business in every business, I've had thereafter, like we take dividends every month and we do that, because you don't wait till there's an accident, 10 years later.
I mean, put on my money and my Love to do both.
44:10
Yeah.
Why not both sure.
Right.
And so that was take a dip, it in, and get a bigger finger.
Yeah, but not just put money in and wait and get no money back. 100% in the thing is, is in this was a fallacy.
I had because people always talk about, like, reinvesting in their business, but I realized that just meant that they were making profit, and, and so the vast majority of businesses.
44:28
Even the software world is somewhat shifting in this, but they want to see profit.
And then even better is if you have net free cash flow, which is just a fancy word for the amount of money that you can take out every month after making Necessary investments in the business.
And so I wanted to have business That pumped cash flow because I lost it all before.
44:43
And so I think there's a lot of like, every, every one of my business Seasons, I would say, I've had three business Seasons.
I had my gym ownership period.
I had my turn around and early Jim wanted a period and then I had prestigious Labs the licensing business and Alan that was like my last season where you exited the final exam.
45:01
Yeah.
And then I've say, like now we're in our this, their third season, I guess.
So brick and mortar, Jim's licensing, supplements and software.
And then you know, third season is what we have now.
And each of those has a huge huge magnitude of Leverage that was added to it.
45:17
Mmm.
And so you know this like Jim Elantra started on accident in that I was like this might be a way that I could make money because people are like hey you're doing this pretty well for your own jobs.
Can you help me?
Turn back around - yeah?
You're like, can you teach me what you've done?
Is it like, alright, let me go in here and I'll just help them double the revenue and yesterday's.
45:33
I'm good at this.
I'll go people.
Pay me more for that.
The low payment of a 20-pound, right?
And so that was a big that was when I went from B to B to C to b 2.
Yes.
And then for there to be honest, it was just going up another, another order of magnitude.
Because now instead of just building the one business now we're building lots of businesses at the same time and so that's kind of like why acquisition.com I think has a much higher you know has bigger feet for like Roger, right?
45:59
And so what do you look for when you're you're acquiring a business or investing in a business that has cash flow and what businesses have the best cash flow.
So this will be relevant for everybody in the audience and also hit.
So what we were talking about with the Well, thing, like wealthy people, choose higher, leverage opportunities, and we went over.
What leverage was earlier the best businesses, especially an inflationary period are businesses that have low Capital expenses, okay?
46:20
And that's because any other examples.
Yeah.
So I'll give you opposite examples to make and then I'll drive it.
So the something that does have high Capital expense, which is what you would not want to get into would be like stuff that has lots of inventory.
So there's lots of supply chain, lots of manufacturing, heavy equipment things where you have to constantly buy more stuff in order to increase capacity, right.
46:39
A low Capital expense Things like Services, right Services, you know, digital businesses software it is mixed because sometimes the development team can be considered as an expense.
It really depends on how you build the dev team, but the idea is that if you can produce 10 times more units without phenomenally changing the cost basis, then you will have a business that has lower Capital.
47:02
Yes.
And so that's what you like.
And most of those types of businesses, produce more cash flow, have more pricing power, and so, I mean, that's what Warren Buffett, invested rights hike.
That you know, like insurance.
Geico right?
There's no cap like it's risk or literally assessing risk are it's math.
47:17
Like the business is math.
Thank you.
Really think it's just met is the entire business of insurance and what's crazy?
It just a side note, is that a great way of figuring out the highest leverage?
Businesses that exist is looking at the business have been here.
The longest insurance has been here since before World the world wars.
47:33
Thanks have been around forever, right?
JP Morgan was the 1800s, right?
The the in the biggest insurance companies, they're all, huh?
Plus years old, they're found in the 1800s and so when you have a business that's lasted that long to me, that's a great bread, crumb of like this thing has to print money because it means that they were able to still keep making money.
47:51
Through Wars, through famous Impressions, all of it, and they were still able to keep going.
And so, I think that when people are like, when you look at all the like, many of the biggest businesses that exist, they have phenomenal gross margins.
I do want to get to like, you know, business term here.
But like the gross margin is how much incremental cost.
48:07
It is to make a new an extra Widget, right?
And so like a pill, for example, cost a hundred million dollars to make the first pill and then every poll after that costs a penny, all right.
Sure.
And so the gross margin of the pill is very high because if they sell each pill for ten dollars, the cost of a penny that was a great margins.
48:23
And most people who are small business owners or people were trying to get into small business price like small business owners, they say, Well it cost me a dollar.
I'll sell it for three or I'll sell it for two, but if you're already starting on like a 50% gross margin, it's very very hard to make money because think about like that's at 100 yard at half and then you have the rest.
48:40
Everyone else, you have to pay off that extra Fitness.
Very hard to do and so like I'll give a couple rules of thumb if anyone wants.
But like if you're, if you're building a service-based business for us, by all means, I have to get gross margins about 80%, which means, five times the cost of goods of the cost.
Me $100 a month, the minimum all charts 500, right?
48:57
And so that also gets you to think about business differently, which is not necessarily even how much can I charge, but how can I provide value and make it cost as little to me?
How can I be as efficient as possible?
And if you think about what technology does over time, its technology takes something that's valuable and makes the cost of delivering it less.
49:13
And so that's what happens is.
A lot of people are able to have access to things that were once only for the wealthy but now become for the common man because the cost basis decreases as a result of technology.
And so technology is we see it you know like we can create technology but you can also have technological breakthroughs just through process in your own business.
49:31
It's like and that's where niching down and being very specific about the Avatar becomes important especially when you're starting because then you can product has the service because if you're doing everything custom which most We're starting out, do it becomes really difficult because efficient, and it's really difficult to go fishing a very little margin, right?
We have to charge huge fees which most people are too afraid to do.
49:48
And so the flip side is, if I do the same thing over and over and over again, I will get better and more efficient at it and I'll know how to do it faster and quicker and cheaper.
And I specifically choose this type of customer so that I can have more margin because there are millions of even this one specific type of Avatar.
50:04
And then from there, I can take the gross margin, the extra cash that I have and I can hire the best people I can invest in marketing.
Eating.
But when you have such little marginal work off of, it's very difficult to make money.
Yeah, so hard to grow.
That's interesting.
What do you think?
It's going to be harder or easier to become wealthy and start businesses over the next few years?
50:21
With everything that's happened in the last couple of years and we're this whole great.
You know, 2030 agenda is coming and all these different things are happening, the war and all the, you know, might be another pandemic.
Whatever might be do you think is gonna be easier or harder uremic to make money?
I think technology in general makes things easier for most people.
50:38
I mean, because at the end of the day it's just It's increased access from more people.
Yeah.
And so I think to reach more people at any moment.
Yeah.
If I were just to use history as a guide, this is only gotten easier to get into more competitive and easier to get into.
And so I think that what happens is just the arena gets bigger, so you got more Gladiators so it's more competitive but more people can walk it.
50:59
And so I think but it but for the world in general, the more people you have fighting to make amazing products and services, the better it is for society.
Yeah, but Downstream effect of that, is that in a capital, Capitalist system.
It is a winner-take-all foremost for many, not all, but for many businesses and just by the nature of at that does create social disarray, and it's just, but the thing is, is like it's still the best system that we have.
51:21
We don't have a perfect system because the other systems remove incentive and he might have driven by incentive.
Yeah even the survivorship bias like every MLM in the world exists off, the fact that there's that one guy who makes profit of thousand dollars a month selling shake mix and the other five million shake mix producers are like Someday.
I'm gonna get there.
51:37
Yeah, it's just survivorship bias right?
But that's why the whole capital is.
Gene works.
So I think they're, like figuring out some sort of a, you know, creative way.
Like my I put this in mind on my YouTube channel but like the idea of having 100% death tax.
I thought was like, take down like the income taxes and all this stuff.
51:53
But like the thing that creates the conglomerate at the top, is that if let's say, let's say I have 100 billion dollars, right?
That's interesting.
And if I'm under billion, I'm probably pretty good at managing it because that's why I have 100 bucks.
So let's say it again. 15 sheets of holding it, you're using it.
Yeah, let's say, I mean 15%, oh my God.
52:10
That's so like fifteen billion dollars right on my assets.
It is so hard for anyone to to make that up in a lifetime.
With just the in like that.
Might be my kid who gains 15 in the next year against want.
Like and so it, the compounding effect of the wealth is a cross-generational is where I think it gets crazy, but if there were 100 percent death tax because obviously this is aligned with my belief that all of it disappears.
52:35
Anyways, so this is obviously Alex ends of the world but it's just Basically dramatically lower the income income taxes.
I think income taxes should be like as close to zero as possible.
And then make the capital gains taxes are because that's only gonna really affect the Well, if you really want to think about it, right?
Because people who if you make with your hands, awesome?
52:52
Right.
If you make on your assets, that's this with.
That has no has infinite leverage with with time.
So if you trade the most expensive thing for your money, then I feel like you should get tax class and if you trade no time for a minute, sure.
This is like a weird thought experiment.
You think would happen if it was 100 death tax.
I think that billionaires would become far more giving and as they approach the end, they know they can't keep It and I also think it would change the way the game is played.
53:12
Because if you know because this is the analogy that I like, I haven't heard it anywhere else.
I think it's mine.
But if you were to imagine wife as a poker game, right?
We everybody grows out, they've been 18 years old, they can go to the casino, they get a chip or 21, whatever age you can be and that you get it, you get a chip and then you sit down at the table and you're dealt cards, right?
53:28
There's all the other players around the table and depending on the cards are dealt and the skill.
You have used to begin to amass chips, right?
And the difference between this fictitious, you know, casino and the casino of life is that The real world, you can amass chips, you cash out, you have a big wad of money, you walk out the door but in the casino of wife and the Grim Reaper Taps you and says you it's tells you it's time, you have to get up from the table but your chips down the table and they push him to the middle to be distributed by everybody else and continue to get paid for.
53:55
And that's when you realize that it was a fake game with rules that ever mattered to begin with.
And so I bought this piece of land in Austin, that was huge.
It was like a big really, really nice lat.
And I remember thinking to myself like this, I got me some land right on.
Oh yeah, I have that tree.
That thing around my.
54:11
Alright and then I thought to myself was like, well, the guy before me thought the same thing in the guy before him thought the same thing, and the guy before him thought the same thing, and I was like, and we've literally still been looking at the exact same piece of dirt, and it's just been cycled.
Even if it was father to son, even if it was family to whatever, like, like death, taxes, every 100 percent.
54:31
Like even if the government doesn't death taxes, everybody 100%.
And then time taxes your money to Infinity because like we were, like, I want to build a legacy.
It's like that's even just with like within Americana, you know, within the times of America but like you go a thousand years and there's never the same superpower of our thousand year period.
54:48
And so we're like how many leave a legacy is like?
But that would be like you know, let's say an ancient Greeks a going to leave a legacy for my kids, when like they might change their currency by, you know, XYZ or and there's so many things and I've had real experience with this because my great-great-grandfather was a ruler.
55:04
And here, on this is where we're from, we got kicked out because we were loyal to the shop back in the day.
Which is why my dad came to us.
And so despite that my great-grand great-grandfather had like four hundred wives rule or very, very well really, very, very well for different time.
55:20
Different specific culture, very, very wise ruler, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All the money, all the women, all the everything, literally a ruler, right?
And doesn't matter.
And here I am, I'm not even that many generations separated from it, right?
Even that you don't have all that wealth.
You don't have that land.
Yeah, right.
And so like the idea that we're going to somehow like because the desire for legacy is that Our to cheat death.
55:41
Think that's what it's done.
Like we don't want to die, we want to last forever.
So we want to make something that is impermanent.
And so we fool ourselves into thinking that the accolades and the material success in the books.
You write whatever are going to last forever and they're probably right.
And so like, I mean, the sun's going to disappear at some point, right?
55:57
It's all right.
Like if we don't do anything before then like at the very least that's going to happen.
And so if that is the inevitable outcome, I think it shifts the way people think.
And I think that's when you start changing.
I mean, Tony Robbins talks about like global global.
If systems and that's why would someone like, adopt new religious belief, like everything changes because the reasons they do and the way they believe the world Works changes.
56:17
And so I think that if they did do 100% death tax, it would be a really interesting way to see the downstream effects of how change, the way the players played the game.
What do you think would happen?
If all the billionaire started Distributing their wealth sooner?
I think we'll all, would they be as hungry to be and driven to push and build?
56:33
And innovate?
Say yes to generate the wealth, if they knew I got to give this away anyways.
Quickly, I think they would I think it's It's I think it's I think I'm going to say something that might sound bad, but I think Winters went because of who they are.
Hmm.
And so I think it's like sales guys, like you can have an incentive or a complan, they just want to win, but they are sales people.
56:51
And if I get on the phone I want to sell because of who I am, not because the compa cop is the ticket to get me to say yes to the deal but it will not change my activity.
I will do it because I love to sell, right?
And so I think billionaires get there because they love the game like you don't get to a billion without just because you obviously don't need it for you.
57:07
You stop needing it for you millions and millions ago, right?
So you do it just because you love the game.
What I do think of the reason that I like that solution is because Elon Musk said this, but private Enterprises 10 times as efficient, a capital allocation compared to the government, right?
So every dollar that private private Enterprise spends, it's 10 times more efficient and so it is like if we were to death tax, 100 percent.
57:28
So whatever you accumulate, while you're alive, it just goes back.
Like and the thing is, it's not that it would go back into the system through the government.
It would if you were lazy but most people knowing the government was going to take it the less efficient vehicle at the end of your life, you would then start.
Thinking about how can I allocate this money efficiently.
And so, what I think would happen is, you'd create far more Ingenuity and Innovation around social Enterprise before they die solving problems knowing that the wealth would eventually disappear.
57:51
Mmm.
So like it's more.
There's this backstop that no one wants to hit.
And so, I think what happened is, they were change their behavior before hitting the back.
So I don't think a lot of people just be dumping their building to the government.
I think just knowing that they had to would then distribute them to.
Yeah, that would be, you know, that's Alex's to sense of the world which is obviously different.
58:08
What's he just had a Big exit, right last year.
What was that for?
How much is?
It was 46 points, 46 million.
So when that enters your account, what did you expect?
What happened?
What did happen and what can you teach other people about what they should expect to happen when they have a big?
58:24
I say.
So I will say that I did not feel the money, I did feel the loss of cash flow because I had this you know, my measured myself off cash flow for since night, don't have any, right?
You got a big chunk of the no money coming in every month.
So I actually fell interesting, a probably still still Feel horror now than I did before the exit, that's interesting.
58:44
Because the cash flow is going down.
Now I know that acquisition.com is going to be, I think significantly bigger than sure.
And those companies were, but in the interim, I definitely did not feel any better after that.
I am happy that I did it because I do think I'm in the right, you know, vehicle doing what we're doing.
59:02
Now, making the books making that the YouTube channels that the Twitter's that in various social media is all of them.
But the cash flow is what I felt and because I take In dividends my whole life, the amount of money that we got out was pretty much about we already had anyways, right?
So it was not life changing in any way.
It didn't change how I lived at all, like not at all.
59:21
We didn't we didn't have any big like what are you going to buy?
I was like well I could you know, I'm happy already.
I could buy 100 labels before the sale.
You know what I mean?
Like that wasn't.
And I never bought them in.
And I never did it's like, you know, because I don't get a lot of out of that.
What else was different losing losing?
59:36
The team is hard because when you sell a company, All the you sell the people like, that's something that people come back shares.
Yeah.
But you sell, you sell the organism cell that the system, the people process, and the bridges and everything, but a percent.
And so that was that was hard because there's definitely times now that we're building acquisition.com.
59:55
We're like man I wish I had sound, sorry, I already taught this person, everything.
I'd like to have to do it again, so there is a.
But there's also some level of beauty to it because now that I'm doing acquisition not calm, I have a different appreciation for what I'm doing.
Because every other time that I've started something, it has been from a place of lack, it has been from a like, well this is what's going to not make me poor, you know what I mean?
1:00:18
Like, the gyms was all about that and then I lost it.
All said, the second time was all about that again.
Wow.
So this time I'm starting not like that.
And I know what it got like before we sold the company's last year.
I spent basically 12 months, not doing anything because I wasn't required in the business.
I could truly it ran and so, I had a lot like, it was very depressing.
1:00:36
Us exactly is very depressing for me.
What happens if we don't have Purpose.
I mean you find one.
Yeah you know I mean and so for me but you're depressed state even though you have I mean I'll show you a fine but you are emotionally mentally.
Like what am I doing?
Everyday exactly.
I'm not going to the gym for so long.
1:00:52
Right.
Can we go out to dinner?
Yeah.
Like what else?
You gonna get every meal?
I want I can travel.
Okay.
Now, what after three months of that, he's got to help some Mission.
Yeah, some purpose.
Right, even though you have the money your safety, you have everything.
Yeah.
Security.
But it wasn't fulfilling 100% it.
1:01:08
So that was that was 12 straight months.
And it was because we were going through a sales process.
So you can't start new initiatives because I'm in the middle of a sale and you don't want to like make any massive new hires.
And so you just basically have to just like maintain and the whole time you're wondering, I hope this deal goes through because if it doesn't then you just wasted a year just doing nothing and then you might have to do it again.
1:01:26
So it was this, it was, it was a super super, it was one of the most emotionally tiring years of my life because it's always like this is about to happen, it's not going to happen.
The deals on the table, the deal's off the table.
Like there's all of this drama that's happening constantly And I also one of the things that sucked that I didn't like was as soon as I had made the decision to sell or that I was going to entertain the idea of selling and this is a mistake.
1:01:48
I made everything became about satisfying fictitious Overlord of like what will they think about this move?
How they value this?
And I started things eBay, whatever acquirer, who whatever private Equity was going to buy the company, like, how are they going to see this?
1:02:04
Are they going to Value this or is this a waste?
And so what happened was, I started making the private Equity By Request Mmm, and that was a mistake.
And so I think that like at the end of the day and now that and what happened was, interestingly we started the sales process because my wife and I are Beatdown.
We were just very tired, you know, we've been in gyms for almost 10 years you know at that point not to say that that's not a good thing.
1:02:24
But like, whatever we want of course, you're ready, we are ready.
But in order for us to sell it and make it a cell business, we had to fix all the things that were wrong with you, right?
And so we took a year before the year, so it's 20 or 18 years.
Exactly.
So took two years basically, one year Like fix everything and then one year to sell it.
1:02:42
The thing is this looks like when you have a house that you, like, fix up before you get ready to sell it.
By the time we're about set your like I lost.
This is amazing.
I just fixed all these to all the problems I fixed now, got more cash flow with your fish and yeah, we got one.
And so it was again a very like mind trip experience where I'm like well maybe I should just hold as an asset that just produces cash flows.
1:03:02
Yeah.
Over Uncle Warren never sells anything.
Like selling is what makes you rich.
Keeping his will make you wealthy.
Like you know, I'm like I've got all these kind of things in the back of my mind.
But I think ultimately like, I think no matter what we had done, we would have been fine.
But I think for me right now, I think the likelihood that the choice, if I had to alternate realities, which I don't have to play in, I think that the choice will ultimately yield more impact for more people.
1:03:22
I would not have the intention to do acquisition.com, and the media stuff that we're doing right now.
I wouldn't be here right after I wouldn't be focused on their gyms.
Yeah, or the, yeah, exactly.
On those companies that were in that portfolio and acquisition.com would still be a side thing, but it probably wouldn't be the main thing.
Whereas now, it is 100% of my attention and the companies Are killing it.
1:03:41
I feel renewed.
Are killing it.
I feel renewed.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn-out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, the highlights that they have at Harvard are not the income, but the experience, and the network, and the relationships, and the character development Etc.
Now, if you're thinking yourself, man, it would be harder to sell.
L people, that way.
Because it would take longer to do it.
0:35
But if you do it that way and you only let in really good people, what do you think happens?
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
0:52
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
You've probably seen these make ten thousand dollar month in 30 days scam, businesses marketing, all over the Internet and in the same degree, you've probably seen Harvard market and say you might maybe graduate from Harvard and that's the only promise they make and you can pay us two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year.
1:12
And so what's the difference between this clearly scam business and this incredibly legit hundred plus year old business turns out, there's only four things.
And if you're a student and you're trying to decide between different Educators, you can use these four things to make a filter to make the right call in my And on the flip side, if you're an educator or an education business owner, you can reverse engineer, what legitimacy looks like.
1:32
So you can stop being a scam artist and actually be a legitimate educator and build a brand.
That's valuable that compound in time.
So that hopefully, 100 years later they're talking about your business rather than Harvard and I can speak about this with deep credibility because of three important things.
Number one, I graduated from Vanderbilt University magna cum laude in three years and I got the super high SAT score and my GMAT was above Harvard's Min score.
1:55
So I know that.
That world and I got a management consulting job right after that, so I know where those worlds.
Lead on the flip side, I've owned an internet marketing, direct response business and three.
I've made the transition from this world to that world and I know exactly what steps to take.
2:12
Because I had to figure this out for me because when I wanted to sell my company, people didn't want to buy it.
And then I was like, well, why are they think this is valuable in this, is it?
And that's what I'm about to share with you and I apply this strategy and building acquisition.com.
So I'm Walking this walk.
2:27
I'm not talking about it in theory, like think about each of the four Frameworks as it applies to acquisition, not combo portfolio, that only buys companies as you can imagine.
Because we have lots of leave a footprint across all different, social media channels that we get.
Lots of people who have influence or type businesses that apply to work with us, have us invest in their business.
2:44
And oftentimes those influencers are disappointed when we don't want to invest in their businesses, which can kind of feel tough, because it's like calling someone's baby ugly.
But we do is we tell them the steps that they can take in order to become legitimate.
It.
And so, what I want to do is make this so that you know, the steps we would tell them.
So that if you're in this opportunity you could actually make yourself legit.
3:04
There are multiple levels of legitimacy for Education, because if you think about it on the Polar extremes on one side, you have Harvard, most people don't call Harvard a scam right, but they fundamentally sell education, right?
And on this side, you've got a guy who tells you how to start an ATM business and promises that you're going to make a hundred thousand dollars a day in five seconds.
3:25
Right?
So like This is one side of the Polar extreme in the societies.
The other.
They both sell education in on the scam index.
Why is this one maxed out?
And this 10, what we can do is, we can reverse engineer.
What Harvard does in order to say, well, if we apply the same Concepts and principles to a different or alternative skill, we can still give it the same level of legitimacy.
3:50
So ITT Tech that teaches people how to become a mechanic.
So why is that not a scam, right?
It teaches The niche skill, it takes.
Now here's one difference, it takes a couple of years, not six weeks in order to get the skill, but here are some of the elements that create legitimacy number one.
4:08
Harvard turns people down if every single person who applies to work with you, you immediately try and take their money and the only requirements to become a customer of yours is a credit card and a pulse ding, ding ding.
You might have red flag number one because by the way, legitimate business practice that I can give you is that most people Probably aren't qualified to become customers and if you define a qualified lead as somebody who has the highest likelihood of success with your program or service or education, then you should have screening metrics for who is not a good fit because it means that it's a very unlikely that somebody who is not.
4:42
If it succeeds with your program and means it's more likely that they'll be upset.
Leave you bad reviews.
Call you a scam?
All of that kind of stuff, which you can easily avoid number one by selling qualified, customers only and having filters you apply to your leads based.
In automatically filter people out if you have an SAT score or ACT score of whatever, whatever 500 is, or 20 on the AC, I don't know the scores, but whatever, whatever low score is.
5:05
Harvard's not going to look at, they're not going to read it, they're just going to push it right out and the same degree if someone doesn't have two nickels to rub together and they're in debt up to their eyeballs, probably night might not be a good person that you want to sell your thing to write, just as a baseline.
Number two, is that Harvard doesn't give income expectations.
5:25
They don't say become a heart.
Graduate make money tomorrow, right?
Of course not number one, there's the delay between when you start and when you actually even graduate and get the endorsement of their brand, which to be fair is really what Harvard cells is the brand endorsement that you get to put on yourself.
5:41
The second thing is that instead of showing testimonials of students on income, right?
Like I graduated Harvard and I got my first job at 185 thousand dollars at Goldman Sachs like you don't see that anywhere on their site.
What you will see is testimonials Around experience of the program, which is fine.
5:59
Those are what I would consider soft testimonies that can't be refuted, but what they will publish is data in this is fucking huge.
This is what allowed Jim launched to go from.
I would say a middle on this index to over here where private Equity Firm would be happy to buy them because they see it as a very legitimate business.
6:17
You need to pay attention.
When about to say, if you do not track your customer success metrics, meaning when someone buys, what percent of them, Succeed at 30 60, 90 12 months, 24 months, what are the averages for, whatever the thing that you educate them on?
6:34
Now, mind you, this is this naturally predisposed itself to be to be stuff where people are learning to make money.
But if you teach people how to use Adobe and you have a course on that awesome, if you teach people how to, you know, take pictures for homes, as real estate agents, awesome.
6:52
Right?
Those are what I would consider.
Indirect income-earning skills versus direct.
Income earning seals, which are usually businesses in a box of some sort.
If you track the data, then you don't add any sensationalism to what you were reporting.
Harvard publishes what the top, 20% with the average, with the median person gets and what industries, their graduates go into because that's data they're not setting false expectations.
7:20
And they're not saying this is, what you can expect.
In six weeks, they're saying for years ago, these people Started and today they graduated and this is what they got.
The important thing is that just like in fight like what makes Financial funds legit, as they say, past performance isn't a prediction of future performance.
7:38
And they say that very clearly, just like, you should, and the highlights that they have at Harvard are not the income, but the experience, and the network, and the relationships and the character development Etc.
Now, if you're thinking to yourself, man, it would be harder to sell people that way.
7:56
Because it would take longer to do it.
But if you do it that way and you only let in really good people, what do you think happens?
You start to develop a brand, you start develop a good reputation.
And so for example I was having the discussion with Jacob my neighbor because he was saying he was considering starting a sales quote, whether he does that or not at some point in the future is irrelevant.
8:18
But I said, if you were going to start one, then you want to be legit about it because you see everybody and their mother has a sales school right now.
Because They start selling High ticket.
They immediately make 20 grand a month and they start a course on how to make 20 grand a month, has a high ticket closer, right?
So is everybody.
Now, if you want to be legit about it, what you would do is you do you give tons of content away for free?
8:40
This is pillar number three, pillar number.
One, is that you sell better customers and you have filters.
Pillar number two, is that you set.
Proper expectations, only Based on data in the testimonials provider about experience rather than income or outcome.
The Third Is that you can monetize the education itself, you can sell education, but I think the smart move.
9:01
And if you've consumed any of my stuff is that you give away the secrets, you sell the implementation.
And so, the smart move is take all the content.
You would normally sell as your course, and give it all away for free.
Where do you think some of the best smartest materials, get pumped out from Harvard Business Review, people, cite their stuff, they make content to Market that they are thought leaders in the space.
9:24
The Implementation.
They sell is that we will Hands-On teach you how to do it.
And so if I were selling the ability to sell, then I would give away the course as content through all the different platforms.
I possibly could and the implementation would be.
9:41
Let me listen to your sales calls, give you feedback in real-time, and then monitor your performance over that period.
So that you become a salesperson pillar number for Harvard, does it graduate everyone.
Some people fail.
And they get great.
9:57
And the reason for that is because Harvard wants to maintain their brand because what they say, is sure, Johnny graduated from Harvard with a 16 GPA and so you can expect to the employer that he's a 16 person.
Now he was smart enough to get in.
10:12
But through the four years we saw that he didn't have some of these other character traits that led to success for GPA and this is the score.
And so I was telling Jacob if you want to be smart about it, number one, you would Just show the data number two, you would probably not accept, 90% of people who want to be salespeople because you could immediately tell the interview just like Harvard.
10:33
Does that you're probably not going to be a good salesperson.
And so, rather than accept, everyone and say we're going to make everyone Harvard smart, which you can't.
They got smart and realized it's much easier to pick smart people and then do a standard education than it is to take dumb people and try and make them smart.
10:49
So it's easier to find people who have your proclivity for sales who naturally have the characteristics of Good salespeople and then just get them this much better and then endorse them.
But before you have the endorsement you still rank order them on who you think has succeeded the best and have the possibility that someone pays and does not get your endorsement, because that is how you long term maintain the brand.
11:14
And so, let's play This Out.
Imagine two companies, you've got company one, who sells everybody Under the Sun who has a credit card in response to an ad which is basically everybody in that space right now, all right?
And they just say You have a credit card.
I've got an opportunity and they sell them right most of them don't succeed.
They don't publish their stats because they'd be abysmal because many of those people don't even login.
11:34
Which sucks how much is that?
Is the fault of the business 100%, because what other alternative do you have?
If you say it's all their fault, then you take no responsibility and you don't get better.
So what could we have done to get 100?
Like, answered that question, how can we get 100 percent of people who graduate from my thing to be the best salespeople?
11:53
First thing is, you pick people are naturally good at sales.
Second thing is we automatically cut out the people who are not third.
We set expectations that are appropriate only Based on data and the remainder of our testimonials and stories are based on the experiences of people who've gone through our system or program or implementation.
12:10
Third, I established far more demand for my service than I have Supply so that I can keep my prices High by generating more content, that is better than everyone else's paid stuff.
So if you're free stuff, is better than their paid stuff.
You mean Jane thought leadership and all they do is copy what you have and everyone else can then make a judgment wait their free stuff isn't as good as your free stuff.
12:33
So then you're paid stuff, must be better than their paid stuff.
That's the natural logic that the marketplace will always do.
So when you have that Supply demand curve in your favor and you have all these people want in this tiny little amount of Supply you control the market.
And when you mark in the business, you do control both demand and Supply, because you can stimulate demand and you can cut your own Supply to drive the price, exactly where you need it to be to deliver the outcome that you want.
12:55
Choose if you want to make the best fucking salespeople in the world, these are the steps you have to do.
A most efficient quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
13:11
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Now, let's play it out.
Let's say you did it and you had a really high standard, and you've only been making content for, let's say a year.
13:27
Now, if you're like, wait only a year, yeah, it takes time to build big shit.
So if you build it for a year and let's say you only got 25 people to graduate, okay?
But they're all killers Savages, what do you think's going to happen to the companies that they go get jobs at you got anymore?
13:44
Sure, do now, you have even more Demand on both sides and what do you think's going to happen to the Friends of the those people who start making twice with the industry averages for sales guys because they're that much better.
Their top 20% top 5% sales guys rather than just run-of-the-mill sales guys.
14:00
Well they're friends going to be like well fuck it.
If I can wait a year to get three times the earnings, it's totally worth it.
Well if I'm going to make three hundred thousand dollars a year, rather than the industry average, sales guy making 60, I make five times the income, how much more valuable is this one, your education?
What we know Harvard charges people 250,000 for there for years.
14:20
So for a year, You could probably charge a lot because you have the data to support the fact that one, you don't let everyone in to when people graduate, you also have a rank order because of the 25 guys.
There is one guy that you said, no matter where this guy goes, he will fucking murder everyone.
And the guy who's number 25, you can say he got into our program.
14:37
He's still a Harvard student but he wasn't the best Harvard student.
And what happens is they start to believe you businesses start to believe you.
And then the customers someone leaves a review, right?
This guy leaves reviewer like yeah, you got C's, you didn't show up you You didn't do your homework, obviously you weren't as good, right?
14:53
But you have the data to support that and you're like, man, this takes time to build something like that.
Sure, does Harvard's over 100 years old.
That's how you build a brand.
Where is that?
An education business abso-fucking-lutely?
Is it legit abso-fucking-lutely?
Is it a scam in no possible fucking way and so if you want to go from scam to 100% legit, look at what Harvard does and model that thought process, because if you do it that way, you can enter what I believe is one of the Two industries out there if done the right way and one of the keys to making Harvard's thought leadership.
15:28
And if you look at the highest Brands out there that are in the business consulting or business space, look at McKinsey, look at Bay and look at BCG.
You look at these, look at JPMorgan, like the bank's, the reason like, why do you think they make these white papers?
Why do you think they spin out these incredibly in-depth reports that they spent millions of dollars Gathering data on?
15:46
Because once they do it, if you're an investor and you're making decisions, Is based on their data, you assume that they are good and it makes you more likely to like and trust them.
And ultimately long-term do business with them and to respect people that are from their business to reach out to you, Etc.
16:04
It's a self-fulfilling marketing strategy.
And so, Harvard invest their stuff, the Harvard Business Review, they put out books, they have a massive email list, like, there's all these things that they do to position themselves as number one.
If you look at the stuff that we're doing acquisition.com, it's like there's a free course on my site that you can take, you don't have to opt in anywhere.
16:24
There's downloads that you can use immediately that many people take and immediately just sell to other people.
And I've, of course, right now that's coming out on leads and you guessed it.
It's going to be free for the next book.
Hundred-dollar lead to comes out and the whole goal is it has to be so good that it becomes the textbook, it becomes the cannon becomes the go-to resource that Peter had multiple business owners reach out to me and say, I was gonna write something on this but then I saw yours and realized I was just going to copy and paste everything you had.
16:55
So can I just like send it to my list?
And I was like sure of course.
And so that's what you want.
And the thing is if you're not selling your education and your selling the implementation, you get way more of those opportunities because people don't see you as a threat.
17:10
If you're thinking about thought leadership.
Sure.
Like their packaging is a white paper or it's a review or whatever meta-analysis like sure maybe they could use some help.
I like Making it more palatable, but you can still take the concept of like, how can I review all the data that I exclusively have access to all of you?
17:26
If you have a business have customers, imagine how valuable it would be to actually publish your success data publicly and just show you, hey, the bottom 20% of students at Harvard, don't show up to class.
Now, you might think, oh, I don't want to, I don't want to publish my bad stuff.
Transparency, always wins long term because if like no, it's like the Eminem thing.
17:46
Like no one can hold against you.
What?
You put out publicly?
Lie, right?
And so if you're like, dude, bottom, 20% of our people who sign up for my sales thing, don't graduate because they don't show up and they never even make a dial boom.
So on the front end when you're qualified people like don't be one of these people, right?
18:01
And so then you're always up front and always legit and that's what prevents you from being in the waste bucket.
It all the phds that go and teach at Harvard and Stanford and whatever.
Their main job is content, creation, think about that.
Their job is to create net, new content that no one's ever made before they just call it research.
18:20
And so they do a study that last three years or five years and they get funding for their study and they make truly one of one content and the university benefits because everyone then sites that search that study and where it says done at Harvard University by X.
18:36
Y'see doctor.
So it reinforces their brand and makes them because of all the backlinks, they get to and all the citations that that study gets as a more legitimate study.
And so, if you think about your content the same way, they think about their research which is I want as many people to cite my research, my content, then that's how, you know, you have high quality content, guess what?
18:54
That's also.
How Google figures out.
What content is good or not?
They see how many people share this thing.
How many people linked to it, because it's many people link to it from diverse sources.
It's probably pretty good at as high Authority, Expertise High depth at cetera and so if you make content like that you make it too good to fail and fundamentally from the expectation settings, it comes down to the term unsubstantiated claims that's fundamentally what?
19:18
Almost all marketing laws and FTC compliance.
All of that comes down to that one term which is people make promises that they can't back up.
And so if you if you have no data guess what, you can't make any promises.
So the best thing to do is collect data so that you can make substantiated claims.
19:35
That's the The key here, and it's not really a claim because you're just saying this is what happened, caveat past performance isn't a predictor of future performance.
This is what happened with our got last graduating class.
It might not ever happen again, but you can use that to make your own decision.
It also gets you out of the rat race of the best.
19:51
I always have it.
There was a company that I was looking at and they were a little bit smaller so we ended up not wanting to invest in the company but she the owner of the company asked me.
I said, what makes you different than everybody else in the space?
And she said, well were the best and I was like, you are smaller than How do people in the space and so objectively?
20:08
I think that's false and she like, looked really defeated and I said you want to know how you can get around that question because prospects, actually ask you that because she was like, it was one of the big issues they had coming up.
I said, you don't need to be the best, you just need to show and you just need to demonstrate High return on investment.
20:25
So that way, I don't need to compete against six other people because it's like saying don't invest in that fund only invest in my fun.
Well, that's silly.
Invest in both.
You, you Mike, if you get a good return, On both, get a good return on book and so it stops make you a competitor from everyone.
Feel like I'm the best would, you can't really objectively prove?
20:42
But when you can say is these are the expectations.
You can have given the data that I have to support this claim and then the prospect can make an informed decision to buy your thing or not and guess what, when they make informed decisions, they tend to stick with them.
If you're in the wastebasket right now, you're in the bucket of sewage right now and you can self identify and you might get butthurt by this.
21:01
But like, I don't really care.
I'm trying to do this long term for you rather than short-term for you.
To be kind rather than nice.
You have to take a big humility pill because you can either you can continue to kind of like, go on this on this treadmill and never really break through that barrier because there's a reason that most of these businesses cap like they can't get Beyond a certain size whereas legitimate businesses can, and it's because they consistently over-deliver and exceed expectations.
21:27
This company when taken to its natural end will either go out of business because things will stop converting.
That's what going out of business.
Means you have to change your entire offer just because you're the same employees.
He's doesn't necessarily mean the same business, right?
You have to constantly reshuffle and recycle offers, which means that you never actually get any compounding to work in your favor.
21:43
Which means you constantly have to start back at Ground Zero every 24 months with your new big idea because you've over-promised and under-delivered to everyone in one market place that you have to switch marketplaces and do it again and I'll be really clear.
You can make money doing that.
You just won't make big money and for everybody's in Mosey Nation, My Hope for you is that you want to make big money because that's all we try to do at acquisition.com.
22:04
Is we help companies?
Make this transition.
Obviously you're all the way here.
We don't talk to you.
Like if you're over here we're like okay let's add a couple of these other elements of legitimacy because hear me out on this, if you have a company that's doing ten million dollars in Top Line and three million dollars in profit and there's two companies, one is kind of in this scam bucket and the other ones in this very legitimate.
22:22
Harvard bucket.
This thing might be worth 30 million dollars.
This thing isn't worth is it worth a five dollar bill?
And so you can make yourself 30 million dollars wealthier by adding these elements of legitimacy.
And if it takes XU a year or 24 months in order to go through those steps.
22:39
It's worth it because you got 30 million dollars wealthier in that 24 month period tax-free.
So this is where you have to expand your time Horizon and say like do I want to be really wealthy or do I just want to flex on Instagram and that's and that's and that's a real question, you know what I mean?
22:55
Like some of you guys just want to flex on the screen which is 5, then like go do that.
But like this is like I make my shit for the people who want to go big and like to go big.
You have to be legit and I'll give you the little math and My team will cut this out because it's a little deep.
But what happens is, when you go into a market place, it only becomes more expensive to acquire new customers because in the beginning of your warmest audience, rather people know you like you trust, you whatever and then you expand one Circle outside of that.
23:20
And what happens is, there's two forces that compound against you one is that it often costs more to reach those colder.
Audiences to the percentage of people in that code audience, who responded by your thing is less, because they're less of a fit if I'm selling dog food.
And I only Target.
23:36
People love Petco.
I probably have more people by than if I just Target the United States, right?
It's just more, people are a fit and here's the third really Insidious, when that works against you is that advertising costs, only go one way up.
If you look at Facebook ads, cost per impression for 2014 2015, 2016, it's just a straight line going up.
23:54
And so, you've got your going to colder cold audiences that convert less, and less, and less, and the net cost of advertising only goes up.
So, then how do you scale a business over the long term if you have three forces?
Against you, you have to have the people who come into your business, send you other people.
24:10
It's a nonlinear thing that can compound in your favor.
And so for example, if your cost to acquire a customer has gone up faster than the cost increase on cost of Impressions, on whatever advertising platform, you have negative word-of-mouth working against you people who otherwise would have bought, who didn't know you at all.
24:31
Have been convinced not to buy because someone did by and said their escape and so The only way to really scale.
Long term is to have net Goodwill from your customer base, that gets you more referrals.
So that when you go to that cold as Market that cost you the most that converts least amount of people that one guy brings you five and never leaves.
24:49
And that's how you can continue to Market and expand over time.
But if you don't do that, you constantly have to reinvent yourself every 24 months, and remarked it to that little warm audience, who knows who you are, and you sell a new widget.
It's a tough life.
And so the only things that get really big are things that grow unto themselves.
25:05
They compound and compounding takes time and the strategies outlined is the longest term play of making a legitimate education business into something that's valuable and actually helps people.

Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
I'm a big believer in continue to take dividends out of a business as it continues to grow.
And that's because you want to decrease your downside risk, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
A, I hope you enjoy and subscribe if I'm an entrepreneur and I'm growing my business month, over month, over month, when should I one start taking money out into one?
0:40
Should I start actively investing?
These are the questions I get most frequently on the with the entrepreneurs that I speak with who you know, depending on where they're at they might have you know five hundred thousand a million two million dollars in the bank and they're like, I'm not really sure what I should do.
And so what I wanted to do is walk you through the thought process that I have are had around investing to give you a little Of some Frameworks to think through that helped me make the decision making process a lot easier.
1:04
So, first off, I'm a big believer in continuing to take dividends out of a business, as it continues to grow.
And that's because you want to decrease your downside risk, right?
Because for some reason and the statistics are very likely that the business will not succeed in the long term.
Right?
You know, 90, whatever it is 90 percent or 95 percent of businesses fail within five years and so, it's much better in my opinion to consistently take money out of the business as you're growing it, because there's a very high likelihood that it will not Kick around A and B many entrepreneurs have this idea that they're going to sell their business for some magical number sometime in the future when in reality, only one percent of businesses ever sell.
1:38
And so if that is the case again, well I would rather not stacking chips on a 91 1 bet it does happen but the likened is low and so I would like to take chips off the table table on a regular basis.
So that is first part, which is making sure that we're taking money out.
But the second question is okay.
Well, now that I have this money, this 500, this million this, whatever, what should I do with it, right?
1:57
And so one of the big things, Is I just like to think about this, through the lens of opportunity cost, which is if I'm currently making, let's say a five hundred thousand dollars a year, right?
From my business, in every Castle, its own earnings.
So, I get to take out of the business after reinvesting in in the growth and competitiveness that we need to continue to maintain to to grow, right?
2:16
So if I 55 thousand dollars of net free cash flow is coming to me.
And let's say I've got, I don't know, a million dollars saved up.
If I were to, if I were to passively invest that I should get about 10% ish a year, right?
That's just going to be Resting through indexes like the S&P 500 Etc, right?
2:33
If I'm doing that, then the the advantage of actively investing might be the marginal difference moment, might be an extra five or ten percent.
So that'd be a 50 to 100 percent increase because 10 to 15 percent has a 50% increase, right?
But if I look at it, in terms of real terms, just purely on how much my net worth is going to increase which is the lens that we have to look at this through which is the opportunity cost.
2:56
If I were to spend half of my time thinking about massively investing because it We'll take up half your your mind space.
I promise you because I've done this mistake before I made this mistake before, then what happens is your active income will fall at a disproportionate rate compared to what your money is making you.
3:12
So let me walk you through a numbers example.
So let's say you've got that million dollars and you can get 10% a year which is 100 Grand. 100 percent passively right?
But the additional 50% are hundred thousand dollars a year, fifty two hundred thousand dollars a year, which would be 5 to 10% of that million, right?
3:29
You can get through.
Lovely investing.
Well, if you're currently making five hundred thousand dollars a year from your business.
Do we think it would be reasonable to take half for 25% of your time to go chase that when you could probably get your income from 500 to 750 thousand in the next year, five hundred to a million.
3:45
And so for me that was always the opportunity cost of actively investing which until my wealth became so large that I felt like it was out the opportunity cost of the money that I should be making by paying more attention to my money was going to be was going to outpace my Which is still almost not there.
4:02
And so for me, that is why, as for entrepreneurs, it's my belief that a should be ripping out cash on a regular basis because that's downside risk protection.
It's not your upside, it is downside protection.
If the fact that what if my business does not succeed, and you have to think, like, as much as I'm a big believer in being optimistic, you also have to face reality and confront facts, which is the likelihood that this particular business that you want.
4:24
I've had 13 businesses that I've started up to this point and now I'm going to eat more, right.
So like the Likelihood that the business that you start is going to be the one that you finish with is extremely extremely, extremely low, right?
Extremely low and the likely that you're going to solid business for big number is extremely extremely, extremely low?
4:41
And so you take this money out and you put it into the SP or you put it into an index because it is passive and you can put it there.
And the idea is that you never have to think about it again.
Now, the amount of money that you should keep in cash, in my belief, is it should have a six months, two years worth of normal living that saved up in cash and that's just so that you can sleep well at night.
5:00
And that's it, right?
And so the other thing is that when you invest that in two indexes or not, you can always take a loan against those assets.
If you wanted to start something big so it's not like it's a liquid when it's there.
You can take loans against those assets at 60 or 70 percent loan to value.
Meaning, if you have a million dollars in Assets in the, SP most banks will give you 60, 70 percent of that or at least 50, right?
5:22
Depending on the stocks and all in your history with them etcetera, that will give you basically a for free, right?
They'll give you at 1% or 2%.
Money that you can go and reinvest the starting another business or hype is real estate or whatever right?
And so for entrepreneurs it is my belief that you should be investing most of your time and energy or almost 100% your time and energy and growing your income growing.
5:43
The main vehicle you have.
But extracting the money and putting it into a low brain vehicle, that's not active, that's passive.
That's truly passive, not real estate, flipping that's not pass it, right?
Truly passive.
If you're in crypto, right?
Or you have some speculative stuff that you want to get into it.
5:59
He's probably taking up way more of your attention than it should be and it's actually going to make your main income stuff which means your net worth will grow more slowly than it otherwise would.
So it's all by the opportunity cost of your attention.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
6:20
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
All right, now, I'm going to put this special, no doubt here for employees.
6:37
If the primary objective of the employee in my opinion is to increase how much your income is.
And so all of yours and this goes for a to the, the initial parts of your investment should be growing to increase your skills because that increases your basis that increases your basic income, that you can continue to yield from the marketplace based on your skill set.
6:53
And so, this is where I think people step, you know, they step over dollars to pick up pennies.
If you're, if you were saving, you know, $500 a month in, there's nothing wrong with that.
But I would be actively investing that 500 there.
The Thousand or two thousand dollars a month in the beginning into making my skills more valuable.
7:09
Because I know that if I do that, in two years, I might quadruple my income because that's the thing, is that your ability to earn is one of the greatest Investments, that's not just a billionaire saying, it really is like, you get like if you develop the skill of selling which might take you two years, you can go from making sixty thousand dollars a year to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year or five hundred thousand dollars a year which puts you in the top one percent just by ironing.
7:33
That one skill and so if you can develop that skill is worth the investment in most investments in self-improvement or so disproportionately low that it is worth the investment.
Even if there are courses that you only get a handful of things from, you are still as yourself an asset more valuable.
7:48
And so you I mean at the end of the day, you are the source, you're the source of where all the money comes from.
So it's like when people don't invest in themselves it makes no sense to me.
I've spent, every dollar I possibly could gaining access getting mentorship, getting coaching getting programs by Courses, buying books and doing that stuff because I'm the source, right?
8:07
If I can improve me as the machine, that generates all the flow of income, then the rest of the stuff becomes easy, right?
And so, first and foremost, you have to invest in that after you have an excess of that, then start pulling the dividends out of the business that you have investing those things that are passive not active.
8:23
And then at the point where your net worth from Your Vessel assets, what 10% of that, net worth growth would be, is an excess of what you make per year.
Then at that point, it makes sense to start shifting your perspective.
Towards managing wealth and growing wealth, rather than growing income.
Now, like I said, two employees.
8:39
Number one is increase your skill basis, meaning continue to invest in gaining skills, so that you could become more valuable company.
The way you do that is by tying yourself to revenue streams.
That means you find ways to generate the company, more money, period.
And that could be through a variety of ways.
If you were at, you know, your, your customer success or customer service for film it that it's going to be, how can I send as many customers as possible?
8:57
How can I retain these customers?
How can I track these metrics and show to the people who are deciding my compensation?
How I'm directly making a company more money, right, and how losing me would cost money company a lot more than what it would cost them to keep, right?
If I'm on the front inside.
So it's going to be sales, it's can be marketing to be acquisition based.
9:15
How can I show them?
What I, how I can become more value.
How can I close twice as many deals?
How can I, you know, close it a higher percentage?
How can I get more leaflet by working my pipeline better?
How can I generate leads on my own in a tenement from the leaves that they're generating for me, right?
All of those things are things that you can do to increase how much you make right now, I guess that if you're an There's going to be a certain cap most of the time on what you're earning.
9:36
And if that is the case, in your rubbing against that cap, you should keep your your basis for living as low as humanly possible.
And plows, much of that money as possible into a highly liquid asset.
Again, if you're in a situation where your your wealth, right, the network that you have is is the 10% of that amount is still less than you make, then all of your, your attention should still be going to or your primary net worth, increase our, which will be your income.
10:03
So if I can consolidate this video to a single statement you should, it's my opinion.
Spend the majority of your time on the vehicle that will increase your net worth the fastest.
And for most people, it is going to be increasing their income.
10:20
Until the point, where they have saved sufficient amount of assets that they put in passive, highly liquid things like SPS and indexes Etc.
And at that point, when you're, when the To earn and increase.
Your net worth is faster or greater through the assets that you have.
10:40
At that point it makes sense to switch your attention towards growing those assets.
Because now, the opportunity cost is shifted away from where your income is generated versus where your wealth is growing.
And so that is my at, what point should you start investing?
That is how I break down first.
10:58
Invest in you increase your skill bases, so that you can generate more income.
It is the highest Return genuinely.
I'm not saying that for jargon.
It is the highest return that you can get.
The second is that you continue to put things into past truly passive, not what people claim is passive that are really side hustles but truly passive businesses so that you can continue to focus on your main income generation and then when ten percent of your net worth growth exceeds your income capacity currently at that point, it makes sense for you to shift your perspective into growing your wealth, and rather than your income.
11:29
So, I hope you found this video valuable.

Hard work will not make you rich.
I get driven nuts by the amount of gurus and influencers and whatever who want to brag and say, no one can outwork me.
I'm the best in the world so many people outwork me.
I still make more money than them.
There has to be something else.
One of the things that grinds my gears about a lot of the people that I see on Instagram that you probably see to is this whole like known can outwork me, Mantra first off, it's objectively false because many people a outwork you today.
0:24
The outward caved in the past.
See you haven't met everyone, Andy, it doesn't matter.
Anyways it's the same thing, when someone's like, I'm the best and you have to say you're the best because if you don't think you're the best, it shows that you're not confident to me.
I don't take that at all.
If someone's like I'm the best then, why aren't you on fucking Billboards?
0:39
That's what the best would look like.
Absolutely, you need to do the work, you need to put volume.
It is the only way you get better, but if you start claiming that, you are the best, you cannot be outworked.
You are making statements that, you know, are not true.
Why are we bragging about work?
Because work has very little to do with the highest levels of the game.
0:56
Warren Buffett talks about if you mix two good decisions a year, he's had a good year until Was it that one of the best investors?
One of the best business people in terms of measuring it by money.
Which is how you measure business talks about how he does, basically nothing reads five or six hours a day, eats McDonald's and makes a couple good decisions a year.
How is it that that guy is making so much more money than the people who are bragging about the fact that they work so hard?
1:14
Everyone only has the same hours a day.
Anybody who only sleeps eight hours or only sleep seven hours and works the remaining of hours of the day?
All of them would be tied for hardest-working.
So what creates output you have volume of activity and then you have the leverage of the T that you're doing.
1:30
That's what creates the total output in order to do anything.
You must do something.
There has to be some level of energy.
That gets input into the system are activity.
In terms of number of activities, is a very new be measure of success in the beginning.
Warren Buffett doesn't say I said 1,000 emails today.
1:47
He doesn't talk like that.
He's playing a different game.
Jeff Bezos.
In like, woke up at 4 a.m. today.
Now, mind you, I'm saying this is somebody who likes waking up early.
We can't be a superstitious about what matters we can up.
Early, doesn't matter.
Go to bed late, doesn't matter.
Not Being a lot, doesn't matter.
The few things that matter are the inputs that go into the system that have the most leverage to create the most Alpha.
2:05
Now, if you're a newbie and you can't get your ass off the couch and by all means, figure out how to actually get your ass off the couch and do stuff.
But then there's only so many hours and so boom.
And then very quickly, you hit your capacity of work.
Great.
You've maximized that now, what the leverage that we have on that activity is going to dictate how much we get out of it.
2:23
And if we do a low leverage activity, many, many, many times we might get more, then a high leverage activity that gets done.
Once a CEO who's Go to work with acquisition.com Works virtually every hour of every day, when they come in, almost everybody does.
Sometimes they ask their like am I gonna be working more or like it's impossible for you to work more?
But you are going to be changing what you work on because that's the only leverage.
2:40
We have there's only 24 hours.
We're going to switch these nine out and we're going to pop these in with higher leverage activities.
And so, the way that we do that is we look at their calendars and we look at their org chart.
If this is how you fucking grow business, you look at what they spend their time on and you see which of these activities are low Leverage, is there anyone else in this org chart that we can hand these activities if and if a large percentage of these activities are a certain type of thing, Don't exist in your chart then it's a role that we need a higher.
3:02
The point of why I hate the concept of no one can outwork me, is that there are many ways to win the game if you were to think about an amazing goal as a dragon, to be slain, if you are familiar with video games in any way when you create like a war party, you have a group of people that are gonna go go on a quest.
3:17
You don't just have 10 Paladin's or guys who just have Shields and swords.
So you've got a Healer a mage that's really gonna damage but can't take a lot of damage.
The you've got a paladin who can't hit us hard, but he can take a lot of shots you find.
People who have complementary skills.
If you're playing football, you don't have 10 running backs, the entrepreneur really should be the coach of the team.
3:38
It's about organizing the pieces and how the well, they play together.
That ultimately determines how good the team is like, how many times have you seen the team with the All-Star?
That has the poor Supporting Cast?
Get beat by the overall better team?
It happens all the time.
A lot of entrepreneurs is I see them are trying to play the game like they're the star player and they want to score all the points but they lose to Apple because Apple's got a team.
4:01
We celebrate a specific action like work when it's really just saying, oh look, there's a paladin who can take a lot of hits.
Cool, that's not the only thing that's required to win.
I think what is more valuable is to know?
What are each of the roles that exist within the business?
A b.
4:17
Is there one of these that you map to based on your characteristics and skill sets?
And then see what is my eventual Evolution through entrepreneurship will start at the beginning which is what are the players on the field?
So if you think about it by function, you've got somebody who has To promote, he's got to be a good marketer.
They have to understand how to make things known across different platforms, telling stories, building a brand providing value to an audience.
4:37
That's what marketing is sales is being able to convert that raw attention into a sale direct response ads.
Sales Pages video sales letters, Etc, which is pretty much anything that's physical products or software-based.
That's low ticket or its higher ticket people-to-people.
Hand-to-hand combat who know how to in the beginning cell and then later trained how to sell.
4:56
And then later later lead, people who trained how to sell these are The selling the same people I've met really brilliant Marcus who suck at sales and really good sales people sucking marketing.
Then you've got somebody who understands product.
How do we make something?
Beautiful, the guy who started Shopify, he's not CEO of Shopify, he's head of product, he's a mage.
5:13
He knows how to cast spells.
And you've got the experience people who managing everything outside of the actual product itself, how do customers engage with us, how can provide more value?
How can their amazing experience?
How do we make sure they're hitting these Milestones?
This person who knows, customers experience?
A customer success is not the same person who understands product and ux and Design.
5:29
And that's a different game, which is different than guy knows how to close is different avenues that are promote.
The bigger, the Enterprise gets, the more specialized, the skill becomes in the deeper, The Well of experience that people need to be.
They have to be more specialized when people are like I can't be outworked.
You're bragging about the wrong thing.
5:45
It should be like, I can't be out recruited.
I can't be out.
Managed no one can build a culture like me, that's super high.
Leverage across the organization.
No one can lead like me but no one can outwork me.
It's just an irrelevant activity metric.
I love working at work all the time.
I would never claim that no one works harder than me.
6:02
I tend to have very good leverage with the activities that I do.
I spend tons of time writing a book and that book princess copies forever.
It's a different way to play the game and so level 2 of this, which player you are in the Middle.
Run of this, you end up segregating yourself to a portion of the business that you're an expert at or that you're best at CMO or chief sales officer Chief product officer.
6:19
It's not about one player being the champion here.
It's about how the team works together, which then gets to the third level of this is just about being the coach, think about the best coaches do, they're literally trying.
To headhunt the best players and they're trying to recruit the best people in college.
Look at what Google does think about their recruiting efforts.
6:35
They've huge influx is dedicated to getting the best and smartest people out of college.
And they have another ring for the best and smartest people come out of business school.
And then another one is they're very high-level recruiting at the top of the executive level, the parallels, between sports and business, they are almost the same in that way.
Now mind you can only have, you know, 10 or 11 people on the field, you might have 10,000 but if each of those players represents a function or Department of the business, it makes more sense when we Move up the levels of Entrepreneurship.
7:02
We need to make sure that we're playing the right game and that we're using the right metric to measure our success.
Final level of this is being, the coach is recruiting the top-level executives, and creating a farm system underneath feed into the company that you have.
So you can have a sustained competitive advantage and create a dynasty for the team.
7:19
So you can create the best winning team every year and have the soft skills of create a culture of high performance, so that you get the most out of every individual player.
And the difference between In coaching and mediocre or poor coaching is what would players do if they had no coach or leader and then what would they do if they had the best coach?
7:36
And best leader, the Delta between those two is the value of the coach, the value of the CEO, the CEO needs to have the highest return on time out of anyone, the organization because they need to always be solving.
The next problem, as long as when they replace their time, the activities, do they do with the new stuff.
Builds the business, even more than that, trade will always work.
7:29
In coaching and mediocre or poor coaching is what would players do if they had no coach or leader and then what would they do if they had the best coach?
And best leader, the Delta between those two is the value of the coach, the value of the CEO, the CEO needs to have the highest return on time out of anyone, the organization because they need to always be solving.
7:46
The next problem, as long as when they replace their time, the activities, do they do with the new stuff.
Builds the business, even more than that, trade will always work.








0:00
I would trade everything that I have when I'm 40 to be 32 and so it's just like reminding myself, enjoy this now.
The following?
Yeah, but I would trade everything to be here when I'm 40.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons.
0:15
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
You imagine you'd always created something from a lack.
Yeah, but now, it sounds like there's a different intention for why you're building something.
What happens when people shift their attention?
Yeah, from scarcity, lack mindset to growth impact service, whatever it might be, that you're coming from.
0:35
I'm so excited for this question.
So I think the biggest thing that changes is time, ER time Horizon what is time Horizon and I think the single greatest differentiator between the poor and the middle class middle class and rich rich in the truly, wealthy is how they see time.
And if you think about money as simply a condensed unit of time, right?
0:54
That's all money is like you trade it for.
I mean, you can trade time for money.
So like it is there almost equivalent units and the people who know how to master their time, the most, I mean, that they know how to master their money, the most, right?
And so really if you want to master to the original question of like how do wealthy people come wealthiest because they measure the time and so Time Horizon is just like the perspective from which we see what we want to achieve.
1:14
And so if I am doing, if I'm building a company from the place of like, I believe that this company should exist.
I believe this problem is worth solving and that is where you start it from.
Then you build it differently versus versus I need to make money.
I need to make money this week and you make money tomorrow because what can I go make money with exactly?
1:31
And so I think like I mean, you've got this amazing brand here.
If if people were able to not ask for 12 months and just serve the this Is what I did when I launched the because I literally sold another company.
I didn't make that much, but I have enough for, like two years to live by living pretty Frugal.
1:47
I wasn't like, I never bought anything fancy.
It was like, you know, whatever food and travel may be right about still sleeping on couches back.
Then, you know, just because I wanted to save, I want to spend it on hotels and start spending hotel rooms until about four or five years ago.
I would always find a way who do I know in that talent and crash on any way side note.
2:05
But when I launch School of greatness 10 years ago, I remember saying I'm going to do this for one year.
Because I wish I had access to this.
I wish this was a thing that I can go listen to ya in the world to teach me.
Yeah.
And I'm not going to try to make money like I'm going to do it for a year.
Yeah.
All in but I'm not going to try to make money.
2:22
I don't want to make money.
I mean if the money came greater but it wasn't my intention.
I was just in.
How can I create the best content to serve people on the things that I wish I would have learned in school growing up?
Yes the school of greatness.
Yes.
And after one year I was like man this thing is really starting to take off you know but it wasn't based on how do I make it?
2:40
Much money.
It was, how do I create something that could really make a lasting change.
Yeah.
And that intention is what's made me sustainable for 10 years, loving the process, totally.
So when people come from a place where me hear you say when they come from, a place of that intention of service or because this needs to be in the world art exists not to do something that exist to exist, right.
3:00
It's like no one says why did you paint that?
Like they needed to come out need is that you express it?
Exactly.
And so I think that if people chose their businesses that way I think and I don't know, I'm all about making money like by all means go get your backyard as much as you can.
Yeah, no means.
But I think that what it does is it ends up freeing you to then make your real impact, because then you can start the whatever the next thing.
3:21
And hopefully, your first thing is that thing, but realistically, it probably isn't in all I have to do is, look at every entrepreneur.
That's really wealthy.
The amount of graveyard businesses, they have in their back, right, right.
And so like right now, if you're listening and you're like, I'm not sure if this is the perfect business idea, let me just save you the time.
It's not because look at every other person who has been Ultra successful they have 10 failed business ideas so just like just start so you can Just start knocking off the Badness, is but extending the time Horizon, I think only happens if you do shift the intention through it, you're building it or you're just unbelievably self-disciplined.
3:51
But I think it's easier to just like start at it with the right heart, because small changes, but I think it'll be worth it.
Is that the reason that most people aren't successful, in my opinion, is that they sacrifice Global benefit for local benefit.
And that happens in all areas of life, you eat the piece of cake because you have an acute local benefit versus the global benefit of a six-pack that lasts for very Time or Better.
4:10
Health Etc, right?
The instant gratification, as opposed to delay gratification.
Exactly.
And I just, I like saying Global I just like saying local versus global because it happens in an organization.
For example, sales guys don't want to put the notes in the thing because it's a pain in the butt to put the notes in the CRM.
4:26
But Finance needs to notes, customer service needs to both success needs to that like all of these other departments, need those notes for all the other things that we're going to do and so to local cost, but for a global benefit.
And so I think if people were able to delay that That immediate gratification, which is like, this is the nature of success.
4:43
I think they're responding that there was this study.
That was done.
I can remember it.
It's marshmallow test or the other.
Okay.
God, I can talk about the mark.
Both.
Okay, so fun fun with that.
With the marshmallow test is measuring how long they delay for the marshmallow.
So at what point does it not make sense if they say, you can get one?
5:02
Because it because they like to everyone, that simplifies the experiment which is like if I give you a marshmallow one now or you can get to later, right?
But what if too?
In a year you're like I don't care.
I'll take the one now, right?
So then the next question, I would have is like, if you were to test kids and then say at what point the global versus local crosses when you're and then track the kids who had the longest marshmallow waiting period but then you could measure how long the most successful, probably a life.
5:27
Yeah, really interesting.
Just total side note.
But huh.
The three things, I think we're in common of the ultra successful were inflated sense of self as in.
They thought that they like, they deserve big things.
They want to go after big things, they believed in themselves, right inferiority.
I never been good enough.
Hmm.
And impulse control.
5:42
Those are the three factors of the most successful.
They like what?
They did a common factors now.
So it's like, these people think they believe that they can achieve all this amazing stuff and then it's just it's an amazing Paradox because at the same time, they think they're not good enough and they are insecure about whether they can achieve it and if impulse control.
5:58
And so it's like if you have blend.
Yeah.
Right.
And they just they, and they stay focused on the thing.
And what I like to see the biggest breakthroughs that I have had, I think that will create a lot of the wealth that we will have, in the future is, is Really a deep understanding of how long long is and shooting with the intention of like, I'm only bringing this up because my YouTube guy said it was.
6:17
Like, I've never had somebody who actually started out.
I was like, will see what we do in five years.
I was like will measure that and he was like, no one has literally ever said that smells like as long as it's he progress I'm good because I want results in like two months, you know.
Oh yeah.
Like if we're making, we're going this way.
I'm cool.
I don't need to sit, like, that's good enough for most people if they could extend the time runs because like I'll give you another hack.
6:37
You can know how wealthy someone is based on the Time Horizons.
They speak Give an example.
So if someone's talking about how they're trying to make, you know, make money this today, I hate.
Let me hold 24 today, you know how, you know, how poor they are.
I have to say Port like, you know, right?
If someone's talking about what they're going to make this week or this month or this quarter where this year, but this decade well different, the people are who are talking those time Horizons.
6:59
And so I think that if we can shift the time Horizon that we think in, then we gain more leverage over our time which we then know we will compound into money because I think if Master the time.
You must, mm-hmm.
You've been married for how long or others, five years in a relationship or six years or some six years relationship, five years married.
7:20
This is something I've been on curious about a different Decades of my life, right?
I'm 39.
Now just turned 39 March, and in my 20s, I don't think it was.
I was like, how is it possible to be of one human being for the rest of your life, right?
Yeah.
Like there's so much adrenaline and testosterone and it just desire.
7:38
Yeah, I was thinking from a place of Desire now, I'm from a place of, I don't know from a spiritual Foundation.
That's all right.
More of a sexual desire and I would study these different men over the years and the ones that I really respect.
Her, were the ones who had amazing long-term relationships, and who had healthy businesses that impacted people in positive ways and had, you know, semi Healthy Families in general, right?
8:02
I'm curious, why did you decide to get married?
I guess at twenty five, six.
I was just totally.
She was 23 years.
Before and I was 26 or 27, that is why their?
Why decide to get married in your 20s?
Yeah.
And how has that been beneficial towards your inner?
8:20
Peace.
Your health and your wealth.
Yeah.
So I think getting married is a great hack for making money.
I have a lot of thoughts of this first one is because at least if you're anything like me probably 80% of my attention, went to chasing tail and so getting all of that attention back automatically just makes you more money, right?
8:39
All your energy is It's probably on a hundred percent of doing that is spread all over the place and so that was that's just like honestly just getting into a relationship accomplishes that going from relationship to marriage though was really surprising to me because I was, I would say fairly against marriage for most of everything and it's by happenstance Layla and I got married almost like as a dare and then we're still married and it's been awesome.
9:01
The total will get it another time if they're but when I, when we did get married, it was actually really interesting and maybe this is just my own personal.
Experience, but I felt this very sincere shift of, knowing it felt secure.
Even the long-term, well, I'm like, why do we need a government body?
9:17
Why do we need someone?
Why do we need an external party to validate?
A real relationship.
Sign a document from exactly Mary.
Yeah.
But there is some level of commitment that comes with it.
That makes it more stable and knowing that it was like oh she's in it with just knowing the barrier to exit was significantly higher for both of us.
9:36
I think increased our commitment to the relationship but it gave me so much more.
Ability for risk, taking in a lot of ways knowing that she was there knowing she had my back and, you know, I was texting a buddy of mine who was, who was living the fast life?
Yes, girls every other night.
9:52
Yeah, and he was like, how do you know what do you, how do you think through this?
And I thought about it and I think that when you get into the into the committed relationship or marriage, you trade novelty for loyalty.
Hmm.
And for me, that to me loyalty I was trying to Define this for myself but like Me loyalty matters, more than love, or is it form of love or the one that I value the most?
10:15
And then as a secondary because I was trying to Define like, what, like whenever someone says like, what is love, right?
Like if you actually like start trying to peel the word back, most people just describe activities that people who are in love do well it means and then they use a laundry list of activities.
10:31
And so the best definition I have another this is this me out there is of how much like measuring love is.
How much are you willing to endure to?
Keep it.
And so if you have a relationship with someone and like and I would say love and liking to me is the same thing because it's really difficult to differentiate between the two.
10:47
If you have a relationship with someone and you're not really willing to like let's say wait 30 minutes later to go to dinner with them, probably a very little liking in there, right?
If you have kids, you're probably willing to do a lot for them.
And so like I'll give you an example that a friend of mine said he was like man he must like he's like if you have a car they've been working all the time.
11:07
Like a lot of guys like Tinker with much love that car, right?
That thing's a piece of crap.
He was a lot of that that it barely runs because of what he's willing to put up with.
And so it's kind of interesting when you think of like you can measure Love by your willingness to sacrifice or endure in order to keep it.
11:23
You think we should under a toxic relationship though or something that's no, not adding value equally or putting forth a level of effort to be fair, the toxic relationship.
I'll use the quotes here because defining toxic would be another call, right?
I think that there are, there are moments in Ships that are negative but if you love someone a lot because you had a lot of benefit.
11:45
So going the other direction where I like, what if it's more toxic than it is, then you would have put up with it, right?
So then, is it worth, is it worth putting up with anyone having a negative experience?
It depends on what you have to gain, right?
And the more you love someone the longer you willing to wait for another positive reinforcement.
12:01
So if I meet somebody and I have a negative experience immediately, I'm probably done, right?
Right.
If I meet someone and I have positive the next day, positive, two days later.
Positive a week later.
The next one, I might be willing to wait two weeks and then four weeks and this is really just becomes a question of human conditioning rather than love not to get, like, I love this stuff, but anyway, I can get us back to where it's, but, uh, but mirroring Layla gave me a lot of the security that I needed to make take the big risks and knowing that she had my back and Layla and I have very uncommon views on marriage.
12:32
What's the?
I guess, unique views on marriage.
You guys have so most people get married because they feel a chemical attraction.
Yes.
And then they just wait, Right.
And So eventually it's been long enough and it goes away.
Yeah.
And they're like, I guess we should get married.
We had the first date we talked for hours about business all business and at the end of the day, I said you should quit your job at work.
12:52
I was like, well, you're gonna have to eat or was this a?
And just like a casual encounter was 100%.
Yeah.
And all business all night.
The whole thing.
We walk for four hours of talk about business and the very end, I said you've got to quit your job and work for me.
13:07
She said, no, I just make it not your job.
De tarde made.
But I got a job work for me and I said, listen, even if I don't come with the deal like this needs to make sense for you.
Like this is how much I'd pay.
I was like this.
I want to pay you so much.
You'd make like, you should totally work for me and she said, no, but I kept working on her and eventually three weeks later, she quit her job and she joined, and we hung out every day after that one.
13:27
And we did not have a super chemically sexual, not at all.
We just like doing the same stuff and we both wanted the same outcome and so at least as I see it, it's like you have to have It aligned mission of what you have accomplished in life has values of how you want to get there, man.
13:45
And then, ideally, this like bonus bonus points for similar interests to.
That's so funny.
You say that because I say that, you know, from all the mistakes I've made in the previous relationships that are all my mistake.
It all comes to values, vision and lifestyle and having shared alignment does that be 100%, but it's like an alignment and values vision of Lifestyle.
14:04
Yeah, not in, you know, if you have the sexual chemistry, which we do, which is great, but not Using that as the main value.
The sexual chemicals.
Yeah, because in two five, ten years, they may not be there.
If you don't have the values of vision alive star, which you call values missions.
14:21
It's all business.
First, big mission, is that what we're trying to accomplish values?
How we're going to get there?
And then interests is like, what do we want to find out?
Exactly.
Yeah, that's so funny.
Yeah, so that's that's what I think and if you have those things you you create a relationship in my opinion.
At least, this has been my Human Experience.
14:38
It becomes very difficult to get out of Of, and I say that intentionally in that, like, the best way to stay married is to figure out how to stay married.
And so like, well, let's stack all the chips in our favor is like, we like doing the same stuff we like, talking about the same things and then I think in a very important way, if you, if those three things are aligned, you will get exposed to the same.
14:57
Stimuli, hmm.
And if you expose same stimulate a lot of the same adaptations, provided you have the same values.
So if we get this exposure and we both have the same values, will both grow in the same way, right?
Think what happens for many?
People is their opposite sides and they tracked, right?
15:13
And what happens is you get on this, you probably Esther perel everyone.
I just had a Ronald, we could go here, then I'll just go ahead now.
I feel silly my understanding of meeting activity is you've got familiarity right?
And you've got for us, a variety of the familiarity because the side and and so in the beginning, you've everything is so new and exciting.
15:34
There's all this variety, right?
And then you get to know each other and it gets better and better be like, oh my God, this is amazing.
This amazing this Amazing.
But then all of a sudden you keep going and then your siblings and your roommates right?
And so it's not like she says, you know, a problem to be solved, but a dichotomy to be managed between familiarity and variety and one of the interesting things with with our relationship is that we have so many ways to be familiar.
15:58
So for US based on that likes to need to create more variety.
Yes.
How do you guys do that?
Because you talk about all the same things.
You do.
The same thing all day long.
How do you create varieties?
Great gosh.
Besides the multiple You're not doing the multiple people to know.
16:13
We're not very bad that I think they would stem.
No, but I think the variety piece comes in through deliberate creation of room to be missed space into this.
If you think I'm going away for a week.
Yes.
And you're going to go with your friends or family and I'm not going to be there you know how much you like someone more when you see them after not seeing them for a week.
16:34
So good is not weirdest feeling right?
And that weird.
Yeah so it's like we can create that deliberately the Min so Along exactly.
And so it's like if we can like physically separate ourselves in terms of when we work, so we work on separate sides of the house, we only come together for food, so we eat and then we go back and ideally we're not on any of the same meetings because the last thing I want to do at the end of the day, sit down and say like, how's your day?
16:56
Just kidding.
I was there the whole time, right?
Right.
Yeah.
So, it's ideally any work together but you don't, yes, that they work in the same company but you're not on called along together hand in hand, right, and we can accomplish and so that way when we talk it's like to His colleagues that are both after the same thing that both believe in getting their the same way and we're talking about our unique things that are interesting for me that she wants.
17:16
You might want my perspective on and I'm like hey I'm thinking about this hooker this message or what do you think about this?
And we can bounce on it but because we didn't share every moment of the day it gives us that ability to have variety but I think Esther said this.
So yeah, but the couple set have that Deuce do start businesses together, they have a misquoting to research things anyways, couples that stay Start businesses together, have a ten percent divorce rate, if you start and make a dollar in a business together and I think it's like birthing a child except in order to do a business, I think it's harder than having kids, and people will be like, you don't know that because you don't have kids, it's true, but I do know that there's a lot of people who have both, there's more people have kids that this is there some sort of together.
18:03
And I think that there's some magic in that because it's like birthing an idea, but you both got to agree on what you're going to create.
You're not living up to biology or leaving up the choice.
Do you guys ever fight or argue?
Sure.
Like I would I would say we don't have what I would consider like real fight slow up server.
18:18
Yeah I mean my arguments but I'm sure that like the many common miscommunications that can happen as humans.
Oh sure.
Sure.
Hey you said this that did is this what you meant to say?
No, no.
There's like there's two ways to take it and one way makes you really angry the other one doesn't I meant the other way, whatever you're angry about.
18:41
What's the thing you love about her?
The most she's made of steel.
She's a playlist, just on break.
So like I'll tell you the two moments and in our marriage that like are we weren't married yet, but the tube moments that like defined her to me.
So one was in, we're probably nine months into dating women, don't have you, maybe, like, six months ended where six months in a dating and I lost everything again.
19:03
Standard standard Alex move, right?
Just lose everything and she had to go launch a gym and she had absolute Crush.
And I was so stressed out at this moment.
In time, I had the six gems.
I had a chiropractor agency, dentist agency, I had that, and I had to launch business, we're actually like flying out and doing launches.
19:20
I think I one more thing I can remember was, but those are, says, eight different businesses that I was owning.
I made no money, obviously, because I had eight businesses, right?
And I was just, I was too stressed to function.
That was the only way I could describe it as like, I was not present at all ever.
19:36
I was just thin.
I just, I was so spread that she walked In the office one day I didn't look up and she was like do you want me to be here and I was like you know whatever you want and she was like well are you you want to break up?
And I was like yeah that's fine really?
And so she said okay that's fine.
19:54
You know I'll and she'd quit her job to do this so it had been five months like you should quit everything.
You'd build up a personal training business it was done really well.
She got rid of all our clients so she come to these launches.
Wow.
Five months in ice, I was like, you know, I can't whatever.
She went to Hawaii to do this launch.
20:13
There's going to be a really big lunch, and I was betting big on this thing because so she filled working with you but not in a relationship with.
Yeah.
So we've actually like work is the thing that is our first language.
It came naturally to us.
And so she went there and I had, I think I lost all the money for the seventh reason in a row, right?
20:28
And I had like 10 grand left and we needed to make a hundred thousand dollars in that month or I was going to get behind the.
So I, it was ten Grand to get her there for 30 days and weeks.
Hotels are insane.
And as Like you, you need to crush this even though we just broke up.
Oh my gosh.
You need to crush this like, you need to crush this.
20:46
That's like, all I can say and she flew there and she said, every sales record that we had when she got there and did a hundred and something thousand in cash collected and she killed it.
And when she came back, I had a coach that I was like meeting with.
During the time, she was gone, he was like, look at the stats of your life.
21:04
He's like, are you better shape now that she's here is like re making more money now that she's here?
Are you like and to be fair like in general, I was still doing better because I had started the launch business.
Like I was, you know, I was like yeah.
He's like I think she's a very good thing in your life was like.
Okay it's only when she came back.
21:20
She crushed it.
When virtually every other person that I know would have either not gone like you.
I'm out of this or just wilted under the pressure because I put a lot of like Unitas like this is the last one.
I have like you have to crush the other.
I don't care about you.
Intimately one more.
Yeah, perfect.
And so she killed it and then she came back and then two or three.
21:39
Months later, of course, I lost all that money, again, classified.
And then, and so, then at this point now we're sleeping at her parents house, and you're not in a relationship.
No word.
So we got back together again after that.
What you came back to?
Yeah, that was like, I was like, you're awesome like used to tall when everything else was crumbling like let's keep doing this.
21:58
Yeah.
And so this leads me, probably the probably the core point of Layla is that and I don't know if that's all relationships but at least the way this one is compared to every other religion I've had is that I respect that.
First, and I don't think I had Sookie like, I don't and I say this not as any, I've Loved A lot of people in the past.
22:18
I don't think I respected them to the same degree.
And I think part of that is because it was harder for me to respect them because I didn't have a shared Arena to witness it and it would be like, maybe for me, I might not have made one of respected athlete.
Maybe maybe because it's just not a game.
I understand as well as a business game.
22:34
Sure.
Mm, maybe just saying that I can appreciate Excellence to notice but I respect At her, and her opinion mattered to me.
A lot of times I would feel like someone's opinion like like, yeah matters but like, hey, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do my opinion matters.
More her opinion.
22:49
I valued equally or even higher than mine in many occasions because I trust her gut.
She's an amazing Instinct with people, especially, and so I respected her first.
And the second time that happened was, I'm sleeping in her parents house, winter, that I am his 24. 25, 26, 27 L 26 27, she's 24.
23:10
And they gave me like the spare kids bedroom.
So I'm like in this little desk, you know?
I mean like the little chair like crept up and I'm like, this is like make-believe except it's a real business and we had this horrible day where we lost like a hundred fifty thousand dollars and it was and I just saved like everything was turning around everything was turning around for us.
23:30
We lived there just to like kind of, save some money.
Yeah.
But we the first month of getting rid of all those businesses that I had and just focusing just on demo and we did 100,000, we did 200,000 300,000 so like things.
As were turning around and I was like okay this is happening and then we got 150,000 refunds which is pretty much all the profit I made many ways because a couple of the gyms that we had launched, basically told all the customers to refund and then sign back up through them for half the price.
23:52
Oh my God, it's like I go to a gym.
That's we pay for everything.
The hotel is the flights, the marketing, the sales guy, and we let's say we saw a hundred people at 500 bucks.
We make fifty thousand dollars right?
Just for example they would say hey hundred people now that they're gone.
That's annoying.
That's messed.
24:08
It was it was a flawed model.
You remain like and I could I could lament, but I was not operating within the context of like, human and Senate, there's a huge incentive to not be ethical, right?
And so, we lost 130,000, which was all my savings again.
And I, at that moment, I had already lost everything, like, three times since I've been with it, had been like 11 months at this point.
24:28
I think that went 10 months because we got married in May and it was 13 months since we had met.
And so, I just looked at her and I'm like, in her parents, you know, room or whatever.
And I said, listen, I'm a sinking ship and if you Want to get out.
I was like, I will have absolute respect for you.
We will be like we're cool.
24:44
Like, I will hold nothing against you because I like, I clearly have not got this and that's where she was.
Like, I would sleep with you under bridge if it came to that.
And so, that was when I was before you're married, or yes, before Merit.
And so that was when and like, you know, I think the, the dedication in that book, says actually might be spoiling it.
25:05
But then I think the next book says, you saw the light in me.
It's a, it's a, it's a strong.
Ride or die.
I couldn't do this without you.
Yeah, that's right.
It's a very meaningful thing.
But I, but I don't know if I would have done it without her, you know what I mean?
And inside, it was all that to say, she stood tall when everything else was crumbling around me and for that, she has my eternal respect.
25:25
Wow.
And so as a result of that, that security knowing that she liked, even when she didn't have to, she was there and she chose to be there alongside me because she believed that we could do this, even when I read, It is belief, I think for that.
25:42
That's and that's and to be fair that was the first 11 months of our relationship easy.
And so like since we got married it's been super easy really.
Is he it has been literally nothing was harder than the first year of our relationship.
I went, I mean it's real but you know it's great.
And you what I'm assuming you want to tell yourself a marriage expert by any means.
26:00
But you've been married five years.
You've you've also know, you know, you have a lot of respect for older men who've been married for a long time.
You've sure interviewed them and Have mentors in that space.
What do you think makes a strong marriage lasts more respect or love?
26:19
I mean, you know where I'm going with this one respect because I think that respect is based in logic, love less.
So and so I'll say it, I'll say differently, I think that love has a strong, emotional component, some days.
Like some days you feel like you love someone more than it's right.
26:34
But respect doesn't change consider because it's based on facts.
Based on evidence is based on.
I the story I just told you will not change that happen, right?
And so, when emotions fade logic remains, which is why I'm a big fan of logical selling, which is when someone is trying to make a decision, I do want to give them the logical reasons for why they should do that.
26:55
Because when the emotions do Fade, which they inevitably do, about the decision that they made, what will remain is the logic and the logic will carry you through the dips.
But if you don't have a logical reason to be together, then when the emotions fade, that's when you have no.
To be together because the emotions are on and there's no logic, right?
27:13
And so I think that for the long-term relationship, that's why the mission the values in the interest, there's a lot of logical reasons for us to stay together.
We have a million logical reasons together, we're Partners in the business.
We love the same lifestyle.
We're both in the fit in it, like that.
Yeah.
And as we have all these huge stack of reasons for why we should stay together.
27:31
And I think that if we can stack the reasons and as a funny side note, with the length of marriage, the average married person spends Two hours a day together. 45 of that is watching.
Television, average marriage 3524. 24 minutes of that is housework and then 35 minutes.
27:49
Sorry 35 minutes eating hmm.
And so 45 plus 25 plus 4.
So there's like 20 minutes that's not that of the two hours.
That is just being with someone.
And so we have spent every hour of every day to get day together for six years.
And so I feel like in that way, sure that we've had a 50-year marriage, right?
28:09
Time time perspective.
But anyways just and and these where do you think you'd be without her or a marriage like hers?
That is supported you and throbbed.
You think it'd be as financially successful?
Do you think it'd be you have more time to build your businesses or you feel like you'd have scattered energy with lifestyle choices?
28:28
Don't know.
I don't know if I would have learned the lessons that she's taught me that crew like if I had.
So if I had a similar marriage to the one that I have, I think it would be the same if I If I didn't have a similar marriage to this one, I think I think I would have figured out.
28:44
The money thing was too important to me, for me, not to figure out who Fair think it.
I was too important to me as you have the discipline.
Yeah.
And and the fitness thing that was all right, that was always on Lock and so like the missing piece I still probably would have had that long in to figure out because I do because to your point, like all the people that I respect had been in 20 or 30 or 40 or 50-year marriages.
29:05
And I think there's something about character.
It speaks to someone's character.
They've done something like that.
Yeah, I think that was something that I wanted.
Yeah.
What do you think you're 32 now?
Yeah.
What do you think?
When you hit 40?
The three biggest lessons will be, that you will have learned or that you, if you could go into the future because you're really good at thinking to yourself in your 40.
29:27
Hertz self was looking at you right now or in a room with you, talking to you.
He said, here are the three things you really got to need to learn.
Yeah.
And try not to make these mistakes.
What would those three lessons?
Be the you think if you could go in the future?
Well, the first one.
It jumped out at me was patients works so that would be the first.
29:43
I think I would have continuous reinforcement on the fact that the longer I wait for things to better.
They are the second one would be Define your terms Socrates says wisdom begins with a definition of terms and so a lot of people make these goals but they don't know.
The goal means and so they're like I want to be healthy.
29:58
What does that mean going to be happy?
That mean really?
We have to Define our terms before we start trying to attack.
Ever breaking them down, which is why I like you're already in my stuff.
I attended to find terms a lot.
So I think a definition of Is is half the Define your terms and then third one of lessons that I think would probably still be because whenever I talk to my 85 roads, often Mike my therapy sessions with myself, it's always just remembering to smell the flowers more because if I'm 20 years old and are 30 years old and I would trade all the millions.
30:29
I have to be 20 again then that is the lesson.
So I would trade everything that I have when I'm 40 to be 32.
And so it's just like reminding myself and Enjoy this now the following?
Yeah, but I would trade everything to be here when I'm 40, right?
So like if I can, just if I can just even get a tenth of that awareness in the present moment, I can bring 10% of that future awareness to the present moment.
30:53
That would be a success.
Hmm, for me, can you break down really how to sell someone or how to enroll someone in your product or service?
Who has a reason why they don't want to sign up?
Yes.
So the the Baseline assumption is this person wants what you have.
31:10
And so that's why I like in the beginning of every sale, you're always asking what proper result, right?
Like why are you here?
What do you want?
And sometimes you have to like ask that question.
A lot, different ways to get someone actually answer because like, if someone says, well, I just want to find out more.
It's like they're not actually here to find out more.
They're going to be the one to solve a problem.
It's just, I'm just saying, we will probably solve it.
31:27
It's an easier way to get to the core of the matter.
And so once they admit they have a problem, then we can.
So how do you approach it?
Then we'll give you the back.
Uh, give you the back of napkin before I give you that.
Yeah, we're talking about earlier.
So, hey guys, Real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
31:46
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
32:08
The back of a napkin sales scripting process that I have is called closer.
And so it's an acronym that these are rumors or the first thing you see is clarify whether they're at a flat.
Why are you here, right?
What brought you in today, why do you respond to the ad?
Why'd you take time to take this call, whatever it is, right?
Clarify were there and keep asking to get the right answer?
32:23
If it's just information, so you're not hopping on Tony calls a day to get information right now.
Of course not.
Okay, what probably saw cool got that then L is label them with a problem, right?
So that's where you really repeating back them.
So let me just get this straight.
So you're here because you're trying to lose weight and you are, I'm going to do so at current.
32:39
Is that correct?
Awesome.
Okay.
Great that I think you're gonna like what we have.
So tell me.
So then we go to 0.
So clo closer owes overview their past experiences or past pains.
So it's like will tell me what you've done so far to try to accomplish this.
I'm assuming, that's not the first person.
You talk to them term.
This is the first moment, you realize wanted to lose weight, are you wanted to XYZ, right?
32:56
And so then we go through what I call the pain cycle which is like okay.
What did you do?
Try this and that wherever you, what was good about it, what was bad about it, great.
What else have you done?
And you go back through and each time as I can.
Each time you affirm the person, you're like, that must have been hard, appreciate you sharing that just affirming and giving them positive reinforced throughout the conversation.
33:15
And that's just building Rapport 101, right?
I understand how you feel.
I feel the same way.
I, my sister was like that too.
I totally get where you're coming from and how this difficult blah blah, right?
0s is then we saw the vacation.
So now that we've exhausted all the pain there in the thick of the pain of remembering all the times, a failure, like, you know what?
Giving everything you said.
33:31
I think you're perfect for what we have can kind of tell you about it.
So you get permission to sell, right?
And then we sell, I like to have Main points that I hid.
And I think it's good.
People remember threes very well and I know you've seen Russell stuff with webinar.
Like threes are remembered.
Well think for same thing with values in a company.
33:49
I think three people remember, it's easy to triangulate ideas, right?
And so when we sell the points, the key, a big part of this is not actually explaining the features.
This is obvious, but I like giving short anecdotes that are easy to remember.
So if I would say a word like we offer, accountability for whatever program, He's right.
34:09
And that doesn't mean anything to anyone.
So I want to give a quick story or anecdote to explain the concepts.
All right.
Well, we have, you know, three types of accountability.
We've got peer to peer accountability, which is, people are going to be walking with you shoulder to shoulder, you're going to have alumni accountability, which people have already finished, but they're just 12 weeks or 12 months ahead of you there, cheering you on from the finish line.
34:29
And then you have expert accountability of people who've helped 1000 people just like you get to where you want to go.
All right?
So there's the three levels of accountability.
If that doesn't make any sense, do you have?
Give give a kid, or were you ever a child that always gets a laugh?
They're like, haha, I was kid.
You're like, well, you were when your parents who tell you to brush your teeth, you want to brush your teeth brush my teeth, right?
34:46
Like of course, but then every night, you'd still go brush your teeth even though you moaned about it, you brush your teeth now.
Like, yeah, well, that's an example of external accountability turning into internal habit.
And so what we're going to do is we're going to be the initial parent that would tell you brush your teeth.
35:02
But we're gonna be able to transition to getting that internal combustion engine going by the end of this.
So that your brushing your own teeth, right?
Right?
You can do the same thing with the seat belt.
There's a million examples, you can use sure.
And so that would be a quick whatever that was 90 second anecdote to explain .1.
You same thing for .2 .3 that you have of like it's kind of like and then you explain a little Epiphany Bridge or the story of how you realized it's important and then they would say like that make sense.
35:24
Yes!
Boom!
You have the second Point, make sense.
Yes!
Move to the third point.
And then it's, then you go for the close, like, well given X y&z.
I will tell you.
This is extremely expensive.
The reason we say that is because it's even better than a price.
Bigger because extremely expensive for everyone is expensive.
35:42
If I said, hey Louis it, it's $500, just kidding.
It's a hundred dollars.
You might have thought 500 100 were both cheap, right?
But if I said, it's really expensive.
Whatever I say next is going to either be actually expensive for you, the train, which case I braced you which is actually more likely to close the sale or it will be less than what you perceive as expensive.
36:03
You're like oh great because the problem that most people try and do when they cells, they try to minimize that.
Thing they say next.
But actually has a counter active effect.
You say it's actually not that much.
It's only.
Yeah.
Right.
But why do you say that?
We say only that all of a sudden people expect low and then you rip their expectations until it's much better to set expectations here.
36:22
But people are afraid of doing that.
That's not how psychology works.
She said, expectations sky-high anchor and then you say reality, it either matches the braced person or it's much lower which most cases it is interesting because that really is that work for Sales to mass or is that only better with 121 sales calls having jurisdiction on webinars?
36:43
Interesting.
But one that also converts.
Well, I do know that from the infomercial world, you price a career-high.
So, it would make sense to me that he's like, I would imagine it would still work the same way.
It's like, guys are super expensive for guys.
It's not five thousand dollars and you work your way down, right?
36:58
And then when we do end up saying, hey, it's expensive.
We want to make sure that we're selling to goal.
And the point there is that some people sell program but people don't buy programs about results.
And so the He Is We want it as closely as possible.
So the outcome that someone desires and the same, it sounds obvious, but people don't do it.
37:15
You mean like a lot of these like, well, duh, but no one does, right?
And so, like in the weight loss example, I realized that people didn't want to buy memberships.
No one's like, I want to buy a membership, of course, not, they want to lose weight and so what we did was we shifted our selling style in the gyms in the fitness programs to how many pounds you need to lose.
37:30
So it's like okay cool.
You need to lose 36 based on our calculations.
It's going to take 36 weeks for us to get there and we'll take another 50% of that.
To basically, re-stabilize you getting metabolism back up and now you're eating the same amount and a lower weight.
That's a whole great.
And so now, it's going to be a 52 week program.
37:46
It's, I will tell you, it's very expensive, but it's normally, you know, whatever, $500 a week.
But instead, it's only 150 a week, interesting, fair enough.
And then when we get in the closing questions, I always prefer neutral or negative questions.
Because it's, if I said sounds amazing.
A lot of people go.
38:02
What?
It's not amazing.
But if I said fair enough.
Yeah.
Then it's much easier to get someone said.
Well, yeah, it's for Fair.
So it's like how low can I make the thing they're agreeing to and then the negative version of that which Chris boss talks about in the negotiation was a difference?
Is no base questions?
Yeah, Rachel's like that's not so bad.
38:18
Is it her right?
Or you wouldn't be opposed to moving forward, right?
Would it be totally crazy.
We move forward.
Today would be totally crazy.
We started you on Monday, like all these oils are crazy.
Okay, cool is that.
And so and then at that point, let's say, Lucy says no right to whatever they think, we're sorry.
Now we begin the key of closer which is explained away their It's so see clarify L label over either past experiences SL, which is a three anecdotes that are going to tell and then you present the price and then at that point, hopefully they say yes.
38:49
But in the world sales know is, the job knows the job.
They say, yes, then you wouldn't be necessary, right?
And so know, like selling is everything that you do before you present price closing is what you do after mmm.
39:05
And obstacles are what come up before you present price.
That's when you disagree with the prospect objections or what happened after you present price when they disagree with you.
All right.
Well, so the money I don't have the time.
I don't have, let me check with my spouse cetera and so obstacles.
39:21
You want to you want to resolve as many of those as you can before you because they become bigger scarier Monsters of objections after you present the prize, right?
And so, like, that example, I gave earlier with the information, when someone says why, I want to find a little more information that's an obstacle.
39:37
Like some was presenting the first five seconds.
They're already telling you inaudible, like, you have to confront it.
And so, a lot of people are like, well, you know, I think it's my potassium, slow right here.
Like, is it though because like, you know, there's a lot of people in Africa and none of them have stubborn body fat, right?
Right.
Because they're actually start, right?
39:53
But so, you would think that they have true starvation mode, but there, but they look like they're starving here.
So what do you think it is?
You know, I like and then you can get into it.
Most people really offended by that, but you get is an extreme example.
So once we get to that point, They say no or I have to think about so there's three circles and this took me actually really long time to think through because I've gone through a zillion different you know, books and things on sales.
40:15
Ironically after I already knew how to solve not before which is just kind of funny but different people had different like Grant had, I think decision-maker stall money.
Those are this.
He's like those are three of you always have to overcome which is like I need to think about it.
I need to talk to my spouse or its money, right?
That was those are history vary from Sage.
40:31
She has five, she has time Any time money.
Spouse fear.
Shame, interesting.
I was like, that's cool noted and then Belfort has his the three tens.
And like there's a number of different ones.
I don't think there has to be an email disagree with Melissa, who knows?
40:49
But there has to be a unifying truth here, right?
Because everybody has their own buckets, and there's obviously some elements of each of these.
And so I pulled back from Albert Ellis who is one of the fathers of CBT cognitive behavioural therapy.
He said, and originally he had like 17 and 11 9 and they had 73 reasons that people have set themselves.
41:07
He just kept boiling it down and the three that he came up with.
Are the people blame their circumstances.
They blame other people for their unhappiness and then they blame themselves.
And so, when we are confronted with an objection underneath the pretense, that the person has already admitted that they want, the thing that you have in the sing, you have would solve their problems.
41:27
So that has to be there.
If we have that, then we have to walk through three concentric rings of power.
And so the first thing that people, Will do is they blame their circumstance so they're casting their power to something else.
They're saying it's because of time or the money or the money, right?
41:43
And then you know with the money if you were selling a B2B thing, I would say well, what's the difference between a self-made billionaire?
That starts at zero and you it's not resources.
It's resourcefulness right now.
You can tell a story if you want to reinforce the point but the other day, like if you were resourceful, you can make it.
The question is, if you were to die tomorrow and you needed to come up with the amount of money for this thing, how you're not?
42:01
You figured out exactly.
So what we need to do is figure out how to tap into those.
Sources, right?
So the bubble that you go to that thing, right?
It's so each of these has their insecurities your fears, your what people say, no judging you and you just taking action and yes, risking and so underneath of circumstances I have three big buckets.
42:17
You've got time, we've got money and you've got what I call fit, which is actually an association with identity.
So, usually it might be like, why want to lose weight loss?
Because everybody understands it, I want to lose.
I don't want to lose weight, but I don't eat broccoli.
Your parent has broccoli on like, you know what, I don't like cardio though, and so that is that's where you just go through.
42:34
Like you got to change the change Ryan.
There's all scripture and yeah, it's like you can't, you cannot change any of the variables because the end of the day, like, you know, I used to have, we lost clients who would say, like, well can we make this this, the breakfast, because this is what I already am.
Like, well, that breakfast got you, that body.
So we need to change something right, correct?
Right God, she's change.
42:50
Right?
And so we walk through and like, maybe here, maybe you're not heavy enough, maybe this isn't enough pain for you, right?
And then they're like, why don't you put on 50 more pounds right now?
You'll finally make the exactly.
Yeah.
It also do another, I'm like, all right.
Well then maybe today is the day.
Yeah, right.
So time money.
Each of those has three.
43:06
So like time is 3, which I go macro micro when then which is right?
Right.
Yeah.
And then, you know money, I could go through when they're like, yeah, I'd go through too many of them.
Sure.
Sure.
But that's circumstances, right.
The next level and this is peeling back an onion.
43:22
So if you're a salesperson or selling someone and they blame money, are they blame time where they blame the fit of your specific program?
Understand that you're actually targeting someone two steps away from being in power.
Hmm, and so making the decision.
Yes.
And so, if we believe ourselves a salespeople to be coach's first, because that's what we're really in serving.
43:39
The customer, the goal of the sale is not to get the person to buy.
And this is a huge thing for most salespeople.
Everyone has to understand the goal is not to get the person to buy.
The goal is to get them to decide.
If you get someone to decide then you have already given them power more power than they ever had in a very long time.
Probably I guarantee you that you will make more money and you also disassociate success in selling from purchases.
44:00
You also get more purchases but if you do it this way, then you won't have an ego that Invested in being right?
Is not about you.
It's about them, right?
We get them to admit that it's not.
It's never been about having enough time because it's about priorities.
We all have the same 24 hours and you know what, if you're really busy.
44:16
Now, do you think you're ever gonna be busy in the future?
Well, yes, I do.
Will do you want it to be permanent?
Well, I do want to give her 12.
You're gonna be busy in the future and you're busy today, then you might as well start.
Now when you get the most support because he's already busy, right?
If you learn how to do when you're busy, you know how to do it again when you're busy in the future, that way, you'll stick with it, make sense, great times that word, right?
And so each it, that's one of the three four time, right?
44:34
You're A lot of pieces.
It's and so, the next one is other people with other people.
A lot of times it's spouse often, right?
And so, you know, I kind of walk through a process, which is, you know, or are they aware of the fact that you're struggling with this?
Yes.
44:50
Do they approve of the struggle?
Well, I don't.
I mean they're like, well, I mean, now they're not approving of the struggles.
So will the, why would they be against them that they already don't approve of right?
Well, and if the roles were reversed, would you be support and support of them?
Mmm.
And usually, they'll say yes to that.
Most times like well then why would they be against?
45:06
And if they're anything like my wife, I would do everything I possibly could to support her and I think she would do the same.
Is that the same there with you?
With your relationship?
Yes.
Or no?
Cool.
Finally, I'll walk through is like, honestly, just listen to you, you know, Tom I think I think you're asking for permission when you should be asking for support.
45:24
And the reality is look, let's play this out, right?
Let's play this out, let's say that you don't do this program, whatever it is, right?
Let's play it out and 12 months from now, you're more negative situation.
Currently.
I'm more of a weight, more, poor, whatever.
And if you keep doing that, who are you going to blame for your circuit is going to be.
45:42
You should be her so you her.
So is that fair to her?
Is that fair to your marriage down?
So I think what we need to be looking for support not permission and so what we're going to do then we stand, we towed comes up, I'm like we're going to do is you're going to take control.
We're going to take the power, you have to make the decision for you, and then she will support you.
46:00
And what we have to do is, when you show up with her like listen, I've wanted to be an entrepreneur, all my life.
Who knew that there wasn't an entrepreneur School in.
He got through the eighth are like, sure.
I just like doctors go to school but no one did it for me.
And instead of being a hundred thousand dollars is only 10,000 hours other people.
And I'm not going to moan about how not making money because I'm actually supported with other people that I'm committing, to be more present here, to be a better wife, or be a better, husband be better.
46:21
You know, spouse to her to be a better mother to our kids and you give them the script to tell the other person and that the very end you say that the end of the day, sometimes like I said, we have our three day, no sweat guarantee.
So if for some reason you go home and your husband says, listen sweetie, I want You too.
I don't want you to be healthy.
46:37
I want you to keep the extra weight on.
I want you to live 10 years shorter, I want you to pull up those sweatpants and reach your bag into this Cheetos and get them all, orange and finger and spread it over there and teach our kids, not generational help.
And if and have, you know early, diabetes.
If your husband says that's me by all means already, there we thought the whole goal is to find some some similar ground because sure, if you're in Paris, and you find out somebody This is from the same city as you, you think they're amazing.
47:07
If you're in the same city, you don't care that all their from right, right.
So it's just like, how can we find some similarities?
Because people really are persuaded more by people that they find similarities with.
Wow.
So the idea is, how can we find this?
But anyways, all that's say when you are selling first.
People will confront you with time money or fit and you have to be prepared to know that you might have two more layers you have to go through.
47:28
So you might have to peel back that first layer and then they hit you with the spouse, which is do, they approve if the roles were reversed, And then you're asking for support not permission, right?
And then you go, three day, notice will guarantee, right?
And then, the last level here is self, right?
47:44
And what people do here is the avoid, so we're trying to conquer is avoidance.
So now, here's the good news, is that when someone says, I need to think about, and I'm not sure we're talking to the decision-maker.
That's amazing.
Yes, that's if we weren't like your decision maker.
Yeah.
This is amazing.
This is great news for sales people because they should be like, oh my God, they're not giving me a money.
48:01
They're not giving me time.
They're not giving me spouse.
They're just saying, they don't need They need to think about it.
Well, what's your main concern, right?
Hmm.
Tell me what you thinking about what are the variables that you can use to make the decision.
Let's walk out together because the end of the day, you don't need time to make decisions.
48:17
You need information on the only source of information got.
So what what do you, what are your questions about, right?
And you keep going.
And then from here, all we're trying to do is understanding the variables that they use to make the decision and if they don't know them, which they usually don't we say, do you know what it, what it takes to make the decision about this and then you actually physically walk them through confronting decision.
48:35
If they're not sure about your like listen, I use this all the time is called the rocking chair close.
It's like let's be real.
You're not going to go and actually, like, sit on your rocking chair on the balcony, like King.
Am I gonna do this program?
Of course not right.
Going to get in your car and your mom's going to call your kids and you get the laundry and you got dinner and you got all these other things you got to do and then five days from now, you're going to have some moment.
48:55
We either put your pants on, you check your bank account, whatever the thing is that we're selling and you re like shoot I really should have done that and in that moment you want made the decision.
So in might as well do it today.
You have all the information you got all the momentum, has your six inches from gold, right?
And you don't want to be the guy who was like, let's think about we've already done.
49:12
I know you want to do it because you already here, right?
Yeah.
So, all the at you putting your number, you set a time, you scheduled it, you drove in your car.
If you see, or you showed up on Zoom even when you're in the middle of a work week, eat it all the stuff.
We spent an hour on the phone with me up to this point, you're this far.
And do you think that maybe the reason that you have that you're on this call today is because you have been able to pull the trigger in the past.
49:29
Mmm.
And then usually they'll come up with something like well you know what?
I try to program like this before and I feel Don't want to fail again.
Which then you go into, like burn you twice?
Which is, well, totally makes sense that I understand that.
I'm really sorry they had to go through that.
Well, did you ever date anybody in middle school or high school?
Oh yeah.
Are you married to that person?
49:45
If you are, they are then you can still see it, but it never has.
They're like, no.
I'm like imagine if you were gone, your first sixth grade boyfriend or girlfriend enacted that you swore off men or women, after that one break up, that be ridiculous.
Right?
What's the same thing here?
Because the thing is, is if you had a bad experience, you're going to let that person burn you twice.
50:02
The first time when they were with you.
And now when the preventing You from doing the things you really do need to do for preventing you from being meeting the person you need to be right.
Right.
And so don't give that situation where power that are.
He's had only let it burn you once.
Not twice, right, right.
And so then we walk through, we just have to confront the decision.
50:17
And so at the end of the day does do you believe that the product is going to get you to where you want to go the way you want to get there?
That's a second part that I learned later in sales is that some people want to lose weight but they want to lose weight their way.
Mmm.
And I'll tell ya, we learned another time.
But like, I'm sure we found that out because we would get Didn't want to sign up for membership, so we'd invite them to a free nutrition consultation and they would spend four times as much money on supplements as they would on the membership.
50:42
Because I still want to eat, or that it's still raining.
Then wait.
Yeah.
These want to lose weight their way.
Yeah.
So the first thing that we need to learn is these are the yeses that we need from them.
That's like, listen, if you don't have any decision, I'll tell you what variables are at it.
You're more than you believe the product or service that we have seen get you to where you want to go the way you want to get there.
50:57
Yes.
Okay.
Do you want to work with me or us yesterday?
Yeah.
Like yes.
Okay.
Do you know someone who has or do you have Access to the amount of money to start the program.
Yes, sir.
If it's, yes, then let's go.
We just made the decision together.
Mmm, how much better do you feel like, just like, wow, okay.
51:13
I feel like they're awesome card when you use and then boom.
So a lot of it is this the ability to get them to decide in front?
Yes, exactly.
Confronting the decision and then if someone's like still wishy-washy on it, the easiest and best questions in sales in my opinion or what are you afraid of?
If you sign up, what are you afraid of having a right?
51:29
There's my monitor.
I don't listen Larry.
Yeah, right exactly.
Well then what do you think would have to happen in order for that to happen?
Well, I don't show up, I don't do the word kind.
Yeah.
Well then what would you need to see in order to feel like that wasn't going to happen because at the end of the day, you do know you need to work out and do all the stuff that lose weight, right, right.
Okay.
51:45
So that's fixed.
So then what would you need to see from us to make sure that you feel good about taking the decision because like, you can just always just take it apart and get to the point where, like, you know what?
If someone just texted me, it's like that's part of the program.
Hmm.
Right.
Right.
This is the weekly check-in.
Yeah, totally.
And we do have that.
What do you know?
52:00
I didn't know that.
Okay, fantastic.
Let's get you because sometimes you can't mention every single feature, you possibly have with Every sale, which is one of the benefits of what I wanted.
One of the drawbacks, right?
It's like you can cater it but the same time you don't want to take the whole shrill time and I'll give you I'll give everybody the audience to really easy ones.
If you're starting your business.
Yeah.
Number one is the reason clothes, which I use all the time which is whatever reason they tell you that they don't want to do, it is the very reason you should do it.
52:20
Like I don't want to do it because like I think my, you know, my spouse is really control it.
I think the reason that you should do it is because your spouse really good drugs, you need to control of your life.
I think that I don't have time to do it.
I think that that's the very reason that you should be doing.
Is you need to get your time back, right?
Because you're trying to do this business program.
And currently, are you working all day?
52:36
They're going to say yes because everyone thinks I'm working all day.
Like you're working all day.
Okay.
Well then obviously what you're doing now isn't working, right?
So the first thing we're gonna do is cut out all the stuff that's not working and then it can have all this time to do the program.
Mmm, that's micro.
So the macro is the one I said earlier microbes, that's the second one for time, everyone in the audience.
52:56
And so with the reason close it's just whatever reason they present with just so totally understand, you know, of money.
That's the how long you want that to be an excuse of why you can't do things in life, the very reason you should be doing.
This more than anyone, right?
It's like when someone says this is a lot of money to me, right?
This is really expensive and then you would normally say, like, this is a lot to you, right?
53:13
And they say yeah, like well you know what, that's the perfect reason to do it because there's people every single day who come in here and they buy this thing in the money means nothing to them.
But the thing that makes level, yeah, I think it makes you successful is that this is a lot of money to you.
And the only reason that this will work is if you don't do the work.
53:29
Well, and if this means a lot to you, then you're more likely to be successful than anyone else here.
And so, when Say that it's true and it helps overcome that because a lot of times like I spent a lot of money early on by percentage my net worth on on skills and acquisition education, and it is scary, but it's 100%.
53:46
We need to do when you're starting out.
It's the fastest route to getting to where you want to go, is buying the lessons from people ahead of you.
And so that's the reason clothes, you can use in all those different situations and the other one is one that I'm working on.
I'm trying to figure out like a skeleton key for closing because it's something that like I just love the stuff but it's a hypothetical close.
54:03
So, whatever they present with you, get Hypothetical.
Yes.
And then you were in the new walk backwards.
So if someone's like, I'm just not sure.
You just say, well, if the programmer perfect way to do it like, well, yeah, I would do it for a perfect really cool there.
What's the difference between what we've gotten perfect, right?
And usually they can't generate many ideas.
54:19
Anyways they're like I don't know, a lot of times are like well I don't know and you're like, right?
So then it's not that.
So let's talk about what's really like worrying.
You what are you afraid of right?
And then we can then we can confront their at the real stuff, right?
The fears, the insecurities total out.
Same thing with but like you can use that for any of them.
It's like, I don't Time.
54:35
Well, if you did have time, would you do it?
Okay.
Well, how much time would so that if you did have, so they get the yes.
It's like, well, how much time do you think you need?
And then they're going to say something like did you know that it's actually one tenth of that is what you actually going to need all?
I didn't know that and we already got the yes.
So they're already committed with commitment and consistency.
There already committed to the yes, that they just said and so it's really hard that if they said cool, if you have the time to do it.
54:54
Yes, cool.
Now they gave us one problem to solve it all.
We have to do, especially if you sell Services.
Yeah, it's like cool.
That also, all I have to do is solve this one problem for you.
Because I just got you to say that's because you that also ties them down to not any other objections, right?
They still might but it's much harder for them to go back on it to a no yeah.
55:14
Now one of the things that I've heard you talk about a lot and I'll see you just share right here.
Is the is developing skills and acquiring skills over over the last decade.
That's something that I've been obsessed with, in some of the teenagers acquiring skills because I didn't feel like I was enough enough.
I wasn't smart enough talented enough those things.
55:31
So I wanted to become those things by acquiring the skills and In them.
What would you say?
Are the three main skills?
We could only learn three to reach your first million.
What would that be?
Well Teresa, I mean, the reach, the first moments, you just have to sell something to someone.
So it's just sales sales.
55:48
It's just one, you can just make a million just doing sales beginning to sell your own products.
You can just do a really hard to sell, right and in order to make more in sales you sell stuff, that's more expensive, that's it.
Like what was it?
Like learn how to sell and then find the most expensive thing you possibly can to sell and then sell that.
56:04
That's how.
Yeah, that's it.
And I will tell this to everybody who's like not sure the more expensive it is the easier to so really why is that?
Because you're dealing with better people like hey you've probably had a Consulting client.
That pays you?
50 Grand is like oh yeah by the way, I sent the wire yesterday.
Yeah.
Where's the 50 dollar persons like what exactly am I going to be getting with this program?
56:22
You know I mean it's just it's a different person, you know I mean you're dealing with a different Avatar and from an actual selling perspective almost every sales same regardless.
So you might as well just do the sales.
They're getting paid five thousand dollars for rather than sales are getting $20 for right.
I learned and the one thing that I will say is that if you're starting out with the intention to develop the skill of sales, selling the highest volume environment possible.
56:44
That's why a lot of, I think some of the best rep.
Those people are Fitness people because so many people ever, you know, you work at LA Fitness, you get 25 memberships a day that you're, I mean, you're sitting out 25 consults a day and I did that for five years, you know, for years every doubt, 20-plus consults.
56:59
Every I was an early finish up my own gym, but like so, like, where you get you, there's just so much.
His competence that you develop at that point like in those those the time and the money, like those things become so ingrained in our second major.
Yeah.
In your language patterns that and it gives you power at all, all different, areas, your life.
57:17
So sales is number one, you might want to develop the skill in a high-volume environment but understand that that's not you might make some money doing that, but the goal will then be to sell massive buildings.
Sell super expensive cars, sell yacht sell jet.
So you're I mean like so, Software packages to Enterprise software.
57:37
Like all of these are roles that you can make 400 a million dollars a year doing.
So that's, that's where, you know, you want, if you and that's a million income, not even gross, estimated income.
But if you just want to like make a million dollars, just reverse out a million dollars and just do it looking at Daily.
57:53
So it's, you know, 3300 day, whatever roughly.
And so at that point, it's like, okay.
Well, I can sell three, fifteen hundred other things, you know, and I'll be over it.
I can sell 15 thousand dollar thing.
Sure I can sell you know I mean in or you could sell 33 hundred dollar things and it's just which of those sounds easier they're different, you know?
58:10
And I will say that I have this desire maybe in the future to like look at some sort of entrepreneurial personality type or like I do believe that businesses are extension of the entrepreneur in terms of like their personality.
Their thumbprint is on it based on just how it works.
Until like I've met guys who do super high volume really low ticket transaction and they are a little different than the guys who sell ultra high ticket like service based stuff and so yeah.
58:35
And so I think and I've seen people really successful in both sides but I do think that the more expensive the ticket in general that the less operational complexity there is you still have to say, if you're going to take 10 sales calls, you might as well make them more thaw.
Exactly taken apart.
Exactly.
Right.
58:50
I have two final questions for you before I asked them, I want people to get your book.
It's really inspiring 100 million-dollar offers how to make offer.
So good people feel stupid saying, no, it's a great tagline as well.
So make sure you guys get a few copies of this.
And also go to acquisition.com, right?
59:08
Which is the main business that you're running right now acquisition not common.
So when is the right time to acquire a business, if you're a small, it depends on whether you're going for majority and minority.
That's the huge.
That's a huge lever here.
So there's the what you're trying to buy and then there's the life cycle of the business.
So it's like, if you were trying to buy a majority then you want to get it before its peak, right?
59:27
And you want to have it when it's already established, the good leadership team and you want to make sure that you can pull the entrepreneur out, it still functions, like that's how we're selling companies that we had.
That's what we do with acquisition.com companies that we actually, we by minority minority.
Yeah, exactly.
So we bought its minorities 10. 20, 30 %. 2030 is usually the is the steaks at like we when we need to be invested enough to care, and usually the companies are between 3 and I think 36 million is the is the biggest one.
59:51
So three, we don't really have any threes.
I think that's most.
We have right now.
Six but six million to 35-ish million is the it's kind of the range and we have seven companies in the portfolio.
And so for those companies, you know, we Buy them because we think they can get better.
We think that we can grow them and we think that we can put a team in place and we can transition from face spaced branding to a brand based business.
1:00:14
So that it is sellable.
And then what happens is interesting there is that we might triple the revenue the business but we might 30X the Enterprise Value because it's not valuable.
If you're just, you know, Johnny Johnny teacher or whatever, which we do mostly internet businesses, because we know how to transition from being the personality brand, who teaches some sort of Niche skill, like we talked about earlier in Teaching the same thing but being like Salon University or being plumber you or Jim launch, you know, like those are all like very specific Niche skills.
1:00:43
That provide real value, that's just two people.
So we're almost the entire portfolio for one is e-learning and that's because we're huge education people.
I like the business.
I also like the impact, the margins.
Yeah, I love the cash flow.
It's a low capex business.
It's very inflation responsive.
1:00:59
And that, like, we can always adjust prices very easily.
It has, there's, there's real impact on people's lives compared.
To like a four-year degree, you've got a great price acre and alternative and I think the education my thesis is that education is becoming increasingly fragmented just like media has and it's just catching up.
The fact that all of these quote, gurus exist is a Telltale sign that more and more people are not going to college because they don't see the value.
1:01:19
And I think they're right in that and that assessment.
And so rather than spend a hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollars over four years or 50,000 dollars were four years.
You could spend a quarter of that I'm getting way more.
Yeah, way more tactical training that can replace your entire income.
And so In terms of price, we look for companies that are growing their cash flow positive that are typically e-learning or Internet businesses that have, that have really good products.
1:01:42
So ideally, somebody who really knows, who is good at the thing that they teach, which sounds silly.
But sure.
You also know that there's lots of people who don't have that and if we have those things, we own average triple the prophet the business within a year anyhow.
So we're very like when we have the when we have are very narrowly defined Avatar which doing three million or more.
1:01:59
So 250 a month or higher that's just to be considered.
Usually there at like the usually like a million a month, 500 thousand a month is usually we take them on that's that's our sweet spot and then we can bargain ramp up and then with regards to majority kind of goes back to like I personally I think long term we're going to try and figure out a way to maybe raise a fund, so I can help all of the founders.
1:02:20
Take some cash on the table and maybe do some sort of conglomeration thing because they'll be learning, which would be cool.
Or, you know, we might have them sell off individually.
It's from the book.
It's really up to the founder because we're in, this is kind of cool for me because like I'm really just there to support Them.
And we recruit the key players for them.
1:02:37
And because we have the reputation we have, we have so much more recent leverage.
We can find the people that will help them so much easier than they can.
And so, that's how we can build these things into Enterprise so quickly and we can get outsized returns.
And so that's that's what we do.
That's cool and you guys teach also how people can acquire a company on your site as well.
1:02:55
We don't know the the courses on the site correspond with the books.
So the book has a free course that comes with it.
It's on the site.
You can go through it as all the downloads everything.
The book, The e-book is 99 cents on Kindle.
The up.
I think it has its it has 5,000 I think five star reviews on Amazon.
1:03:11
Who's counting?
Yeah.
Who's gonna die.
And so but it's not here.
It's I wanted to make a pretty one.
I think that the hard copies a little more.
Yeah.
But you know I wanted to I was like I've got people from like Nigeria and in here and be like I could afford this thing somewhere.
So that's and I know they're probably never going to come back with their stock.
1:03:28
Oh, right, right, right.
Yeah.
If you're a US based company in your e-learning, we're always happy to see how we can.
We'll have to have you.
Come on?
Another time if you guys wanted to come back on to talk about how to acquire a smaller company and teach that process, if you're interested in learning that.
But acquisition.com, Alex were moseyed on Instagram Twitter and YouTube and YouTube is blown up your Facebook as well.
1:03:52
But you're doing what daily almost daily YouTube.
Now, you shorts shorts a towards, yeah.
We just shorts daily on Instagram, Tick-Tock.
YouTube or on Twitter, we have a podcast that's actually Grown a lot.

Yes, make sure you follow you everywhere.
Why would all linked up?
This is a question asked, have one of the and called the three truths.
Imagine it is your last day and maybe you've surpassed 85 maybe 100 120 or something extended the life.
As long as you can and you lived your life, you've accomplished the things you want to even though they don't matter anymore.
1:04:47
You've made all the money but you've given it all the way because it doesn't matter anymore and no one has access to your content or information for whatever reason, it goes with you.
Everything the books, the videos.
All this stuff goes with you.
This interviewed gone and you can only Share three things with the world.
1:05:04
Old three lessons that you've learned from your entire life.
Yeah what would be those three lessons or three truths that you would share give first and without expectation you'll get more than you can imagine in all aspects of life one.
If you can't do it forever, don't do it for a day and probably something to the extent of if nothing matters.
1:05:24
Then you get to decide what matters so use the power wisely.
Hmm, let's go, man.
I don't acknowledge you, Alex for your growth and your and your ego death.
And the cotton, the constant Journey, I'm dead.
Yes I do.
I'm sure I could, you know, I'm on the same journey and it's but your acknowledgement of it.
1:05:42
Your ability to look yourself in the mirror and see.
Okay, here's what's working, what's not working and how do I continue to develop that?
And now you're this stage, we're really feels like you're trying to create as much value as possible to as many people as possible.
Yeah, through your books, your content, and your information.
1:05:57
So I really acknowledge you for the example you're creating for your you're really uniqueness.
You're being Person who you are.
I mean here in like the base man with your wife, beater worth like just like you don't care necessarily about what you look or whatever you know you just want to add the value and not think about what are people saying about me?
1:06:16
But how can I make it about others?
Should think is really inspiring example that you're leading from?
So I want to acknowledge you for that man.
And hopefully, we'll have you back on four more times.
But final question, what's your definition of greatness reality exceeds expectations?
1:06:31
I mean, Alex like, good stuff.
Person who you are.
I mean here in like the base man with your wife, beater worth like just like you don't care necessarily about what you look or whatever you know you just want to add the value and not think about what are people saying about me?
But how can I make it about others?
Should think is really inspiring example that you're leading from?
So I want to acknowledge you for that man.
And hopefully, we'll have you back on four more times.
But final question, what's your definition of greatness reality exceeds expectations?
I mean, Alex like, good stuff.








0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, what you start with is not what you're going to end with but it will give you the stepping stones that are necessary to get to the higher leverage opportunity in my opinion.
One of the bigger mistakes people make is they try and go to the big leagues before they're ready.
Eddie and then they fall flat, welcome to the game, where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:37
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and Buffett had documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
By far.
The most frequent question, I get asked, is when should I start my side hustle?
And when should I quit my job?
0:53
Once I have started my side hustle and if you thought any of my content, you might think that I am against side hustles in general, and I'm not, but there's constraints that I put around that and I want to explain how in my opinion.
You can tackle that the best to maximize your opportunity for income in life.
All right, so first things first, I'm going to define a side hustle as a main hustle that has not gained enough size to support you financially.
1:15
All right?
This is an important delineation because if you just try to make side money then to me, that's a distraction from what your real main hustle is, which is probably your career.
And so, first things first, if you have a career or you have a job, then I'm a big advocate of the reason you should have this job is because you're trying to learn and earn and depending on where you're at in your life cycle of Entrepreneurship or want to be entrepreneurship, it should be probably geared more towards learning than earning, especially in the first decade.
1:46
Now, once you have some of those learnings, if you don't want to continue down this path of maybe being number 17 at Google, you know, to use that kind of analogy and maybe getting into a startup with a deep skill set, getting some equity, and having a big upside, if you don't want to pursue that path and you want to just make your own money, then you take the skills you have and you have to make your side hustle, really, your main hustle.
2:11
And so what happens is you have to shift your perspectives from, I'm going to do my job, too.
Meet the requirements that I have to continue to be gainfully employed and over deliver on what is expected of me in my role.
The remaining hours of the day, I Am shifting. 100% of my focus to my new thing and if you're like, well what about my marriage?
2:29
What about my kids something's got to give and I'm a big believer in Seasons which is sometimes you have to have a season of sacrifice.
Sometimes you have to see have the season of sowing in order to have a season of reaping later.
And so maybe that means 12 months or 24 months.
2:46
Sacrificing some time with the kids and wife and pop.
You're going to hate me for this, but like, you know what, there's only so many hours.
If you've got to work eight for your job, there's only other hours in the day and they got to come from somewhere.
All right?
What I would say is try and maximize time, you're gonna have their kids and be present for them, so that when you are there, you're not, you know, scrolling on your phone and not actually present with them.
3:04
Now you have another eight hours a day that you're probably awake that you can do full-time side, hustle work.
And my objective here is to number one first, secure your family financially, which Is live underneath of your means with just the income from your job, your side hustle will also hopefully start making some income, you can also bank that money to or that money goes back into adding more people or whatever you need to do to get that thing off the ground.
3:31
Once I have a certain amount of savings for me would be like, six months of living is what I would feel comfortable with before starting my next thing and it's exactly what I had.
When I started my gym, I'd say fifty thousand dollars and for me I lived on less than that I was like 20-something months of savings for me okay?
You might have family that might be Be less for you.
3:47
Just do the math on your own for me.
The next step is that I need my side.
Hustle to at least match my income from my current role.
Now, is there an exception of that?
If, for some reason, you're only able to work on your side, main hustle for hours a week, and you're doing half of your income is you're doing in your 40.
4:06
Then I would look at that.
Race should be like, well, in four hours, I'm making half of what I make in 40 if I had the other 36 hours back to add to my for, would I be able to match that if you can use?
You can say yes then I would say I'd feel comfortable making the jump, but if you want to be safe, which many people were trying to make this jump, which is just so, you know, the single hardest jump in all of Entrepreneurship is going from the safest thing which is a job to being 100% eating what you kill.
4:31
It was the hardest decision I've ever made in my life.
Entrepreneurially, some people are really easy for it.
It was not easy for me.
Still the hardest Choice I've made, so I want to Stack as many things in my favor to make that the lowest risk possible.
One, I have all my savings.
I've got breathing room to I've already matched my income for My current thing with the new thing three and this is probably something you might not have thought of is that I want to sustain that level of income for six months.
4:55
All right.
This is like, orders of risk.
You have the savings, you've match your current income.
You're living below.
Just one income, which means your banking 3/4, what your pet you're getting paid, probably, and then three is that you've shown that?
It's reliable because if you just the first month, you mash your income.
You quit.
5:11
And then the next month you drop back down to zero or one quarter because you're doing gig work or whatever.
That's going to be really.
So it's going to affect the work you do, it's going to affect how you sell and honestly it's gonna affect every other aspect your life.
And so I would want to see consistency.
So if I've done this thing so it took me six months to save my stuff and it took me six months to get reliability of my income to match and stay at that level.
5:31
Then for me, I would say it's a reasonable jump for you to go out and do that thing now.
For me, what side hustle do you pick?
I want the side.
Hustle to be something that I have a high likelihood of success with, which is something that I have some sort of experience.
5:47
With one of the easiest things to do is take whatever you're doing in your current role and start doing that as a contractor. 1099 etcetera.
Do those companies have the most Enterprise Value?
No.
But you can make some money and learn some basic skills and business that you would have no other opportunity to learn, you learn how to hire people, you learn how to fire people, learn how to have hard conversations, learn how to drive initiative, you learn how to Market, you learn how to sell to get new business, you learn how to contract it invoice.
6:10
You learn how to process payments.
You learn how to set up an LLC.
There's lots of things that you have to learn just going 0 to 1.
Now, if you have a longer time Horizon do that you'll figure those out as you go.
But I would say that you don't need to be perfect on the first pick, you just need to be directionally correct.
In the first direction is I'm going to be an entrepreneur.
6:28
So, if you make the first jump, you've already taken the biggest, jump in the right direction of what you ultimately want to do.
It is very, very, very rare that long-term entrepreneurs.
First business is their last business.
Look at every single person that you aspire to and look up to in the business world with the exception of Zuck and besos.
6:47
And the thing that they started is not the thing.
That was their biggest thing, right?
And your Salah had some direct response like brick and mortar store thing and he was like painting painting lanes and parking lots right?
I think Ed my life was like selling Insurance stuff like I was doing personal training online like there's what you start with.
7:07
Is not what you're going to end with but it will give you the stepping stones that are necessary to get to the higher leverage opportunity in my opinion.
One of the bigger mistakes people make is they try and go to the big leagues before they're ready and then they fall flat.
Be willing to do the basics because realistically, I'm probably not basis.
7:23
I probably not Zuckerberg and you might not be either, and that's ok.
And so you don't necessarily need to model their path.
You can model one that decreases the risk because besos had a Wall Street Finance job at a hedge fund.
He didn't need to worry about money if you quit, you could.
Right back to the hedge fund and make probably a million dollars.
7:40
A year, Zach was a Harvard grad, drop out, whatever he could get a job if it failed at any top tech company immediately and if you don't have those prospects need to be a little in my opinion a little bit more respectful of the risk that you're taking on.
And so if I were going to walk through the transition of being in a job and then deciding to go all in on my side, hustle, that would be my three-step process save six months of living expenses by living under.
8:05
My means while I had my job.
I would start making money on my side hustle and I would make it until I matched, my current level of income of my job.
And then step three is that I was just staying that level of income for six months before being willing to quit my job and during that process be continuing to stack savings.
8:23
So that if something happened, I could weather the storm A most addition quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
8:41
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And if you're a kid and you can live at home or you can live with four buddies, do that, and if it means that your living expenses are miniscule, cool.
8:57
And if it means that, if you can get your living expenses to be so little, that you can cover it with part-time work, like if you can bounce it a club on the weekends for two days and you get the other five days back.
I think that's a net win.
But the biggest part of this is like how much overhead do I have to cover my life that I'm burning hours on the thing.
9:14
I don't want to do long-term to do the thing.
I do want to do long term, so it's Like massively cut your overhead so that you get as much of your time back to invest in the thing that you want to do most, which I categorize entrepreneurship rather than the side hustle, because that'll change, but the directional decision go out on your own wall.
9:31
And so, for each of these phases, phase one, I see 50 Grand from my consulting job, over two years, living far under my means only making fifty thousand a year during that period of time in order to have a safety nut to make the next step.
The second thing is that when I started my side hustle, I actually started a charity project.
9:47
Act where I got all my friends to pay me 200 bucks a month to do, their Fitness and Nutrition programming from home.
And I donated all the money they gave me was about four thousand dollars a month at one point when I decided to transition to, the my main house which is just going to be Fitness.
I didn't even start my gym yet, but it was enough that I could live.
10:04
I just said, hey, would you guys mind paying me instead of the charity?
All of them said it was fine and I transform four thousand dollars a month, the charity to four thousand dollars a month of income and that's how he's able to quit my 50,000.
All your job for 50,000 dollar your online business, This was like 2013, so it was before online businesses were call and that's what actually give me my living expenses when I started at my gym because I was like, well, I didn't even think online businesses were legit.
10:29
I was like, I'm just getting PayPal to texting people programs, but maybe I should have done more of that.
But then when I started my gym, that's actually what I used to eat off of while.
I was reinvesting stuff into hiring more people, buying more equipment, things like that, that I couldn't afford the beginning.
And so the phase 3, there is that I had seen that they had sustained the level of Jeans for a six-month period.
10:49
And then when I asked them to go to for payment, that was my big risk and they said yes.
And so then I felt confident that I stay in this level of income from my side hustle for an extended period of time and that ultimately gave me the confidence to jump into the new thing.
And to be fair, I actually move locations during that period of time and dramatically cut my over it.
11:08
So like I was saving really aggressively but when I wasn't sure that the money was going to come in my rent was first zero because it was just the gym.
But before that That just when I got to California, I just rented a bedroom from a guy that I met at the gym for 400 bucks a month.
11:24
And so like, you can live super cheap and he wanted me to live there because he wanted to get fit.
And so he gave me that discount.
And that's, I mean, use what you got, right?
And so I would meal prep every Sunday with him and so he got a little bit of value from that, which I got to have a discounted payment and sometimes he tripping on groceries for my food, like, and maintain my relation with that guy, for a decade now.
11:46
And so like you can't In those early people who help you out like I think it's always worth remembering them.
And so for my first phase of saving up I see fifty thousand dollars making fifty thousand dollars a year over two years which means I was living on like a third of what I could possibly live on at that time because I want to save up this, not to go all in on the thing I wanted to do.
12:04
The second phase was when I wanted to match my current income.
That's when I started an online business and I got 20 of my friends to pay me 200 bucks a month each so that I can make four thousand dollars a month and that took a long time to get there.
But as soon as I did that I had A new level of income that matched.
12:19
My current level of income.
Now, I didn't know how sustainable that was.
And so, it took me six months before I said, hey, would you guys mind paying me instead of this charity?
Which is phase three, which is that I had sustained that level of income, that matched my income of my job to make the transition to fully go into fitness as my main hustle.
12:35
So, that was step one, two, and three for me personally,








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll and if you don't have high quality data, then you will have poor decisions and you will not like the life that you end up leading.
0:22
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
If you're an entrepreneur or then you need to be able to make decisions in order to make good decisions, you need to have high quality data and if you don't have high quality data, then you will have poor decisions and you will not like the life that you end up leading.
0:46
And so one of the important skills are attributes that I believe successful entrepreneurs have is an understanding the basic equations of business.
And so what I want to share with you today are probably two of the most use equations that I use when talking the portfolio companies that we have when analyzing decisions about what we need to do with the business, where are bottlenecks.
1:04
Our Etc.
All right.
And so, I also think that understanding the equations will make you a better business owner, because you'll understand the things that move the levers within, how much money you're going to make in a business.
And so, if you understand that, these are the most important important levers in the business, then you'll be more prudent in terms of when you make decisions around them.
1:22
All right?
So there's the fundamental equation that I like.
As a simple understanding of business, which is just Number of new sales or sales velocity right number new sales.
So this equation has three variables in it. 1 is the number of new sales per month, which most people know the second is, the lifetime gross profit per customer, which most people have no idea.
1:46
And then the third is hypothetical Max Revenue, which most people also have no idea about.
And so then if this is the equation that I want to get to, right, because from here, I can tell business is growing or shrinking because let's say your hypothetical, Max revenues, a million dollars a month and you're doing 1.5 Right now.
Well, it means that at your current sales velocity and current lifetime gross profit, you're actually to be shrinking, right?
2:05
So, I got, that's probably a company that I don't want to deal with are going to know that there's a problem, right?
The flip side is if you have a company has a million dollars a month and they're currently doing five hundred thousand dollars a month and I know that they're going to be growing and then they will cap in a million.
So I know that this thing.
If we change, nothing will double right?
The third scenario which is actually probably the most common is when people or business owners have their at equilibrium.
2:27
So, they're pretty much maintaining the same Sales month over month over month.
And the revenue has remained more or less unchanged.
That's actually pretty beautiful, because there's other stats, you can pull from that with very high degrees of certainty.
The longer they've been maintaining that period of time and so then you can actually make really good extrapolations about the future, all right?
2:45
And so that is equation number one, which I would just how like fundamental to doing business.
You have to know how much money you're going to be making.
And how many of those things are going to sell, okay?
Now the second is, is how do we actually figure out what the lifetime gross profit is per customer.
All right, so you've got price times margin /.
3:02
Turn the alternative to this.
This is in, recurring based businesses, the alternative to this is simply price margin price, times margin X number of purchases.
So it's like, if you sell a hundred dollar widget and the average person buys, you know, three of them and you make a 50% margin, then it's 50 times 50.
3:22
So 50 plus 50 plus 50, which is 50 times 3, and so your lifetime gross profit for customers. 150 bucks.
The reason that, that is so important.
If you know that it costs you $10 to acquire customer, then you have a 15 to 1 LT Vedic ratio which is awesome, right?
Which is high-five keep going, keep doing more of that thing.
3:40
But a lot of times people don't know these numbers are it.
So then they can make decisions.
They're like, should we increase our marketing?
Spencer, we do more reach out to these numbers.
Good.
Right.
Because people won't understand like is this good or bad, right?
Which is kind of funny because you want to have wait for someone else's judgment on whether or not a number is good or bad, but anyways, we'll get beyond that.
So when I know this right when I'm dealing with a company that doesn't know, you know what their numbers are.
3:59
Our I will walk through these two equations with them, so let's walk through one together.
All right, I actually had a recent conversation with a company that had a service-based business.
They were marketing agency of sorts.
Cool.
Cool.
Little niche.
And so they were selling thousand dollars a month service, it cost them a hundred dollars a month, right in cost.
4:22
So there's price, they're selling 120 new units per month, they had 40.
So these are the numbers that that we knew.
Right.
That they knew as of right now.
And so from these numbers we are able to learn a lot about the business, right?
So one of these is that they have 90% gross margins right?
4:43
Based on their new units per month, right?
We know that we can go 120 divided by churn but we don't have the turn percentage, but we do because 50 over 380 is your turn percentage, which I'm guessing is me like 13 or something like that.
5:00
See here is 13 13.1%, right?
So I'm going to divide this by Point 1 3, which is going to give me my hypothetical Max ready?
This is how business really works.
My friends was a nation, most people don't want to do this math but this is why most people don't make money.
5:18
All right, so 923 is the max amount of clients that they're going to be able to have at this current juncture.
So if nothing changed about the business, they're it stays the same.
The number of new customer stays the same.
That's where they're going to keep out, which means that this business will do nine hundred and twenty three thousand dollars per month, right?
5:38
That's where that's where it will max out, right?
Cool.
Nothing wrong with that and they have 90 percent gross margins.
Right now there's obviously other costs that have to go into doing the business but they probably run this at.
I probably have 40 to 50 percent net margin.
Because if you're running 90, you can probably cover that, right?
5:54
It's a good business, six, twenty bucks here, good business, right?
And so the idea here is if they're currently because remember we know their current is there, currently at 380,000 because we have 380 active customers per month, then this business is going to be a fast growing business, right?
6:12
I mean think about their to 120 right now and their turn is 13%.
They're going to be they're going to jump to, you know, 500 next month.
And and mean it's going to, they're going to, they're going to jump, pretty quickly.
You're right.
But what it'll do because of the churn is to turn will start evening out their growth, right?
Because This point right here is the point of equilibrium.
6:30
It means that the number of new sales they make compared to the number of people that exit the business are the same.
So I'm going to actually spell it out that I think might be useful most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
6:48
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help.
You get there?
So I said, 923 is the max, right?
That this thing can do.
7:03
Why is that?
Well, we said the churn was 13%, right?
So times point, one three?
Right?
Is going to be equivalent to do to 120.
All right, now if 923 is equal to 120 which is the number of new sales, that it means you're gonna have 120 new sales every month and you're also going to be losing 120 every month, which means zero growth.
7:29
All right, that is A point of equilibrium, the reason equilibrium point so important is that that's where we know we can we like that's where we're going to level out again.
We have to find a new channel for growth right now.
Right now, if you're a business is plateauing, then you can make you can make these assumptions.
And you can do this math about your business.
I'll people like, I don't know what my LTV is, right, and I'll give you a simple, a simple, another example of something like that of a business in equilibrium.
7:51
So let's say, you've got a business is doing a hundred thousand dollars a month, right hundred thousand dollars a month.
Let's say, you know, price point is, I'll use Numbers here again.
So let's say it's a thousand bucks a month, right?
For the services.
All right, which means that they have 100 customers simple business so far, right.
8:07
So now the question is just going to be sales, velocity intern.
So let's say that they've got 10% turn and they've get and they get tenure customers per month, right?
And the thing is, a lot of people don't know this number, right?
Which is silly to me, but a lot of people don't know the number but the thing is is if you are in equilibrium and they're getting 10 new customers a month, then I can tell you that yearns 10% I don't need to I don't need them to calculate it for Me, I don't like.
8:30
So you haven't grown for six months?
Yes, let's average out the number of sales that you get month over month over the last six months and they'll tell me, it's been, you know, around 10 like okay, well if you have 100 current right?
And your outflow is 10 and you haven't grown.
8:46
Alright, so your inflow is 10 and you haven't grown.
That means real flow is 10 and then it's simply 10 over 100.
It's 10% that's the game, right?
And so now you're like well why do I want to do all that stuff?
Well now we know what the LTV is because again they're probably not going to That number is.
So we say okay, well thousand dollars member dueduedue times our margin percentage, right?
9:07
I didn't put the margin in here.
Let's just say it's 80%, right times 80% and we divide it by churn, which is 10%, right?
Which means that we're going to make eight thousand dollars per customer.
All right, and gross profit.
The reason this is important is they might be like, I don't know how to grow them.
9:23
Like we're making a grand per customer.
How much is it costing you to acquire a customer?
And this is this is where it gets funky, ah, people like well it costs about a thousand bucks to acquire customer migrate.
Why don't we do 10 times more of that?
And sometimes, it's really that simple.
It's like I just, we never saw like that.
9:38
I'm like, right?
You're spending 1,000 to make eight.
Let's play that game as many times as we possibly, possibly can't write.
And it's like, well, we can't do.
We've maxed out this channel.
It's like okay, well we have eight thousand dollars to work with in order to acquire customers, right?
But let's be real for a second.
You don't want to run a non-profit even though a lot of people do Do, but if you're in the game to make money, right?
9:59
Then this eight thousand dollars, right?
Realistically, in order to have a sustainable business, you need to have a 321 or higher, right?
It's called LTV to CAC ratio, all right?
And so for me, I personally really don't look at businesses that have less than this time to one, and that's just a choice, you can do that.
10:20
But there's tons of research studies that have figured this out, especially in the software World.
A lot of things are quantity, Quantified or quantity.
As to whatever you want to say here, right?
Is that 321 LTV to calculate your or greater is what is necessary for growth?
All right, and a lot of this also has to do with cash flow.
10:35
So, imagine for a second that you had a ten dollar per month thing, right?
Okay.
And let's say you had someone and, you know, they're going to stay for 10 years, something super long.
Right. 10 years.
That's a, that's a, that's a very long LTV, but the total lifetime value of a customer like this.
10:52
Very 10 years is 120 months is going to be twelve hundred.
X, right?
And let's just assume it's a digital product.
So that there's, you know, almost virtually all grow smart, right?
Well, the thing is, you might have a 321.
So, let's say, cost somebody, you know, let's say cost you 200 bucks, right?
11:08
To acquire this you're like, whew, going to be rich, right?
But the thing is, is $200, is 18 months or 20 months, rather, excuse me is 20 months.
It's going to take you 20 months to recoup off of your $10 per month, right?
And so your cash flow is going to be horrible, right?
11:25
Even The business fundamentally is good and that's why people raise Capital they take outside investors all kind of stuff.
Right?
But the game is then figuring out which this is actually the topic of my third book that will come out probably in a year or so it's called money models.
Which is how can we figure out a way to make money getting this customer?
11:42
How can you figure out a way that we can?
We can do a little bit of, you know, money Kung Fu and figure out a way to either decrease the cost of acquisition, right?
If we can get this from 200 to let's say, 50, right?
It's like, okay, well now I got five.
It's like okay can we can we put some sort of like you know by by three months up front you know or by five months up front by your first your first year is half off, right?
12:06
If we know they're going to stick.
So if we did first year at 50% off, right, then we're going to have $60 right there were going to make up front, right?
And we know that it's going to cost us 50 dollars to make the $60.
So we actually have plus 10 in cash flow for the business within on the first train.
12:25
Action.
And then we can keep spending our money around and we just know that 12 months from now.
This guy's going to start recurring at $10 per month, right?
And then we're good to go but this way we casual the acquisition.
And so that's the kind of little stuff that I think.
It's just sometimes it takes experience having done this.
12:42
A lot of times to know, but anywho this is definitely a more in the, in the, in the trenches, how we look at businesses that were looking to acquire percentages of in, in the portfolio.
These are the two fundamental equations.
You have to know, Like, the back of your hand, to do, right?
12:58
You have to know this one.
And you have to know how to calculate L TV.
If you have those two equations, you can pretty much learn everything you need to know about a business on the back of the napkin.
Alright, so I hope you found this valuable, you keep being awesome, 0 Z Nation, a lot of people are broke.
I don't want you to work on that.
So I made this click, subscribe, if you dig it, don't click.
13:15
If you don't either way.
I love you.
Bye.

13 lessons.
I learned after graduating college from The Real World that I wish I had learned earlier.
The first is that you make better decisions and you learn more by assuming that you're dumber than everyone else.
The reason this was something that took me a long time to learn, is that when I was in college, it was all about showing how smart you are.
0:15
It was about talking more in the group meetings about raising your hand more in the classroom, I took that and started translating in the real world and I realized that I didn't learn very much because I was the one talking all the time and it only took a few times of me getting introduced to some Buddy, someone would introduce us, and I would basically spend the whole time blabbering on about how great I was and how much I knew only to find out later that this person was way above me in business, and whatever things that I was pursuing at the time.
0:41
And then I felt tons of Shame and embarrassment about how stupid I was for doing that.
I had to shift the way that I talk to new people and the way that I answered rooms and I'll be real.
I still talk probably too much but at least being aware of that lesson as early as it could.
I wish I had learned it earlier, fundamentally you can't learn if you're talking it.
0:58
So, if you're trying to learn then not Talking is the first requisite for doing that, and if you want to make better decisions than you need to learn, this was a big Epiphany.
I had, I got introduced once to somebody.
I was walking peripherally after I had left and somebody else went up to them and was like, do you know who that guy is?
1:13
And in that moment I realized that my positioning was now Sky High because I didn't have to be the one to say it.
The idea that I realized was how can I get other people to edify me?
Because what I had to allow people to do was to make the same mistake that I used to make which is that someone young someone in Perience.
1:30
Someone less aware whatever would come up and then start posturing themselves and blathering on about everything that they're doing.
And me, I might be way ahead of them but I would listen and see if there's anything interesting.
And so on that conversation, I learned more than they did.
I learned what type of person they are?
I learned where they're at with their career.
1:46
If they had anything interesting, that would be worth following up.
They learned nothing.
They felt good about themselves and then later would feel bad about themselves when that other person went over and told them.
And so I was like of these two scenarios which would I rather do but I rather have someone have Conversation with me and then not know who I was but be able to learn is that's that's the worst case scenario or would I rather blather on learn nothing either I am above them and then they're like well fuck that guy.
2:12
He brags or on below them and I'm the moron.
So I stopped doing that so that was lesson.
Number one lesson number two with it, the hardest respect to earn is one's own.
What I realized this was something that was really hard for me is that I had a pretty bad reputation the very beginning of my college career at all of my high school career and it was because I drank too much, I was irresponsible, I was slept around a lot and And I wasn't representing the type person that I wanted to be.
2:32
And so I felt ashamed of the behaviors that I did, but I didn't change them.
And so it was only through a conversation.
I had with my father, where I said, how do I change my reputation?
How do I get these people to stop saying this stuff?
And I thought there was some, like, PR marketing angle that I could take that I could control the narrative.
He said, why don't you stop being a piece of shit?
2:48
And he said that in his own in his own words and I was like that, can't be it.
I'll figure out a way when parents talk to kids, they're listening.
But they're not listening that really stuck with me to start thinking about it.
And I said, like, well, if I wanted to be somebody who's respectable, what I do, So that I try to start acting in that way.
To be someone whose respect my own, I would earn.
3:04
And so, when I started doing that, nothing changed externally people still treated me like I was a piece of shit and they were probably, right?
But my behavior began to change and then slowly.
So did my reputation but it started with me trying to respect myself first and then others.
Begin to respect me as a result.
3:20
If you want to control people, think control what they say.
This is the third lesson I learned and this is more of a business / marketing lesson, but if you want to talk about products and services, you have to equip It people with the words to describe what you have because otherwise you're asking them to solve the problem of how to describe your business.
3:36
And if right now, you can't even figure out how you're going to describe your business and you own the darn thing.
How do you expect them to do it and have sex when they're telling their friends?
And so this is really about equipping people with simple language, so they can communicate what you do.
So, for example, at acquisition not calm the mission when I started the business was to document and share the best practices building world-class companies.
3:52
Most people don't know what that means.
And so I have now and we probably will shift the language to make real business education available to everyone.
They functionally mean the same thing.
But giving people the words to describe it in a way that they understand, allows me to give them more so they can explain to somebody else.
You get more out of reading one book, that's great five times.
4:10
Then out of reading five mediocre books, I don't read many books.
And what I mean by that is I buy lots of books.
I skim most of them and quickly realized that it's not worth reading.
And so then I toss them aside because just because someone wrote a book, doesn't mean you need to finish, it has nothing to do with.
You means that they didn't organize it.
Well I have found that books that are older in general tend to be better because the reason the person wrote it was a different intention.
4:29
They wrote Because they wanted to transmit knowledge to the Next Generation.
Whereas people who write books.
Now either writing for money writing for notoriety or running them to sell or the ship.
If you find books for the author is actually writing because they want to convey knowledge to the Next Generation.
Those tend to be better books in my experience because the intent is to actually teach not to persuade slight difference.
4:46
When you do find those gems, I have realized that if I read something once and to end, I still don't know yet.
I will read a book two times three times, four times, five times until I can teach the book when I feel like it is worth learning.
And then once I have like, He's the book for everything that it has to the point where I can convey the message to somebody else.
5:03
Like I can teach the concepts of the book, which is something I've done many times.
Roxy, make a presentation on the book so that I can wrap my own Frameworks around how I can remember it.
That's where a lot of these Farmers come from, is because it's me trying to make sense of the world.
In a way that I can remember, if your behavior doesn't change as a result of reading a book and it means you learn nothing, which means it was a waste of time.
5:20
And many people who read books are just wasting their time, because their behavior doesn't change.
And so I consolidate what I find something, that's good.
I plug everything I possibly can into it and suck the juice out of it so that I I can change my behavior as a result which comes from the Frameworks and how I think about it.
How deeply do you understand the knowledge of the book?
There's a handful of books that if you just did them for the rest of your life you Flynn because if you just did how to make friends and influence people and you put it into your DNA, you would be successful.
5:42
Number five, is that most Champions do not have something that you do not.
They lack something that you have.
It's a different thought process.
Because if all of us have the exact same hours per day, it means that they're allocating their time differently.
Many times, they eliminate things that you are still doing, they have sacrificed more.
They've given up things that you have continued to have on your tree.
6:00
As branches that are distracting from growing Champions.
When I look at the people who are further ahead of me, they're even more ruthless with their time.
Their even have lower tolerance for friends family, people around them that are not at the bar that they hold themselves to for me, going through college or, you know, when I was younger I always thought it was about adding to your plate saying, yes, to everything saying yes to Opportunities.
6:18
Say yes, yes, yes.
When all I did was I just completely got distracted and spread super-thin what most Champions have is singular, focus and they are willing to say no to everything else and that took me too long to learn 6 is That Goodwill compounds faster than money.
Like, if you actually think about what good will is it's that you have positive sentiment and you have a degree of influence over a person's Behavior.
6:38
That's what Goodwill is.
If one person has good will with you, and then shares your stuff with somebody else and you create Goodwill in that next person, you can double your Goodwill or 10x, your Good Will in a matter of 12 weeks 10x in your money, in a matter of 12 weeks is very, very unlikely Goodwill because it's based on audiences and humans can compound significantly faster than money can.
6:57
And when I realized that, that Goodwill could be Related into money.
If I so desired at a future date, that I realized, I'm rather than focusing on the money that I'm trying to make today.
Why don't I focus on the compounding vehicle that compounds at a much faster rate than money?
Does that compounds tax-free by the way, building the audience is tax-free and then when you choose to have the conversion event, you can do that at your own choosing.
7:16
But if you focus on the audience, you focus on the good will that will grow signally faster than any kind of monetary move, but you can still translate that later in the money when you want seven is that you're going to die two weeks after you die.
Most people have forgotten about you and six months after you.
I know it will talk about you and if they're not caring enough then then it certainly doesn't matter what they think about your life.
7:35
Now because if that's the most significant event that's going to happen in your life which is that you stop living how much credibility or wait, should we give to other people's opinions on what we should do with our lives?
My opinion very little, unless the person is a vested interest in seeing you succeed comma and the context to provide the advice most of the times, it's just worth ignoring, because they're trying to live their own life and they're projecting their own beliefs and experiences on you.
7:56
And you spent all this time trying to improve your own view of reality through.
Least that you've shed and shifted that they have not.
And so would they believe to be true is what they're casting on to you and if you don't like the life they have, and I don't think it's worth listening to hate extraordinary accomplishments.
Come from doing ordinary things for Extraordinary periods of time.
8:13
This is just me speaking about me, but when I was younger, my action showed that I was more impatient.
I always was willing to sacrifice what I had today to get the quick Bach, you know, I was always a Shifty like that because I just thought, that, that was how it worked.
I thought there was some Shortcut, I didn't know about, and I would see the guys on stage as being like this.
8:29
This is what we do.
We do the basics and we do a lot of it.
I was like, they're just trying to hold the secrets back and I'm here to tell you that, that is not true.
Like I wish I could go and shake my college self and be like, if you do one thing for a very long period of time, you will get very good at it and it will compound onto itself.
And maybe I would listen to me if, I mean, a future self showed up in my living room.
8:47
Now, I would totally listen to him.
But, you know, I mean and so I can't do that.
So the next best thing I can do is try and Shake You by the collar.
The thing that makes the action extraordinary is the commitment to it.
Not the nature of the action itself.
Working out and doing reps is not extraordinary.
If you saw one set of a workout for me at the gym, you wouldn't think, oh, this guy is amazing.
9:08
Look at them quad.
It's the fact that you do it for 20 straight years is what compounds on itself.
If you listen to one guy, make one phone call, you listen to one major league baseball player.
One at bat, nothing about that is extraordinary.
It's the dedication to doing it over and over and over and over again, despite feeling like there's better opportunities, despite people approaching you with new and exciting things.
9:27
But saying that you're committed to the no vision you had and that reality has not changed in such a way that your need to believe you're no longer true.
He said, I believe that XY and Z is true and as long as that remains to be true, then I will continue on this path for an extraordinary period of time and that not the action itself.
But your commitment to the action is what makes someone extraordinary 9 if it's worth doing?
9:45
It's worth doing well.
This is a really great saying.
I sure got it so much soft when I was younger.
I just wanted to like, get it done.
Get it done, get it done.
Rather than doing it.
Well, there's kind of two ways you can take the saying, which is why I like it so much.
Is that if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well, because Times.
I was doing things that were not worth doing.
10:01
I didn't have the time to do things well because I was doing so many things that were not worth doing the first criteria.
Is what problem are we solving?
What am I hoping to accomplish?
Is this worth doing at all?
Because if it is worth doing, then I have to understand that to do it comma right to do it.
10:18
Well, it's going to take this much time now, given that is it still worth doing, and if it passes that test of any being worth doing in the Long Haul, and because it is worth doing worth doing well, then it gives us this A lens through which to see the activities.
We do so that we can prioritize.
The things that will make us the.
10:34
Most money are going to get us closer to the goals.
We have it.
So younger me had more energy than me does.
Now I make way more money than younger, me did, it's because I do fewer things and I do different things than I did then.
And now, if I write a book, I'll take a year on writing the book.
Because if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well, because I understand that taking one year today will mean that that book might sit and sell and distribute itself to millions of people over the next 50 years or 100 years, Or after I'm dead.
11:01
Compared to me just putting words on a page that are pretty good and then shipping it.
And I think the vast majority of people don't get the difference between good and great.
The Ocean between good work and great.
Work is vast, it's 5 times, 10 times the work to go from something good to something great which is why you have to be really selective about the few things.
11:17
You choose to do that are worth doing and in being worth doing worth doing well, 10 be willing to negotiate everything except for your values.
And so, there were so many things when I was coming up that like, in college, even right after college, Age is jobs like I always just took things at face value.
11:34
So prices, terms relationships, everything I took it face value.
So, whatever someone presented?
I said, yes or no to, I have now realized that virtually everything is negotiable.
People present with basically their best bad guess.
And they're hoping that someone takes them by the hand and says, you know, that makes no sense.
11:50
What if we did it this way?
What problem are you solving what problem by solving?
And then ask the right questions to get someone else's true desires and wants and then knowing what your own true desires and wants and what you're willing?
To give up allows you to make better deals.
And so I used to think of negotiating as a zero-sum game, and it's not at all, you can find a way, we're both parties, get better than they were before, which is the entire point.
12:10
That is how negotiating works if you're doing it.
Well, and so, I didn't understand that.
I thought everything was an armrest, I thought everything was like this for that tit-for-tat, like no give.
And I also thought really short about it, I was like, I was trying to get one over.
I was ruthless with vendors, I swung the other direction.
So first I didn't negotiate anything and then I found out you could negotiate and then try to get everyone to give me there.
12:29
Last penny.
But then I realized that this long-term doesn't create good relationships and they will not be loyal to you at all, which long-term has a more negative impact than giving them the extra 10% and having an amicable relationship.
You want to negotiate everything except for your values.
I negotiated everything in that second example, including my values because I was doing business in a way that was contrary to the values that I wanted to, espoused wanted to embody, because the deals we do with that was just not common.
12:52
For example, like I could probably ask for significantly more than I do.
And I've had many times we've like, I want to give you this, I'm like, I don't want that because I don't, I think, you know what that means.
This is what I think is fair today and in 10 years and so it's balancing both your need today.
Your need in 10 years and they're need today and they're needed 10 years.
13:10
And you have those four points that you try and find the closest point, given your reality and you can explain that this is how you're thinking through it with them.
And I think they will appreciate all four data points on the map to come to the best solution for today.
And tomorrow 11.
Humility is a big one because I want to be a different voice on this because I have heard all over the Internet.
13:31
Recently, people saying, humility is stupid.
If you looked up with the word means, you wouldn't want to be it because if you look it up on Google, it says, thinking less of oneself.
This is why looking into finding terms is important.
Because if you look at Merriam-Webster, for example, its lack of Pride or arrogance, I don't think people would say you wouldn't want that.
13:47
I'm like, no, I think I think people are.
Okay, not being prideful arrogant, I think that's okay.
But even more.
So, and the definition that I have taken on is actually the The opposite of that which is it is not decreasing your regard for self but increasing your Godfather's.
This from Clayton Christensen who's a Harvard Professor, go to the human.
14:02
I thought that posturing when I was younger was the thing that would get people to like me.
But what I realized later was that you gain status by giving more to the group than you get.
This is especially true for guys.
It's probably true for girls but I can't speak to that.
If you want to gain status the way you do it is by sacrificing more for the group that everyone else does.
14:21
If you want to gain status in a company, you give more To the company than anyone else does more than the company gives you back?
Because what do they do?
They reward that behavior the group rewards, the person who gives to the group, it's how it works.
The people who take from the group, The only going to get status from the group and up getting banished by the group and bad it down.
14:39
Because everyone wants to keep that person because they don't serve anyone else.
And so it was only by realizing that I had to give my life in order to get it.
I had to give status, I had to serve because when you serve someone you're giving them status, you're increasing your Godfather's.
When I gave status, I got it back when I gave give respect first, I would get respect back and it was understanding that group dynamic which is what made me president of the fraternity that I was in all of these things started compounding when I realized that truth, and if you do that, I promise you, you will have all the status you want 12.
15:10
The happy man has a thousand Wishes.
The sad man has one.
This is a little bit more of a heartfelt.
One for me.
Because when I was younger, I was definitely angrier.
Probably darker in general.
And a lot of that came because I had expectations that were fictitious, real, or otherwise, Other people in my mind that existed who are constantly judging the behaviors and actions, I was doing every day and we're telling me that I was not enough in some ways that created and reinforce behaviors that I still continue to stay in terms of the actions, I take.
15:36
But the way that I feel and think about them has shifted, when you are sad, you want to not be sad.
That's the main focus you want to feel better.
And many times.
People will take the short term way of getting out of that, which is alcohol.
Drugs etcetera.
Because in the moment, they can feel better.
15:51
Everyone just wants to feel better.
And so when I think about Things that I used to think people were wrong in me right now.
Get all angry and it's putting myself out.
I use a different frame now which is they just wanted to feel better.
Do you think it had nothing to do with me and they just wanted to feel better about themselves?
And that's gives me a lot of Peace about many of the things that used to anger.
16:08
Me, being able to quiet the hundreds of non-existent voices in my head, that we're constantly judging the activities that I was doing and labeling them, good or bad or good enough or not.
Good enough etcetera, took up a tremendous amount of my attention and because of that all of my focus was on feeling better and so I couldn't actually have any energy left.
16:24
To do stuff because all I was focused on was feeling better and all I was spending all my day was in my head, trying to not feel like shit and doing both short and long-term things to do that.
And so it was only when I came up with the Mantra, which I have said before.
But fuck happiness, which sounds ironic because I said the person who's happy as a thousand wishes, but in choosing not to admit the deficiency between my current state and the future state of what I desire to be, I was able to accept where I was and then the deficiency of not being good enough, not being happy enough disintegrated in my mind and then, I was able to focus.
16:54
Asan, just doing things.
And then when I started doing things, I started making progress.
When I started making progress, I started looking back, I'm feeling proud of how far I've come because it wasn't about the many voices outside was about the only one that mattered.
And so that shift is what I think genuinely from a spiritual standpoint is the thing that was able to give me the strength to do some of the things we have done.
17:14
But I wouldn't have been able to ever start on this path because I was paralyzed about what I thought other people would think about me.
Only to realize that they weren't thinking about me at all 13, failure leads to learning.
Learning leads to success success leads to complacency, complacency leads to failure.
17:29
And so a lot of times I'm really thinking that like there was a destination, but I think the actual entrepreneurial cycle is not a destination, it's not linear.
It's cyclical.
And so that's why I talk about entrepreneurship in terms of Seasons because there are Cycles where you learn a lot right now.
Used to say this, a lot where I'd say either the business is growing where I am either.
17:45
I have learned lessons and I am applying those lessons to the business and the business is growing or the business is not growing and has problems.
And now I am the one receiving the lessons from the business in until I learn the lesson that I'm supposed to learn the business will cease to grow, until I have learned this lesson until I beat this boss at this level.
And the difference between video games and real life.
18:01
Is that sometimes in order to beat that boss, you're not doing it in 10 minutes.
I'm going to take you ten years.
Recognizing that you were not above the cycle, but that, that cycle is inevitable because you have failure, learning success.
Complacency the goal is, if you can identify that, how quickly can you get back to learning success?
Learning success.
18:17
And try and skip the complacency step altogether.
It still happens to a degree when I can start feeling the feelings and it's rearing its head.
I'm aware of it.
That allows me to speed through it faster into the same degree.
I stop labeling things as good or bad because if I'm feeling it means I'm about to go through learning and I see learning is good on the flip side.
18:32
If I'm succeeding, I succeeding is good.
And so either way they lead to my success and framing it that way took a lot of the Judgment in the label and the depression around not achievement away from me.
And also, when things are good, it allowed me to not be so high on my Supply because I knew that whenever things were good, everything is good, is followed by something that is not as good.
18:51
And so, you always have regression to the mean, right?
You have regression to the meat and so things are amazing.
That it means they can only go down from here.
If things are terrible, it means you can only go up 14 is that I would pay any amount of money to make obvious truths real.
For me, there is a reality that no one can see right now, true reality and no one can see it because we are shaped by the many things that we've been told throughout our lives.
19:11
And many of those things were not true, much of the path of Entrepreneurship in my opinion is shedding these false truths so that you can see the world more.
Clearly.
If you see these business, people were super far ahead and all of a sudden it's like they can lose it and they can get it all back again and things seem.
So Seamless for them.
It's because they have a more accurate view of reality, a nude.
19:29
And so imagine trying to hit a target with a blindfold on, you're just going to keep missing and keep missing and keep missing.
Now, imagine there's a guy next to you.
He's got a blindfold on to, but it's clear.
He's just nailing it.
You're like what the hell, I'm doing the same thing with my wrist.
I'm doing, you know I've got I've got all this technique down it's simply because he sees the Target and he sees all the environment around it more clearly than you do.
19:49
And for me the whole concept of ignorance tax and ignorance debt has been one that I've taken.
With me for life.
And I actually heard this a speaker said this on stage and he's actually using his a clothes for the audience.
He said how much is not making a million dollars, a year, costing you, he's like well if you make fifty thousand dollars a year right now said it cost, you nine hundred fifty thousand dollars a year to not know how to make a million dollars.
20:11
I thought about that and I was like, shit.
We were paying a Debt Service to a false reality in order to get the real one.
And so for me, I will pay any amount of money to speed that process up to see the world more clearly in.
He that is true.
And if the views that I have, do not serve me in someone else is further ahead of me in the game, then they are better at the game of business than me in some way.
20:33
And in that way, I can learn of them.
Doesn't matter what they're doing.
Some people were like, oh, this guy's unethical, this guy's you can learn from everyone if they're making more money than you can learn from them.
And so taking that and taking my ego hat off, right?
Taking my ego hat off and saying like, I'm the student here.
This guy's better in some way.
20:49
What does he believe to be true about the world?
I don't, or what do I believe to be true?
That isn't and simply trying to observe to see those realities is something that I will always pay for. simply trying to observe to see those realities is something that I will always pay for.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
I feel like in the casino of life you get tapped on the shoulder by the Grim Reaper.
He says your time's up and then all your chips, get pushed right back to the middle, the table and then you leave the casino empty-handed because it was a fake game with egg rolls, it didn't matter.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:35
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished facing this musk and Buffett had documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy deficits occur when we speak desires, right?
And so I love this statement desires our contract with make with ourselves to be unhappy until we get what we want.
0:53
And so, when are we stated desire?
Like I want this, I want this amount of money.
I want whatever you literally sign a contract that says, like I won't be unhappy.
Until that happens, right?
And so, like I had this thing earlier on where I was like, I want to have meaning, I want to have great meeting my life and I was talking to a guy who made a lot more money than me, and he was like, because I asked him, I said, how do you create a new story meeting in your work?
1:12
That was the question.
I asked him on a podcast and he was like, why do you think life needs to be meaningful?
And it was the same exact thing as the happiness versus.
Like the meaning thing where it's like I say, life has to be meaningful and therefore everything that I'm doing, like I create this expectation of Life.
Whereas, if life just is, it just is And it's the only way that you can actually be.
1:32
There is just pure acceptance which is why I like the whole like shoulds of like we should work, we should have balance, we should acts it's like I believe.
Marriage is a compromise.
Like, these are just statements of belief that our casting expectations out in the world that are just bound to be untrue at some point and then create dissonance.
1:48
And so it's like I believe marriage is marriage and I believe my marriage is my marriage and I believe your marriage is your marriage and like I believe that I can work 24 hours a day if I want to and that is all period, not and It's bad or and it's good.
There's no judgment on it.
It just is.
And so like, if I get dopamine secreted my brain, when I start working cool like and I will optimize for dopamine and if I die I know that on a thousand Generations.
2:13
Nothing I do anyways, it's going to matter.
So who cares?
Like, that's like the, the opening thing in my book is like there are no rules.
We live in this, like this, like, shoulds and have twos and like, happiness, everyone talks about it and it's just like everyone is unhappy because they say, they want to be happy rather than being like, By accepting like happiness.
2:32
Like I just am period and then like I don't need to judge the am it just is how do you always say that?
That makes sense.
Yeah because so one thing I noticed is if you're like I just want to be happy.
2:47
No.
Does that mean Alex that?
You think that at some point that will change for you or something or you're you have you live?
No, I think that that will change.
I think you guys maybe are taking what I'm saying the wrong way.
I mean, like, Alex is saying, you know, everybody has different beliefs and there's no one rule fits all to everybody.
3:07
And so if I say I want to be happy, that doesn't make me wrong.
Like, if I want to live my life, that way, that's perfectly fine.
But the thing that that what Jack is saying, is, no, I am like happy, like I, but for me, I like to make like a conscious effort to work towards that and Alex can live his life.
3:28
Like life is life, my marriage.
Has my marriage.
And it works for him and that generates happiness, whether he's like, thinking that it doesn't have to generate happiness.
That's the past.
Yes.
Yes.
Like right, like butter, like, because it makes it like not.
Because it's like, when people say, like hey work, you know, set these goals and like the rest will take care of itself.
3:48
It still makes the rest taking care of itself.
The reason that you're doing it, which means that is actually not getting around it.
When people are, like, you got to be process-driven.
If you're like, if we focus on the process that goes to care of themselves, it still means the goals are important.
So like if you To make the transition from like a process Driven Life, which is like I'm doing these things to do them period so that I can be happy so that I can have a good marriage.
4:07
So that I have a meaningful life has to disappear from the equation.
It has to be, I do them period not because I do them but then it goes back the other way.
Like, but why because you say so like because you want to write like if you want to have, if you want to ascribe meaning to why you're doing something, you do it for whatever reason, wow, this is deep still out.
4:30
I mean this is what I spent a lot of my time thinking because I have nothing else to do and this is what my last year was was like, trying to figure out like why why?
I didn't have like I felt the exact same way.
While I was well, I had nothing as to where I have now.
I feel the same like, like people are like, man, it was cool in the money in my account.
4:47
I thought nothing like truly, like not even like the to day.
Like I it was irrelevant.
How did you learn?
All of this did was this through speaking with other people who have been there before you thinking I mean, my closest friend is a philosopher and I use that in terms of like the actual meaning of the word, philosophers alike, feel a to love and then Sophos is wisdom or knowledge.
5:09
So like he's a lover of knowledge lover of wisdom and like we talk every week.
It's like the only standing meeting that I have is we talked for like two hours and we just talked about life and he's one of these guys who like lives in a cave and it's like he got his Ph.D when he was 20 like just a very brilliant guy and so you know I just talked about things, you know today.
5:24
Chairs contact information for saying yes on the Pod.
Oh I mean he's brilliant.
I mean, If you like doctor, gosh he's brilliant.
He's the smartest human that I know in terms of like Brilliance and their ability to communicate it in a simple way and so he helped me get over a lot of the things that I used to struggle with and a lot of it was just like the language that we use matters a lot because like how we say, things is how we think things and so like what I was saying earlier Alex and this is not like a slight.
5:52
I'm just saying, like, when I hear anyone talk like, Almighty more customers, or whatever, it's like, people talk, so many things are Themselves and they're like, I don't know why I'm not successful and it's like, will define success and why are you not?
And then what are the you know, I mean like I just want to do this to be high.
6:08
Like there's so many chains that they put on themselves, that it becomes very difficult to live.
And so like I spent a long time trying to not do that and it was just because like I was unhappy and I didn't like being unhappy and then I stopped at judging myself for being unhappy and then I stopped thinking about it all together.
6:28
And so I think that like I'll give you In a really real example for them.
So one of the things that I'm vehemently opposed and I'm like, you know, one give G Flack, you can give it to me and like this is coming from a family through like had alcoholics and drug addicts and things like that.
Like I really don't like the Alcoholics Anonymous concept of every morning waking up and saying I am an alcoholic High, you know, whatever, and then they go into their and their meetings because what it does is it puts it at the Forefront of their mind and they they literally label themselves.
6:56
Every morning is having this problem, right?
When somebody who's not an Just doesn't think about it.
They don't think I'm an alcoholic.
I have to fight not drinking every day, they just don't think about it.
And so I think to the same degree that like, living a meaningful life, is not saying like I'm living a meaningful life.
7:13
You just are and you're not casting it, you're just, you just are.
But any think some of that is just that inherent belief that some people just have the raised from that.
They had positive experiences that turns into a spiral.
But the people who don't have that, who are used to every day being like I'm worth.
7:30
Atlas I suck at this, I am bad at this.
Don't you think that maybe that like first step and like, getting in that direction is positive affirmations of like I could do it?
I can.
Isn't that like that's better than zero.
Like I feel like we're going to 0 to 1 because I think he's exiting I think it's exiting the equation altogether.
7:47
So saying I'm worthless instead of saying like I want to be worthy or I am where they just saying worthiness doesn't matter, but then wouldn't you get just people not caring at all?
Yes.
Yeah, so I'm A denial of yeah.
Like I believe we do nothing happens and like you know, it is what it is, right?
8:04
And there are different ways to take that.
Some people were like, life is meaningless and there's no point in any of it, which I would agree with them.
And then the other people are like, there's no point in any of it.
And so, I'll do what I want.
And some people see that it's like a very, very, very self-serving, which I might be, but to the same degree like you are released from the chains of the expectations of others.
8:24
And most people in my opinion that I have witnessed who aren't happy is because they are weighted down by the Chains of their parents of their friends of their siblings of the, whatever things, the people that they believe are casting judgment on them.
And they care so much about that person's disapproval that they don't want to do the things that they want to do.
8:40
And so if I think it's easier to get someone to realize that none of it matters and then build from there then to try and flip the negatives.
It's just to exit the equation altogether, just say none of this matters.
Therefore I will start my YouTube channel and not care.
If my dad says that YouTube isn't real, like it's not about being worth it.
8:58
Like this is Were there like I deserve success?
Like they know known as there's anything, but you can do the stuff that get success, independent, of your deserving us me a terrible person and get become successful, so that person doesn't deserve.
But they did the things that create success if we define success as some material, whatever, as I think like, if you can exit the equation of like labeling yourself and then just doing.
9:22
Because what else will you do?
While you are alive, it creates some levels of Freedom that allow for clarity of thought and also for the ability to take risks, Most people can't take and I can't lie.
I understand the difficulty is it's not like I'm some perfect like you know like nihilist who just like never believes anything matters and doesn't get upset.
9:39
Like, of course I do, but like my instant self-help is ever something happens.
It's like I'm going to die - not going to matter and that like it's like it just got so ingrained in me now that like, It's okay.
But would you consider yourself emotional?
Yeah, I mean probably.
9:55
Sitting I have emotions.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
10:14
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
Got it because a lot of the times at least in my experience, like, and what I've seen people that are nihilists, it's easy to.
10:34
That's like an easy out.
If something bad happens, if something good happens, it's just like, oh yeah, that's fine.
Sweet on the rug.
It's not, it's not like it matters.
Anyway, so bad happens.
It's not like you actually deal with their process, whatever, you know, event or action occurred that make you felt that emotion.
If we believe that we have to like, why should we, why should you feel that emotion?
10:53
Like why should we process a traumatic event?
What does that mean?
Well I do believe that there are like, you know, things in your brain biologically that if they are deprived of something or there's like some, some bad traumatic event or something like that will affect your biological medic versus non-traumatic.
11:15
I mean, I feel like the definition of the word trauma would probably.
But what would be the line between like okay in like let's let's give an example of something terrible, right?
Actually, not Because it's a podcast and people might go grab.
So, let's just say something bad happens that we described as bad in this culture, right in another culture that might not be bad.
11:35
It's trauma in this culture is not trauma in this culture.
So, if the circumstances the same, why was it traumatic circumstances?
Warrant same why not?
Because the culture, the facts were the same.
When we describe the facts as changed, which means that we can choose to call something trauma.
11:53
But wouldn't isn't it?
Doesn't it make sense that people would be built up due to culture and environment for dear old guy sleeps with a 15 year old girl, terrible.
Right?
We want 200 years for real guys, to the 15 year old girl, 100% normal, right?
12:10
How is it trauma now and not trauma that and mind.
Like this is not my state.
I'm just I'm you have to pull an extreme example if we're going to talk about trauma to illustrate the concept, right?
So if it's traumatic and One instance, and not traumatic.
And another, then it means that we can basically change the cultural narrative that we're ascribing to our context and make it not traumatic.
12:31
That makes sense, right?
Which means it didn't matter, which means, the only thing that matters that you chose to make it meaningful.
But let's say like, like the the passing of a parent.
Yeah, I love hundred percent, something like that.
If we think like, we feel like we have this, we have a narrative that says, if I don't mourn, it means I didn't care about them, right?
12:53
Right.
That's a statement of belief.
I could say that if I don't mourn about them, it means I totally cared about them.
Like why does my morning have any indication of how much?
I cared they're non correlates right?
But it's just because we had like we have so many of these belief statements that like quote Society or things that we inherit, right?
13:14
But we just choose to say that this is how life is And so I think it's just like monitoring what those statements are.
And so like one of my favorite, one of my favorite sayings probably like five one thing on my Tombstone.
It would be a permutation of a quote, by Orson Scott Card which is we questioned all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those who never think to question that's a good clubs, right?
13:35
Yeah.
So, it's like, we like art.
Of course, I'm opening to question my beliefs.
It's like, what's trauma?
Like, when someone's like, I was traumatized as, like, where are you, or do you just choose to label this trauma?
And then now you've got the rest of your life because you Call it trauma when 200 years ago, it was life and a thousand years ago, having your parent, come in front of you was just nature if you want to go biology, right?
13:55
And so, we're just like, we just choose to create meaning around things.
And so, like, at the end of the day, like end-to-end bottom, bottom, bottom room, yeah.
All our brains do is just create industry meeting.
And so we say, this is a threat, this is not a threat.
We make the like we need to reinforce this paper.
We don't need to reinforce this paper all through meeting.
14:11
And so if you can control what you doing, D, meaningful, you can massively shift the odds in your favor.
Because you don't need to ascribe.
Meaning to be lets say, like, there's, like 500 years ago.
You see, like a parent killed in front of you?
Yeah, that because all you have in your mind is, like, food, shelter, water.
14:28
And now that we have this thing's taken care of our minds, go to other places.
Sure?
Yeah.
I just don't think it changes the actual facts.
So it's like, we have we have, there's, there's stimulus-response Ryan.
So like we could control the response, we control, it's the stimulus.
And so like, Was it is either set Seneca or Epictetus?
14:48
Who's like, no one yells at a rock, right?
It's like, if you are the rock, then like, just doesn't matter ride, like you just like, eventually, like people just fuck off and just leave you alone.
And so like, and if you see, if you see stimulus of life that way in terms of, like how you deem things, or label things traumatic, or non-traumatic or good or bad, you know, it's the same thing.
15:07
I'm sure with, like, the hate comments or whatnot, is like, if you deem the comments of the fans as meaningful, then you will both care about them being Positive.
You will care about them being negative but if they're not meaningful at all to begin with and like, I don't think you can do either.
I think you just either have to participate in both sides or you remove.
15:23
That is also belief statement, right?
So like maybe you can.
So, how did you transition from Asuma?
I'm assuming you used to care a little bit more about beliefs and stuff like that.
How did you transition from that to now, not caring.
And like, did you have to completely change your mindset to wear yours automatic response to things was just like, what are these chains of?
15:44
Didn't like the cultural constraints and stuff.
Like that.
A rider making me feel this way.
Yeah, that did.
Did you just switch that light switch or do you still on occasion?
Catch yourself slipping that.
Justin right now is like, I just said that his belief, right?
That's what I figured hundred percent.
Yeah.
I mean, I think you systematically you here.
16:00
Like, that's why the talking is so important.
Like, what words are using?
What do those words mean like you say trauma like to find that?
What do you mean by that?
Which is why I like when you hear really good writing its academic like the first few pages will be like we're going to talk about this and this is how we defined this.
And this is how we defined this, it's like we're competing.
Ants around the words that were using because they mean they equate to thoughts, they're just buckets, right?
16:18
That we like say a word like trauma, and like it means something different to all three of us.
It's like we have to agree on the definition before we can talk about it.
So make sense.
So I definitely made a conscious effort so when I was like 19 or 20 I became a born-again Christian, the dunk.
The whole thing was like, oh my God, life's amazing.
Jesus great.
16:34
And then I ended up falling away from that because I was like, I don't know if this is true and then I spent the next five years dedicated to apologetics which is defensive faith of the Christian faith.
So just learning the arguments around like I Christianity is true, right?
I ended up not believing you on in it and I can give a variety of reasons, but I'll give you the simplest one.
16:53
Hopefully, I'm not insulting with.
This is just my belief that I'm sharing, which is one of the strongest Arguments for Christianity against other world.
Religions, is that other world religions, say like?
So if you do a good job you in a good place, right?
And fundamentally that's it's a hard Paradigm because it means like at what point are you 51 percent?
17:08
Good verse 49 percent should have just held one more door open and I would go to the good place forever, right?
Not even talking about About like Finance circumstance and creating infinite outcomes, but like whatever.
And so if you can draw that line then it makes it kind of makes it ridiculous, right?
It's like kind of breaks down on the like be a good person system, right?
17:26
And so that's all worldviews, with the exception of Buddhism and Christianity with Christianity there, like you don't have to be good, just have to Faith if you have faith in Jesus and you go to the good place, right?
And so the reason that for me fundamentally, I didn't believe in that was because you actually create another false binary, which is believe or not believe.
17:45
When in reality, is to what extent you believe, it's how hard you believe, and again you create another 50% line, which I believe 1% more and then I would go to the good place for our right.
Anyways, the point is is that I studied apologetics for a long period of time and then I was really sad and I was just like being said, I would look for happiness.
18:04
I was like, I'm just going to do stuff that I think is cool and that was like, that was like the first break in the chain for me.
My slogan myself was actually just like happiness and And that was wildly fraying because I stopped judging myself for not being happy.
And then I was just like, oh like I am unhappy and Michael whatever, I just kept going and all of a sudden just like stopped mattering to me, like, I don't think about Virginia like I don't think like, does this make me?
18:31
Happy does not like, I don't think about you just do what you want to do in the moment, whatever goes down and it's not like it's like all short-term, like all pleasure-seeking whatever.
Like I still have a long-term perspective of like, this is what I want to build.
Yeah, like I want to write these books.
I want to build these courses.
I want to do this stuff but it's like, those are things that I enjoy.
18:47
So that's what I, so I do.
I love it.
It's great.
All right, maybe I had questions but now I know the answers to him time a stop here.
I'm just listening rather just listen and not like I don't want to mess it up, but then I created a belief that now I'm gonna mess up and you can't miss the comments are going to be grown up.
19:15
That's why does that matter?
I know it's I mean, I know it's crazy stuff but Like I think they like if you want to like, you can't do what 99% of people are doing.
If you want to be in the 1%.
Yeah, like fundamentally.
And so like, you have to have like, what I would consider like maybe uncomfortable conversations is be like, that's okay.
19:30
Like cool.
Like I just I'm going to do my thing and then they're like and thing is a lot of times if you just even just make your statements of like this is how I believe.
Like people feel like you're attacking them.
So if you articulated well because I like, why?
I don't like cool.
I don't like doing everyone.
Like it's all good to me is it which is why I don't talk about it as much.
19:47
Probably.
How about you?
Yeah.
What bothers you?
This got to be something out there that like I also have a voice lesson people wasting your time.
That's, that's a really good answer.
Good answer.
Yeah, it's the only thing I don't have a lot of this may seem like a silly question, but if you go to a restaurant and you order something, let's say you order a steak and you order it medium.
20:08
Well, and it comes back medium rare.
Yeah.
Do you say something?
Not worth its time?
No, I don't actually, you don't know why would I, I don't care.
But at the same time I was like well, a lot of people would be anxious to say something.
I figured you probably wouldn't care about this emotions, right?
20:24
I wouldn't even have an emotion first I mean that certain no, I mean, yeah.
Yeah.
I mean maybe like in a like I like we have a big ad campaign that supposed to go out and like I get all the creatives They before and supposed to launch.
Like, would that annoy me?
I'd be like, yes, but let's fix it.
20:39
You know, like this is bad.
We can't run this, let's try again.
You know, and in the end it won't matter because we're all going to die in.
This money is going to go back to the game.
I'll give you this one analogy.
This might be a good wrap up.
So this is like my mental analogy that I, that I not make sense to me, which is like, if life, A game, right?
20:57
And all of us are given a token to like, enter like a casino because we're in Vegas, right?
It's will get a, you know, a token.
We enter the casino and we sit down at the table to play poker, right?
Everybody's planned, everybody's got cards and all of, you know, we're dealt cards.
Everybody's dealt different cards.
And we got to play the hand were dealt and depending, on our level of skill, we amass more and more chips throughout the game, right?
21:18
And at the end of the game, the difference in the real world and the game of life, right?
In the real world, you just just you go and you can cash out your chips and you walk out with money.
And there you go, there's your day.
But I feel like in the casino of life you get tapped on the shoulder by the Grim Reaper.
21:35
He says your time's up and then all your chips, get pushed right back to the mill, the table and then you leave the casino empty-handed because it was a fake game with egg rolls, that didn't matter.
And so like we accumulate these chips that I'm just going to push back in the middle again that other people are going to play on and like the reason that that analogy became real for me is like, I bought this piece of land.
21:55
Austin and I was like, that's neat.
And then I was like, how many people have owned this piece of land?
It's like the guy, you know, the guy before me owned it and the guy before him owned it, the guy before him donut and I was like, and they were like, this is mine, and they die, or they sell it.
22:11
And some of those this is mine, it's like they're just chips that just get played with and they just get a mast and then you get redistributed.
It just doesn't matter like death taxes ever be 100%.
So like it was like a state planning it's like dude, 500 Generations.
It's from now like a your offspring are you know 500 to the you know .5 earlier 1/2 to the 500 power of like diluted.
22:35
They're basically just humans at that point.
So if you're well somehow is a big enough that it can be diluted that that much and last that long, the people who own it are just humans.
So to like, they're so they're just as close to me as you are, you know, it doesn't matter, right?
And then the alternative is the people that I'm giving this to urges the ones that I care about, are the immediate family.
22:55
But When people get resources that they didn't learn how to use or manage, then it destroys them because it's too much potential energy, the can't handle it right?
And so it's like it's really for nothing and so like if you want you can build something that you think is cool but like at the end of the day like we're just going to catch up soon.
23:13
So anyways Alex has water views but it's a great analogy.
Just lots of you think about this one?
Yeah I don't have to re-watch this but you know it's funny I was Actually thinking I would, yeah, everyone listen to podcasts.
The next segment.
23:29
I would actually listen to this.
Yeah, yeah.
Money income.
No worth investing and Isis savings accounts what credit cards.
Thank you so much.
Thank you Alex for coming on.
23:45
This has been an incredible podcast.
Yeah really.
So








0:00
If I were 85 years old and I got to go through a time machine and be back in my body as I am now to experience my life from my 85 year old self, it's dramatically shifted, how I see everything.
So let me walk you through it.
I've struggled to feel grateful for most of my life.
0:15
It's not that I don't have things to be grateful for.
I have tons of things to be grateful for but I don't feel gratitude and so I've tried a lot of different practices to try and feel gratitude, you know, the journals and the daily meditations and things like that, but they've never really stuck.
That's not to say that they don't.
I work for some people but I want to share with you.
0:32
In this video is one of the most powerful perspective changes that I've ever experienced.
If you don't know who I am, my name is Alex Rosie.
I'm the managing partner at acquisition.com, which is a portfolio of companies that is over a hundred million dollars.
A year.
I make these videos because I hope that you make all the money in the world and experience all the joy, they possibly can in the process.
0:47
I have spoken in the past about the frame of the veteran, which I won't recap here, but it's really just having different frames your perspectives through which to see circumstances so that you can improve your experience recently.
I've been trying to toy with one that would create Gratitude, there's a clip that went pretty viral not that long ago.
1:03
It's also my number one tweet of all time which is when I was 20 I wanted to be a millionaire.
Now that I'm a millionaire I want to be 20 when I'm 85 years old and in my mind I imagine that will be a multi-billionaire at that point.
I know that I would give up everything that I have of material wealth just to be poor and 20.
1:21
Again I called this the frame of the grandfather or the grandfather frame and it works like this if you've ever looked at pictures from your past, East and you look at where you grew up or you look at, you know, your old room or you look at a picture of you with old friends doing something, we tend to feel these feelings of nostalgia and I try to quantify, like, what is Nostalgia?
1:41
So to me, Nostalgia is gratitude in the present or past circumstances, for whatever reason, we're able to kind of look past all of the kind of minutiae of how we were feeling our moods and were able to kind of like see big picture.
The things that we are grateful for take a pause here.
1:56
I'm sure all of us have tons of childhood shit and things that we wish were different.
Blah, blah blah, but there are still elements of our past.
Our childhood, our adolescents are teenagers or college Years.
Whatever it is, right, we're you feel grateful.
Some of you guys are superstars and are always grateful for everything and I'm, you know, I'm Jelly, I don't roll that way.
2:13
It's not like I wake up and I'm like, man, I just want to count my lucky stars, like I just don't, that's just not how it functions.
And I've been trying this on and I hope you do too, because it's been, it's been really, like, improving my life.
I tried to do this or wake up thinking to myself, if I were 85 years old and I got to go through a time machine.
2:29
You and be back in my body as I am now to experience my life from my 85 year old self seeing it again, if I wake up and I feel my body and I'm like, ah, this is so nice.
I don't have all the joint pain.
Ah, my wrist, don't have arthritis, and then I wake up and I'm like, I remember when we used to live here, even when I looked at Layla this morning, I was thinking to myself, man.
2:53
Like, this is my wife right at the beginning of our marriage.
You know, we're only six years in, we wake up and we walk over to, you know, to have our coffee in the morning.
Always do and I'm like, isn't this so nice.
I remember when you used to have coffee here together, this is great and I look out the window.
Look how young Vegas looks.
It doesn't have all these buildings and these flying cars like it does.
3:09
Now, it's so underdeveloped compared to what it is today.
And I feel gratitude for an external just environment, which I would never really think that.
But I know that my 85 real self will totally appreciate this things.
As I'm going through the day, applying that frame also to business where I could see that, you know, the CEOs of our companies and the people that work within our holding company that I would search.
3:27
Not calm, they're stressed about things.
And in my mind I'm thinking isn't this cool that we get to do this together?
And that fun, is that neat?
Look how cute that is.
It is the most powerful frame that I've encountered.
I think the reason it's so powerful is one, it operates almost entirely from a frame of gratitude that for me I can feel for whatever reason, gratitude journals, the meditation seems like that.
3:47
Like I don't feel that.
But thinking about my 85 year, old self being able to really experience life through my 32 year old body.
It's really shifted, how I see things in also decreases the amount of anxiety and stress.
Over outcomes because I'm like, this isn't gonna matter in the long run.
4:03
I also think it helps from a business, the term loosely, but like a business wisdom perspective because when you think about the decisions, you think about it within the larger context of your life and you're not like, oh yeah, I'm going to make that short-term dollars because you're like, I'm 85, I don't have anything to prove, you know what I mean.
You think about like, the really stressful things that you've had happened in your past.
4:21
I feel Nostalgia for the sleeping, on the floor that I did at my gems for how tired I used to be.
At the end of the day of taking 20 plus constants, for months and months.
Months and months on end in rather than feeling stressed about it or resenting.
The fact that I have to do it, like I get to do this, I get to make videos talking to a camera.
4:37
Look at my 32 year-old self go trying to make his content trying to help other entrepreneurs.
Like, in the cool, if I had to characterize seasons of my life, I would say I was very angry as a teenager and young adult.
And then I went from Angry to being aware of the deficit between where I was and what I consider to be happiness from there.
4:55
I kind of switched to what I have affectionately called the fuck happiness mantra.
Child lived for a very long period of time which was, I stopped trying to optimize for a penis at all and just really stop thinking about it all together which I think move me closer to something that I would consider to be Joy.
You can be joyful, independent of circumstance because Joy is from within happiness tends to come from external, right?
5:15
It comes from circumstance and I think when we look at the grandparents, at least the people that are older, that I aspire to be is think they just have an internal Joy.
They have gratitude for being able to live it one last time because the end of the day, like it is our last time.
I'm being real here.
5:30
Like I've had a guy that I graduated with died a few months ago and he was a really successful guy, really smart kid did really well.
I mean, this is really dark but he got randomly murdered and you know, he had Grand plans for his life and I think to myself, Mike, you know, tomorrow really isn't guaranteed.
5:51
Thank you for your attention.
I know you have a lot of places that you can put it and I'm grateful that you chose to share the moment with me.
So those Nation appreciate you guys.
Bye.
Bye.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else going on.
Everybody happy hump.
Today happy Wednesday.
I'm super happy to make this video for you because this is my tenth not story and I do if I told you guys this story before but kept not is a kid that I went to high school with and he changed my life forever.
0:45
And I'm making this half for my own team and maybe you can take somebody in your own team that resonates the risk if you feel like this would resonate with them or maybe resonates with you.
But when I was in high school and I'll tag, I'll put a picture of me in high school.
First comment after this is done, posting, I was I was a really, really arrogant kid was really angry very prideful kid and I was I had a lot of talent, you know.
1:14
I I did really well in school without trying really hard.
I got, I think I did well with girls at a young age, I didn't have that struggle.
I was in really, really good shape genetically.
I didn't need to work out.
1:29
Out really hard.
Not a six-pack and I was really pretty ripped at a very young age and kept not was none of those things.
I don't think anything came easy for kemp, not so maybe temper.
Now you'll find this video sometime in the future but hopefully you appreciate the lesson that you taught me but Camp was at a time acne.
1:52
Super thick glasses, he wasn't particularly in shape and wasn't particularly strong.
He didn't.
He wasn't like You know like on any like real Varsity Sports, you didn't play you know like anything like that and but Kevin I just for some reason we're always at odds with one another and at least I felt that way and he was one of those kids that would go to every single study hall and be like teacher you forgot to give us homework and like freaking hate it.
2:22
I really did and because he would just, you know, he would insult me for whatever reasons, right.
And Probably a hundred percent all deserve and I would, you know, lash back out him and put him in his place and it got to the point once.
2:39
And I mean every time we get test back, I would I score the same or a little bit better.
I'd be like, hey man, how'd you like giving up your whole weekend study for that test that even look?
I didn't look at the book and I got a better grade than you.
I was like, I was, I was really a nasty piece of work.
Anyways, I remember one day, kind of culminated and we were in front of a bunch of girls and If he said something snarky to me, I can't remember.
3:02
It was and I looked back at him.
It was one of those like looks were, like everyone goes silent because of what he said, and I like looks like peered into his soul and I was like, Kemp was like, in what world were you ever be better than me at everything?
And I remember saying that and I mean, it's like it even hurts me to say those words now because it's just like such a horrible thing to say to another human being and just so full of Pride and ego, it's like disgusting.
3:24
But anyways, those are what that's what I actually said.
And and I could tell that it Hit him.
And I think that our Communications after that kind of like we were still in the same honors classes and things like that, but I didn't talk to him as much and it just kind of like these out now.
Why am I, why am I telling this story?
3:41
Because I wanted to get into Duke.
All right College, that's where I wanted to go to school and after I applied, it turned out that camera got into Duke and I got into Vanderbilt, which is a lower rank school and I always remember that Because tempted even like smear to my face, it was just like this quiet moment of victory for him and it was something that taught me such a sincere lesson of life and it was that I used to get by on talent and this might be true for some of you guys and I even caught myself in that moment, feeling.
4:19
Sorry for myself being like, this isn't fair like I'm smarter, I'm blah blah.
You know me telling you telling you like I don't deserve this at his.
You're better than this all this kind of crap.
Right.
And what it did for me is it taught me the lesson?
That life doesn't give a shit.
Was that like reality and like no one cares, right?
4:35
And it was so humbling for me, I can't even.
Like it was so humbling for me to just lose and it was just straight up by can't beat me.
And I am so much from that experience.
And I think about, you know, some of the people that we, you know, we have on our team and you probably have on your team people who have gotten by on talent and if they, if they were able to unlock what Kemp Which is that?
5:00
He never got anything hinted to her anything and he had to hustle so hard, just to just do X.
You know what I mean?
And and I learned that from Kenneth, I never saw anyone like him point to every single study hall, I finished all this study packets, he's all this stuff and I was like, man, I wonder if I did that, if I would get better grades, right?
5:23
Duh.
And so there are probably some of you right now who, you know, struggle to get leads or struggle to sell more and like, I think there's moments where it's like, well, how hard have you tried?
And he tried that hard Camp has or like we're so used to getting things because we're naturally good at them.
You know?
I mean, we have so much natural Talent.
We're like, man I deserve better than this.
5:39
I'm part of than that guy.
I'm I should be more successful than that person, whatever.
Write the stories that we tell ourselves, and at the end of the day, like can't beat me.
And that means that someone else in your Market is beating you like someone's beating.
Maybe a lot of people are beating Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
5:59
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And you can either like Thomas, like, the sob story yourself, or you can be like, what do I need to do?
6:23
You know what I mean?
Like, I got beat.
I'm getting, I'm getting my ass handed to me by this Marketplace.
I don't know what I'm doing, right?
And then, you can humble yourself and learn because I didn't have any, I'd literally didn't grow that much in high school until I got humbled.
You know what I mean?
It's all I got that beautiful slice of humble pie, that, that life decided to serve me through Kemp.
6:40
Not and it just so dramatically impacted like how I started studying in school and I started, you know, reading the books and doing the homework and then all of a sudden like what do you know?
My grades went up.
Like she's like crazy right and I started getting respect from the people that were that were around me.
6:56
Like I didn't have a lot of respect from the people.
When I was younger, I mean, people would hang out me, what?
Not all social.
But like, I didn't have that.
That level of respect when I got into college.
People used to, like, we see how hard I started working there.
Like, man, I respect that guys, hustle.
You know, I respect how hard he works on stuff and it was a new thing that I never experienced.
7:14
And so like there may be people on your team right now who, you know, Could you so much more and are just there off of town you like man, like maybe it's your sales manager.
You're like dude, you're so like you're so naturally good at this.
If you actually just practiced overcomes you don't.
7:29
I mean if you actually work your leads, if you actually followed up with these people, you'd be making three times as much money five times as much money.
Not just a little bit more because the thing is, is it's not like incremental change.
If you change that character trait, like massive things start changing, because it changes who you are, right?
7:45
And so, Anyways, some of you guys might be struggling to get lead.
Some of you guys might have employees that are struggling with stuff.
I think most of us just like assume like we tried one or two things and we try to one or two times and it's like, well I don't know what to do.
Facebook doesn't work for me.
8:01
Thanks for parking doesn't work right, you know, stuff like that, right?
Just stupid things to say really it works its eyeballs right marketing, always works.
So anyways, I just tell the story because it was, it was something that was on my mind this morning and I just I thought maybe just One person this resonates with you but man don't beat me in that store T by B Kemp because the marketplace doesn't care about me about ego.
8:28
Crap.
You know, he doesn't care about like the fact that you may be better, maybe your gyms better.
You're like our James better than their gym and they make more money than this, right?
Like our trainers are better than their trainers just like last time.
What the market thinks that's not what reality thinks.
They're beating.
We can do it.
8:45
So anyways, that's what everybody hope is.
Happy happy hump day to all of you on this resonates with you, because it was a story that really changed my life.
So to Camp, not wherever you are, thank you.
You changed my life.
You probably know it and you helped me become the person I am today, so, appreciate you all.
9:04
Hope this, you know, But anyways, Tegrity member.
Maybe this is just for you and I will see you guys on the flip side.
All right.









0:00
Most people in an economic downturn like the demand again for income producing scales does not go away.
When there is no money, the demand for money is just as high if not higher.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:16
We have learned along the way.
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
That's exactly what I figured out.
What feature flipper was you know, at first people would do it for a year and I'm like, okay I learned what I wanted to learn and like that was good but then we realized like man people stay for the community.
0:33
Like you said, the network, the accountability, you know, the camaraderie of just coming to an event every quarter and they love it.
It and you know, to make it even sweeter.
I did exactly what you said was.
I cut the second year price in half and I just said, hey you know it's half the price and you know it'll be that price as long as you want to stay in like our retention skyrocketed just from doing all of those things.
0:56
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you think about it, really like when people are, if you look at like anything customer success, they always put like, basically it's results in experience.
It's just like understanding that most I think in this space typically like e-learning masterminds, they have the results there which like Getting the network, you're getting the information.
1:12
You're getting all this, but they actually forget about the experience, which is like, did you set expectations properly with a person of what they're going to get?
Even because some people join for Network, for some doing for the education and then you onboard them.
Well.
And then what's, how often are you talking to them?
Are you proactive with your communication?
And so, a lot of people actually look at Jim launch and they say, oh, it's a digital, you know, information business.
1:31
I'm like, dude, we had a 40-person support team, you know, because under so focused on the experience, like, every time someone had a baby, a wedding, a birthday, a holiday, like a, their first trip.
They A descent on money.
It's like, we're constantly pouring into them and I think that's the intangible stuff that people don't leave because they have relationships.
1:47
And so I think the relationships in the feeling that you give, those people is longer lasting than the education.
All in all because people are loyal to a person, not necessary to a thing, right?
And one of the points that Layla made their, I'll just zoom in on real quick, which is asking people why they're joining sounds really simple and obvious, but people are solving different problems when they're buying the same thing.
2:08
And so, having a personalized experience for They're going to consume the product in the service at the onset.
Giving kind of like a unique roadmap, is one of those things that will dramatically enhance the value that they're receiving from the program because usually most people deliver way more stuff than some consume.
And so it's like, okay, how can I give you the shortest path to getting the value that you want the way you want to receive it?
2:27
And so like that's a huge part and then you know, some of the other cool things is using that network of fact that you have a for the network but also for group purchasing power.
So if you, let's say, let's say just for math sake, let's say your first year was twelve thousand dollars in your second year.
Thousand dollars.
If you have a group of 200 entrepreneurs or 500 entrepreneurs, who are in this network, we have a huge amount of buying power and so there's normally services and products and things like that that everybody probably frequent that may or may not be yours, you know that you own and so you can bundle in the savings from the group purchasing power to be an access of the absolute cost of The Mastermind and then it becomes a savings to be a part of the association or whatever.
3:05
And so there's like ways that you can stack the value that makes it just so irresistible in such a no-brainer for people to stay That they're like.
Well shit.
Yeah.
I mean it makes the I'd feel stupid to say no.
Right and then I had the idea.
Yes, speaking of reference, your book subtitle there, you know, offers what with the subtitle offers?
3:23
How to make offers, yeah?
How to make offers still good people.
Feel stupid saying now.
Yeah, so, you know, we talked about the book earlier and just like all the different ways to Market, and I know you're coming out with a whole series of books and everything else.
The next one's about generating is leads leads and You know, you've talked about how it's taking a while with all the revisions and everything else, and it's going to be used in a headache.
3:48
And I remember, I actually asked you and this is maybe like, 45, I go.
Hey, you know, how are you publishing them?
You're like, just on Amazon Kindle.
I was like, really.
I was like, he's right now.
He's like, I am like, what about every like I'm just doing it.
I'm like, holy crap.
Dude, to do all of that.
4:05
I wrote, I wrote my one book right over there, and that was like four years ago.
I was like, I don't think I could ever do that again.
So difficult to like, write it on my own.
Yeah, it's tough.
But instant rice first book even thinking he was going to publish it.
Like, I don't think people realize that like he was literally writing and he's like, I don't know if I'm going to do anything with this.
4:22
Like I just don't think I'm just writing for myself.
He's like, we could actually use it with the company's.
It'll be like a manual.
Is exactly what it was.
Exactly.
And so then find it was like one day he woke up in the morning and you know, if I'm going to publish it me, I do it like few months.
Good, why do you think I would do something?
4:38
And then I kept telling me, I was like, well, If the thing is good enough which I'd read it like probably six times by this point I'm like it is fantastic.
Like it's going to blow up like you don't need to do anything and he was like, Hey and then one day I woke up and you're like I'm I put it on, I put on Instagram, it's only about six on Amazon instagrammed.
4:55
He was like yeah.
I was like, I don't even know where to login to like, you know, make sure the shit's going well and stuff and says, little bit of shitshow.
But it, you know, he made one post and no marketing.
No other post about it, nothing.
Just it just literally went viral off Word of Mouth.
5:10
He was insane.
People don't believe us there, like, you had to pump something.
I'm like some shit.
But people just aren't used to actually like the, how much time he puts into writing.
Like, I am not somebody to get bothered by how much from to work for.
Like, when he gets into writing words like weeks on weeks of like, I'm like, hello or you hungry, are you, are you struggling reason in there?
5:27
You know, is in this closet lie, I go in your closet.
Yes, yeah, turn off the light.
He's so dedicated to it and it's because he genuinely loves writing.
Yeah.
Books are very special to me because, like, I've learned a lot from, you know, reading and like If you think about like when people die, the only thing that's left is like, looks like the only thing that has like stayed for two thousand.
5:45
Five thousand years is like written word and so I think there's something magical about that.
And so that's what I you know, I spent a lot of time trying to make it really really good.
I think there's a big difference between like publishing a book and Publishing a great book and there's just a mountain more of work with like you know I mean like there's probably 20 percent of the work is publishing a book.
6:01
Compared to, you know, publishing a book that the product, the value that people will get is so far in excess of what they pay.
That they tell their friends about it and so, You can, if you can achieve that ratio, then then the product takes off and then it continued like it becomes, its own marketing.
Yeah.
6:17
And so that was that was the goal for the book.
And, you know, when I told Layla that I was like, I don't know if I want to promote it because either it's good enough that it will promote itself.
Right?
Why would I promote it?
Because if people aren't telling their friends that it's good, that why would I want anyone else to read it, right?
100% And I think the thing you did that was genius, was you made it a dollar like, you know, like the virality of that you haven't seen many people do that, right?
6:39
Because like, they spent so much time.
Time and money to get a book out there and to do the launch.
And you know, if they paid Ghost Rider and all this stuff and it's like to sell it for that, you know.
It's like well I have to lose like might as well read it and then like it just it's kind of like it made me realize too that a book is pretty much just like content and you know we make content for free.
7:03
We don't charge people to watch our YouTube videos and stuff and I was like yeah that makes it like why not try it as a book and so See what you did with that and obviously even if it was a dollar and suck, nobody would watch it or nobody would share it, right?
So it was just like you got nothing to lose by buying this and just reading it other than your time and it is just it's crazy like how viral it's gone because I read it when it maybe had a couple hundred reviews.
7:29
And I was looking at it before piles like this thing's got like 5,000 reviews now.
What's going on here?
Yeah, it's crazy.
Yeah, it's been pretty cool.
I'm very excited about it.
Comes up on one year and July.
Yeah, you know.
If we can get 5500, maybe 6,000 the first year, kinda crazy is anything about like, you know, what does it look like you know 20 or some no other gonna be like 120,000 views, right?
7:49
We should be pretty cool.
So but like, you know, to your point about the pricing thing, it's like a price it there because like, what was the objective of the book, the objective of the book is that it could shared in that many people consume at the objective is not like for me to make an extra twenty thousand dollars a month on a bus back side back.
Yeah.
Like I just you know an Amazon takes 66 of the the of the 99.
8:07
Like it really?
I cannot be gone.
What the fuck?
Yeah.
We We said, we want to be able to basically anything you put out there that's education or information.
We just like decided like there are brand like is just wanting all the to be for free.
So we don't make people pay for anything.
We don't want to ever sell anything.
8:23
That's not how we want to make our money.
Yeah, we, I mean, we just make our money doing the stuff, you know what I mean?
And so, we wanted to just teach as many like, this is model simple.
It's just okay.
We really do, do this stuff.
And why don't we just help as many people as humanly possible?
Knowing that 99.9% will never work with us and never give us a dollar and that's fine.
8:40
And then n of the people who are super executors because they can take the stuff without handling and get themselves to 3.
Million 5 million you know, eight million, 10 million a year and then they're like dude, I used all the stuff I got past this level.
Now like I trust you because I used your stuff and it worked.
8:56
So now I know the next things and work and then it just makes it for such a better process of finding alignment getting the right partners and so it's just big picture.
I don't want to sell more like 10,000 dollar things, you know.
I want to I want to just find partners that were in it for 10 years and builds on the road.
Do you ever see yourself started?
9:12
I know, you're not going to charge for education, but you ever see yourself starting like a mastermind for high-level entrepreneurs?
No.
No.
That was actually no.
I mean, I feel strongly against that.
Yeah.
But even if you didn't charge like just I don't know as a networking type deal I think we thought about doing like an event.
9:29
Yeah.
You know like a mo Z Nation event or doing a community on like Discord or something like that.
So like we're trying to think of different ways.
Did he tell you to do discourse?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Put it together and I've to discords right now.
Okay?
Oh yeah, they have 15,000 in them.
9:46
All right.
And Discord is interesting because it's like 24/7 and it's just like non-stop people are just always talking always commit.
It's different than a Facebook group where they had to make a post and somebody might comment.
Somebody - it's like a 24/7 chat room.
10:03
Yeah, that's crazy.
I mean, yeah, I could see us doing something like that.
It's just what's the objective, you know?
I mean, For us.
The objective is to I mean the mission of the company is to document and share the best practices of building world-class companies and so we do that by building world-class companies and documenting it and then we share it and the key point of sharing is like we share it so that everybody can have it.
10:23
And I just in my bones believe that the only thing that makes the world better is entrepreneurial businesses.
And so the more business owners we can equip with the skills and lessons that, you know, we're very difficult and painful for us to learn, then the more good businesses will be out there and even if none of them ever worked, With us, I will die.
10:41
And I won't matter, and it's okay.
And we're happy to just help people out and we're good with that 100%.
So how is it?
You know, working together.
I mean you guys seem like you're just yin and yang like, you know, it just works so well, just watching it from here, does work.
10:57
Well, those were very well.
Honestly, I mean it's a tough one because we met and we started working together so quickly and it's not for I would say like 99.9 percent of couples.
And I think also, A lot of couples aren't going to work as well together as we do because I think that we just naturally, you know, like I've always been kind of in this position with anyone that I've worked with like the integrator to a Visionary and Alex, is naturally a Visionary.
11:23
And so, I think we met and we had complementary skill sets and it was the right timing and start doing it from day one.
And we're both really coachable and we both take ownership over our shit and don't blame each other.
And so I think just who we were, we're lucky that we found each other and it worked so well.
11:40
I'm working together is great.
We love it.
Do you guys ever like how do you split like between business and your relationship or is it all just flowing together all the time it flows together?
I mean there are moments where you're like, hey husband had or hey wife hat, you know, like and you need to like clearly delineate but most of the times, like the things that we enjoy talking about are the things that we're building together.
12:04
You know what I mean?
And so forth.
In a lot of ways were talking earlier like the businesses that we build are a lot, like our kids.
They're the things that we're bringing to this.
World and we're raising them and you know, fostering them and whatnot.
So like that's that's what we enjoy.
And we've always kind of decried, the black and white.
You know, you have to have one date night, you cannot talk about business, you have to you should you must blah blah blah.
12:22
I think you can do whatever you want and this is like this is the life that we like and this is the marriage.
The what we do marriage, the way we in the way we envision marriage and it works within our Dynamic and that's all we know.
And so you know for people who have similar Mission values and Lifestyles, then I think those are the three things that for us have to be in alignment.
12:40
Any kind of long-term partnership.
It's like you got to want to do the same epics thing.
You have to want to get there the same way and then the lifestyle is like you do in the meantime.
Yeah.
And I think, you know what, people all say this, which is what people see in terms of like us in the business setting and working together and doing all that like we actually do, I have always intentionally like tried not to because I actually is a pattern when we had Jim launch, which is I don't want to show, like husband and wife, Alex and Leland front of our team because I don't want them to that too.
13:10
Attract or distract from business.
And so, like, how we are in private, when we're not in.
Front of other, people is very different than how we are in front of people to.
And that is like, so we're super playful, super funny, playful tons of humor Dragon claw, light-hearted, you know, very touchy.
13:28
You know, like, that's one thing that like, I actually, when we had the company, I was like, oh, like I just because you go just had your spouse, but in front of the team to, like, be hugging doing all that, other than being at quarterly.
Yeah, that's a little weird.
I try Train ourselves, not to do that.
Some part of other people and if anything he's like, no, like unified front.
13:44
It's just like, I mean, she's like, I would imagine just like parenting, right?
May not have tits, but I would imagine just like parenting unified front.
Like we don't disagree publicly if there's ever anything.
Like, if there is anything we're like hey after the meal that in private.
Yeah.
Like I thought we were not doing that.
Yeah.
Where did that come from?
Oh, I thought you were talking about this like my bad.
14:02
I'll let him know in slack.
No, big deal.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, just being sensitive to other people in the room.
You know, I think especially like so many people are hesitant to work for, huh?
And wife Duo because they're worried like about the stability of the relationship and how you disagree, and how you solve arguments on stuffing last thing we ever want to do, is bring any, any sort of personal element in like, in front of our team, besides I was, are intermediate team, which is like, you know, Caleb who does video.
14:24
He's gonna see us together like in our own element and same with Reas but besides that nobody really sees.
Got it, got it.
So, with all these businesses, you're buying, how do you factor in, like the economy?
Because I've heard you talk about this on your videos talking about.
14:40
Like the vehicle at which you're in, right?
Like, if you're, you got a ship, that's got a lot of wind behind its way easier to go with that, right?
And so we see the economy, doing whatever.
It's going to do.
How do you guys have a gate this?
So I will take this.
So one is what's the marketplace?
14:56
We're going after?
So the marketplace that we're going after is you learning which as a category is set to two and a half X over the next five years now compared to like anything else.
That's great growth.
So from like the wind behind the sales perspective, we've got that and I think a big part of that is because formal education is being disrupted.
15:13
I think, because a lot of people are looking or seeking out alternative education sources to make money, right?
Because, and this is not me to cry or sing colleges bed.
It's just that a lot of people can't afford to spend four years and a hundred thousand dollars and not make money for that period of time to then make the same amount of money that they could just not doing that experience.
15:31
And so like the opportunity cost is massive.
And so if I say it differently, is that the demand for income producing skills has not gone away the supply.
Of formal the formal supply of it has.
And so they are seeking Alternatives and so that is why that market is growing.
15:47
So number one, is that number two is at NAU no bad economy future, especially an inflationary environment businesses that have low Capital expenses and high cash flow tend to be businesses.
That fare better because there's easier pricing power and because you don't have to, you know, put Capital back into the business to expand it.
16:05
It's easier to those businesses are more flexible and so the types of businesses that we work with are by Nature, low Capital, expense businesses, High, cash flow.
And so, for those reasons, we feel really well equipped for, you know, an inflationary period that might come in the future.
You know, everybody has a plan until you get hit in the face but as far as we can see, we feel pretty good because things have to go on and so it's like okay well if we can mitigate these risks at least then we can charge forward and deal with things as they come.
16:33
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn-out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free to check that out if that's what you are into.
16:49
And if not keep enjoying the show, Yeah, I mean it comes down to their very flexible businesses and so if you have a flexible infrastructure and you have a flexible model and these aren't businesses with the huge Capital expenditures and giant buildings and real say, all over the freaking world, it's not going to be that hard to Pivot and honestly, like, during covid, with all three of our businesses, was it easy?
17:11
No, it was a pain in the ass, but did we do it?
Yes, and it was something that made the company's better off.
And so, we factor that in when were looking at the entrepreneur and are they, the kind of person that could, you know, do well in economic downturn?
And Then the company as well.
And most people in an economic downturn like the demand again for income producing skills does not go away, right?
17:30
The demand for, you know, other things that are like nice things might decrease.
But like when there is no money, the demand for money is just as high if not higher and many of the businesses that we have teach kind of niched, income producing skills.
So might be, you know, how to fix a hair salon.
17:46
How to be a plumber?
How to whatever those are?
I think, always going to be in demand?
Yeah, second to that.
Is we do try to pick people.
We Believe are Market leaders, or could be Market leaders.
Yeah, it's a big one.
So we're not looking at people that are distressed or that we don't think have the potential to take over their specific Niche.
18:03
And so typically in an economic downturn, the market leader survives.
And so, we felt confident that those people could do that, right?
When you guys look at these different businesses, you know, you're talking about Market leaders and, you know, as far as in the space and generating revenue and everything.
18:19
But, you know, like a lot of businesses probably like Jim launch early on On are very dependent on, you know, the founder right there.
The face, they're driving all the traffic even today and many of my businesses like do Ryan stops making content.
You know, where the leads coming from, right?
Yeah.
18:35
What do you guys do to address that if any you mean so that we could like potentially exit them in the future kind of thing?
It's always honestly with all them that is part of the plan.
So that's something that takes I want to say.
If you're starting your like I want to sell my business and I want it to be like Rock Solid, maybe it's 18 to 24 months.
18:53
I would say if you want to do it right and like really rock solid three years.
So, most of these companies are three year to five year plan, involves out.
So it's, how are we going to basically like, you know, diversify your risk of the founder, you know?
Because at some point if they want to exit, I think most of want the freedom to choose, right.
19:10
Like, they don't necessarily want to exit but they would like the freedom or the opportunity to decide at that point time and so we are always setting them up for that.
And so, it's, it's, you know, I think that it's more complicated when you are the founder, then when you're somebody like myself, looking at it because I Look at my you just have to put other people you proud for every Alex.
19:26
I need like ten people, right?
And that's all it is.
It's just the 10 people that fill the skills get gaps and then the 10 people that can you know, essentially act as characters to fill in for one face, right?
So can 10 people fill the gap of one?
Alex.
Yes.
Is there more operational complexity?
19:42
Yes, but it's more sturdy business.
So oftentimes like a personality brand, it's basically diversifying and adding going from like, one personality to like, you know, you to Disneyland is not just Mickey Mouse.
It's all the characters.
Dot.
Yes, the Alice in Wonderland and Snow White like all these people.
It's like how do we create that within each of the businesses?
19:59
And so a lot of those businesses, they have people that, you know, our Niche, experts teaching their customers because they're coaching businesses and those people typically, you know, you kind of make subject matter, experts that can take over a different subject matter.
And then the other one is taking, you know, their leadership team and kind of like raising them up to be more forward facing kind of taking the internal and making external.
20:18
So there's a few different ways you can do it but it's just a process.
And if you if you do it over time, it's honestly Not that hard.
Yeah, you you pretty much described what I've been thinking because like I don't want to sell.
But yeah, I'd like the have the option one day, right?
And so we started thinking about this at like the one I'm most prevalent at which is the real estate education business, right?
20:39
And so I said, you know what, we're really good at making content.
Why Don't We Just Produce it for other people in the community?
Right?
And so, we took like our best students who I thought were great on camera.
We took our coaches, everyone else.
And so we created a whole separate you Channel Instagram, everything else and they're grown really quick just because our post-production, team makes them the exact same.
20:59
Like it's just send us the videos and we'll make the thumbnails and everything else that we know works.
And so that's actually helped out a lot.
And like we're launching a new podcast.
I am not the host, you know?
And just trying to diversify.
I think the more that you edify those people.
21:17
Yeah.
So it's like the more that one you associate with them like you're seeing with them before, they're on their own and then you edify them.
Um, when they are on their own, you consistently do that over and over and over again and just like as an added point because this is the subject of the next book.
Lots of stay on this but like typically if it's a Founder face, you know, Face Forward thing, then it's going to be through paid ads organic for the most part, right?
21:38
And there are so many other ways to get customers and so it's like okay well how do we get an affiliate Channel set up?
How do we get a referral, you know, really strong referral program in place?
How do we get a big manual outbound team set up?
How do we do huge blasts, you know, two different lists that we can that we can.
Hit.
And so there's, there's these different things that we can set up and we can do that.
21:56
And, by building an employee team, we can build a customer teams can.
But affiliate networks, all of those things we can do that are not found are facing at all.
And I can tell you that when Jim launch the sails past 50% of total sales came from the opposite team.
I can't explain the amount of like peace of mind to just know that every day we're doing 5,000 miles and that's going to turn into underground or whatever you know what I mean.
22:17
And so we just know that if I die tomorrow, all these people have jobs, all these families are secure Our mortgages are paid like everything's going to be okay.
And that's why, you know, a private Equity or whatever feels comfortable coming in to purchase a business like that because they're like, oh, they're not only Diversified across channels, but they're Diversified across methods of acquisition, right?
22:37
It's not just social media, right?
Exact.
This is like one, right?
Like we could cold call, we could cold email, we could cold.
DM like there's so many different ways that we could do this.
We could build, we could do paid ads to get, Affiliates and then build a thousand person to Plate.
Like so Prestige Labs was 100% Affiliates is all affiliates. 3,000 civilians, Alan was 100% Affiliates Victory.
22:56
It's super fun.
Sweet.
A two-level affiliate set up in in Allen because for the same reason I was around, I want to be the face of this and so there's so many ways you can do it and even like even in the paid ads, you can put the mascots because put your customers more, right?
Have the customers in the results and the experiences and the workshops and things like that, be far more prevalent because the end of the day, like, they don't really care about us.
23:15
They care about what they see in us.
They care about what they relate to.
And so if we can, if we can draw that line or just kind of lean into that more, we can kind of like, Step off camera and it's like, oh, wow, this person is just like me and this business help that person succeed, whatever.
Yeah, I love that.
So you mentioned that if you're going to replace the founder it might take 10 people to replace Alex, right?
23:35
What are you guys doing to recruit top tier talent for ourselves in general for you?
And, you know, helping the founders, you know, hire better.
I think that, you know, we're at a point now where it's actually we're attracting a lot of top talent which is something that I haven't had for the last six years.
23:53
It's honestly it's really like an unfair advantage and that's what I've experienced to.
I totally.
Yes I tell people I'm just like I make a post and we get so many like hot applicants and it's great but like that's not the reality for most people.
Yeah.
So for most people, I mean like when we had Jim launch like to get top level top-tier, Talent is investment, you know, I think that there's two ways that you can get it, which is one you can go through your network and you can try and literally like, pull whatever favor you can to get your first top-level person.
24:23
And if you can get one that edifies you to every other person that you're ever going to talk to that, it's not a crazy idea to join your company, right?
So like for Jim launch, like we got our CFO and I'll go with the second way, which is using a recruiter or paying somebody to go recruit if you don't have that in-house.
24:39
Because the thing is log people don't have Recruiters in house.
They also don't have the time to dedicate to really finding the right kind of person.
So, I mean, before worked out a lot of money on a couple positions and I'm glad because once you have one or two people that are top tier talent that you Did pay a lot of money for it.
24:54
Then those people have networks and then those people also edify you.
So you start to look more legit.
So it's hard to legitimize your company and so then you do attract Talent more naturally, whereas in the beginning you just don't have that Advantage.
So you don't have anything to leverage besides your money and so it's, you know either your time you can try and DM and you know on LinkedIn and crap yourself.
25:14
I guess as a Founder which I mean I've done it or you could pay a recruiter to do it for you to find that talent.
I really just think like we basically gotten in, I'll tell you how we found our CFO, we got An in with one of our friends said, I can get you with this recruiting company but they typically only take companies above 100 million.
At that point we weren't there and he was like, but I'll tell them like, how fast you're growing all the stuff.
25:33
And so because of that, we got to use them and because their name, their brand of recruiting, right?
So when they reach out to somebody, they're like, oh shit.
They're like, they were literally number one in the nation.
So they're like, I'm going to answer to them because there's a number one firm.
And so, I think you have to associate with somebody else's brand, if you don't have a strong enough one, and so, for our companies, like I Vision when they were trying to fill roles for them, you know, like we do leverage hours to find people for them because we have so much inbound like hey, do you need an operator for a company and being a sales manager for go?
26:02
So we can just throw that back into the big competitor, you know.
That's a big thing that we can help with the portfolio companies because also like, to her point about like the legitimacy if they're like, oh your portfolio's doing, you know, 150 million a year like okay.
Like I feel much better that you guys are all on board in this and you guys are investment firm.
26:19
That's really like see something here too.
So then they feel way more at ease.
And so, we will, you know, will screen and vet some of the final candidates especially like, leadership and up and so like we can attract them, we can vet them, and then we can place them.
And then it also gives us from operating perspective, we get multiple lines inside of the business.
26:34
So we know what's going on because it's, you know, sometimes the founder doesn't communicate all the time, because they're busy, whatever.
And so we have other people who are in the company that know and like and trust us to.
And so it gives us so much more Intel to how the business is doing.
So we can keep a much better pulse on what we can do to help them.
So so you're telling me acquisition outcomes are recruiting company.
26:52
Now, that's I mean I mean that's actually yeah because when we were deciding what we want to build, you know, Alex is saying, this is what I want and I was saying this what I want and then we kind of put sign together.
It's always like a mesh of the to and so like what I really love doing is finding talent for people, like, I love doing it for my own teams and so I was like, I think I'm good at it and I think I'm really good at helping people with it and that's why we decide like the most Hands-On piece that we are with the businesses is recruiting.
27:17
So it's repeating their leadership and that was the number one thing you said from the beginning, you were like people, yeah, that's what they all need.
Yeah, and it makes sense like that's the thing, you're helping, probably the most with its the phase of growth that they're in.
So MIT part of it must be that that tends to be the problem that most of Mariah.
And so we have morphed ourself into becoming like, the best solution for that thing.
27:36
I don't know if it's the chicken or the egg, but just the more high quality people, we place into Enterprises where there's a deficit, the faster the growth is.
And so, we just like everyone's one Higher away from the business of their dreams.
Yeah, now I 100% agree.
And I mean, for acquisition.com, it gives you guys so much.
27:53
That competitive Advantage.
Not only just like, yeah, we're going to potentially give you money, you're obviously going to get our expertise.
But by the way, you're getting our Network to.
Yeah, it's like shark tank, but a son.
Yeah, that's super cool.
Well, I really do, I could talk all day to you guys because there's just so much, you know, you guys have going on and knowledge and everything.
28:11
But, you know, I appreciate you guys coming on the show.
It's been a lot of fun and I know the audience.
Got a lot of value out of it.
So yeah, I mean we appreciate you having a song you know, I appreciate you minute drive.
That's true.
No.
And I appreciate the question because it was, you know, we don't get to talk about like as much higher level business stuff.
28:29
Or what we do every day that often you had never.
So this was actually really fun for us because we almost exclusively we talk.
We talk about this stuff.
Everything is always but nobody asks us about it.







0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
When you do Niche down sometimes you can still make more money because of all the points I said, Earlier, which is you're not even close to tapping the methods, the platform, the media, where the total amount of volume you need to do to reach all of those people within that Niche, welcome to the game, where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:44
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and Buffett had documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy your Market isn't capped.
Your mindset, is capped.
Let me tell you what, I mean.
So the other day, I had a business owner who was spending, fifty thousand dollars a month, marking his app, that was a fitness app saying he didn't want to spend any more money because he thought he had saturated Facebook for weight loss.
1:11
A 60 billion dollar industry in America.
I shit you not mind you.
This guy's making three million dollars a year, he's not a moron, but what, but his mindset was capped, tell you different story.
I had an agency owner also spending fifty thousand dollar month also on Facebook in the chiropractor Niche.
1:28
Saying, hey, I think, I think I've saturated my market I was like you've saturated your Market.
A sixteen billion dollar industry of chiropractor with your six hundred thousand dollars of spend.
Let me zoom out on this for you so you only run ads on Facebook.
1:44
I was like do you run ads on Hulu you run it on YouTube.
Do you run them on Spotify and you do Direct Mail?
Do you do radio ads?
He's like no no no it's like okay let's zoom out even further as a do.
Do cold calls do you do cold emails?
Do you do cold voice mail drop?
She's like well.
2:00
Out.
Okay, let's zoom out, even further do you make content for chiropractors use like?
Well, no on any platform.
No, okay, so what we just walk through is one of the multiple different Frameworks on a walk.
You through, in terms of how you can uncap your mindset, so you can realize how big the industries that you're probably in really are.
2:19
And the reason this is so important is because many people hit this first plateau and then think, oh, I should start a new business.
Oh, I should start a new product line when really they need to confront the problem ahead.
Ed, which is they don't know how to get more customers within their current Niche or space and the easiest way to know that it's your mindset.
2:37
That's cap.
Not your Market is just Google how big the market is that you're in.
If you're an HVAC and you're making two million bucks a year, and it's a 50 billion dollar industry, guess what?
You're probably not capped.
So, here's how we walk through it.
Number one, from the marketing perspective, you have your method, which is the biggest thing you do, it's running, paid ads, it's making content is doing Outreach.
2:59
It's Getting referrals, it's getting Affiliates.
Those are the methods that you do to get customers underneath of that.
You've got the platforms that you do that method on.
So you've got Facebook, you've got phones, you've got email, you've got Hulu, you've got YouTube, you've got to Bula, you've got Google at like, there's so many different places that attention wrap underneath.
3:18
The vet you've got the media on the platform, so if I'm on Instagram, I can go Instagram DMS.
I'm gonna scram stories, I can go Instagram, post, I can go Instagram reels.
I have all these different media within the platform.
Form and on top of that one level below, that is, how much volume am I doing within that media?
3:35
Am I posting one story a day.
One story a week, my posting multiple stories today.
Multiple posted a, what's my by spending $100 a day or thousand dollars a day, or a hundred thousand dollars a day?
So each of these are levers and this is just framework number one, in terms of how much available is out there.
3:53
And if you've just done one method on one platform, with one medium and you have an increased, the Of the of that thing.
And here's The Tell-Tale sign, if there are other people in your Market marking to the same audience.
So like that, chiropractor agency, if there are 50, 100, other agencies that market to chiropractors, and they're all marketing on Facebook, which many of them were.
4:16
We're still probably are, then you could probably add up all of the ads meant of every one of those agencies together.
And that just gives you an idea of how much there is available in terms of number new clients per month that all of them together or Selling just on Facebook ads.
4:33
Your Market isn't capped, your mindset, is capped now, rerun real quick.
If you're trying to pick what Market you're going to go in, I talked about this in my book and really it offers there's four things I want to look at number one.
Are they in pain am?
I actually solving a problem for someone number two?
Are they easy to find because I can't find them.
4:50
I can't sell them.
Right?
Number three.
Do they have the money to spend in order to buy my thing is if I'm trying to sell to broke people's probably not going to be good idea number four.
Are they growing?
I don't want to be selling a newspapers.
I want to be selling to something like old people that are there's more of them every single day that are retiring, right?
5:07
So I want to go where the winds are.
So if I have a market that checks all four of those boxes, then I know I'm at least in a good opportunity.
Now, once I have that in place and I looked at the four variables that I talked about earlier, can I do a new method?
Can I do it on a new platform?
5:23
Can I expand a multiple types of media within the platform early on?
Can I increase the volume that I'm currently doing in the mediums that I have right?
These are the things you could do immediately to get more customers, get more leads today.
The next way to think about this is, let's say you've kept all of those things.
5:40
All right, which is probably not true.
But let's say you did because we're going into Fantasyland here.
Okay.
We want a magic ride together.
We're going to round This Magic Carpet Ride.
Some.
You could time I'm gonna introduce you to what I call the Pyramid of markets.
All right.
There are five directions that you can go in any market place to expand.
5:58
I'll tell you a story of when Learn this.
So I went to this meet up of eight entrepreneurs together.
We were doing five hundred million dollars a year in Revenue.
So this is like a multi-billion dollar room, which is kind of cool and I was one of the smallest guys there.
I think I was doing 30 ish million a year at the time.
6:14
So I was small, there's only eight guys do the math, I was on the small guys and the thing is that I saw these guys go around and gals, there's girls there too and they were talking about their businesses and take this the way.
I mean it was like these guys are smarter than me and I didn't feel like they worked any harder.
6:29
Harder than me, I was like, why are they making so much more money than two main factors?
Number one, almost all of them had been in business longer than me, big lesson.
Big shit takes time and I had to learn that, like, I want you to feel that because it took me a long time to learn.
All right, there's not many billionaires under 30, there's like that made it themselves like 10 in the whole fucking world, right?
6:53
There's not a lot of them and fact-checkers maybe is 20 who fucking cares?
It's not a lot.
The second lesson that I learned is that all of them are going after bigger markets than I was.
All right because at a certain point, you do saturate a niche and I'm going to give you context to what that means.
So Jim wants is a licensing company.
7:09
We specifically at the time only focused on microchips now, we do health clubs and Mike regimes because they expanded the market right now.
I'll tell you exactly the process in a second, how we did that.
But within that pie, there was only 50 thousand micrograms United States, we'd already spoken with 20,000 of them.
7:25
So we had And still do have really maximized every media.
Every chance we go call the cold email quickly.
Yeah, we run ads on Google runs a YouTuber, friends on Facebook or Instagram.
We make content like we do all the stuff.
We have books, we have three trainings.
We like we do all that stuff there, and we have really done a good job.
7:43
Building a market leading business there.
But again, it wasn't as big as theirs and that's why we decided to open up another Avenue, and that's where the pyramid comes in, so that's when we talk about.
So, if you imagine a pyramid in your head, okay?
And you're currently at the middle and I'm not going.
Use Jim's.
I'll use salons to give a different example, to mix it up.
8:01
So if you deal with hair salons, for whatever you maybe, you sell pair stuff, or maybe you sell equipment, or maybe you sell Consulting Services, maybe some marketing doesn't really matter.
You sell to salon owners, okay?
That's your current market.
You can go in five directions, okay?
8:17
Number one is, you can go up Market, that means on the pyramid there are fewer people on the higher part of the market and they cost more, but they spend more typically higher quality customers.
That's where you go into Enterprise sales, it's bigger stuff we're talking franchisors, as in people who have hundreds of locations under one umbrella or multi-location or chain owners.
8:37
That's up market for salon owners.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
8:59
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast, so that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
9:18
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
9:36
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under leads and so that you can not miss out.
Out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
9:54
Downmarket the second Direction you can go, is you go to hair stylist?
You talk about people who are renting chairs and doing hair with their hands full time.
Not running the business of hair.
There's 10 times more of them than their RVs, and there's one tenth as many upmarket is, there's down.
So imagine a factor of 10 or sometimes more.
10:12
As you move up or down the ladder or the pyramid.
The third Direction, you can go is you can go adjacent.
So that means like sidestepping.
So what's something that's similar in nature?
But not See the same that would be like, a Lash & Nails, place or a lip Place, whatever some sort of Side Market like Med, Spas might, depending on the Aesthetics of it might be one there too.
10:36
Right.
So there's different adjacent, markets of, if I were a chiropractor it might be Physical Therapy, like they're similar but different right?
You want similar business characteristics, similar Avatar in terms of the owner, similar types of customer within the same larger industry.
Now, when you do that you just open up another vertical and you attack it.
10:54
The same way you did your first one.
All right, the fourth Direction you can go, is you actually go broader.
So if you had our original pyramid of the salon, now imagine a pyramid, that's all the way like this, and it includes all the adjacent pyramids within it, which would then just be Beauty.
11:11
So that includes Med Spa, owners, lash owners Botox places, which is med Spas.
So, I donors, massage studio, like all of that, kind of falls in the same psychographic, they serve the same customer, right?
So, that would be going broader if we wanted to really open up the net.
11:27
Now the last Direction you can go and this is an interesting point is the only one that makes your markets smaller.
But it doesn't necessarily mean, you make less money, which is you could become narrower.
And so that means is, instead of just being all salon owners, it might be salon owners.
11:43
You specialize in extensions or a blow hair place, you know, they just do the Brazilian Blowouts.
Like they're just doing that specific thing.
And what's interesting is Often times when you do Niche down, sometimes you can still make more money because of all the points I said earlier, which is you're not even close to tapping the methods, the platform, the media, or the total amount of volume you need to do to reach all of those people within that Niche.
12:08
And so then when you Niche down become more specific with your messaging, your offer and the value deliver.
Because if you can make this one specific Avatar, 10 times, more money than the broad Avatar, you should absolutely Niche down on that one and be specific in your messaging.
And we've done this with companies and Dumbledore.
12:24
Triple or sometimes 5x the Rev in the business despite cutting down who they Market you buy like 85% by getting really specific about who we serve best and so big pictures zooming, all the way back out.
If right now, you're not getting as many leads as you want.
And you think that your Market is saturated because of what you do and realistically all you did is, you know, there's five other competitors and you think you have 20% of the market, you should be looking the way.
12:48
An investor looks at the marketplace and says this is a 60 billion dollar industry.
I have not even 1% of this industry in order for me to reach everyone before even going into this second pyramid of how I can expand.
I should be looking at SEC.
13:03
I've already talked to 40% of the industry, like, you talk to 40% of the industry.
You have all of my blessing to start the next vertical or move one of those five directions.
The last thing I'll do is I'll tell you the end, why we decided to do health clubs, as our next move within the licensing business, a gym launch.
13:18
But my whole point here is, you have your four initial levers that you can immediately pull To grow, how many leads are getting and you probably haven't even done one of them.
So do one of them do another one of them and then eventually try and do them all.
And if you're like, man that's going to take a long time.
13:35
Welcome to the main point.
I had originally which is it takes time to build big shit.
Usually there's this big checklist that you probably already know as an entrepreneur of what I call the should dues.
I know, I should be calling Miley's faster.
I know I should be following up better.
I know I should be making more content.
I know.
13:50
I should start a cold.
Call thing I know I should be running ads on more platforms.
But you're not.
And so instead of just doing the easy thing, which is just going straight to your room audience and trying to make another offer confront, the work that has to be done to build a much larger Enterprise at search when Avatar.
Now, let me tell you about why we decided to do health clubs.
14:08
So, when we looked at our adjacent markets at Jim watch, we have Micro gym owner.
So a micro gym owner is a lot of those Boutique studio.
So you see the orange theory is the f45 is the crossfit's, the, whatever those types of businesses to be clear.
This is not an affiliation with any of those.
This me just naming them.
Those types of businesses where you have large group training facility, where you have like 10 to 25 people in a class setting that are doing usually circuit training of some sort, all right?
14:35
They became really popular right after the crash in 2008, because people can afford personal training anymore and so group Cheney became the more economic option and then there's a big opportunity there and then it got super, super flooded with people in that market.
Anyways, I won't go into Jim history, but the reason that we decided to go up Market rather.
14:54
Rather than down Market, you're like, wait, why is that one saturated?
I'll tell you, because literally the amount of Jim's per capita in marketplaces that were people who are interested in buying like the, we're talking thousands without like cross it dropped by 30%, because their gyms went out of business because there were too many of them used to people just like open a CrossFit and the, like, it would just fill up.
15:13
And now there was like 20, crossfit's in a city and then that same base got divided by 20 and then people got hurt and it was so we could have gone.
Down Market to personal trainers.
We could have gone a market housetops.
15:28
We could have gone to physical therapist or chiropractor is actually very similar in nature.
We could have gone to any type of Health studio in general.
If we wanted to go broader or we could have gone more narrow, which at that point, we already taken that big narrow step which was 30 customers signed lease one employee for micro gym owner.
15:49
So like we were very specific on who we knew and so we'd already taken that step.
But those are the directions we could have gone in.
The reason we went to hell.
Clubs, is that?
I asked our team one question.
I said of these different potential Avenues or avatars that we could pursue, who do we provide the most value to buy absolute metrics in terms of dollars made and it was by like it was no contest health club Owners.
16:13
We are able to immediately make them like tens of thousands of dollars within the first like month by restructuring.
Some of the things that we could do within their business and then like doubling or tripling, their bottom line.
Adding by reorganizing their onboarding process, reorganizing their sales process, how they handle retention, and how they handle up sells for personal training and supplements and things like that within their space.
16:36
And it turned out that those business owners were actually, even better fits in a lot of ways because they were business owners first, a lot of micro gym.
Owners are Fitness passionate first business second.
And so we have to break a lot of beliefs with them to be, like, it's okay to sell.
It's okay to charge more like, don't sell from your own wallet.
16:52
Like supplements, aren't evil, like having multiple revenue streams, Seems like maybe you should pay people on time.
Like there are things that we have to do two small business.
I'm just being real it is what it is like some people starting out, they don't know.
That's fine, that's why we're here.
But with the health club Owners they already have ten employees.
They've already put five hundred thousand dollars into the facility like they understand return on Capital and so for them when they saw what we could make them versus what it cost, it was a much more of a no-brainer than someone who's still always worried about how they're going to pay payroll tomorrow, the personal trainer version of that, for that business, we could add less You there's way more of them, but for us, I tend to if you've noticed any of the business that I do, I tend to go up, Mark it because I prefer to always sell out about our customers.
17:35
That's me.
And I also liked building things top down in general and I kind of started in the middle there so that we weren't at.
We weren't at Enterprise Health Club multi you know, location and we weren't a personal trainer and that was basically cuz I didn't know the stuff that I'm sharing with you right now.
When I started that business but I did know enough to stick with what I picked.
17:53
And so if I started all over again, maybe I would start a health clubs.
Yeah, but I picked what I had and I we built a great business off of that.
So to wrap that up, the reason we picked the health clubs was because we could provide more value, them more consistently and we already had multiple channels that we knew could work to acquire them.
18:11
So it's very minimal operational change, we didn't need to learn a lot of new stuff.
We did a beta test with 20 of them, they crushed it.
And then we use that data to substantiate.
How we'd market?
And set expectations for new health clubs.
I would come in of how we can help them improve their job.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show a classic employee mistake, is you look at all the revenue and you say, oh, that must be the owners that must be Alex's.
And every business owner who's watching, this is laughing themselves because they know that is so far from the truth.
It is hilarious.
But People still make that logical fallacy.
0:34
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to build an acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to under million dollars and Beyond, I hope you share and enjoy.
When I were to show you some of the lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:53
So, volatility and risk, I had a conversation with somebody on my team and it was such a good conversation.
I wish I had recorded it.
And so this is going to be my attempt to break this down for you.
If you are an entrepreneur and you have a sales team, you can send this to your sales team.
If you are kind of still in the selling mode, this will apply to you.
1:10
And if you're an employee and you're looking at making more money and you want to become wealthy, this will also apply to you too.
All right, so the employee question came to me they requested like a 15-minute time which any Something important cuz it doesn't happen very often.
And so I was kind of looking for, I was like, hey, what's up man?
And what was interesting in the first, you know, for 25 minutes of the call.
1:28
The first was just like, I just really want to pick your brain, unlike the direction of my life, and I was like, well, that's a really big amorphous.
Topic.
Like, what problem are we solving, right?
Which is always if you ever talk to me, it's usually like what problem are we solving, right?
Because then we can start tackling it.
And I don't think they knew what the problem that they were solving was because what it was is in reality.
They had family members who are saying, hey, you shouldn't be in this job, you need something that's more secure, all right?
1:49
And so as I I dug deeper into this conversation.
There were so many nuggets that came out of it that I think I've wrote them all down on a list and I'm going to try and hit as many by can.
Alright.
And so the first thing was this person in particular is on our sales team.
We've a lot of it.
You know 20 plus sales people and their family said you should get out of sales.
2:06
You need something that is less risky, alright?
And so the first thing I asked was do these people who are giving you this advice, make more money than you and he said no and I was like rule number one, do not listen to people poorer than you about advice on money.
For everyone who has family or friends or parents, who make less money than you, or make the same amount of money than you at a at an older age, don't listen to them.
2:29
All right, listen people who make far, far, far more money.
I don't even think you should listen millionaires.
Listen to billionaires.
Number two, they had a must understanding of volatility and risk.
All right, this is a classic poor person thing.
All right, I'm going to break this down for you with an example.
Let's say I own an insurance company, okay?
2:46
And I know statistically that every nine years, there's going To be a super catastrophe, there's gonna be a hurricane which Katrina hurricane Maria, something that's going to destroy everything and I'm going to lose a buttload.
Okay?
Now that means that one out of nine years, I'm going to get destroyed, but the other eight years, I'm probably going to be a lot of money.
3:02
So the question is, is my insurance business risky.
The answer is no, and I'm going to make the assumptions that I have a sound business model, and margins, and all that stuff.
But the reality is that my insurance business is not risky.
It is volatile.
Those are not the same things, all right?
If you flatten out the curve, over the nine years, and look at the growth that's going to occur.
3:20
My business based on those metrics, I will be far better off than something that might be less.
Volatile less up and down, but not grow as quickly.
All right?
Sales in is an example of a highly volatile profession that still is low risk, and let me explain why.
3:38
Who do you think is the most secure in the company?
Somebody who generates revenue or someone who costs overhead, someone who generates Revenue.
So, salespeople are by definition people who generate Revenue which means they are the lowest.
Risk in a company.
Now, for them, they may have more volatility from paycheck to paycheck, but in general, people in sales, make more money than people who are not in sales, all right?
4:00
And if you're good at sales even more so which this individual is right?
And so with the concept of volatility versus risk I said what you should do if you want to decrease the volatility or in your life and get the up side benefit of your position is, you need to decrease your expenses to your salary.
4:16
All right, so his salary and I said now, your salary is what you need to assume your All you're going to make.
Now, I'm not saying live on your salary.
I'm saying you should be saving off of your salary now, think about this, let's say this individual is living on as it has a salary of less a forty thousand dollars a year.
All right.
4:31
Now if I can get them to live on 25k, right a year then that Delta can be invested in the S&P 500 and within 20 years, their top, 1% crazy.
I know and if you split, where you live with other people and you really try and live down, you can do it faster, right?
4:47
But the reality is that this isn't all the person's going to make but you should play.
Man, like it is because then what happens is, all of this becomes gravy and even if you have a bad month, which there's no sales person in our company, that would not, that would not make any sales, it doesn't, it doesn't even make sense, right?
5:03
But even if you had a bad month, this person would still feel like they're making progress towards their wealth, freedom and Independence goals, all right?
But the reality is that they would probably make, you know, another hundred K per year on top of that.
But now they've set up their lifestyle such that their expense to income ratio is.
5:19
So favorable, That they can save so much of their money, they get to their goal faster, which is the next point which is wealth.
And I've said this before and I'll say it again is not a number and this is one of the things that I did to tease out this conversation.
Wealth is a ratio.
It's a ratio between how much you spend versus how much you make it's in Flow versus outflow.
5:38
Not I need to make X to be free.
Now, if you want to have a crazy Lifestyle, the reality is, it's a not that fun.
Not definitely not fulfilling and I'll tell you what is way more fulfilling having the freedom and the peace of mind which is actual people I want knowing that you're going to be set up for life and the way to do that is to have a strong income to expense ratio.
5:56
And so this individual, if he's making 140,000 and he lives on 25, he's making nine times more.
Whatever the math is there, whatever, six times.
Six times more, you make it six times more.
Then he spending, that's a great income to expense ratio.
His wealth is going to build very very quickly, right?
6:12
And with that, that extra money will more than cover his twenty five thousand dollars a year, right?
Like the 115 that he's saving in this, All right, every year in pure cash, he's already saving four and a half years of income, every year.
Now, let alone, the fact that if he's just gaining, it 10%, right, SPS 9.
6:30
But, like, just for maths egg.
Let's just say 10 that he's going to be generating self compounding growth, which means that in two years, two years will be at 230, right?
He would technically be able to retire on his current income.
Think about that, right now.
6:46
If you want to, if you want to spend more than fine, but litter, there's a 24 month.
Way of saving your way to wealth right now what I want to return two hundred thirty thousand dollars.
No.
But if you worked for a decade by the end of that period of time, you have to, you know, to point something, right?
And at that point, he can totally just retire and not only that.
7:02
If he keeps his expense ratio 25,000 or maybe even bumps himself to 40, or 50,000, was your which for most people is a really comfortable living, you know, as long as you're not doing anything crazy, right?
And if you do it that way, life will be better.
Now, the next point that came up was he was like, okay, well, I've got I've got some debt so what should I do?
7:18
He's like, so I've got student loan debt, I've Credit card debt.
That's about.
I can't remember.
I think it's 20 grand right between both of those and I was like, okay your student loans have super super, super low interest.
So let's not worry about those.
Let's worry about your credit card because the credit card has 16 percent compounding.
And so, you think about that it's like a negative investment, right?
7:36
You've got something that's compounding against you versus something that's compounding for you.
So, the way to guarantee a 16% compounding rate of return is too deep, is to take away the drags that are at negative sixteen percent.
Alright, so if you're in this situation, the first thing you do is you Pay off your credit card debt.
7:51
All right.
Number one, after that, you're going to have your, your student loans and then your Investments, the reality is the student loans, the interest, because the hell with the government setting them, you know, have set them up.
It's the cost of you learning this however, long ago, I think it's horribly unethical that they do student loans.
I think I'm so wildly again student loans in general in what world would someone ever give an eighteen-year-old access to two hundred thousand dollars who has no skills whatsoever to then?
8:15
Get something that has no return more than what their current earning potential is, it makes no sense.
And if you can't even Encrypt, your way out of it, it is purely a scheme by Banks to make more money purely it makes you a slave to the bank for the rest of your life, but there's no interest on it and so I'm not going to think about that for right now.
Alright, so credit card loans first and then you stack into Investments.
8:33
Now me personally, I just don't like having any debt and so if you want to, it's a personal choice, as even make mathematical sense, it makes emotional sense.
You can pay off the student loans and then everything else gets plowed into the S&P 500.
The reason I say that is because Warren Buffett.
The only, the advice that he's given the people who are managing his will, is that he just wants everything, put in the ass. & p500 smartest investor of all time.
8:53
That's what he's doing.
So I think it is worthwhile advice and very easy to follow.
A Mossad agent quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
9:12
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Next one, and you do this every month, it's called dollar cost averaging.
So that even when it goes down, it goes up.
You're going to participate at all times.
So when it's overpriced, you're still buying and when it's under priced, you're still buying, don't try and time it, so just dollar cost average in and then get rid of any of the anxiety around getting a good deal.
9:34
All right, next one.
So it's like, okay, I want to know how I can grow.
All right, so this is for anyone who's in any company, the closer you can tie yourself to an acquisition channel.
The more valuable are the company because you're you're driving Revenue, right?
And so what I, what I explained to him was I said, listen.
I'll throw my trainings, you know, the different ways of getting clients, pick a channel that were not currently using and in your off time try and figure that channel out and we pay more for leads are for sales that someone goes and brings in on their own compared to stuff that comes in front of marketing.
10:00
Right.
I'll take.
So you're going to get disproportionately paid for those off the bat and then as soon as you figure out that system, I said, come to me and say, hey Alex, I figure out the system, I figure this process is getting us more clients.
I want to build a team and I think that I can show five other guys how to do this and generate revenue, and I just would like a piece.
10:18
Us of all of their sales and I would say absolutely.
And so if he does this, he would be able to two or three X's income as a result of that, right?
And so that is a way of figuring out how to provide more value.
Now, the next thing was, I think this came up from the family to was going off on your own right now.
10:35
Obviously, as the owner of the business, you would think that my incentive is to keep everyone and overtime.
My incentive has shifted, my incentive is, I want to be the best human.
I possibly can be.
And if that means that, that this, it's time for that person to go.
And spread their wings.
Then that's fine.
10:51
And I encourage them and I wish them the absolute best.
That, I mean, that genuinely because I never want to be the person you hold someone back from accomplishing.
Their dreams that being said, understanding risk is important.
So many many, many many, many people.
Many many, many of my sis people make more than many entrepreneurs do.
In fact, it probably got the stats.
I think the average small business owner makes like seventy eight thousand dollars a year.
11:08
Alright, so if my salespeople make 150 or 200 thousand dollars a year and if he does all this thing, he could make five times with the average small business owner makes five times five times.
And that's income, right?
That's what's important.
And so, sometimes you can see the Allure and this is a classic employee mistake, is you look at all the revenue and you say, oh, that must be the owners that must be Alex's.
11:29
And every business owner who's watching, this is laughing themselves because they know that is so far from the truth.
That is hilarious, but people still make that logical fallacy.
And so for perspective, if you are a two hundred thousand dollar a year salesperson, you own, in my mind, a million dollar business because if you're running a 20% net margin after everything that and the thing is is it's not just profit in This, but it's net free cash flows, the amount of money that you as an owner can take out after reinvesting in the business, right?
11:53
And so if you, if you're a salesperson and you're making it a thousand year, it's the same as you owning a million dollar business.
And so many times, and in this instance, depending on your skill set, you may not want to do with HR and finance and figuring out fulfillment and generating leads on your own.
All the other aspects that come with owning a business legal and all the other crap, right?
12:09
And so, I'm not saying, don't be an entrepreneur obviously, when it's winter but I'm saying, I understand adequately understand the risk.
And I think that if I adequately understand the risk, I'm being very very Is that everyone here?
I don't know if I would have become an entrepreneur.
I really don't know because I'm pretty risk-averse, believe it or not.
And I think I've told you, I had a really good paying job before I quit and it was because I was so miserable that I decided to do something else, but I did not have the table.
12:32
Entrepreneur story of like, I was always bad at school and I knew I had to do my own.
Like I didn't have that at all.
I was good at school.
I got a good job and I just I was miserable, so I did something else.
Anyways, next point, I'll give you another saying to work off of track.
Don't slack?
All right.
Easy to remember.
12:47
And so one of the These things that you can do to increase your net worth is start by tracking it.
All right, this is one of the easiest things.
So right now, every week, I get a get an email that has every single one of my assets, everything one, of my bank accounts, all of my portfolios and it has one number at the bottom.
And so, I know every week, how I'm doing, and whether I'm going up and up, now, you might be like, well, man isn't the market volatile.
13:08
Sure.
But I also have other Investments to Etc, but the point is, especially the earlier on you are.
Do you can decrease that psycho now you can do that every quarter.
I'm Just I tend to be obsessive about it.
I like looking at it because I like making progress.
If right now, you are the Sole Provider in your household or you're a solo business owner, or an entrepreneur or even, you know, you have a seven or eight figure business, right?
13:28
But you haven't liked your actual.
Net worth has been surpassed, you know, a million 5 million tracking every day.
The cumulative amount of your bank accounts is one of the single greatest things that I ever did ever like ever ever ever.
And so, it became this habit that first thing in the morning, I would open up my Chase app, I would.
13:46
And the nice thing is if you have one of the Commercial Banks.
They give you dashboards.
You could pull all your accounts and together.
So, if you have two business accounts and then you have a savings to checking personal and then you maybe have like a portfolio all of that stuff you can have in one place, so it's actually pretty cool.
Anyways, I had an Excel sheet that had all my assets on them, all my bank accounts, all my investments in everything.
14:03
And I would take five minutes in the morning and I'll update it and I did it daily.
So I saw every single day and I could just scroll over time and watch my bottom number, continue to go up.
And here's what's magical about this is that when you look at your bank accounts every day, you start to get a pulse on the flow of Of money.
14:18
You start to get a feeling for oh yeah, Tuesday's is when this goes out.
Oh yeah.
On the first week of the month is when this goes out.
But then what happens is all of a sudden you're like, hey, I went down by 20 bucks, let me examine, let me investigate and you look in there and you're like, holy crap.
I've been using the software for however, long cancel, right?
14:35
And so, as soon as you start doing this, you'll start decreasing your plug.
The holes, you'll decrease the, the outflows of money in your life because you're tracking and not slacking.
So, as long as you're not a slacker, become a Tracker, track your net worth and so forth.
Individual, the, the action plan that I made for him so that he could create the wealth that he wanted.
14:52
Was this kind of recap for you, all right?
Number one track, don't slack, you have to track your net worth if you wanted to improve.
So how can you even tracks?
Like how can you personally?
Don't even know what it is track.
Don't slack.
Now, your debt should also be on there.
So if you paying down debt, his net worth will go up.
Because right now, he's got 20,000 dollars net.
15:08
So his net worth is negative, twenty thousand compared to his cash, right?
Boom truck.
Don't slack next pay off high-interest credit cards or high interest loan debt first next dollar cost average.
All of the money that you make an excess of your expenses into the SP mind you.
This is not investment advice.
15:24
I'll probably post a legal disclaimer.
Do whatever the hell you want investment has risks.
There's no guaranteed returns life is risky, you know, no one comes out alive, okay, back to the main point.
So dollar cost average of the SP and actively decrease your expenses as much as humanly possible.
15:39
If you have a salary with variable compensation on top of it, try and save off of living off your salary and if that sounds crazy cool.
Don't be ordinary.
Be Extraordinary.
Do things different because the average person literally retires with nothing.
Don't be like that, you can be different and the thing is all these things we Aspire for a private jets exotic cars, Penthouse, has expensive clothing.
15:58
Fancy restaurants.
I can tell you firsthand.
They're not what they're cracked up to be.
I like BJ's and chilies more than I like Ruth Chris.
I really like my cheap Jorts.
More than any of the fancy pants that are outfits your pants.
I can tell you that when I lived in a $1200, a month apartment in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
16:14
It's just you're really nice place.
I was happy as can be it.
I might have Venus is in no way change having the place that I have.
Now I regret the exotic car that I have and private jets are wildly expensive and you can get anywhere you want on spirit for way less.
So decrease your expenses in terms of increasing the income tie yourself to an acquisition Channel.
16:33
Try and find a new way of acquiring customers at the business that you're currently in is not doing do that and then build a team underneath of you that can do the thing that you just learned how to do, all right?
Because then you will be closer to what I call a Rainmaker and rainmakers are always paid the most Every business and understand that when you do that getting to two hundred thousand dollars a year, you own a million dollar business.
16:53
It's the same thing, right?
Except you have way less risk, because if you want a million dollar business, you can work your ass off, two months in a row and become poorer.
Whereas, if you work your ass off for two months, in a row, in a business, you're going to get richer.
All right?
And that's the difference between being an entrepreneur and employees that a lot of people don't adequately monitor the risk, all right?
17:11
And finally understand the discipline volatility and risk, overall something that goes up and down a lot is not necessarily risky.
It's just Volatile.
And if you can understand that words matter and how you describe things matter and understanding the definition of words, you can put better Concepts and Frameworks around your thought process and make better quality decisions.
17:30
So anyways, I hope you found this valuable.
This was a great conversation, I wish I had recorded it but hopefully you got the nuggets from that.
You can apply to your own life and business.
Keeping awesome.
Leave a comment and I'll catch you guys next bot.








0:00
Total break the myth in this video that you need to go make a million dollars that you need money to make money. 1 2, 3 4, 5 6, 10 different ways, you can make a million dollars for little or zero money down and you can apply this to a thousand dollars.
A hundred dollars, a hundred million dollars.
0:16
You can do any of these things and a door to track the amount of zeros that you feel comfortable with the first thing that you can do.
If you want to make a million dollars, you can sell something for a million dollars.
And as crazy as what I'm saying, sounds you absolutely can sell something for a million dollars, if you Go to an e-commerce store and they're doing a hundred million dollars a year.
0:33
You say, hey, if I can increase your conversion across your entire site, rewrite, your emails redo, your landing pages and I can get you a 5% lift, can I get one percent of that?
So you make them an extra, five million a year, and you get one.
Do you think you can do that?
Yes.
Why are you going to be able to do so much?
0:48
Not because of you but because of who they are you make a million dollars by selling someone else five to ten million dollars of value and you're like I don't know how to do that that's fine but except you don't have to do that and then say I want to learn how to do that and then go get the You love doing that and then you can go sell it.
You can't say that you don't have the money and that's why you can't make money.
1:04
The second one is that you can borrow a million dollars and then buy something and have someone else pay it back, it's fundamentally.
What real estate is you borrow money to buy an asset, you put tenants into the asset, they pay off the money that you never had.
That is what real estate is it?
1:20
I'll tell you a quick story on this.
So buddy mind.
Got into real estate, was flipping houses, didn't think there was a lot of money and it was like, oh, this sucks is so much work and there's all those tent, you know.
So he ended up buying a 14, unit, apartment, building with someone else's money, he didn't have any bought the apartment building, and then, sold it for months later for 500,000 dollars, more and you made 500 Grand in one transaction.
1:38
And so, then he realized that the more sense of the building, he sold the more money he made, then he started getting into commercial real estate, which is even more expensive.
He's like, wait a second.
I can buy something for 10 million and then I can flip it to somebody for 13 and not even hold onto it for that long.
He started flipping 30 or 40 of these a year with just him in a couple of Vieques.
1:56
Number three, is you refinance something for more than you bought it.
So if you're like but I If they'll do that, they will, if it's priced low enough.
So if you have to go talk to a thousand building owners, you will probably get one of them who's willing to depart for their thing for significantly less than it's worth.
And a bank will loan the difference and you don't have to put any money down out of pocket.
2:13
Let's say you have a hundred thousand dollar house and you get it under contract for eighty thousand dollars from them saying that they're willing to give you the house for eighty thousand dollars and then you say cool I can give you 70 and then you got a seller financed me the 10 over the next five years and they say sure and now all of a sudden you just got to get the The bank and the bank finance is 80%.
2:32
And now, you actually just made the difference if you wanted to, and you can take that number and you can do it at a hundred million dollars.
You can do it at any of these levels, but that's the concept is, that makes sense.
Number four, is that you get a contract for something for less than it's worth, and then you sell that contract.
An option is a contract to say that you will be able to buy something at a future date at a price, that is agreed upon today.
2:51
That's what an option is.
If I agree upon a price to somebody today, then I as the person who's getting the option, is hoping that it is worth more than that.
The first you selling the option.
Is hoping that it's either worth less than that in the future.
Or doesn't think it's Gonna Change significantly?
It will just get paid for that tiny option for the contract itself.
3:06
Let's say you've got a million-dollar house.
Now you call a bunch of houses, you're going to be offering 20% below.
What the market rate is that you believe that houses were eventually going to get to somebody who's like, you know what, I've had this house for 30 years.
I bought it for $10 and now it's worth 800 Grand.
You know what?
I'll take the eight hundred grand.
You think it's worth more than 800 and you say thank you.
3:23
I'm going to send you a DocuSign.
They signed the doc you said that you have an option period to flip the house.
You could go to a real estate investor.
Say hey I have a house for nine hundred thousand dollars on sale, right?
It's worth a million.
The guy says okay, sure I'll sign for 900.
This guy's going to put 900 in, you're going to pay 800 to this person and then you make the hundred in between and you put no money down.
3:40
The next one you can do is that you can sell something that's really expensive and get a commission.
Sounds really simple.
You sell a skyscraper that's $100 skyscraper.
You'll get 34 percent of that deal three or four million dollars on a single transaction.
If you sell a 20 million dollar residence and you might like, that's crazy.
They exist.
Look on Zillow, the realtor gets five ish percent of the transaction.
3:59
That's In dollars, never own the asset.
The next one is that you can find somebody who has an audience by whatever they're about to launch early and then sell it later.
Now that one does take some money, it's less but the value of the thing later that's how it balloons.
This is how the entire nft thing worked is that you have tremendous demand for a scarce resource.
4:17
They have the scarce resource and then it balloons the price because there's so many people bidding against each other to get it.
And so getting an early on those types of things, which is why.
If you buy into something pre-ipo, it tends to almost always go up.
Simply by the fact that there's way more eyeballs that are competing for.
Most times the next one is selling units of stuff.
4:32
Super simple but people don't do the math behind this.
I don't even like confining it to a year but you know, we do live in time and so I will explain it that way.
If you wanted to make a million dollars, you got 52 weeks in a year about 20,000 hours a week is what you got to make 20 times 52 technically a million forty thousand for the internet trolls.
4:47
How many different ways can make 20 grand a week?
Well, you can sell 20 people a thousand dollar thing to people at 10,000 are thing.
One person, every four weeks and eighty thousand dollar thing on a weekly basis. 20 people who have 1000 or lifetime, For example, if you have a hundred dollar month membership and the person stays for 10 months on average then if you sell 20 of those every week over time, those will stack up and then you will cap add a million dollars.
5:09
And the only way to grow from that new million is either you got to sell more units or you got to make the thing that you're selling worth more, that's it.
The next one is that you can get people to give you their businesses for no money down, good friend of mine actually did this and he combined for different information businesses into one business and they were all small businesses.
5:25
They were all doing about a million issue year.
I get small is relative but you're like and so you combine them all together.
Be a four million dollar Top Line million-and-a-half.
Bottom line business for no money out of pocket.
He literally said hey I know you don't want to do this business anymore, just give it to me and I'll pay you the income that you were going to make this business for the next two years.
And they said, sure.
5:41
And so we combined all this business together and then overnight, he owned an asset that was doing a million and a half a year in profit and four million, and Top Line, and it cost him nothing to do it.
He owns the asset.
And so, if he turned round and went to say, hey, I'm gonna go sell this.
You probably saw the thing for five million dollars put together, it might cost him two million bucks and he makes the three.
5:57
He made more than a million dollars with no money.
Pocket understand that the people who are making money, don't constrain themselves by time.
They're not thinking, how do I make X dollars per hour x dollars per year?
They're thinking, how do I provide the most value to somebody?
So they'll give me a percentage of the value.
I provide here's another one is that you can go find something you really like and go promote that you don't have to go find and make your own products.
6:16
You can find products that you really liked from other companies and just become Affiliates of those products.
And the nice thing is that I just recommend, you be honest.
They're like, hey, I tried a hundred fucking different soaps.
This is my favorite one and here's why people don't want to go through the time and the money.
Of figuring out which soap is the best for your audience.
6:32
And if you make the rack after you do that, they're like, oh well shoot he just saved me time and so then I'll go buy from him through his link or whatever.
It's you can inflate other people's products and make money in that way without any money out of pocket.
And then finally Arbitrage in general, which is a fancy word, but it just means that you sell the same thing between two different markets because they're priced differently.
6:52
If Bitcoin is 19,000 dollars in Japan.
On the Japanese Market is nineteen thousand.
One hundred dollars in the US market.
You buy the 19,000 are Bitcoin.
Over in Japan and you sell it in the American market for 19 one and you make a hundred bucks.
That's all Arbitrage is and it happens with physical products.
It happens with lending money between two parties.
7:09
If you can get money for 1% and you can sell the money for 6%, you make five as the difference.
All of these are different versions of Arbitrage, which is just same thing to markets, two different prices, you make the difference.








0:00
And so the idea is you start not with the intent of saying, this is gonna be the one thing.
I refresh my life, which is the fallacy that employees have that, whatever they pick is me, they think they're going to throw survives when in reality, it's I just have to do a thing that I'm good enough at that.
I can learn the game.
And the thing is, once you start taking steps, The Next Step becomes illuminated, welcome to the game.
0:19
We talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer than the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Yeah.
So You so much for taking the time this movie.
This is a conversation I've been looking forward to for a while because I've discovered your stuff around the time you were blowing up seemingly on all of the social platforms and then and then I came across your book and I listened to an audible and around the same time, all of my friends had also discovered the book and they were just like we were all messed up being like Oh my God.
0:49
Have you read 100 offices?
Just absolutely sick.
And it's just like jam packed with value.
So firstly, thank you for that.
And for providing that as a 99-cent service to the world, broadly How do you, how do you think about pricing for that, for that book, by the way?
I mean, I think it's always like, what's the, you know, what problem are we solving?
1:06
And so for me, like the point of the book is not to make money from the book, the point of the book was to, you know, help as many businesses make money and then I mean, the the play Frank was not comes on very long play.
You don't, I mean, which is just, I believe that there's lots of the I think that the biggest inflow of deals will actually come in five years from all the people who consume the stuff and have gotten to, you know, 3 5 10 20 million and they Want to work with acquisition.com who are not at that threshold yet, but it's guys who want to go to 100 and they're capped at 10 and they're trying to figure out what to do.
1:39
That's that's what I'm making all the stuff for.
But yeah, so the problem we're solving is like, how do we get this in as many hands as possible?
And so, giving it away for free, I actually don't think would have gotten as many hands because I wanted to use because if Amazon makes money Amazon, a push it, right?
And so I did make and so at 99 cents a like it's two-thirds of the revenue from Something if I was at 2299 that it's the, I get 2/3 and they get 1/3.
2:04
And so my, at least my meds argument was, it's easy to sell a 99-cent thing.
I can tap into the traffic, that Amazon will provide and what problem by solving, which is mass distribution.
You know, many people as possible and I think there is also a tiny element of free versus paid.
There's like an emotional difference of like I paid something.
2:20
I mean it's a difference between customer and of where you know, what I mean.
And so that was that was at least the thought process behind it and Yeah, just thought that was that there wasn't there wasn't too much more thought than that.
So one of the things that you open a lot of your content with is the phrase to the effect of my name is Alex from ozi own acquisition.com, and I'm going to help you get to three million in Revenue.
2:44
If you're more than 3 million in Revenue, then talk to me.
I want to acquire you, but if you're let's turn them in Revenue.
I want to help you get there and I have nothing to sell you.
And that's, that's interesting.
So it's it's interesting a because like the way people were describing you You when it was sort of on the Grapevine when you first started blowing up, was that phrase that?
3:04
And and I have nothing to sell you and that was that, that really tapped nicely into some something in the Zeitgeist, where everyone knows someone's, always trying to sell you something and then, just the fact that you are so blas about throwing the word 3 million out there.
Well, for most people, they hear that number and they like shit their pants because like Freeman's a lot of money, but the way you seem to talk at like it's almost like it's it's not and it helped.
3:26
Like for me at least helped me change my Mindset around multiple Millions to the point is that it didn't seem like such a big deal.
So I wonder if you can just kind of speak to that a bit like what water what's the philosophy behind the introduction?
Yeah, I mean so many, many of the things that I feel like I've gotten some notoriety for have been, you know, sheer accident, that it's it only seems masterful in retrospect than more than it was, you know, intelligent design.
3:55
I got frustrated because a lot of people are like, he's just trying to sell a course, this is like early on.
Because you know, and I was like, I was like I'm not I have nothing to sell you as I've nothing to sell you.
And so the very first video camera which one was I just said it.
Like I was just annoyed when I said that and then you know the comments just like port on if there's like.
4:11
Oh so I just need to be more like more explicit about the side.
People just don't know.
Like I have nothing to soften 99-cent book.
Like you don't even like if that and that's actually the one thing that I've struggled with this because like the internet doesn't deal well with nuance and so they're like, you know, super like he's trying to make money like, do like, yeah, and the book does make money the book makes Probably about 60 thousand a month in income that I make from the book.
4:33
Yeah.
So I've been like, it makes money but like relative to my income it's just like, it's a relevant.
Like, it doesn't even you don't even like it doesn't.
It doesn't, my top employee makes a million plus a year like he just doesn't do anything for me.
So it's just like for context, right?
Anyways, all that's say the thing you process was more.
4:54
Just me trying to be explicit and then terms of talking about 3 million I may even change Jit.
I'm a I've changed on some a lot of my profiles to 10 million and up but the biggest issue that most people have between 0 and 3 specifically it's just ignorance.
5:12
People just don't know what to do, you know what I mean?
And so like just, you know, getting to six figures is literally just like sell something to someone.
Like that's it.
That's all you have to do to get six figures.
Like one channel, one product, one Avatar.
Like, that's it, you have to do anything else.
And then, you know, when you get, you want to get seven figures, then you just do that.
5:29
And then add the word consistently, which is you do, you know, you input the inputs in the system in a way that's consistent, so that you get a consistent output.
So it whatever way you acquire this customers, whether it was Reach Out, swear, there was content, whether it was paid ads, where there was Affiliates, whether it was Whatever the thing was that got you the customers, cool do that consistently and you'll be a million, you don't.
5:48
I mean which is which is still only twenty Kay a week.
It's not like a huge number, you know, 123 is usually increasing output of that that main thing to a small degree and really just like Baseline efficiencies and building out the core team.
So usually at that point going one, two, three is getting the person out of delivery to a large, you know, to a large extent.
6:10
And usually they get their first kind of first.
Lower first like one or two.
I'm trying to think the right word to how to say those competent individuals who are helping them out and then you know handful of Frontline.
And so it's usually like companies that PSI 3 million are like 5 to 15 employees.
6:27
And so there's usually really only like to wish good ones and the rest are okay.
Right.
And so at that point, you know, going from 3 to 10 is usually where we can at the minimum level that we take people on.
And it's not because there's something magical Three million is that three million?
6:43
Typically checks, two boxes box one.
Is that they have product Market fit at some level.
People want something from them like something they're selling is resonating enough that they can generate sales.
And the second thing I guess there's three boxes one.
Is that the second is that they have at least one, reliable acquisition channel that they're currently doing.
7:00
And the third is that they've acquired team in place.
So, they demonstrate product Market fit, they have reliable acquisition Channel.
Just at least one.
And they have a course email place, which may be relatively dysfunctional and have very few key players.
But at least they have some semblance of structure.
And so, if they have, if they meet those minimum requirements, then we can at least start from, at least some level of Leverage to start helping them grow, okay?
7:22
So I'd love to talk a lot about that.
That initial bit that you sort of threw away with like, oh, one product, one channel, 11 hours are.
Yeah.
So for big context, a couple of weeks ago, I happened to be on vacation on some Greek island and I posted an Instagram real of like, hey, this is the creator life.
7:41
I'm working on My iPad and stuff.
And there are few comments from people being, like, I'd love to live this sort of Life Style, but I just don't know where to start.
And that sort of that idea of, I'd love to be able to, you know, for if we imagine 99.9%, listening to both people listening to this, if you told them, they could make six figures a year.
7:59
Doing what they love?
They'd be like mind.
Blown would absolutely love that.
So I wonder if we can kind of explore that 02 six-figure jump or sort of process.
Let's say someone has got a full-time job.
Let's say they're working in.
I don't know Consulting.
Or something corporate and they love the idea of I want to make a living doing what I love.
8:16
How would we break that down in?
This is under the assumption that the hate doing what they're doing.
Yes.
I was like because I always like to because like I've got employees that make million bucks a year plus so like you can absolutely become filthy wealthy and that's income, right?
And so a lot of businesses that are at ten million dollars a year, the owner might only take a million bucks in income depending on, you know, margins etcetera.
8:34
And so like a lot of, a lot of employees will wish for they see Top Line as income which is just a very employee mindset.
They're like oh Make six figures a year.
I'll make six figures a year.
It's like Well if you really want to make six figures a year, but probably make 500 Grand a year.
You know, mean revenue-wise at least if you don't want to have just bought yourself another job, right?
8:53
Because so let's let's talk through this transition.
So if you're an employee, when you make the switch, you're still an employer simply the different business that you happen to own and you are basically 100% of the expenses and so the business itself actually make some money you as the sole employee of that thing and the boss gets to call your own shots but you were still the employee, right?
9:10
So you're wearing all the hats Etc.
Ra.
And so it's relatively nuanced, you know, I mean, like if you had a 64 consulting job and then you start Consulting on the side, for example, through your own LLC, you have the same job, you just got rid of the person who is giving you Direction and now you are responsible, right?
9:26
The thing that most people have to do is they have to go get money, right?
You have to go make money and the way you do that is you sell stuff, right?
And the way that you can even begin the conversation to sell stuff is that you have to have people who show interest in the thing which means you have to make your products know and we do that through advertising, right?
9:41
And there's five After I've tried it which I just went over earlier and so it's like pick one of those five ways start doing it on a consistent basis.
Bring people in.
What do you sell them?
That's with 100 offers his book is Forest like this is how you figure out what to sell and then you sell them the thing and then after that you'll have some delivery.
9:58
Now usually if you have a consistent method of advertising and selling with a with a what to sell from the offer, then you can start getting people to help you on the level of delivery you have which comes down to Breaking the delivery into chunks.
Rather than holistically and saying how can I specialized labor?
10:15
Because you trying to say, I just need somebody to do.
What I do is silly right, you need to figure out.
How could somebody do?
How can I get, how can I get five people to do?
20% of what I'm doing and do it consistently right?
And then you can increase your advertising sales is very high, leverage thing in the beginning.
If you spent all day selling, just you, you would have enough for five people to do work, right?
10:33
And so then you would have a business, you know?
So let's say someone's listen to this and I thinking, all right.
Cool.
I know, like, I've read like this, but he too, he, he, he telling me.
I've got it.
I've got a seller thing.
I don't know what to sell.
I don't have any skills.
I don't, I don't I don't know what I could possibly offer to the world.
Yeah, how do we how do we break that down?
10:49
Yeah.
This is actually a topic that I cover more in the leads book.
That's coming out soon.
Soon relative terms, six months, I wish everybody knows something.
Alright.
And so the idea is what do you have?
Like everyone has unique depth of knowledge in certain areas because you've been alive and your eyes and ears have taken inputs period, right?
11:11
And so, I like to think of people starting.
Like, so if you look at every familiar with Y combinator, yeah.
Well, I sit yeah.
But so yeah, yeah.
So Y combinator is one of the most successful, you know.
I don't know if they're technically VC their star you know, C Capital startup investors in Silicon Valley and they have a very standard deal structure and they have criteria for what they look for in companies and one of the most important criteria that they look for his past experience.
11:36
And so, they're okay with somebody who's super young etcetera, but they want to, they want you to have experience in the industry.
Just so much ignorance.
Debt that you have to pay down if you literally know nothing about an industry, like there's just so much.
Like if your dad was a mechanic, you know so much about cars just by osmosis of being around a mechanic for 18 years.
11:57
And so I like to think past jobs, you've held.
You will know stuff about that industry.
The jobs of your parents are things that you will know about that industry.
And then you've got personal interests.
And so, I think that, if I had put those into three buckets, it's Like parents stuff past jobs of self and current interests.
12:16
And so it's like of those three things, which of those three buckets, do you think you could help someone do a thing better?
And so the idea is you want to sell the most valuable thing, right?
And so, the mouse viable thing is what is the problem that I can help somebody else solve that I could charge the most money for or in reverse that could make them the most money.
12:35
And then I will be able to charge a percentage of the money that I'm able to make somebody else in this thing.
Now that's in a B2B setting in a b2c.
It would be how valuable do people perceive the problem that they have as right, whether it's like, I could teach music tons of people want to be able to learn how to and if you're better, you know, because you've had a side interest and that awesome, maybe you have a side interest because you're really good at editing the songs.
12:56
Well, there's tons of musicians who would love to hate that part and would love to have.
It's like we all know how to do stuff and all we have to do is packaged the thing that we're doing and I think the big problem is that people expect that they're going to have a perfect business.
But if you look at the track record of all the, I can't think of an entrepreneur besides Jeff Bezos, who's a freak of nature.
13:12
So who's first business, because most viable business in the world is most people have a graveyard of failures behind them.
And so the idea is you start not with the intent of saying.
This is gonna be the one thing.
I refresh my life which is the fallacy that employees have that, whatever they pick is me.
13:28
The thing, they're going to throw their lives.
When in reality, is I just have to do a thing that I'm good enough at that.
I can learn the game.
And the thing is once you start taking steps that the next step becomes illuminated, you trying to think 100 steps into the future.
When you have no context is Avant because chaos is going to break your plan anyways.
13:45
And so do what, you know, exchange, I like service businesses to start because they are the, in my opinion, the lowers risk to start because you're just, it's just your time, right?
So that this business is meaning do stuff for money.
Like mowing the lawn, I cleaning windows, all of us, clean houses like whatever like all of those are service businesses, right?
14:04
And they're fine, a lot of people think they need to have some novel idea to start a business one.
I mean, the best, in my opinion, if you're getting into it, the best way to start a business is just look at what everyone else is doing and just try and do it better.
Like, I mean, and there's obvious holes like if you've, if you've gone to, if you've gotten your dry cleaning, it's like, can I do this in half the time as this guy if I do the lawn care, what are the things people hate about Lanka?
14:27
Are they leave?
The The trimmings around the edges are all are all shitty.
The person doesn't speak English that well like will quote, then I've got advantages, right?
So it's like what are the things that I already know how to do our have past experience?
In what things?
Because I have past experience.
I know that other people struggle with that sucks about this thing and then I will solve a specific problem and it could also be a problem that other people solve to you just try and do a little bit better like it's just not rocket science, you know what I mean?
14:51
And then you exchange you start selling your time for money.
So yes, you're still trading time for dollars, you don't need to reach to read Rich, Dad, Poor Dad, just yet, right?
You're still trading time for dollars Right?
But the point is that you're, you're, you're training that time for money in order to learn not to earn, you need to earn in order to pay your pay, your rent Etc.
15:08
But the, the major thing you're doing is you're paying down ignorant step.
So the vast majority of your income is coming in the terms of in the form of Education rather than earning.
Yeah there's a few a few things that I think are very interesting.
The first is that I think if we think of sort of how an employee thinks of us is how an entrepreneur things were business, owner an employee, Ee sort of mindset is often sort of the activity that I'm doing, where the entrepreneur is more.
15:34
Like the problem, the specific problem that I'm solving.
And I found that when people in, in, in our team, have started doing freelance work and now they have more of an idea of what a create a business looks like and they can solve a specific problem.
They just like, oh my God, it's so easy to make money.
Whereas before they were thinking of this service as like oh I am I offer writing as a service or something like that but as soon as you connect it to a problem that preferably a business has good businesses can pay It suddenly the eyes light up and you realize hang on what does money even mean if I could, if it's for seemingly so easy to make it there, I like we think about service-based businesses because it's it's not that sexy.
16:10
Like when you hear people on podcasts, you don't tend to hear of someone who built a service-based business.
In any in any went pretty big.
You tend to hear the stories of like the tech entrepreneurs that builder in the built an Innovative product and stuff.
They don't see the hundred field startups like the failure rate on Tech startups.
16:25
It might like is just as high as everything else.
Except it usually takes capital and it doesn't take Capital start a service business.
So with you like - tanning is that you quit your corporate job and started the start of the gym business and I wonder if we can kind of explore, explore the story, they're a little bit more.
I can actually even rewind.
16:41
There was a half step in between there.
So this is also covered in the least, but I'll give a give a sneak peek.
So what I did is, I actually because I've been interested in Fitness, right?
That was my interest.
So, like, I had past experience.
I had, I was obsessed with Fitness.
I've been in at that point.
I was 23.
16:58
Training for eight years, I had several State records, so like I was a pretty, you know, I was pretty into it, right?
And it was to the point where people were asking me for stuff all, you know, workout programs and things like just because they knew my interest, right?
And so as a quick, you know, Pro tip for everybody, if you've got stuff that people ask you to do for them, because you're good at it, maybe you're good at Tech.
17:17
It's a, can you help me set up my like, Wi-Fi and stuff, you know, probably it's like, that means you're solving problems.
You can chart, like, what people ask you to do as a favor is an indication of the things you can charge for later, right?
Right?
So I had all these people who are asking me, not all these.
17:32
I mean, I had full people who had asked me for programs and stuff.
And so what I did was during my last year of Consulting, I started something called the free training project.
And so the free training project was, I would charge five hundred to a thousand dollars, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't charge it.
They had to donate that to the charity of their choice, in exchange to work with me, right?
17:51
And so that way, I wanted people to Value it, but I, they weren't paying me directly, so they get it right off.
They felt good.
I had a ton of good will In the marketplace to because I was like I'm doing all this stuff for charity.
I got all these people reaching out to be like this so cool Bob, all right?
And so after a year of doing that I had probably 12 really good test of like great before and after pictures, that I had collected from my clients and I told them that was part of the deal.
18:15
I was like, I'll like, you have to donate it.
I would like to do this for real later, but you have to let me use your testimony and they were like, that's fine.
So, once I had that, I had this first, you know, 10 12 customers who had who had great performances.
And after pictures, I transitioned many of those customers that, hey, I'm doing, I'm going to do this full time now.
18:34
Are you comfortable paying the same amount you're paying to charity except just making it charity of Alex because Alex can't either.
And so, and that was actually how I transitioned from not-for-profit or donating everything and I'd even set up the entity.
I just told him to literally donated and send me the screenshot.
I didn't even do anything like that.
18:51
And so I didn't have a website.
All I had was an LLC and a PayPal account.
So like forever.
He's like, I don't know how to start it.
Since I was like you literally just need a bank account and a way to process money.
That is it like two things and you can Google how to figure out if you can't figure it out from Google entrepreneurship might not be for you, all right?
19:09
But you let like think about there's 30 million business in the United States, 30 million other people have figured this out, which means you can too.
So bank account payment processing make the first 10 free or some sort of charitable things.
So that people like don't feel weird or you don't feel weird about selling etcetera after you have it after providing the service to people, you can transition people from free service to paid service and if they don't want to start paying you then that gives you insight as to either you suck, right where they suck which is also possible to.
19:38
But either way a certain percentage of those people will continue to stay in pay and now you have income.
Now, you can also ask those people for referrals which is exactly what I did.
So I think half that business came in just for I got you know, the initial ones came in from friends and family and me posting.
And so I'll close the loop on what I said.
19:55
Earlier, a year later after I had this testimonials, I made a public Post being like, hey, I've got this thing.
Now I've made a website, which is that was my big enough.
I made a website.
I still have the post.
I found its 2013.
Looks like I made.
I made a website and I am now open for business.
20:12
And so if you would like, you know, training stuff, let me know this what I'm doing.
Now time you had some testimonials and go check out the site, whatever.
And so from there, I was able to get I think about 20 guys who were willing to let me do just like almost bodybuilding type stuff because I was kind of like what I was part of the body back.
20:28
And and so I think I want to say I got 20 guys at 200 bucks a month and so I was making four thousand dollars a month from those people and it took me four hours every Saturday to do the Fulfillment.
What was the Fulfillment?
20:45
I'm just I'll just update their training programs and and send them nutrition like update their macros updated meal plans and then like, you know, new workouts behind week etcetera.
And then I and everyone had myself.
No, just text them the new stuff and they had any questions they hit me up.
21:02
Like it was a very simple business and that's what I did.
It was just 101 online and it only took me four hours on Saturday morning and to show you what kind of person I am.
I hate it, even though I love Fitness, I hated having to do something the same thing every day like on the delivery side.
21:21
So I ended up having the genius idea of saying, oh I need to own a gym because then I'll be a business owner.
I'm really just self-employed right now.
And so that's what got me to start with Jim rather than probably doing the wiser decisions.
Say okay, this case cost you 4 hours a week and you're making four grand a month.
Maybe you should do this for 40 hours a week.
21:38
But doing more of it to me, felt like a horrible idea.
So I didn't want to do any more.
How did I say how do you jump from that to?
Therefore I should probably own a gym.
Oh I don't think that's probably not.
Yeah it was not an intelligent one.
I always thought I was going to own a gym that was I mean that was the not always I had done a said so there's The three things that I was deciding between for my business, I was deciding between a test prep company because I was really going to send it by testing and I had a process for how I did it.
22:08
I had a yogurt business idea because I was a big, yep.
Froyo guy.
Yeah, I know.
And I was like, IMA have it consumer of this shit?
Yeah.
Actually.
I feel like I know and I hated there's so many things.
I knew that I thought I could actually know a lot about the other bits of snow and I was going to finish.
22:24
So those are the three things that I felt like I could do for anybody's listening like, Those are the three that I was picking between the yogurt business cost. 250 Grand a start-up, I didn't have that money so I couldn't do that one.
I had saved about 50 or 60 Grand, I cameras it's your 60.
At the time I was 23 and then the test prep business.
22:41
I actually did a ton of work on and I was going to partner with a professor from my University to do it with me.
And so, I set up all the initial materials and based on a miscommunication, I'll just put it that way.
He ended up either taking the materials and And using them without me to start a business Consulting thing.
23:02
Either way it became clear that what I thought was happening versus what he thought was happening.
We're not the same thing and that left a very sour taste in my mouth was test prep.
I do think it was a smart business.
I probably should have done.
It's all that was left was Fitness and so Fitness.
I was like, I already know that people already want me to help them with it, so I'll just start that.
23:20
And so the gym was the that was that?
What what I would have said is like the legit business.
I didn't think that the online thing was legit, but remember, this is 10 years ago.
So like it wasn't, it was known, even thought it was, that was a, that was a concept of legitimate business, you know what I mean?
It's always really early days on it.
23:35
And so, you know, from there, I hit up 40 gym, owners to see if I could just basically Apprentice for them.
Just work for free one guy hit me back.
He had a mastermind.
I joined his Mastermind for ten thousand dollars, even though I didn't have a gym and I said, are you sure that it makes sense for me to join his like?
23:55
Oh yeah, sure.
And it did actually Make sense to me because then I can learn from all the mistakes of Rios was making before I started.
So I was like, okay this works and so I learned all the stuff that I could from that Mastermind and from him he ended up signing Manson himself.
Oh yeah, is actually kind of questions on that front.
So Most Nation real quick.
24:15
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can fly anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
24:33
The test prep thing is interesting.
I didn't I didn't know that part of the story.
So my first business that went well was also a test prep business and I still have the Evernote document from 2012 or I was like shit, I need to make some money.
What am I good at?
And what could I possibly do?
And it was like test prep and web design and was like cool.
Let me make a test prep course thing.
24:50
And let me advertise it on a website because back then it was hard to make website, look pretty and that.
That's what ended up ended up, making the money initially on the, on the gym front.
So, it seems to me like this, Us to leaps their think.
Number one is I want to do this thing.
25:08
Like I started Jim maybe and therefore I don't know what to look for free, I want to own a business.
Therefore I'm going to work for someone for free that that is seems like a bit of a leap which these days seems very unfashionable to even say, because everyone then goes down your throat for being that's only available for the privileged etcetera, etcetera.
25:26
And then beyond that, also promotes working for fun.
Yeah.
The working for three thing.
It's, it's quite unfashionable to suggest that people were free.
Or at least I mean I was making for grandmas from my little online thing, so I made money from that.
Now, I offered to work for free, but I he quickly was like, I don't feel good about, I'll just pay you.
25:44
And so he paid me, he paid me like, minimum wage, but I mean, I think I made, like, I don't know, 20, 100 bucks a month, whatever it was.
I don't remember what it was because I made more from the four hours a week on Saturday, then I did from that.
But again, the point wasn't to to earn, you know, I mean it was to learn and I had saved up 50 Grand.
26:02
So I knew I could live for Or you know least two years on that.
I try to live in those I was I spent four hundred bucks a month splitting a bedroom and then I ate not you know I spent $100 a week on food.
I was eating, you know, spending nothing to live and then the rest of my time was at the gym, trying to learn the thing.
26:18
That's always struck me about you.
Like, when I, when I've had other interviews, is that your so matter-of-fact about all of this stuff.
And what, where's to me?
Like, at every stage of the journey.
I know people who are at that point, who have gone the other way and decided, you know what?
Oh, I couldn't, I couldn't possibly leave my 40K or job even though Living with my parents and I don't have any any kids or anything.
26:35
I couldn't possibly leave that and take a pay cut because that would be bad and you're supposed to make more money as you grow older, rather than less.
And yeah, but you kind of get that from Ikea, I guess the sort of people you speak to these days are mostly the sort of 3 to 10 million plus rather than the people that are struggling struggling to get started by imagine most of people that follow you tend to be in there, you know, Camp. 88.
26:55
So what if you can, how do you know that we have a survey on our site?
Oh yeah.
Like this idiot percent of people.
Want to start a business at least that follow me.
So, I wonder if you can speak more to this idea of like learn versus earn.
I think that's a good model and the this idea of paying down ignorance debt.
27:14
I think, I think it's a great model that more people could.
Yeah, it's the most expensive cost every like right now.
Everybody because everybody cost me a billion dollars a year to not be to not know what to do to make a billion dollars or I do know how to make billion dollars and I just have to wait and pay down my time debt which is what I feel like I'm doing right now.
Just hang down time and so I think understanding whether it's a lack of knowledge or or it's just I'm like thing, like those are big differences, you know?
27:35
I mean at the Baseline, right?
You could be doing the right thing, but just be 10 years behind when it's going to come to fruition, you will get out sighs Returns on the, on the information, right?
On the knowledge and the lessons that you will learn.
And so you want to you want to pay that ignorance down as fast as you can.
27:51
Because as soon as you have that knowledge, you'll be able to Skyrocket straight to 20 50. 100 500 thousand a month like very quickly because you know how to do it, right?
So people are like getting obsessed about these micro changes when the big scheme.
Changes.
Like, this is why.
In my opinion, all of the money that somebody spend, like, this is relatively controversial, it's a whole S&P 500 vs.
28:12
SME, 500.
But like you will get a significantly higher return investing in your own ability to make money, then you will into any any market.
And so, if you look at all the, the vast majority of very, very wealthy people, they have tremendous earning capacity, right?
They know how to do stuff that makes money, right?
28:28
So it's like we got to go get that.
And so there's really not like if you were to if you were to die.
Cost average a thousand dollars into a month into the S&P 500 for for you know, 50 years.
Sure.
You'd also not live a fun life, but you could do that if you wanted to you could do that.
You absolutely could write or you could take that thousand dollars a month.
28:50
Join a mentorship program every year, you don't.
I mean, this is why the my whole argument against like college is not that I'm against College.
I think it's just over priced and so you could take 200 that like you want to say you want to have a Trippy thought income in the US.
29:05
You can get a student loan for the full amount of college about two hundred thousand dollars.
If you go to like a really nice private school.
Like that's that's what you can get.
Some ties to the government to and thousand dollars and you don't have debt payments for like a very long time.
Here's a crazy thought you could take that two hundred thousand dollars.
You could buy a fucking rental property that makes you four thousand dollars a month.
29:24
And then you would literally exit the system before I even got into it with the money that they're giving you to become a worker, which is just fat and you won't even have to pay the pay Down The Debt Service, for the real estate.
A buddy of mine did this.
He's a PhD student.
He got grants to go to school.
He still took out the student loans and he finished finished his Ph.D with 20 homes and ten thousand dollars a month of income from from doors that he didn't even have Debt Service on because it was it was student loans.
29:51
Crazy just as as a fun side?
Yeah, thought so.
But I won't even get into that one but if we just think, okay I'm paying two thousand dollars a month.
If I'm paying to if I if I'm working for not work, if we go to school for twenty five thousand dollars a year, so hundred grand for four years, whatever, I pay 2,000 a month is there.
30:09
Another place that I could spend $2000 a month and get a superior return on my ability to earn money?
And my argument would be, yes, there are many places.
Most places, arguably will give you a better return on your money.
And then a traditional four-year degree at this moment, right?
And so you take that, you take the two thousand dollars a month, you go and you buy a six-month Mastermind on placing ads, you buy a six-month thing on selling you buy a six-month thing on.
30:34
Making course, it's whatever it maybe takes 18 months.
Well, you're still two and a half years ahead of the other guys.
So what you don't?
I mean, yeah.
I think this is, this is like a key, a key like mindset shift because I'm just thinking, there's so many conversations I've had with friends and people in my audience over the over the years, where it's like, you know, they've got like a regular job, maybe learning 50k, or something and like, or even 30k, like whatever and they're like, I know, I want to make some money on the side.
30:59
Therefore, you know, talk to me about investing.
I've like, do I pick stocks or index funds and I'm like, I mean Index Fund, but like, Hang my God, my poor.
How much money?
How much money?
Yeah, you're poor.
There's no like you're not going to make you're not going to make breathtaking in the thing.
31:17
And here's the thing is when you, when you do the dollar cost average, thanks Everyone likes to put it in the Excel sheet and we're gets Excel Rich.
The thing is that, by the time you retire with four million dollars on that Excel sheet, 4 million dollars will be a million dollars today.
Just now out of money.
Now, we were like that is a lot of money.
It's not when you're trying to live on it and you got like 30 more years to live.
31:34
It's not it's not a lot of money, right?
And that's in, you know, I mean like it's it's just if you just take, take the pounding of 4% a year on inflation and do that for 40 years and then see what the money really looks like, right?
Like people aren't taking inflation into account and that's just not because it's hot topic now.
There's just always it.
Whatever it is.
I think it's around 4 percent has been the compounding rate of inflation.
31:51
And so point is and this is the simplest example.
I have that can illustrate the concept, the same PhD guy though.
Good friend of mine.
He has a daughter, his daughter got a job at a bowling alley, minimum wage.
She just you know, bless people to tables and get some shoes or whatever doesn't matter.
She could spend $500 and get a weekend certification to become a phlebotomist are phlebotomist draw blood for people.
32:15
All right, all you need is a two-day certification so you get the certification cost 500 bucks.
Her earning capacity would go from Seven dollars an hour to $25 an hour, just from that one thing.
So she has two options.
She could wait eight weeks save up the money and then spend the money other certification, right?
32:34
And then her earning capacity would go uphill triple immediately Or she could borrow the money from her parents and then do it that weekend.
Pay the money back the next week from the earnings that yet and then have and then be seven weeks ahead of her other other path, right?
32:51
Or she could save up to $500 and put it in the S&P 500 and make two dollars and fifty cents a year.
Nice.
And so the instant, the thing is, they're making these these these assumptions and they're just not thinking through the math which is like, Like the problem they have is they don't make enough money, they've income problem that I'm investing problem, right?
33:11
The nice thing is that if you're poor right now means you have learned how to live on less, which is a good habit, so keep living on not a lot.
But then, this is where, like, this is where I don't understand people because, like, my plan B for, like, if the gym didn't work, because you have to like, for me, it's always risk mitigation.
So, plan B was, if I didn't want to do the entrepreneurship thing after that, I'd have a good story for business school, so that was that was one path, which they love should, you know, having people try stuff, whatever the other path was and this is probably the Real pathway.
33:37
As soon as I started, I knew I was going to go back was that I would strip at night and I would drive Uber.
So if I drove over during the day, I could make and if I drove all day, if I drove 12 hours a day, I could make like 80 90 grand a year if I just did that and then at night in four or five hours, I could probably pull another one fiftieth.
33:56
And so I could make 250,000 a year just stripping and driving Uber, maybe even more.
Now, once I got the first level of skills to learn how to sell, I realize that my base levels my base.
I love opportunity Rose because then I was like, I could just sell cars to make four hundred thousand a year and keep my clothes on, right?
34:13
I just sell cars and then I wouldn't have the strength so that became my, you know, my new Baseline.
Now, once I knew how to, once I knew how to Market and sell them, my new Baseline became actually with started which, which became my my intermediary model between when I owned by Chain of gyms and when I started doing Jim watch when I flew out, and would do the turnkey sale system because I knew how to Market and how to sow.
34:35
And so what I did was I would just run ads.
I would spend the money on the ads.
I would get the leads.
I would work the late side cell deletes and I kept all the cash.
So when I did that on my own, no employees, I'd make a hundred grand a month.
Like zero employees.
34:51
I mean I had to work 14 hours a day but that's all I did.
If I did that for a month I would make 100.
And so that became my new Baseline right of how much I could make all my own.
And so, like, my Baseline has continued to rise as my skill set has improved and so I could go down that trajectory but basically go back to the girl, go back to the girl.
35:10
A lot of people are in the girls position and are saying, I am going to save my $500 on the next eight weeks and try and earn two and a half to five dollars a year on that money.
When they should be trying to solve the problem.
How do I create another fifty thousand dollars a year in income?
Well, let me let me like boom.
35:25
She could triple earning capacity and if she lives on the same 750, she now has a thousand dollar, whatever that is $25 an hour times times 2000.
She making 50 Grand a year so now she can still live at her parents house.
Have thirty thousand dollars a year and four thirty thousand dollars a year.
You can buy any education you want to the world, any skill you want is available for thirty dollars a year.
35:43
Any any sub 10 million dollar scale up at it that way?
So whether girl we want to spend money, On increasing our ability to earn more rather than trying to screw around with three percent returns in the S&P 500.
Yeah.
So hence sort of when you're, when you're working for free and maybe I don't know, take a bit of a pay cut a practicing for someone else.
36:02
You're understanding, you're learning how the business works and you're learning how specifically that business works.
I the gym business because you maybe wanted to own your own business and your interest in Fitness and you're also learning how generally business Works through like sales marketing operations, all of that sort of stuff, so what Happened next in in, in your story.
36:21
Yes, I joined the Mastermind and then he quickly was like, you know, I got my mask.
It felt weird for him to not pay me because I was just there all the time.
So he started pay me, whatever was minimum wage.
And so I was there from 4 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day with him so that was that was what we did.
So for him before, p.m.
I was there with them every day and then he would go home.
36:37
I would stay for a few more hours, to just like workout, hang out at the gym.
So I was pretty much they are all day every day and then for the next, I think 12 weeks that's what I did is I just hung around the gym.
Learned, learn how to sell learn Stuff.
Work third a team like learn I learned sales was a thing.
36:52
I didn't know the term sales.
I didn't know email lists existed.
Like, I didn't know any of this stuff, like, I truly had no idea how any of this stuff work.
And so I learned a lot very quickly, just from observing normal business happening, right?
And I think small businesses are more useful for people to be at because like corporate.
37:08
It's so specialized because the coverage so big, you have such a myopic view of how business works.
You have no idea, you are actually the very special Cog that does one thing, right?
So you don't see the whole list of you were small businesses because And so, shrunk down, you can see end-to-end how things work.
It's like we do this.
We do this direct mail piece certain percentage, call call phone, we set the appointment, they buy a membership, they go to the trainer who helps them to, like, give me like, you can see the whole life cycle, right?
37:33
So 12 weeks later, I was do it every weekend.
I would go out and look for locations.
When I found location that I liked, I still had my 50 Grand saved up.
And so, then that's what I spent.
I spent, I think most of that to outfit the facility.
I think I 10,000 left over.
Because I knew I had two months worth of rent safe top, which is five thousand a month in rent.
37:53
And I honestly, in retrospect, it was one of the riskiest things I've ever done.
Like I went straight to a five thousand dollar month lease and I had no idea what I was doing.
That's a lot for rent.
Oh, I never even made money before.
I mean, like I didn't eat the is funny because I can only think about this in retrospect, but like the online business that I had, I didn't have a reliable way of getting customers.
38:12
I just like the people that I knew and I immediately was making money from that, but I wasn't keeping.
Everyone always and is starting to go down and I'm like, I don't you.
So I was like, I'll Just sign a lease for way, more money than I've ever made in my life.
That's like a reasonable thing to do.

Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
0:21
I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, understand that Seasons by their very nature.
Eren and then look back and say like, we both contribute to another and then we found out that we want a different things, which is great.
That's the whole point of learning.
0:40
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk, and Buffett a documented, their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
One of the hardest things about pursuing your dreams and pursuing your goals.
0:56
Is that a lot of the people that are in your life right now will not support you and will not support the future version of you, that you need to become in order to accomplish those goals.
And it's arguably one of the hardest aspects of Entrepreneurship on a personal level, because you want people who believe more in the future version of you and don't buy the old identity of you.
1:17
That is keeping you where you're currently at.
And Old Friends, often have old versions of you that they I want to reinforce because one of the things that I found true is that people don't actually want the best for you.
They want the version of you that best serves them.
1:35
Now the closer they are to you in terms of long-term alignment.
The more likely those two versions of you will intersect which is often why often not always why family and your spouse should hopefully be the most line with you because long-term their best interest is often aligned with your best interest.
1:53
Now, how you get there?
Maybe the point of contention, where you might have to break ties for a little bit for a season and then maybe re-engage later.
Now, there's a handful of contrarian views that I hold around friendship.
And I'm just saying these are things that have worked for me and I get lots of questions about it.
2:11
So I'm just sharing my view point.
Number one is that I don't see friendship as a binary term.
Meaning, it's not that we are friends or not friends.
It's how good of friends are we?
And I think just from that onset, you can have Much better.
Understanding of all the people that are in your life, which is, well, how good of a friend are they now to Define friendship, rather than Define what it is?
2:32
I think it's more useful.
At least for me when I tried to find something, I think, well, what's the opposite?
And would have to be true for the opposite.
So the opposite of friend would be an enemy or rival and so an enemy would be someone who doesn't root for me.
Obviously they actively try and destroy my efforts in order to succeed.
2:50
They try and get me to be emotional whenever I can.
And rather than make logical decisions.
They try and confuse me and they try and distract me from my ultimate goal.
So they try and drain resources from me that I could otherwise allocate towards what I'm trying to do.
And so you have a goal and they try and knock out the legs underneath of that achievement from every angle they possibly can.
3:13
That's what an enemy would be.
And for many of you, some of your friends fit that description now.
So the reverse of that would be somebody who roots for you in.
Of you and most specifically behind your back.
And I think The Tell-Tale sign there is not whether they do it in front or behind is that they actually root for you and real talk.
3:33
That's one of the hardest things out there especially amongst guys where it's very Alpha competitive etcetera and as soon as your status starts to raise within the group You by comparison make everyone else worse and so it's in their best interest to make you less of a threat to them by diminishing your status and they will do use.
3:53
The things like talking behind your back, trying to distract you make you emotional make you feel guilty about the things that you're doing.
Take you away, try and label.
You withhold labels that are your old identity, not aligned with the things that you want to do later.
These are all like techniques.
And the thing is, is like I don't think these are bad people to be clear.
I don't believe there's good or bad people, anyways, but the question is just, are they going to help me towards my long-term goal?
4:15
Are they not?
And for me, that is an easier way.
Now, that is a binary, in terms of decision, for me, it's a, it's a more helpful way to sift through.
You I want to keep in my life and often times when I actually make it that cut and dry, will this person make it more likely that I achieve my goal or not, if it's more likely than they've earned a spot, they're paying their rent for my time and attention.
4:37
If they're not more likely to help me hit my goal by being in my life.
Then for me, the question is, is the relationship more important than my goal and that's a decision for you for me.
I made my goal my most important thing because I believe that if I achieve that goal, I would feel better about myself.
My identity associated with it and And I think that there would be a new level of friends who would unlock as I got to that new level and for me up to this point that has been true as an aside, my single one-strike policy like.
5:03
I understand that people are human and people make mistakes, but if you want the one strike not three-strike one-way, ticket out of my friendship, you only have to do one thing.
You have to not root for me.
Meaning you actively resent either explicitly or implicitly when I win.
5:21
And for me, that's Is it like if you resent me wedding?
Why are you here?
Like, like and I'll answer the question.
The reason they're still there is because there's a chance that your success will benefit them but while you're succeeding, they'll still try and destroy it in case they can bring you down.
5:37
So they're hedging.
So they try and destroy you, but they keep the friendship on the surface in case your status can benefit them.
It's fucked up, but it's true.
And there's a lot of statements that friends will make to try and keep you where you're at.
They'll say, you've changed and they'll phrase it in a way that makes it feel like you're doing something wrong by changing and all you have to do is look back at them and say you're right and you have it and that carries almost an equal way back to them because some people want to stay the same, and that's okay.
6:10
The biggest issue that I've had with friendships in general, is that people project what they believe friendships should look like like in their minds on to our relationship.
And so oftentimes, we have disagreement on what that relationship should look like.
For me, I am transactional and this is good, probably piss a lot of people off.
6:29
But what I mean by that is simply that the pros of this relationship should outweigh the cons, that's it.
And if you were like, I can't believe you'd say that.
Well then we probably wouldn't be friends and that's okay.
You'll probably friends with people who don't have that definition but for me, that means that like my life is better off with you in it.
6:46
You helped me achieve my goal.
You root for me along the way and for me, the definition of help is giving attention back.
So have you ever had?
Somebody was like, I was just trying to help and like, you're all you did was just like, in that person just like, made your life ten times harder.
That is not help.
That is inverted Health that is destruction, right?
7:03
In the Sun, a lot of your current friends will claim to be doing and either do so knowingly or unknowingly.
But true help comes from someone who comes into your life and all of a sudden everything gets easier.
That is help.
That is a friend.
That is somebody who's an ally.
If you think about About this in terms of allies and enemies.
It's probably easier than friends, which can seem really amorphous.
7:20
And so, maybe using that word like, is this person at Ally of mine?
Makes this a lot easier at least for me.
So, in terms of exchange, I believe in abundance change.
Same way in business, I do a personal relationship which is, if both of us feel like we're getting the better end of the deal, then this relationship will continue ad infinitum.
It's going to keep going, right?
7:36
So I try and deliver value to them.
And if they deliver value back to me, and it feels like it's in excess of the value.
I provided, which most times in any kind of exchange, it takes me less.
To take 10 years of experience to provide value to somebody in terms of Time, Versus how much value they get from that investment and they should be able to take the same level investment and put it back to me and I get a disproportion return.
7:57
If that's how the relationship is, you would have no reason to end it where you get into trouble.
Is the types of relationships that you're wondering, should I keep these?
You probably already know you shouldn't and I loved this.
This little framework for decision making is that when you're when your face between a hard thing and the easy thing and you're not sure what to do, you should do the hard thing.
8:16
Because if the easy thing where the right thing to do, you would have already done it.
And so let me give you a little frame shift around Burning Bridges because people love using that friends.
Like you don't want to burn Bridges, remember where you came from.
And so I want to give you a counter to both of those things one is that analogies and metaphors persuade.
8:32
They also confuse so you can consider burning a bridge, but you could also consider it pruning a tree in order for the tree to grow, right, where you only have certain amount of sunlight water and minerals in the soil.
If you're a tree and you're trying to grow, you have branches that start spouting off of you and drink.
Resources away from the direction.
8:48
You're trying to go the healthiest thing for the tree is to prune.
It means to cut the branch off and that may seem uncomfortable for many of you.
But again, there's the hard thing and the easy thing, if you're making the decision, you already know.
The right thing is probably the hard one.
The next line is actually one from Tupac that I like a lot.
9:04
And I think Tupac embodies this transitioning between friends really well and he said, just because you lost me as a friend, doesn't mean you gained me as an enemy.
I'm bigger than that.
I still want to see you eat.
Just not at my table.
And so it's one of those things where it's like, I don't wish you ill, I want you to succeed and I want you to do all the things you want to do in your life.
9:21
It's just that your vision for your life, doesn't merge with my vision for my life.
It's the same thing as having an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend and you had a season together.
It doesn't mean you don't honor the season and all of a sudden start destroying the memory.
Because why would you want to live a life?
9:36
Where all you did was Destroy every memory of your life until that very moment?
Well, that sounds like, not fun.
Appreciate the fact that you had a season understand that Seasons by their very nature end, and then Back and say like we both contribute to another and then we found out that we wanted different things which is great that's the whole point of learning.
9:55
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
10:11
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
When I think back to friendships in that way, it allows me to maintain the Goodwill.
10:28
I have associate with that person and also say like you want different things and that's okay.
And so if you encounter somebody who's in that kind of Camp right, where it's like, it's clear that they want to, you know, play Fantasy Football.
They want to drink on Sundays and they want to, you know, do the bar crawls and all that stuff.
10:43
And this is really common or they want to go to clubs every night, whatever it is, if that's not a line with the vision of your life and it used to be your old life.
And now it's coming in conflict.
Those people are going to and like righteously.
So they're losing a friend, so they want to keep you there and that's okay like don't hate them for wanting that.
11:01
It's just that it no longer a lines anymore and I think there's really two directions for these types of friendships.
Number one is that if you decrease the frequency of communication with someone over time, you get fewer and fewer invites and then it kind of Fizzles, that's how most friendships or loose acquaintances and the Very hand selects, the of times, where you have family or like super-close homies, whatever you want.
11:24
I call it sisters in those instances.
Usually you have to confront this conversation which probably grows as a pink you know as an elephant in the room that needs to be addressed and I have one framework for having really hard conversations but I stole from Layla which is keep the other person as a human being at the Forefront of the conversation rather than being right.
11:44
And if I remind myself every time I go into a hard conversation that way, it's amazing how much better of a conversation I have and accepting responsibility for the fact that like, hey, I've changed like and that's not on you that's on me and you want these things, right?
12:00
I don't feel like I can be the friend that you deserve in your life and so like if it means that we're not hanging out as much anymore again, it doesn't mean that you have me as an enemy.
It just means that like I'm moving in a different direction, and that's okay.
The thing is a lot of people have these precepts of what friends should be there.
12:16
Like we're going to be friends for life but how many 85 roles, you know, who are friends of the same people their whole lives?
Not many?
And if they are they've got like One it's not common and so to expect something that's really uncommon from the probably 10,000 people you're going to meet throughout your lifetime that they're going to be.
12:32
The one is not really reasonable but it is.
Okay, in my opinion, to have seasons of friends were friends for the season and then we had train tracks that aligned and then we found out we had train tracks that diverted, and that's okay.
And so I think that's been my recurring theme with friendships is just accepting them for what they are.
12:49
And say, that's okay.
Things have changed good.
That's what growth is you.
Grow and stay the same doesn't work and if we want to grow as entrepreneurs then we have to expect change and that also includes the Personnel on our roster in our bench.
Now some people have said that my Approach review on friendships is transactional Extreme whatever.
13:11
And I'll say, sure you're right, and like, I'm not trying to achieve a common life goal and so it would make sense that my views would be more extreme than other people's.
I also think that some of these views come compounded when you have increasing demands for your time.
13:27
And so if that's not real for you right now, if you don't have people vying for every minute of your day right now.
Then what I'm saying, might not be relevant for you, but for the people who do have people vying for every minute of their day, then it might make more sense.
There's a reason LeBron says, No New Friends like at a certain point.
13:43
He's decided like, he doesn't need any friends, he doesn't trust anyone to and that's fine that works for him.
He has a rare life, it would make sense that he has rare rules.
You might not say, No New Friends.
That sounds extreme So does being the best or second, best, or whatever top five basketball players of all time?
And I think one of the things that helped me out a lot during this transition, is that some people just like boyfriends and girlfriends?
14:04
Who, like, go from boyfriend.
A boyfriend, a boyfriend, or girlfriend to girlfriend.
A girlfriend, like they never spend time alone.
I think there's some people do the same thing with friends.
It's like, they like overlap friends and then they drop one friend.
I think it's very helpful to be.
Okay, being alone and like learn to enjoy being alone because then you're kind of like a whole person who adds value into And of themselves and then you can add value to someone else's life.
14:27
But you do not require them, you don't assess the Tate them.
You don't become dependent on that friendship.
And so that's always, you know, been my goal is to like, be interdependent where like I can operate on my own, you can operate on your own, but together we are better off and until we are no longer better off.
I will continue to make that exchange.
14:43
We trade time, we both get better or trade time.
Let's get better.
And So eventually one of us is not getting better and chooses to end the relationship or decrease the frequency relationship.
Like, that's a really common one.
You might just be like, hey, We're not every week friends, but like, I'm a once or twice a year phone call friend.
Maybe it's just to what degree are we friends?
14:59
And I think you can decrease the frequency of communication with people as a very easy way to balance.
Maintaining a relationship.
If you want it for long term but you don't have as much good stuff to exchange in the short term, the negative friends are the easy ones.
Okay, they're the party and let's be real.
15:15
They're not easy because they're the ones who probably going to cling on to the hardest and probably insult you the most, but if they're insulting you the most, and like, you probably already know that it's not the right fit.
What about the neutral friends, right?
What about the ones who like, they don't really hurt?
You know, you're there your goals but they don't really help your goals.
15:31
I have rather extreme views, which is like, if you are not helping me, you are hurting me because you were taking the place and the time of tension of something that could be helping.
And so I just see that as the same exact Continuum, it's just further along on the same continue, which is where you're going to trade, right and fundamentally.
15:47
If you think about everything you do as an investor, you invest time and energy into relationships with the hopes of getting some sort of.
Super turn, right?
And so you spend that time, no matter what, and the people who build the best relationships, best networks are the ones who invest in relationships that yield the highest returns.
16:07
And the thing is not all the relationships have to have returns in your financial realm, right?
Like I have a very close friend of mine.
Who is an FBI agent and he's my oldest friend.
You know, I've been friends since sixth grade kind of reasons.
My one friend been friends since sixth grade and she is excited.
16:23
Exceptional at what he does but I obviously make more money than he's like you look up what I make on Google and he jokes about it.
You know what he's doing he's knocking down like pedophile rings and drug kingpins and like every time I talk to him, he's got like new stories of things that he's doing.
And for me, the benefits I get from the relationship, is that it gives me an escape from the day-to-day business stuff that I'm dealing with.
16:45
I have somebody who never really asks me for anything because he benefits in no way from the status, from the followers, from the anything because he has no end.
Actually benefit he's an FBI agent right into the same degree but we both mutually appreciate about one.
Another is that we've both been committed to being excellent at our craft.
17:03
He works every hour of every day.
He works over time.
He works weekends because he loves it and that is something that will always have my respect.
So it's not about money for me.
It's about who has a commitment to Excellence.
Now, the vast majority of the friends that I have our entrepreneurs and their vehicle for excellence is entrepreneurship.
17:21
But if someone came to me and they're like a rapper, you're going to mean and They're exceptional a trap, their art for me businesses, my art for whatever your art is for my buddy.
Taking out.
Bad guys is his art as crazy as that sounds like, that's his art.
And so, I just want people who are as passionate about their art, as I am, and who root for me to make the best painting possible, that's what I'm really going for.
17:45
And I think, if you can see it that way, at least for me, it's been helpful.
So, I think that you can have friends who aren't necessarily pursuing greatness as long as As they're helping you pursue yours.
And that's the, that's like, that's the bridge in my opinion.
I like to be inspired by the people that I'm around.
18:02
I want to admire something in every friend that I have.
Because, like, if I were to characterize, like, okay, well, what about fitness-wise?
What about relationship-wise, what about business-wise, what are like, whatever their art form is, what are their dedication, their mindset, their spirituality, whatever it is, I want to be getting better from every friendship that I have like, they have to be better than me at something.
18:23
And I want that, and I think the most important person that should be better than you at stuff is your spouse.
Like, if you don't admire your spouse and don't feel like you have things to learn from them, that's tough, in my opinion.
And so like that is the best friend, you have for life, which means you have to have the most alignment with them, which means they should root for you harder than anyone else.
18:42
They should never resent your success, they should always be rooting for you to stay in the game when the game is on the line like a true friend would on the sidelines rather than shouting from the sidelines and Distract you and try to make you feel bad for still playing, trying to trying to like make you feel emotional about beating the other team, like all of those things detract.
19:02
And so like I think the spouse is like, the nth degree of what the most extreme friend should look like a lie, the biggest, strongest Ally you have.
And then the friends you have are just non sexualized versions of that core Ally you have.
But I mean at the end of the day, it's just like, does this person make me better and that like, if there is one The bottom line question that I have to say, yes to it's that is like, does this person make me better and like, if they don't, then why are you here?
19:33
And here's a tough one, where you make someone else better in a lot of ways and they don't make you better.
This is where there's dynamics that sometimes have to change where sometimes you're a friend, you break up for a minute and then you reconnect, but it's in a different context, like you might almost be a little bit of an advisor or a mentor because you've moved.
19:52
You've leveled up a lot.
It in those relationships.
Sometimes, you do get things out of that relationship, like, teachers, learn just as much as students do in those Dynamics.
And so, again, it's like, is this making me better kids?
Make parents a lot better in a lot of ways, they're more patient after they have kids.
20:08
They're more empathetic.
They learn how much they can love something that they never thought.
Like, there's lots of ways, that kids, even though transactionally, like, all they're doing is sucking resources out of you, but most parents would probably think.
Yes, my life is significantly better.
I am better as a result of this relationship and I must sound ridiculous but like just boiling it down that's a lot of what it is, right?

And one of the things that I live by, is that we're one decision away from changing our life forever, right?
Your one decision away from drinking, and getting killed in a car.
1:19
Crash car accident, your one decision away from, you know, cheating on your spouse.
In destroying your marriage, you know your 11.
Terrible combat away from destroying your Right.
And you're also going to season away from destroying your business if you so chose so decisions are the Wellspring of life or at least the train track splits of we're we're going to end up, all right?
1:38
And so learning to make the decisions is an important concept.
But believe it or not, for this video.
What I want to focus on is actually the environment under which to make the decision, all right?
And so during this process, one of the things that was very frustrating for me and this decision took me about 12 months to make and I'll make I'll explain what the decision was in the future.
1:57
But it's safe to say it like, it was a hugely impactful decision in my life, financially and otherwise.
And one of the difficulties that I was having is that the information that I had was not changing in yet my decision of which way to go continue to falter, all right?
So I kept ping-pong you back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
2:15
And so I was like, it's not my decision making process, right?
And the data that I have to make, this decision is unchanging and yet at different days, I would have How comes which to me is Big Red Flag danger Alert in terms of like a leading indicator of a bad decision, right?
2:34
And so mind you as a quick caveat to this, this is not how you need to make all the decisions in your life.
I would say that you should find and use this process for the most important decisions you make in your life.
All right, who are you going to marry?
Where you going to live?
What are you going to work on, right?
2:50
What are you going?
Like those are the decision to, are we going to make this big strategic change when our business?
Those are big.
Possible decisions.
And that's the key for me is that if a decision is irreversible, and has Downstream consequences, then those are the ones that are take more time to analyze.
3:08
All right, now here's the the piece that I was missing in my equation for making this decision, which I want to share with you, all right?
One of the key pieces of how we decide is the brain chemistry that is going on.
So whether you have lots of dopamine, lots of Serotonin that are circling around in your brain, will also affect how you make decisions.
3:28
Believe it or not, we are 100% emotional decision makers.
The thing is, is what we want to do, is control the extent to which the emotions control our decisions.
Alright, that's the key Point here.
If you don't acknowledge that emotions way into all of your decisions, even your quote, rational ones you are lost.
3:43
All right.
So what you can do is first identify When you are feeling emotional.
And a lot of guys feel like this is like a Foo-Foo turn.
If you're angry, it's emotional.
If you're insecure, that's emotional.
Like there are other emotions beside being a pansy, right?
If you have emotions, I have emotions right now, right?
4:02
Which for whatever reason, anyways, back to the point is that if you have emotions, it decreases the speed with which you make decisions and mistakes, love a rushed decision and say with me mistakes, love a rushed decision.
It's one of the The credos that Leyland, I live by.
4:19
All right, so the environment under which we make this decision is important.
Now we have to acknowledge the biases that we have here is where emotions get even worse.
You have to biases that you have to fight against one.
Is confirmation bias, which is your emotional soup in your brain is going to say.
4:35
This is what I want because this is how I feel safe.
Then your logical braid will search out reasons or data to support that thing, right?
It's like making an argument to yourself.
The problem is You may change your argument but it's not going to change reality which means that the decision can be good or bad based on the soup that we started as the predisposition towards how we're going to gather data.
4:58
The second is conviction bias which is how convicted in mind in this thing or this decision, the more you believe in it or the more you want, the positive outcome to occur.
The more you will purposely blind yourself because you want to save your ego and how you feel about yourself because you it makes you feel good too.
5:17
Think about this positive outcome but it does not affect the percentage likelihood that it actually occurs in the real world, which is why you see other people because you can be rational about others, right?
You see, other people make these terrible decisions.
You think yourself?
Why on God's Earth that they make those decisions.
When in reality that person is you, and it's other people who are looking at you right?
5:35
Real talk.
Wheel clockwise you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
5:53
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world or someone else.
So, this is how I have learned to help mitigate or decrease the emotional impact are the impact of my emotions have a my decision making process so that I can at least be as rational, as I can possibly be and operate from the stance that will benefit my self in the highest degree in the long run.
6:27
All right, so here's what it is.
Number one is that I make sure that I am well-rested when I make the decision.
So if I didn't have like a really good night sleep, like everybody knows, Like, there's like normal sleep.
There's bad sleep.
There's like, decent sleep.
But I'm talking like you wake up like a newborn child.
6:44
I'd recognize those days and I joke with whale about it.
So I'm like, man, I slept like a cherub last night.
Like, if you've got some any big decisions I'm like, let's make them now because I feel completely clear.
Alright, so number one is very, very good sleep number two, and this may sound fucking obvious, but people don't do this.
7:02
Alright, number two is to be well fed.
All right, when we are, Fed our serotonin levels are dopamine levels, Etc.
All get elevated in our body.
All right.
Like you feel better after you eat and here's a fun one for you, your body interprets, stress, both physical and emotional the same way.
7:21
It's a cortisol response.
And so, you in a very real way, when you eat more, are more stressed tolerant.
It's why people do it.
It's why people stressing because you do cope and make yourself more resilient to stress when you eat more.
So, I'm not saying you do this all the All the time.
7:38
But if you're going to make a big decision, you want to make sure that you are well fed and well rested.
All right, and what we're doing here is we're trying to decrease the anxieties and the stressors and the noise that normally will confound the decision-making process because they'll start triggering emotions that will then force you to start finding and nitpicking different data points to then make a supposedly rational decision that is wrong, right?
8:02
And that is there to protect your ego rather than what is going to serve you best in the long run.
And the third piece of the environment that I try and create is if I can, I try and get Space away from the day-to-day activities that I have.
So be that a vacation or literally just removing yourself from the normal space where you operate and because those spaces have anchors in your mind that you have made decisions in the past, you have emotional occurrences that have happened in the room or at the desk that you work at, right?
8:30
And so, you have these anchoring that are around you and you want to remove yourself from those things so that you can have as few.
Outside influences on the decision as you possibly can.
All right.
Now, here's the trip.
Is that once you experience you create this environment, right?
8:47
You want to make the decision from a place of needing nothing.
And so the definition of abundance is having everything you need, which the corollary of the reverse of that is to need, nothing else is to have enough.
And so when you have enough, You will not need this decision to get you anything at all and so the key to make as rational of a decision as you possibly can is to not care about the outcome, either way and to realize that you already have everything you need or want key point and so if you have everything you want and you're well rested and you're well-fed and you're surrounded by the people that you love and you realize the things that are important in life, right?
9:31
All of a sudden it will approach it will.
You appropriately way, the decision that you were trying to make it.
So I don't know if anyone here who's listening.
This has an important decision that they must make, but these are the four steps.
Number one, rest number to eat number three, separate number for operate from a place of needing nothing.
9:54
And when you have those four frames that are stacked on top of each other, they can diss inhibit to a great degree, the extent to which your emotions will influence your decisions.
They Will but ideally secondarily so or at a lower percentage of influence.
10:10
And so it gives us just enough room to peek our heads again above our emotional cloud, and make a decision that's truly rational.
And when we make more rational decisions, we must we live a much easier life.
All right, I'll say that firsthand a lot of the decisions I made in my past they were based on emotions ended up really biting me in the ass especially when I had lots of emotions and acted really quickly and large ways against tyranny.
10:33
Reversible decisions great recipe for terrible life.
And so the opposite of that, if we're trying to use Charlie munger's, inversion process is, how would I make a terrible decision?
I wouldn't be well-rested.
I'd be hungry.
I would be rushed, right?
I'd be anchored around all the things that stress me out.
10:50
And I would make sure that as operating from place of having to have the thing as we look at those things and we reverse them all to stack in our favor so that we can have the best possible decision.








0:00
I've had a lot of mentors in my career.
Many of them were paid.
A few of them are free point of a good teacher.
Is that the student does pass the teacher?
I see this thing that happens all the time when you are a kid and you learn arithmetic.
First, you learn your numbers and then you learn how to add be level up and you learn how to multiply, and then you level up from there and you learn, algebra.
0:17
When you get to algebra, you don't think, man.
My arithmetic teachers of idiot.
I can't believe they didn't teach me this stuff.
It's like, dude, you weren't ready and you had to have the arithmetic in order to get to the multiplication.
It's not that.
That teacher is an idiot.
It's that, that was the sequence.
It's and so when you have a first teacher that teaches you the basics, and you have more advanced teacher later, it doesn't mean you should shit on your first teacher.
0:35
It's like that person.
Got you ready to receive the next thing earlier, on my career?
I definitely did the other way.
This guy didn't do anything.
This guy is the guy rather than seeing it like you would see any other thing that you'd have in school, I've had the opportunity in the, you know, the gift of being able to Mentor, whatever you want to say, you know, provide advice counsel share my experiences.
0:53
A lot of people hold me in a regard and most people who are winners or competitive, it's just like who you are, right?
You want to win.
Beat everybody cause that's that's part of the competitive drive.
But I think there's like a, there's a comma there that needs to get put in which is that you have to accept two things.
One is that you were going to die and no one is going to remember like real real 10,000 years from now.
1:13
No one's going to remember at all.
Number two is that when you're at the end of your life, the people who are going to be our by your bedside or not, the people you vanquished with the people that you helped.
I know that I have passed.
A lot of the mentors that I've had in my career in terms of financials Etc.
Early rod used to think that made me better than them as I've had a couple of More years and some more scars.
1:32
I've realized something different, which is that I was only able to get better than them because they gave me the Head Start step on my shoulder.
You can reach the next Branch.
I think I experienced a lot of Joy knowing that other people don't have to suffer as much.
Yeah, we're walking around outside yesterday in some.
It's like, dude, I did everything you have, and we're doing four million dollars a year.
1:49
Now, like, he was like, emotional just knowing that it's happening.
It makes stomaching the hard times easier.
It feels like it's not just me trying to do this for myself as me trying to do this for a lot of people if I'm failing over and over again at this.
Sing, I know that once I figure it out, I'll be able to help 100 people cheat code their way through it.
And not spend five months, figuring something out or two years figuring something out like, I was stuck at Mid 30 million for three years to everyone watching to like boohoo that's not the point is that there's another guy who's going to get to that point.
2:13
And he's going to move right past it like in a blink of an eye because I've had the right advice that I didn't have.
And I think that if the mentees and the mentors, both see it that way, then the mentees will stop shitting on the mentors that helped them and the mentors will stop trying to hold back secrets that have Propelled them further because the point is not that you're going to beat everyone, you're going to get really old and then you're going to die.
2:36
As you're getting older, they're going to be people who are younger, who had a head start.
And as long as the next guy honors, the fact that guy died on the battlefield to give him these lessons and come back, and they have to recognize that they're going to die on the battlefield to for the Next Generation to pass them, they have it easier than us, that's the point of progress.
2:53
And so rather than lamenting that the Next Generation has it easier.
I thought that what we all say.
I want to make the world a better place.
Well, that's what making the world a better place.
Looks like we say that this is our mission with our business.
We want to make the world a better place.
We want to make an impact.
And then when it actually happens, we resent the kids for the fact that they didn't have it as hard as us.
3:10
That was the point, my point is not to beat the progeny of point is to forge as far as I can look back and be like, hey, watch out for that hole, watch out for that rock, keep going.
Keep going to they move through the path that we tread three times faster than we did because we already cleared all the trees, they get to the next non clearing and they have to start hacking away and hacking away.
3:29
And how can we To force the next PATH and then they become the mentors, turn around, and the Next Generation moved six times as fast to cover my distance and their distance.
If you look at some of the greatest success stories, a lot of them talk about their mentors.
Warren Buffett had his mentor early on the quick story on that was that he said I'll work for you for free and Paul Graham told him your overpriced, he was the one who's going to be giving far more to this relationship even if Warren gave him his time, he still was going to be on the losing side but he still did it anyways because he recognized that Warren had a gift Warren past him in his career.
3:56
You'll notice that Warren isn't like, man, I'm so much better than Paul Graham.
Past that dude in my like, 40s doesn't talk like that.
We really do stand on the shoulders of the Giants.
When I think about, like the gratitude that I have for the gear, Evie's, who's 12 years older than I am, he's forced so much of this path that like, I didn't have to think about how am I going to create this whole thing.
4:14
It's like, he already had a blueprint and I can just start laying that out immediately executes.
There are guys who we have in our portfolio right now, who are in their 20s, who are making twice, what I was making at 30.
But if they came to me below and then now they're above, that was the point.
Gary Vee didn't have Gary.
4:29
Evie to Mentor him on his career.
I do right now, we all do.
Many of us will pass Gary, and I don't think Gary mine.
There's a 20 year old, and might be you, who's watching this and you've got me that's the point.
I'm still going to be hustling trying to beat.
You don't get me wrong when I see guys who were in their 60s, I'm like, man, by the time I'm 60, I'm gonna be ten times as wealthy as that 10 times.
4:46
The real estate of ten times.
Yeah.
But if they had themselves as mentors, they would too.
If your mentees in the students that you have in the people that you help and its people that you teach, don't move above you.
It means that you're a bad teacher, not a good one.
The new Ooh, definition of success of a teacher.
Is that the students surpassed the teacher?
5:02
And then get to the point where they're both looking together with his experience and his Raw Talent, looking at the new landscape saying?
All right, what do you think we should do?
If this video change your mind about some of the shit talking that you've done to a teacher to a mentor who is earlier, on in your career, shoot that guy text and be like, hey, like respect I appreciate you.
5:18
I can't tell you one how much it means to the mentor when they get that text.








0:00
You have to love small business ownership and it has to be about really being a love of the product in the experience.
It's just like, you know what, we have this kind of thing with a lot of the gyms is once someone understands how to write a seven-figure, multi seven-figure gym, you now have the skill set to run a ten million dollar other business.
Welcome to the game.
0:17
Where we talk about a get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I wonder if we can zoom into the sales, think a little bit because I think selling Ang is a massive black box for a lot of people and even for me like when I when I first started actually selling stuff, I've been doing YouTube for five years, but you know, I don't feel like I was selling anything for the first three because it was all like sponsorships, any kind of and then sort of 22 years ago when I had an idea for like, a course that teaches people how to be YouTubers, I came up against so much like internal Barrel like, mental, friction around the idea of selling and feeling weird about it.
0:54
And like, then realized sales is a thing.
So, I wonder what was your experience sort of on the ground in the gym?
How did you cut?
Learn how to sell?
Yeah.
I hated everything the sales and all the Side Story that was that when I quit my job, my dad's body was a my dad my dad's Financial up because investor do right?
1:10
The guy who made his money was like dude you should come work for me.
He's like you can sell and I was like me like I'm an academic.
All right, I'm a I'm a cerebral thinker.
I'm a Management Consultant like the I am known for you know I'm not a Salesman like that was my thing and so I was like I was I thought it's beneath me, I really did.
1:28
And so anyways, I got the job.
II.
Did the interviews?
Got the job and I ultimately like they told me what it was and it was like, here's the phone, here's names, bang, and I was like, I don't want to do that.
So then I started my gym and I realized that I had to fake five thousand dollars a month and then it was like the first day and I was like, oh fuck, how do I get people to give me money?
1:45
I was like, oh sales and so it was a, it was a forcing function.
So I had gone to a weekend Workshop that I spent three thousand dollars for which was a tremendous amount of money for me at the time, To go learn how to run Facebook ads.
It's 2013.
2:02
So I learned how to run Facebook ads and that weekend, and I ran Facebook ads for my gym.
And that was when people came in, I signed up 27, people, the first two weeks, I charge 300 bucks a head.
I think I spent 1,000 bucks on it.
2:18
So I made, you know, spend 1000 made 8700 or whatever was and that was, that was how I that's how I pay my first month's rent.
And my selling was just literally, I Empty gym with no equipment, it was only Turf and a table and they were like, are you going to be here?
2:34
It's just like a scam was like, No And people just believe me.
I was like, I promise I will do everything to get you in the best shape ever and they were like, you sure like I have some people come back, like two days later like make sure I was still there in the two-week period.
And I also didn't understand a lot of stuff like I thought I had to open as fast as possible because I want to, I thought that opening meant that I would make money when really I should have had a really long presale just collected cash whole time.
2:56
I didn't know any of that stuff work so I just try to open as fast as I could.
That was after I had my first 27 points, and I taught all the sessions.
So I was doing six sessions a day and then I would run ads.
I have sales appointments, then I clean the gym and then I went to all my billing at night and then work the lie.
3:14
Like it was I was I was the hardest I've ever worked.
Time-wise.
Like, I've never, I've still to this day, never work that hard.
It was, okay, yeah, let's zoom in to some of these.
So, you had the idea of like, I wanna start a gym, you worked in a gym for free, for then, minimum wage for a while.
3:30
So you understand how a DreamWorks and then he where you just, like, roaming around looking for a warehouse that you could convert into a gym.
Yeah.
And then you signed a lease for five thousand dollars a month ago that.
Right, cool.
I know, I know I have a box, I need to put some gym equipment at their so you put some difficult.
But in there, you take a Facebook ad Workshop over the weekend.
3:47
You spent 3 Grand on it.
And that helps you run ads in your local area that says, hey, by the way, new gym opening something or other and then people walking through the door and then what happens when people walk in through the door?
Did you say?
Hey, this is, this is the gym Can U, give me your money or how was that process would offer an offer, which was a six-week challenge.
4:04
I said, if you lose, because he was similar to my home charity thing where I wanted people to like have skin in the game.
So it was if you lose 20 pounds, six weeks.
I'll give you your money back, so people would bet it was 300 bucks.
I've trained for six weeks and if I lost 20 pounds, I get their money back.
So I was a check.
4:20
So are you relying on then?
People not completing it to make money or know their what the real real is there.
Yeah, so so you've got, you got three buckets, right?
You got people who don't hit it right?
Which is actually not the bucket you want people in because then they're not happy.
The second bucket is people hit it and then have more weight to lose or want to keep working out because they just started this habit and want to keep going, which is the vast majority.
4:41
I think we had just under in hand percent success rate and then the third bucket is people who want to lose the weight and then say, I'll take my money, please, right?
The sales actually, very easy.
I mean, you're just like, hey Do you think that working out six weeks and then going back to not working out is is going to be a good long-term solution?
4:57
No.
Okay.
Well why don't I just take your 300 bucks, I'll credit towards the next year, staying at the gym because now, you've started this habit, you don't want to lose it, we have the momentum and they say, sure, cool.
And I had people commit to the year before they even finish the challenge.
Halfway through.
I be like you like everything.
Everything, cool, your 10 pounds down.
5:13
Awesome you halfway there.
So, I mean, how much weight you want to lose?
Because I promise you, once your 10 like me are now, you're still going to want to look different like you're not going to be perfect.
I've yet.
To meet somebody as a perfect but you're still gonna have stuff.
You want to work on right there?
Like yeah of course.
I'm like okay so question is you want to do it on your own because that's what you were doing before this and I wasn't working.
5:29
Or do you want to do with me?
They're like, I want to do with you.
I'm like, oh, I'll take the money.
I'll credit for it.
So you want congratulations.
High-five big hug.
You want it.
You get it because the point of the challenge is not for you.
Actually lose the weight issue to understand this.
A lifelong process, not six weeks.
Yeah, that was it.
That was the whole process.
How did you do that Transformations?
5:45
Like how do people lose 10 20 pounds in six weeks?
It's all food.
Okay, so you're getting the meal planner?
So what?
Yeah, I would give a meal plans grocery list for Preparation instructions eating out guides the whole thing.
I'd give him a whole custom thing, and then they'd work out at the gym.
Originally was five days a week and then I switched Three days a week.
6:02
Yeah and so that's your offer.
So the offer isn't like a monthly gym membership.
It's just like, hey get into the weight loss challenge, you do the thing and then you're signing up people as they walk through the door.
Yeah.
And what happened is I let and I still do like this in terms of businesses in general.
As I do like having defined in programs on the front end because it gives a very specific outcome for someone on a specific timeline and what it really becomes is your onboarding process so you can typically charge more for a one-time expense.
6:30
Usually three or four times more than you can on a recurring basis.
And so with that affords, you is the ability to liquidate acquisition costs more easily.
And so it's like, if I can charge four times more for the first six weeks of service with somebody, I should do that because it cost me more a to on board, some going to be to acquire them and so I should make more money that first period of time, it makes sense.
6:48
And so structuring business models that way is I've almost done that in every business.
I have got it.
Did you feel weird about selling initially?
Know I was begging for money.
I needed the money.
Alright, I got over it very quickly.
I mean it was just like I had this ethical, I had this like I'm superior I'm not going to lower myself to selling and then I was like, oh shit I'm going to lose all the money I have and so I didn't even know was sales.
7:11
I just said like I will help you I promise Please, you know, I'm like I didn't know what I was doing.
But the thing is, I, you know, I done for thousand sales consults before I ever consumed a piece of sales training.
So like a lot of the stuff I got, I learned most of things I've learned through just doing it.
7:31
Mmm.
And just on this notes.
So you paid three thousand dollars for a Facebook ads weekend Workshop.
He type thing these days so we're sort of tipped almost 10 years on from that.
It do you think there's value in people paying for something like that, or can everything just be learned on YouTube and there's no point in paying for a thing?
7:51
Yeah, I think things can give you learned on YouTube.
I think what you pay for Speed.
So you pay for Speed, you pay for trouble trouble shooting, you pay for somebody else has already done it and not fucked up as many times as your about to to get you there faster.
Like I remember most that I've paid for tons of 101 stuff.
8:06
So I had a guy who had a course.
This is later, this will be 23 years later.
I didn't I knew enough to make, you know, to get ads going.
But like, I really do.
It wasn't like a genie.
I just knew enough to get lead, so I could sell them.
But a few years later, I wanted to get more sophisticated.
I want to learn how to retarget.
I don't know any that stuff and so, I paid a guy who had a course.
8:22
He said, I don't do one-on-one.
I only do As I don't tell my time and I was like, it's America.
Everyone sells their time, just tell me what the price is.
Went back and forth and find.
It was like, 7:15.
Our I was like done cool.
And I think I did eight sessions with them.
So cost me like 5,600 bucks and because I didn't want to learn how to run ads.
8:38
I want to learn how he would think through running myates.
And so the deal was she would get on and then I would be like this is all the stuff from last week.
This is what I have.
This is what I'm thinking of doing.
What, why is it wrong?
Or what would you?
And then Heath, I did all the clicking of the buns and he would tell me why he would think about things in different ways.
8:54
And so, So that was how I learned how and it only took me like eight sessions.
So I was like night.
I like I have to go through a course.
I took eight hours and I learned the scale probably by the sixth time.
I was like, I'm good and I just do two more to make sure that nothing happened.
Yeah, and now you've leveled up your Baseline for how much money you can earn by having totally having this.
9:10
I spent thirty six hundred dollars.
Fifty six hundred dollars.
If I wanted to go run ads for Jim's of.
That was all I wanted to do and have no employees.
I can make 10 20 grand a month easily if that's all I wanted to do.
So like there's you know me like you just keeps adding to your your skill set and staff.
On top.
Now, I also knew how to sell their.
9:26
So you know you stack those two skills together, all of a sudden I'm a hundred thousand a month skill, right?
And so they just keep multiplying and multiplying and multiplying nice.
Okay, so how old are you at this point?
When you just start your gym and you've signed this 5,000 a month, lease 23 down.
That's crazy.
Okay, yeah and he said, that was the riskiest thing that you have it.
9:43
Like, what was going through your mind at the time.
If you can remember for like that, because that's a pretty big, big decision, not much.
Not much honestly, I was ignorant.
Like it was, it was, it was Was it was I mean I I got lucky, you know what I mean?
I got lucky that, I didn't know what, I didn't know, I probably would have advised myself to do that now, but I was fortunate that I by chance went to a workshop for, it was a marketing workshop even knows Facebook ads was even advertised.
10:13
As the thing is, don't even know what they were, they'd known even new Facebook, guys were a thing yet.
And so I showed up there, like, oh, there's these things you can run on and I didn't, I didn't use Facebook.
I had one, but I didn't like I was like act upon I was like very Very like productive mindset like I don't use social media like I was very big on the whole thing but he was like oh we can run ads on there.
10:30
So I learned and it was two weeks before my gym open.
If I had not had that the plan going into the gym, was the guy who I apprenticed under, he just ran Groupons.
And that was how we got.
So that was my whole plant.
I was like, I'll just run a Groupon and I'll just get people in the gym from that.
I'll convert that was his whole business model.
10:47
That was what I was sold on and then I ran a group onto and I get anybody.
No one came in and I ran the same group on because I was in the most competitive part of Southern California's in Huntington Beach.
Also, Orange County.
There's a hundred fucking gyms that are running Groupons and so and he had a hit a more established business.
11:05
He'd been doing it for 20 years like he had, you know.
So when he ran a group on people all bodies, every every every month, he was getting like, 120 people a month coming in for Groupons.
So who's free?
Customer acquisition was free.
He's getting paid to get these people in the door.
I didn't have any of that.
And so I, by chance.
Which will workshop two weeks before it and that is like, honestly, it's the only reason I mean, who knows.
11:25
I might have figured, I probably would have tried to figure out another way, but it would have been tough.
You said that quitting a job felt like the riskiest thing.
Yeah.
What did that feel like a bit but because at that point, you were making like 4K month after the personal training is tough when you.
So why did you don't feel sticky risky?
11:42
But it didn't feel.
It didn't feel regular?
I didn't feel consistent.
I was like, this is one time.
I don't know how long this is gonna last, you know, like it didn't feel like a regular thing, but it wasn't even that because I Been a math decision.
Which at the time it was not about this.
Issue, was an emotional decision, which for me was, I'm leaving the path that I spent the last, however, might basically my entire life leading towards, which is management consulting business school like the whole thing.
12:07
Yeah.
And then you know, Middle Eastern father, same deal.
Yep.
You know he was like this is a terrible idea.
I strongly disapprove of this and we didn't talk for a while.
You know what I mean?
He's like just Throwing It All Away.
So that was very tough for me.
It was that it was just that and I mean at the end of the day, like my my final decision came down to, I mean, I give you the risk things which is like I'll have a good story like ah but I was I was not really willing to let that be the story because I just didn't want him to be right.
12:36
And so I was just going to do anything to not make him have that I Told You.
So moment, I just like I was gonna I was gonna fucking die, I just wasn't going to do it.
And so, The final decision came down to a point where I was so miserable at the job that I had, was I really didn't like the child, like I was fortunate.
I think, if I had liked my job, I don't know if I'd even be an entrepreneur.
12:53
I just really hated the job I was in.
And so, I just, like, the position, whatever released in my day-to-day enough, that I said, I would either have to die to him or die to myself.
And I felt dead inside at the time.
And so I was like, I don't want to continue life living this way.
I would rather accept myself and have him reject me.
13:11
Then me reject myself and have his approval.
That was, ultimately the decision that that allowed me to join our still a pussy about it.
And I drove halfway across the country before I called, and told him because I didn't want him to be able to, like, tell me to come over to convince me that I could that I could come back as he did.
He was I, I come over for lunch, we'll talk about because he would always just like, yeah, sure, you one is we'll talk about it over lunch, you know?
13:30
I mean then you always talk me off the clit off the edge and I was like, no, I'm in Ohio.
It's like I'm gone.
He's like what about your condo?
And I was like, it's there, he was like well what you gonna do I was like I'll sell it.
He's like would you're not going to sell it?
I'm going to have to do what that's like.
I'll figure it out you know.
I was like I'm gone though.
13:46
I'm not coming back down.
How's your relationship with your dad today?
Good, we're good.
I mean he's proud of me now and he's happy about all that stuff.
So I mean, he's got plenty to be proud of in terms of material success.
So you can, you can rest easy enough?
Yeah, I had a similar I think when My took the decision to leave medicine after two years of working.
14:08
And yeah, that that's for my YouTube channel.
My YouTube channels making like way more than I ever would as a doctor.
But it still didn't feel like a mathematical decision.
It was very much an emotional thing.
The whole Asian family, like medicine is, like, the Pinnacle of all of the things, like 10 years of seconds, the veteran cetera and what it took weirdly was I was on Lewis hoses podcast.
14:27
Yeah, I told him the story and he was, he just like, sort of talked me out of it, which is bloody hell, I've But consider in such Stark terms before.
And that was what made the decision to be.
Like, you know what, let's say goodbye to medicine at least for a while and see what happens.
14:43
Yeah, it's only for a while and I can always go back.
One thing is, once you have, I mean, you have an MD, you can do it.
I mean, you always go back to it.
Yeah, out.
Okay, so we at this point you are sort of any of early 20s.
You've got your gem, you're paying 5K month and you're getting people coming in through through the door to do your six-week transformation program and you're up selling them on the longer term thing.
15:01
I think after the fact, what happens next in the story?
The gym starts being successful gross, why?
Five thousand dollars a month.
For the first seven months goes up to 35 thousand dollars a month.
By we buy month nine, I had the whole gym outsourced so I was just managing it by month 15, I took the profit from that Jim do my second, Jim launch that one profitably.
15:19
Now this one, I learned a lot at that point, type relaunched it at full capacity did you know, did it the right way?
Then I opened location 3, 4 and 5 and then using the same concept then I went.
And I felt like I was stagnating.
I felt like I didn't know what to do next.
15:34
I joined an internet Mastermind and they were like, if you're really this good at Bizness, you shouldn't be owning Jim's.
You should be like, teaching people how you feel, your gems up so fast.
And so then and then I transitioned to the turnkey, like I fly out and do the thing, which I make a hundred grand a month on with no employees.
I was like, this is cool.
15:50
So I did that for a Year wish and then there's a series of million series of unfortunate events that happen during this period of time.
Lose all the money like twice, I sell the gyms I go.
All in on the New Concept we switch from doing the turnkey.
System to doing a licensing model and then that was 2017.
16:08
And that's when everything, that's when everything just took off like a rocket, what does it like?
So let's say someone's listening to this and they're into fitness and they're thinking you know what?
I'd like to own a gym.
What does like is it something you'd recommend like it, can you make any money, owning a gym, these days?
16:24
What's the deal with that?
You can, you can, you can make money on a gym.
If you love if you, you have to love small business ownership and it has to be about really being a love of the product in the experience.
It's just like You know what?
We have this kind of thing with a lot of the gyms is once someone understands how to write a seven-figure, multi seven-figure gym, you now have the skill set to run a ten million dollar other business It's just a limited opportunity achill.
16:49
It's a great vehicle to learn how to do everything because you have to do everything in a gym and I think some of the best entrepreneurs are the best sales people, especially learn how to sell, and fitness, because you get so many reps.
You talk to 10, 20, people a day, just rep after rep effortless.
So you get very good at that and you have to deal with people because it's an all-service business.
17:05
So you have a lot of head count for very low Revenue.
Like there's lots of things that are very good to learn.
When I had the same headcount, with TurnKey sales model, I had a 30 employees and I was making Four times the revenue, you know what I mean?
And then went from there to the licensing model.
17:21
I went from, I took at what from eight employees to, like 30 employees that just like that first year and we did like 7 million and then the next year we did 26, you know, it was just like it was just a huge growth, so it's just more leverage.
What is?
TurnKey mean, they don't have to do anything.
I would fly out.
17:37
We do the marketing, we do that, we'd spend the money.
We'd worked leads.
We do the sales like they didn't have to do any.
I just hand them customers.
The you were confident enough in your ability to get customers and convert them to things, that they would absolutely signing up for this.
But hell, yes, you can transform my gym.
Yeah, they said do whatever I didn't do anything.
17:55
I just took a hundred percent of the cash I collected.
Okay, so then what are they getting out of it?
Oh they getting the recurring Revenue go levels of wealth.
So you are very open about kind of net worth and money and stuff and I just love the way you talk about it in a such a matter-of-fact way, one thing that I've been curious about is like What are the levels of wealth that would be Beyond which like you get significant Imaging returns.
18:18
People say 75 came is the pic happiness.
And then, but like, clearly, there are people that, you know, 300 cases, better than 75, km, Millions been thrown out, like do have you got in mind, a rough sort of ladder of level of wealth, unlocks earn certain things?
18:35
Yeah, I think there's like the I don't have to worry about any basic needs level and then there's the, I don't have to worry about discretionary.
Spending level within reason, you know what I mean?
Like I can get, I can go out for drinks, I can go to a fancy restaurant and it's not going to, you know, affect me, I can buy appetizers and not just by, you know, the cheapest thing on the menu with no appetizers know how alcohol and call that the dinner.
18:58
So Layla spends a lot more money than I do, because we just have different but that being said, I spend money on other stuff.
So I spent a lot of money only on information, it's all I spend my money on, it's just information access.
Like that's all I spend my money on and that stuff is expensive, you know?
I mean she offered one 350 grand for an hour.
19:16
So I could just learn from them, you know, I mean, just for contact, so, like, will spend whatever it takes to learn anything.
Yeah.
But like it's always been the highest return for me.
So for me, it's just an eye, like, sure.
Let's go, you know what I mean?
Like, I just I've made some every, every penny I've made as come from knowledge, and if I can buy someone else's 10 years and say, if I can save a year of my life for 350 Grand, why would I not spend that?
19:39
You know what I mean?
So we've got needs.
We've got discretionary spending but you're not worried about appetizers and stuff.
What?
What's yeah, it's build and then you have what I would consider like luxury wealth, which is probably like, you know, a hundred grand a month but it all depends on what you're willing to save.
And so, like Leyland, I have always lived on less than 10% of what we make.
19:55
So, whatever we make is 10% of that is what we're kind of willing to spend.
I don't even think we spend that now.
We probably spent about five percent of what we make.
So, a lot of money, but it's not a lot relative because we're both actually pretty risk-averse, but we're not a logical because some people, I know there's some people in the, in the YouTube space.
20:12
I was having a conversation with her.
Yeah.
Clarinet Clarinet fingers and are like splitting entrees at dinner.
I mean, dude, like you, we literally made more money than this dinner cost while sitting here.
You don't.
I mean like I was I was having a conversation with my father-in-law and he offered to pay for for lunch or something.
20:28
And I was like while we have waited in line, I have made more money than this lunch costs.
Let me cover lunch, I don't care.
So it really depends on your on your, your savings versus spending percentage that you're comfortable with.
So, that's the big Flyer on those levels.
20:44
But I think those are the three levels and it just depends on what that percentage is for you.
So if you're a five to one person I want to make, I want to save 80%, spend 20, then your needs before, when you go from needs to, you know, for level one discretionary you need to still five extra income to do that, but it's just that that smaller percentage.
21:03
So I do think that's individual.
I'm super risk-averse.
Ironically, so what you do with the cash, like if you have spending 10% oh and sort of what happens to the other 90% we are we now going S&P?
Or is that still like, no, I count it.
We invest.
But I have a bigger, I kind of a bigger play for what we're going to do.
21:21
So right now, I'm just stacking it, and I've always been a pretty big cash Decker.
I always have a lot of liquidity.
I just feel better with it.
If you're like, you're not getting the return of 16.
I make a ton of money, I don't like, that's not like what do I get in return for so I would rather have big chunks of cash that I can go on big offense when I want it.
21:39
Then it's just different ways of doing things.
You don't.
I mean I also Have Layla and so she handles a ton of stuff internally and so I wouldn't be able to do some of the investment stuff that we I probably wouldn't do something best with stuff we do right now that takes a little bit more time like deal analysis, etcetera, if I didn't have her.
21:56
So like if I didn't have Layla and I were just trying to live the most passive Cho lifestyle, I'd probably just put everything into a dividend ETF, makes three four percent a year and still gets the appreciation and I was just love paying down.
Our paying up that dividend check every month and just watching it go up and they would probably just become a game for me because it's truly passive, you know?
22:14
I mean like that's just truly zero management passive income which I do like from a cash flow perspective and qualified dividends for anybody's curious gets taxed at capital gains rates which are lower so even if you make a ton of money, you're strolling paying, you know, twenty twenty-three percent, depending where you're at.
So for me I was like, okay that works.
22:30
I'll sit still relatively tax-efficient to get the cash flow from the from the investment.
But for me though, I am going to take bigger risks with the wealth I have because That's the kind of the next level of the game.
For me is taking big bats.
22:48
What does, what does that look like?
Probably, you'll see more stuff for me on the media side, probably in the in the next 12 to 18.
I'll be probably making really major investments in media because, like, you know, they'd here's a fun one, which you can appreciate from a YouTube perspective, it cost me like less than a dollar.
23:09
Or is it cost me a dollar?
Whatever is around a buck per subscriber per month.
Now I'm taking my entire media team cost which goes across all platforms, which is not really fair.
But if I were to if I even took that whole media team and put it against YouTube it cost me around of dollars a month per subscriber and I make more than a dollar a year per subscriber just an AdSense.
23:32
So like from overturned, you know I mean like that doesn't include like what I actually make money, which is mine.
You know, my deal Flow side.
And so you know I mean it's like well then I should you know for my money there and I will be I'll be taking bigger and bigger chunks of companies right now, we do minority deals but I will be taking majority interesting companies, work makes sense.
23:53
So it's like, if I see a company that makes sense within the entire portfolio.
So I give an example.
Like if someone has an accounting firm, it would be great to just have the accounting at hold Co and I'll just buy 100%.
And then I can provide those Services internally and then because of the Buying power that I have between the entire kind of conglomerate for lack of better term, you know, if I have 200 250 million dollars a year and in business that I can push towards something that's like I'm not going to push that kind of money towards something that I don't own, majority of at least.
24:24
So those are kind of the two directions at I'll probably go and it's just reinvesting more in the team and you know, taking up I mean from a from a money, allocation perspective, more of that would go towards the majority purchase of the team.
But that's just, you know, fundamentally how I see it.
Like I'll Better Returns on that stuff than I will in the SP and I have to take if I want to get to a billion, I have to make some bigger bets which is fine.
24:47
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
25:06
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
What's the goal here is the goal to get to a billion.
Like whoa whoa what is it goes in 10 billion?
Yeah the goal is to get to 10 billion but the mission is to just make real business knowledge available for everyone and so that's that's what I'm trying to do and so everything I do a line so that's why I make the book.
25:30
So I make the courses that's why we do the YouTube stuff, that's why we make the shorts.
So we do podcast, that's why we do all of it.
It's just to make real business education available every.
But I have to answer the question.
Why should I listen to you?
And I want to be Unassailable in that perspective, a and then B, I do believe that I'll gain more perspective as as things grow.
25:48
So it's more than I'm just curious what I'm going to learn going from, you know, 200 all your portfolio to a billion-dollar, your portfolio to ten blade, all your portfolio.
And so I have wished that Jeff besos and Elon Musk, and Warren Buffett would come out with a course.
I wouldn't that be amazing but they didn't.
And so my goal is to just document the path that we learn along the way.
26:09
And, you know, when I die of late, they'll just be a whole bunch of people who are you?
Other than me, who make way more money than I do at my age because they were able to just shortcut a lot.
Why is that the mission?
I can making business education available like whoa what was the kind of emotional resonance with you for that thing because that's what certainly for Phrase and free from the corporate wage slavery from everything.
26:31
Yeah.
Not even corporate waves like I'm free.
I can do whatever.
I don't have to do anything if I didn't want to.
So I just get, I just get optionality, which is all I want.
I just want to have options and so I wouldn't have that if all of this stuff didn't exist.
And I have had many mentors in many coaching programs that many courses and so, you know, I would say that I differ from the vast majority of the talking heads in the business space and that I to my knowledge.
26:57
I'm the only one who came up through that world like you look at Andy for Sally, look at my light, you look at Gary, you know what I mean?
Like there's there's they've none of them came up through learning stuff on YouTube, going to seminars going to coaching programs I did.
So I'm a huge advocate for the 444 alternative education and you know paying for skills as fast as you can.
27:18
To, what extent do you think about the balance between, I guess optimizing, for freedom, freedom, fun flexibility, all of that like, living, whatever life, What kind of Vibes versus some people say that.
Once you get to a certain point, you realize that I actually more money, more status more success, more freedom is not actually thing.
27:35
And actually, the thing I care about is investing in a relationship and like having a family and having kids and like, buying a house and the sort of putting down Roots versus having wings, kind of vibe, I have options.
So, if I change my mind, I can't change my mind.
But as I see it right now from where I said, the thing that lights me up everyday is is making business knowledge.
27:57
Knowledge available to everyone.
And I mean, I spend an inordinate amount of time.
Like I spent so much time on those books and presentations that I make, when I give speeches and stuff like, every presentation I make up to this point in my career has been custom and that takes me, like three days.
28:14
You don't need to make a presentation.
So like if you've seen Last Dance, Michael Jordan, there's this, there's this moment where he says that he always has to bring his all because it's the, there's some person who spend hard-earned money and it's the only game they're ever going to see.
And he wants to bring his best for that.
And so that's how I see it, you know?
28:32
I mean, like there's people who will never, you know, they spent real money to be there and it's like they're hoping that they can get one thing from this thing that's gonna like it changed our life.
And I want to honor that what is like a day in the life look like for you.
So it's I mean, I could share my screen, but it's, it's it's I work on my own stuff until about 1:00 most days.
28:53
So usually 5 to 1 is Alex time to do whatever.
Fascist home 5 a.m. to 1:00.
Yeah, p.m.
And then usually, from 124 124 30-ish is when I do meetings, and then that's it.
29:12
Go to the gym, eat, and then I'm done sounds pretty well.
And where are you based it?
We're all over right now.
The Hub is in Vegas, but we're here we're all over.
I mean, we travel a lot.
So it's kind of like this.
Are in between when we're traveling spot.
29:30
I remember you.
Just soaking in to be about, like how you like your office to be very like sparse and not overly fancy and stuff.
And that's one of the things that really I really vibing with within your, in your videos and that you seem to accept until recently, you seem to just be filming on some shitty webcam and just like spouting knowledge.
29:47
And it's just like mind-blowing because you haven't got the and there's like a charm to the gentleness.
And it's just like, whoa, shit.
I'm getting the real truth without any of the production.
All you that like normally gets in the way.
Yeah.
Again, with that.
Deliberate.
Is that just accidental?
Is that just how it ended up being?
30:03
I mean, this all started here at me, like, I'm a big, I'm a big believer in just start and you'll the path illuminates as you walk, you know?
I mean, we now have, I mean, I started without a media team so I just clicked record and I would send it.
I mean I had my media team at Jim launch, but it wasn't it.
What that business wasn't built on content?
30:18
It was built on an outbound and paid out.
So I just said, you know, you know clip it put a thumbnail on it and post it on my you don't even know how to upload them just to say Actually I silly what sounds like just upload it.
And so I just put in a drop box and they would upload it and then that was, that was what I did for the first.
30:34
I don't know, six nine months and then we hired somebody to actually do recordings of the camera.
And so he's like, you know, if we did it like, on the couch, it look a lot better.
I was like, okay, that's fine.
So I took the same amount of time for me and I just had some more people who could who could help and it has shown despite Him as much as I would love meant.
30:56
You know, I would love to just do it like this.
There are you know the audio quality is better.
The video quality is better and the newer videos definitely do better from a objective standpoint.
So some people need, you know, can't focus this long and so they need a little bit more happening and so we can.
31:15
Now again, the whole point is to make it available to everybody, so that means that people who don't have the attention span.
I need to make something available for them so so I'm just doing my best.
To I'm just not going to bitch and moan about the fact that like, people's attention span shortened.
Like so people like I can't cover anything in 60 seconds.
I'm like, there's a hell of a lot.
31:31
You can cover in 60 seconds, if you know, you're saying.
So, you know what I mean?
Like, i-i'm, just not just, I'm just not one to complain about what it is, what it is.
And so, I will do my best to match, you know, providing value to the context that that people are consuming it, it seems like you're spending, like, I don't know how half a million a month on content.
31:52
So, no fair.
No, not even close.
I think we're spending about a hundred a month.
Okay.
Even one dollar per subscriber per month.
It's what it's costing you, yeah, per year, I make a dollar per year.
Oh here.
Oh okay, cool.
I was thinking like a month folks shit that's a lot.
Yeah, no, my channel makes I think as of today, like right now it makes forty-one forty-two thousand a month.
32:13
And then Layla's lail also use the same team.
I think her ass makes six or seven something like that.
So that's just that.
And then the book, the book Revenue comes on top of that, which I count those kind of the same thing because I think that's it's where a lot of people find us those two things together, you know, are more than that.
So I am I technically spend a little bit less than I'm making, which kind of further reinforces the point.
32:34
It depends, if we're just saying, only adds own Supreme Court, the book ever.
So what does 100K month like?
Oh, what does, what does that look like?
The back?
End of the content production engine.
Yeah, it's not huge right now.
We've got four in-house.
I still do Twitter.
So I do Twitter full-time.
32:49
That's still just me.
It's because I like it.
I would do it.
Anyways.
We have a A podcast, vendor a LinkedIn, vendor YouTube, vendor a short / Tick, Tock, / reels, vendor and by, and by vendor you mean like a company that?
33:07
Yeah.
Okay.
Now we have our internal components because like my whole Playbook is pretty simple which is go find the best person who's already doing this at a high level pay whatever to get them to do it be clear that your intention is to take it in house, over the Long Haul, starting with them only hire somebody to Be the, the inner the interface between those two, who has the skill set and then eventually get to the point where you double your volume because you do have from the vendor half from the in-house person.
33:34
When the in-house person beats the vendor, you fire, the better.
And so, what does it look like to work with like an agency on the YouTube site?
Are they telling you that?
Hey, Alex, we need to do a video with this title and the thumbnail go talk or like, what does that look like?
So my team does so cameras, I have in-house team to so they will they'll send me like I could show you a document but it's like the next film session.
33:53
They Have like eight ideas for videos.
I'll just pick the three that I'm feeling.
And so they have like headline idea talking points that they've grabbed for my other videos and shorts that they kind of combined together into one video.
34:10
And I use that as a loose outline for what I'm going to talk about it has to be minimum and this is one of the things that might seem guys.
It's like It has to be minimal on my side because I'm still doing other stuff.
You know what I mean?
So that's my, that's the, that's the big big.
34:27
And so is the is part of as part of the overall mission of making business, knowledge accessible to everyone as part of that, like, you getting as big as possible and all the social platforms as quickly as possible with as much content as possible.
Like the Gary Vee model.
Yeah.
Probably on a a nice we're still not even like we're barely scratching what I would consider to be phase one of that, but we're on just phase one.
34:49
What are the next phases?
We right now, if you were just getting platforms, then we need to maximize all the platforms which are currently not doing.
We have to take it all in house, we have to do that.
We haven't done yet.
I'm not running any paid of any kind which I would add on.
35:06
I don't have any Affiliates or endorsements which I would add on.
I don't have any like in terms of level of content, I would like to do some more like custom production stuff that's more.
Show ish.
Then just like, you know, seven ways to make a million dollars without any money.
35:23
So those are kind of like the direction of where I'd like to go with it and it'll just it'll take time.
And that's fine, like, great things take time.
And do you think at all about sort of pitching certain content?
Like, like, for example, pitching it to a complete beginner who's never even heard of business versus.
35:39
Pitching it to someone who here's how, you'll, how to level up your sales, which is a bit more advanced.
Like, how do you, how do you think of that balance the discussion that we actually have internally a lot?
So So I believe because our beliefs shape shape our world that we can make content that helps both.
So hundred-mile-an-hour offers, if you don't know what to sell that will help you.
35:57
If you sell shit, loads of stuff, it will help you.
So I do believe that if you, I think there's if things are packaged and presented properly, like, sales to your, to your point, can I make a half step into just call it persuasion and all of a sudden?
It's not sales, guys, its sales guys marketers and general population.
36:14
They want to influence people.
So all of a sudden it becomes a much more open topic, so I'm trying to think about all the like, this is what I'm acting like this is today.
Alex is what I'm thinking about right now because I think that there and you know this better than I do but this is just my inkling is that there's a natural ceiling that start you start to approach.
36:30
Now we're we haven't seen any slowdown at all but like I would imagine that there's a ceiling that you begin to approach.
Its you start to kind of own, I don't say own but like take up a Big Slice of like brain brain share of a certain Niche, right?
36:45
And so the only way to expand beyond that I think I've, you know, I've known people who went from sales to Marketing sales to business to make money, you know?
I mean it so they just go they go broader and broader, but I think if you have the depth of knowledge behind you you can make something wide yet also to you.
37:03
So that's a belief that I'm choosing right now is that we can do both.
We can make content that is wide and it just harder but I think we can do it.
So that is what I'm committing to.
If you were to start the whole content thing again like from scratch.
What a what are some things that you might do differently?
I would have started five years ago.
37:21
That's what I would have done.
The only thing I could wish for is for things to happen faster.
The only thing way that would happen faster if I started earlier.
So that's that's it.
But then there's also the caveat of like, I have credibility now that I didn't have five years ago.
So I mean you could make the argument I did.
I probably show my tax return.
37:37
When I was 27 show 17 million dollars of income like I could show that I could have done that.
Maybe I don't know.
I could have.
But like I don't I honestly don't spend much time thinking about it.
I'm content with what we're doing now, we know what plan we have to Execute.
And so now we're just, we're just laying the bricks final thing.
37:52
I want to talk to you about.
So yeah, I think I heard you say in one boy, one of the interviews that you've had six pack abs since the age of like 16 or something.
Something like that.
No, it's your first.
Look, not all of it.
I, I've had six pack abs on my kind of annual bucket list for the last several years and just never, really gotten there, is there like a single resource or lack of knowledge?
38:19
Or is it like a knowledge of motivation motivation?
Okay.
Well that's that's a totally different thing, you know?
I mean like you might you might also want to be a trillionaire.
You might want a lot of things, but like if you don't want it enough, it doesn't matter.
I think it's just more accepting.
They are not going to have.
It was not willing to pay the price and that's fine.
What is the price?
What lots of motivated?
38:37
Yeah.
The price of a six-pack.
It's not that hard though.
That's why I'm like yeah and everyone has his listings like fuck this guy.
I don't know, I've kind of my macros or 20 years, have you okay?
So So go away, but but it's just calorie deficit.
38:53
You don't mean, it's just it's like there's tons of people in Africa who have six packs.
They just don't see the sign of status.
There's just everyone's different skinny, you know what I mean?
And so six pack is purely body fat percentage, that's it.
It's just body fat percentage.
It just means you eat too much.
That's all and a six pack 2, plus being jacked his Progressive overload protein.
39:11
I've seen one of your videos where you sort of break break that down and then to get six pack abs, you just sort of calorie deficit.
And while training bra I mean, truly that is it and so I've hit every muscle group.
Do it three times a week, adwaita reps Over the Bar over a long period of time.
39:29
That's all you have to do, and then eat less than you burn, do that for a long period of time, you'll gain muscle you lose fat, and then you look up after 18 months.
Now, have a six-pack.
Like it just, that's it.
Tell when people are signing up to the way, those programs are all like a gym program and stuff.
Presumably, they know this.
So like why is it that the motivation Gap?
39:46
The accountability Gap.
Like, what is it?
That is the, the What secret sauce that makes someone there's the way so to your to your point even of alternative education in general when you say Hey you could learn the stuff on YouTube etc, etc.
The issue that we're solving for is not that, it's not a knowledge Gap.
The issue is an accountability Gap is that people don't do stuff like that is the primary issue with all humans in general is that they will not endure short-term discomfort for a long-term achievement.
40:08
That is it, you hack that you have success, that's all it is.
And so it's just how can I how can I make it more inconvenient for them to not follow then to follow?
So I can still lean into their humanity and just say, how can I make it more comfortable for them to not follow it?
That's an element of that is accountability.
40:24
Is that someone says, Hey, bad boy, you had a cookie.
When you shouldn't, have you feel bad?
Feel bad.
I'm punishing you because like the only way to change, the only have two things you can do to change Behavior, right?
You can reinforce, or you can thread being punished.
That's it.
You have carrots, and sticks.
40:40
That is literally and So currently they're getting reinforced by their, you know, by their current way of living.
So, think about this way, what is not.
Six-pack do for you.
It does something for you because you keep buying it.
What does not having a six-pack do for me?
Yeah, because Eugene's nothing else.
Over a six-pack.
40:56
So yeah.
Is that the food?
The food?
Just tastes too good.
And I know that I should.
Yeah.
But it's probably not and I get a McDonald's drive-thru at like midnight and I know it's bad and like every convenience convenience and then the story you wrap around like I'm an entrepreneur I need to just do things on my own time at cetera, right?
41:13
So I think if you if you like it's unpacking those things have just trying to find your own bullshit and or if it's meaningful Are you because like I understand why I wouldn't be I was on this podcast, I got an argument the the spokesperson he's like don't you agree that every entrepreneur should be working every day and I was like No And it did not go.
41:29
The direction he was expecting he looks at me and he's expecting to say that I'm like now like what are we solving for featured on live a long time?
Then just walk walk and don't eat a lot.
Like it's all you have to do like, literally at that's all you have to do if you don't live the longest amount possible.
Like I am gonna live a shorter amount of time because I have more muscle mass.
I'm shortening My Life by being how big I so just depends on what Solving, but given how you looking out, you could, you could look fit in 12 months, like you could look like a person that people are like, oh wow, this guy works out because you don't have a baseline of fat that you really have.
41:59
I mean you do you have your body fat but like you're not, you're not overweight, you're just you have your body composition sport now, poor.
But um, say it's not, it's not what you got.
I know anything yet.
Nice.
So figure out what you want, find out what the price is and just be willing to pay that price.
Yeah, well I don't which is also fine.
42:16
I don't buy everything that I see on the Shelf.
If it were A free I'd want, right?
Maybe if I were, you know, quarter of some sort but like like like the thing that everybody has is we all have a wallet with the same dollars in it.
We have twenty four dollars, right?
And so it's like everything has a ticket on it and we're just choosing to spend that dollar whatever we want to $8.
42:34
We got to spend on sleep.
It's like okay well now I only have you know, $16 left and like all right well what is this cost?
Will this cost a dollar day?
It's pretty every day.
I'm committing to a dollar of my $12 or whatever my $16.
It's a big cost.
Does it make sense coming back to the six-pack example?
Like a, how much time effort.
42:50
Do you have?
How many dollars do you pay each day to maintain the six-pack minimal?
Have a passive income body?
No.
Okay, fine, already.
Yeah, this is, this is passive dividends.
I don't need to do much to maintain this.
To get to hear as much harder to maintain here is easy.
I mean, think about this, how much effort is a cost you right now, to maintain your current body.
43:07
Oh Sarah.
Absolutely.
That's how it really does not take.
Like, unless you give your body a recent to eat muscle, it's been a lot of resources to build it, right?
And so you can have minimal stimulation on a weekly basis to maintain contractile tissue and provided.
43:23
You're eating sufficient protein, your body will take the protein.
It needs from your intake rather than its stores of protein, which is your muscle.
I mean, not you, if you watch the video, it's like, you just booked you a pound.
I got a day of May or something.
Yeah, yeah.
Nice Alex, thank you so much.
43:39
This has been absolutely wonderful.
All right, you thanks so much fun, okay?








0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
0:21
I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world with someone else if you want to change how you look.
Look, all you have to change, is the five to ten meals that you have.
Because most people, if you really think about it, eat the same five and ten meals.
0:38
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and Buffett had documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
What was the nation I have been in six pack shape for nearly 20 years.
0:57
I might like 19 and a half years that I've rocked the six-pack and just for full transparency until I was 28.
I was natural, I went on tier T, which is testosterone replacement therapy at 28.
So, the first 14 years was all that and from 2008, until now, I've been on tier 2 since that.
1:12
Okay, now that being said I have done a lot of different diets throughout my life.
I've done keto stuff, I've done high carb, I've done, low carb, I've done high-fat, I've done, I've done, intermittent fasting, I've done.
Today fasting I've done like carnivore style eating I've done iifym, which is, If It Fits your Macros, I've done bodybuilding style.
1:30
Like six to eight meals a day, really light breath metabolism, whatever.
All right, I've done a lot of things and the real talk is I've been pretty much in shape for most of them, but what I want to talk about today is as an entrepreneur, has been doing this, a decade the last 10 years.
I've pretty much eating the exact same way because it has worked for me as the easiest thing for me to do with my work schedule in terms of time to prep time.
1:52
To clean easy to eat.
Not have to think, be able to have business dinners.
Be able to have drinks and work out a lifestyle that for me.
I've never really had to feel like I was dying and maintain a six-pack the entire time.
All right?
So what I'm going to do is break down a five step process that I've applied and many of the entrepreneurs that I know who've seen me eat and been around me a long time, end up adopting this and they never go back.
2:12
Alright, so I'm just sharing, what's worked for me?
What I'm not saying is this is the most scientifically researched, whatever.
I'm just sharing work for me.
If something works for you just keep doing that.
All right, everyone else.
This is just what I've enjoyed and has worked for a decade plus, all right?
And many people that I know have been in shape for very, very long time.
2:29
Follow an almost identical process, all right, because if you can't do it forever, don't do it for a day.
You're not gonna stick with it.
So number one is, you have to figure out what your goal is.
You're trying to get bigger.
You're trying to get smaller.
All right, that's the base Simplicity and if you're new to this channel, by the way, I own six gems and I license my model to 5000 gyms.
2:47
So like I have a decent idea of how to help normal people.
Eat healthy, just a little bit of context there.
Are.
All right, that being said one you pick to go get bigger, get smaller with your guy or girl that's the goal from there.
You start at number seven, all the way up to 21 and every three you go from Extreme Weight Loss to moderate weight loss, to maintenance to moderate weight, gain to extreme weight gain.
3:11
Those are the chunks of three.
Now, all you have to do is multiply your body weight.
So I'm going to use 200 pounds is my average because easy with math.
So let's say I'm a 200-pound guy and I want to get leaner all So I'm going to go to moderate cut, which is the second from the bottom here of these three which you've got 10, 11 12 and I'm going to say 10, because it's easy math, all right?
3:31
And so I'm going to multiply two hundred, which is my weight times 10, which is this coefficient, which gives me drumroll, please?
2,000 calories?
All right.
Now if you're like, but doesn't it change?
What about my exercise?
And what, if I have a physical job, doesn't really matter if you lose too much weight, too fast.
Go to 11, not a big deal, you can adjust it all right.
3:49
Now, if you're also on the flip side, you like I've been doing this for four weeks and I haven't Anything.
Go down.
One.
Not a big deal.
All right, now we've got 2,000 calories, great.
Here's step 3.
You multiply your weight 200 pounds.
Again, you multiply it, by one really hard, math means 200 grams of protein.
4:08
All right.
And so the reason we do that is that proteins just very filling for most people.
Some of the science nerds you like you can only metabolize .7 G for don't give a shit.
I'm talking about what has been sustainable and easy for me to do part of that is because You can measure and hundreds with pounds.
4:24
I'm gonna give you a real hacker.
Right now, every pound of lean meat that you can consume Whitefish ground turkey, breast, 96 for ground beef, like any of the meats that are out there, shrimp, whatever a pound is 100 grams of protein, all right?
4:39
One pound 100 grams protein, so if you need 200 grams, you need 2 pounds.
All right?
That's if you exclusively, eat meat.
And that's if you only ate that amount, you didn't eat any other protein.
I can eat over my 1 gram per pound.
So I've No craziness.
I do because I like eating protein, it fills me up.
4:56
I feel good on it.
That's why I do it.
You don't need as much.
All right.
So now we're back to the math.
This is the last math equation.
We have to do, we have 2,000 calories and we know we have to eat 200 grams of protein, all right?
Now, all you have to do is figure out what two pounds of meat, you want to eat or where you want to get your 200 grams of protein from and figure out how many calories are in that thing.
5:16
That's it for me.
These two pounds of meat are both turkey.
And yes, a turkey for both meals.
Crazy.
These are both 560.
So for me, I know that that's 1120.
That's how many calories I have of protein that I eat my day.
All right, so I subtract my tuner, grams of protein in the calories, associated with those meals, from my 2000 in this example and on have eight hundred eighty calories left.
5:39
Over those heat hundred eighty calories.
Here is the magic of how this works.
You can do whatever you want with them.
If you need to go out to a business dinner, you want to have drinks?
Cool.
Well, cocktails probably 150 calories, have two of those.
And have a 500 calorie meal of whatever you want.
5:55
Because again, you've already got your protein it you knew everyone with it, all right?
Or you could just stay at home and have an entire pint of ice cream.
That's 880 guys, right?
Like you can do whatever you want.
It doesn't matter or you to these cookies is probably 400 calories.
You can have two of them and that could be your dinner.
Doesn't matter.
6:12
All right.
A mind.
You that's with a cut that's with me, trying to lose a pretty significant amount of weight.
Now, I actually maintain, because we're going to this third chunk right in this, in this 13 to 15 chunk.
If I multiply my body weight, I'm more than 200 but let's just say stupid format sick times fifteen is three thousand calories.
6:30
So I would have an extra thousand calories.
On top of that thousand if I did that same thing.
So now instead of having two of these cookies, I can have like five of these trees for dinner or I could have two of these bites, right?
And still have some food.
All right, so the magic behind this is that I like to front-load.
6:48
My protein.
Get the protein out of the way and your breakfast and your lunch for me.
Are very low Roi meals.
So like I can do this.
If I wake up I don't think about after breakfast in probably neither do you.
And let me tell you hack if you want to change how you look, all you have to change, is the five to ten meals that you have.
7:06
Because most people, if you really think about it, eat the same five to ten meals.
So if you want to change your entire life, all you have to do is change the five to ten meals, you eat.
That's it.
All right.
And so for me, I eat the same breakfast and lunch every day and then the dinner is my variable because I have business dinners.
7:21
I travel I, you know, No, I go out whatever it is and so I know what I go into.
How much extra calories I have left over after, I've covered my protein and so it gives me a lot of flex.
So when I get to that big dinner, I can try that new dessert, or I can have multiple cocktails and still keep the sick back.
7:37
Alright, so, You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
7:52
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Last part of this right now is what I want to show you is how I actually do this every day.
Now, for me, mind you, I'm maintaining right now. 3,000 ish calories a day.
8:09
So I start my day with, let's call it a 200 Cal, you can call a bar, you caught a brownie doesn't matter because if I'm traveling, I might not have this with me.
I'll grab a book, you know, Quest Bar at the airport, right?
Usually about 200 calories, and 20 grams of protein, one of those bars.
And then I have shake and this is 30 grams of protein, and 160 calories.
8:27
So all in, I mean, for 360 calories from Breakfast.
All right, I got 50 grams of protein.
Knock down already.
That's it.
Then I go to my lunch.
I have a pound of turkey, which we already know is 560.
And I actually only half of one of these guys.
So I have a half servings so it's one cup of rice that works for me.
8:44
And so that is 780 calories plus 360, which survey says 360 plus 780 is 11:40.
So, between these two things, I now have 150 grams of protein and 1140 in terms of calories that I've eaten.
9:00
Far.
All right, mind you.
I've 3,000 calories.
You just maintain.
All right, not bad.
So now I go to dinner.
Dinner, is the big Flex meal for me.
Now, I also tend to eat a pound of protein at dinner.
Do I need to absolutely not?
Do I want to absolutely I love eating protein.
9:17
I like eating meat.
I feel good.
When I eat meat.
I do if you did it.
And let's say you were 150 pounds and you'd already eaten 150 grams of protein up.
This point, your entire dinner, could be whatever you want.
Pretty cool.
All right?
As long as it equal to the total my college you, okay?
9:33
And so for me I still eat a pound of lean protein when I go to dinner and I do this also because then I'm full if I just eat cookies.
I'm and so I eat my pound of protein and then I eat whatever.
I want to get the rest of my calories, it.
And that's it.
And I've been doing that for very long time.
9:50
You're like there's got to be more to it.
There really isn't and for everyone who's going to probably come and say, Well, it must be nice to be on CRT.
I did it before I was on charity and I was also still ripped inject.
All right, like if that's your mindset, then, good luck.
All right before everybody else, who doesn't have that mindset?
This has worked really, really?
10:05
Well, in a lot of entrepreneurs, I know can do this.
So, here's the, here's the call to action, right?
This is all you have to do going to restate Step 1, figure out, you're getting bigger again, smaller step to pair it to, which of the two.
So three numbers you're going to multiply your weight by.
All right, so if you're trying to gain to me the top half trying to lose its gonna be the bottom half, all right, multiply that you get your calories, third step, figure out your grams of protein, which is your body weight times 1 in grams.
10:32
All right?
In the easy thing to do is just figure out the first two meals of the day to get it, to equal that amount of protein.
That's it step 4 subtract to figure out what the leftover calories, you have our, and you can eat all of those at dinner in whatever form you want.
If somebody were like, What about intermittent fasting do that if you want to and then you just have fewer meals to stuff it into.
10:52
If you're like, I want to eat formula study for meals, it doesn't matter.
All right because 99.9% of you will never step on a bodybuilding stage which is the only place that that might carry anyway.
But the real talk, if you really want to step on the stage is your genetics and the steroids you use.
11:07
Are going to matter more than any of that shit.
All right?
Really want to be real.
Okay.
And so this has worked for very long time and I'm sharing This because I actually had a couple of guys stop me and say dude you made this nutrition video and like I lost 50 pounds using it like thanks so much.
11:24
And so I got a bunch of details about this stuff and so this is really what I eat every day.
This is it this is like super like where is your greens?
I have a multivitamin and I continue to stay alive.
Don't know how much water you drink as little as I can.
So I don't pee at night.
11:40
What other questions do?
I normally get, do you take fish oil?
Nope.
What other common questions are going to get.
What about fiber?
So there's lots of research on this, but, well, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna blow up the internet on this.
I'm regular, I'm fine, this works great.
11:56
Okay, so if like, if you want the easiest, you know, setup that I have found under the sun, keep your breakfast and your lunch, the same, get it to equal after the protein that you want.
Figure out what those first two mules were in terms of calories, I try to keep these as little as possible because for me I work during the day so I don't want to be sluggish.
12:13
So I try not to have a ton of sugar a ton of fat during the day so that when Eat at night.
I eat my big meal.
I unwind, I relax.
I hang out with Layla and then I can like, check out for the back, half the day and I sleep, great.
All right.
And to quote, Dan Soder, if you're having trouble sleeping, not eating enough.
12:33
All right, because we eat a huge meal.
I love the what he says he says you sleep.
So deep, you touch the bottom of the pool.
All right, every time and my point is is like if you're like this sounds crazy and don't Do it, but if what you're doing hasn't worked for you, consider trying this and you might be surprised.
12:52
Its work.
Exceptionally well, in almost, every entrepreneur that I know who started doing this has kept with it because the end of the day, if you have a 90% thing that you can do for the rest of your life versus 100% thing that you only do for six weeks, then why even bother just being shredded for six weeks in the being fat for the rest, your life just be pretty good shape your whole life and that way you actually get the long-term dividends.
13:12
So anyways, most Nation love you guys.
This was a like massively over requested by.
Stay away from Fitness Because I don't want to get in debates about it like I don't care.
This works for me.
It works for you.
Awesome doesn't work for you.
Keeping great.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Just going on everybody.
Happy Thursday.
I hope you have an amazing week.
So far we're now three quarters of the way through the week over the hump.
And I want to make this video for you because I saw somebody recently was actually in my group we've not taking my advice and I'm going to try and have you avoid the mistake that I make that?
0:45
I think that this person is going to make.
And I've had so many gym owners make this mistake and I'm, I'm begging you to not make it too.
So after I had my first location.
So for some of you don't know me that well, First location was in Huntington Beach, California.
1:03
It took me about nine months to get it from.
What's it me?
Yeah, nine months to get from 0 to 250, active recruiting members and I headed out sourced at that point as well.
I'll search being like I wasn't doing the sales, I was still obviously there but I just wasn't doing the sales or the managing the training.
1:24
Now I felt like I was like super, super hot hot star, you know.
And so I was like awesome.
We're opening the second location.
It's going to be great and on my second location I spent a quarter million dollars.
I spent 250 Grand on my second location and I opened that up at month 15 as in 10 was when I opened my first location at months, 15 of being in the gym business, I opened up my second location.
1:49
It's been a quarter million dollars which is basically everything that I had made up to that point and it was just such a terrible, terrible decision because the the second location I was like this one, we're going to do big, we're going to do a right.
I'm going to put all this equipment in there, right?
And it, and I forgot about the thing that had made us money in the beginning and it wasn't the equipment.
2:09
Because the thing is, is that you and I as micro gym owners will never be able to compete with LA Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness and Equinox on the basis of facility.
It's just not going to happen, right?
They have 10 20 100.
Mm.
Me like they have ridiculous budgets in order to outfit their facilities.
2:27
Make beautiful bathrooms with marble and cucumber water.
Her all sorts of stuff, right?
And for some reason, I had deluded myself into believing that I was gonna be able to compete with them on that pricing wise, right?
And so we'll like how do you do that?
Like but what's the one thing that makes us money, right?
2:44
It's service, its high quality, amazing customer service, amazing customer experiences, that's our strategic advantage.
That's how it micro gym owner is able to command premium prices in the market, place and retain customers at prices that are five 10x anyone else in that space.
3:00
And so I had forgotten this and went and spent all of my money on a second location and buying all this fancy new equipment.
And then what happened, right?
It made no more money than my first Jim did.
And that's mind-blowing to me, right?
And so, first thing is, hopefully, let me save you a quarter million dollars and don't do that.
3:20
Don't just think that all of a sudden because you have the money, you should go spend it on more equipment, okay?
That also goes for your current location.
If you fall into some money.
And by that, I mean, I mean, you start gym lunch and you start making some money fast, don't just take that money and they'd be like, all right, great, we're buying a whole bunch of rows or about a whole bunch of assault bikes or whatever else you want to do.
3:42
Stack the cash put in your bank account, save it.
Okay.
That's the point.
The point of owning the business is to make money and it's okay to just make money and not keep reinvesting, everything, that's the point, right?
I can't tell you how many times I've seen gym owners who will be in business for three years and every single month.
3:59
They Us all the profits of their business back into the business.
Meaning they just don't take a paycheck and they're like, I'm just reinvesting.
And then at three years or four years, all of a sudden, they have a couple bad months or a trainer leaves and takes half the business or whatever, everyone's heard the story, and then they closed their doors.
They have nothing, they have nothing.
4:16
They didn't hedge their bet.
They didn't take money and put in the bank account, because the whole time, they're like, I'm going to keep doubling that.
Like, every time you don't take money out of your business, you're doubling down.
It's like being at the casino and putting your bets on the table and being like I'm going all in again.
I'm going all-in again.
It's Dumb.
It's not smart like Financial decision-making as a business owner and I made this mistake, okay?
4:35
So I'm saying don't do it or you can make them stick in the learn it and tell other people later it's up to you.
I think I think time hope is said like one of the beautiful things about humans is that we're the only species that is able to learn from other people's mistakes rather than making them ourselves and then learning.
So Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
4:58
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com.
5:14
Forward slash leads it.
So free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
Now, the last piece that I'm going to talk about here with regards to blowing money, is that this happened?
5:38
I'm really just making this video for all my legacy, guys.
So all of you guys who are in the free group, enjoy.
This happens so many times to drive people wall.
If you're making money keep making money.
Like if you're at 50 k or 60 K or 80 K per month right now, go up to 110, go up to 120.
5:59
Don't think?
Okay, we just went so in the last three months, with working with us, you know, we've gone we've taken our EFT from 25,000 to forty five thousand a month, which is great.
Don't get me wrong.
It's awesome.
But the point there is to stack the money don't Immediately say I'm gonna open a second location.
6:17
Like I can't tell you, I literally cannot tell you how many gyms that we have worked with who month zero.
They're almost closing their doors or they haven't taken a paycheck and however many years there, they're putting payroll in our credit card or they're worried about Rhett etcetera month zero.
Alright, then they make 30 G and their first month in additional Revenue using Jim Lynch and the next month and make an additional 30 Grand in Revenue using Jim lunch and then let's say a month, three or month.
6:45
Now they've taken their gym, total revenue from, let's say 15,000 a month to 45 or 50 thousand a month.
Okay. 15 to 50.
All right, within three months or so and then I get messages from the owner be like hey man, I'm opening up my second one patient.
I'm like, what is like you're like psychotic right?
7:03
Like like you should be able to maintain this for six, straight months, minimum maintaining a solid margin, stacking cash in the bank account, and then feelings.
Financially secure making sure like getting ahead on mortgage payments paying off your car paying off your debt so that you have no constraints on you so that you can breathe with this money.
7:24
That your business is making you because a lot of times, people forget the point of the business is to make you money.
That's the point, right?
And so we're like cool and then we want to take all this money and just go double down again.
So, we're back at the casino and so we're like awesome.
I just need 10 grand, three months in a row, net profit.
7:40
I'm going to open a second facility know.
Like, let's try And see exactly.
Now, we just covered all the overhead and now we have a profit margin.
Let's see how much gravy we can pour on top, right?
Like, how much whipped cream, how much hot fudge?
Can you pour on top of this Sunday that we can take home with us, right?
7:57
And so it's like when you have this like you can make a sick amount of money from one, Jim.
All right, like the biggest failure.
I see it all the time, like, that's why I'm making this video.
Like so many gym owners will do this, because we want to grow and I get it.
But like You can like learn from my quarter million dollar mistake.
8:14
Don't do it too soon.
Otherwise you skill issues.
If you feel like you're working 40 hours a week and you have one Jim, you were Katy when you have to, that's what happens, you scale problems.
All right?
You scale, the amount of time that you have to put into it.
You should literally be on.
You should be bored out of your mind that your gym for six to nine straight months.
8:31
Cashing in 2025 thousand about, take them before you open a second location.
All right?
I'm begging you and for those of you who this resonates with because you've been in that situation, that some of you guys who work with me, You sold off a location because I asked you to.
So we could make you more money, please comment to just help other people who, don't believe me right now, like, our egos get involved.
8:51
Our status gets involved.
We want to say, hey, I've for Jim's, I have three gyms.
I have to Jim's whatever, but like, who cares, right?
Like your wife doesn't care.
She cares.
How much money you take up an emphasis if you're a woman then your husband asked, are you going say?
I'm just using key because I'm a key and that's what I think.
But anyways, don't make my quarter million dollar mistake.
9:09
Don't go out, like, don't keep putting buying the Equipment.
As soon as you make money as soon as you start making some money, three months in a row, don't start looking for a second location.
All you should be doing is continuing to stack cash.
Take, as much money out of the business, don't double down on black, put it in your bank account.
9:25
Pay off debt, increase your net worth.
That's the game.
The whole point.
You got into this business was for Freedom financially, geographically and temporally, that's what virtually every entrepreneur gets in this business for right Freedom.
Right?
And then, as soon as we make some money, like all we do is we want to tie yourself down again, right.
9:41
It's Insane.
But we do it postal.
All right, so if you if you got into this business to have freedom, then build your freedom, like make sure the gyms 100% Health, like Outsource, make sure there's a sick profit margin, pay off all your debt like those are the things that are going to increase your freedom, time-wise geographically, financially, all those things.
10:02
Okay, thanks guys, I hope this makes sense.
And all you have to do is double down on your customer service, getting amazing experience.
You can charge me rent prices.
And take home if that margin.
So, lots of guys, hope you have an amazing day.
I was a little little bit of a rant this morning.
10:19
I just saw a couple people who I love her Legacy.
We're trying to open the gyms just because they did like ATK.
But, like, two months in a row and I'm like, don't do that.
Like, don't do it.
Just stop, just take the money.
Just freaking make your money and just make it and just keep making money.
That's the point.
Okay.
10:37
So thank you very much, everybody.
You could also, if you feel like it, follow me on Instagram.
We just started an Instagram account.
We have little videos and things like that are going on there.
It's at Alex underscore her mozi thoughts on this room.
Lots of love.
Thank you.
All right.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
I think that in order for us to walk the middle path in life or we have to achieve Mastery over the thing.
Before we can truly Master it and give it away.
And that's how we can eliminate the diet for the thing because we truly know what it's like to have it.
0:36
And then that means we can truly know why we don't need the wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
0:54
I hope you share and enjoy.
It was for all my friends who are doing, you know, 1 million, three million, five million dollars a year and who come to me?
And always like, man, I want to challenge.
This is so boring.
I want to do something new and exciting.
1:10
And so let me tell you a story about my neighbor and so my neighbor had a trash business, all right, trash collection business about as boring as it gets and he sold his business, a few years back for a lot of money, I'll just put it that way and I was walking one day and he was like watering his lawn and I was like, hey man, You know what's going on and he said I just got out of my non-compete and I was like oh that's awesome.
1:32
So you know what do you plan on doing?
He's like well I plan on doing the exact same thing again and I was like wait what do you mean?
He was like well I plan on starting another trash business and selling it right back to the guys who bought my last one and I was like what?
And like he could tell that I was kind of like confused by this and he was like he's like why would I learn something new?
1:52
He's like I already know everything about the trash business.
He's like, I'll just do it again and I and it just it just really hit me. so, I was like, So many entrepreneurs myself included, right?
And I made this mistake so many times early on, in my career, we desire novelty.
We desire challenges, we want growth, right?
2:10
But the thing is that we think growth means new.
When I think that a lot of times we could redefine growth as meaning, we develop the character traits to be able to persist and continue to do the same things over and over again, right?
You don't you don't see these real estate Moguls.
For example, being like, man I've built, you know, twenty million dollars in real estate.
2:27
I kind of just need a challenge, I'm going to start, I'm going to start a restaurant.
Right?
They don't do that.
I mean think about how stupid that would sound to you.
You're like dude you're so good at real estate, just keep doing real estate, right?
But I see this, especially in the marketing Community more than anything, is this this need for constant change and, and, and growth and challenge, right?
2:45
But I think you need to redefine the challenges.
This is becoming hard for you because you're getting bored.
So the challenge is learning to a be comfortable with boredom or be, not need it.
Because the business doesn't exist to status fi, our Colonel deficiencies, right?
3:01
And that's usually what most of us.
Build it.
We're insecure.
We need connection.
We need.
We want status, right?
These are the things that we build our business to solve but our business doesn't actually need to solve any of those things.
It just needs to provide value to the customer and then we try and extrapolate our project.
Our own needs onto the business and in so doing break our businesses and make the wrong decision.
3:20
And so let me tell you different story.
So I've had one two, three different guys, tell me in the, in the internet marketing space, who I say once doing You 20 million others doing about 10 million others, doing about 10 million a year, probably in the neighborhood of, like, three-ish million in profit per year around there 325 and so each of them on their own reached out to me and said, hey man, I think I'm going to start a software company because I'm not, I'm not challenging enough doing this anymore, right?
3:47
And I thought about that and I just thought how kind of hilarious it was.
It's like I've risen to the top of my game.
I'm bored doing what I'm doing and so I'm going to stop doing this and then I'm going to enter a new Arena where everyone else has been doing that for 10 years.
And there are other kingpins in that Arena and I'm going to try and relearn everything from ground zero and then try and beat them now.
4:06
Here's what's interesting, right here's what's crazy.
If you were to let's say make a hundred thousand dollars a year in your business and you decide that you're going to be a true entrepreneur and I mean you're never going to quit and it means that you're going to continue to do business for, you know, 40 years or whatever.
4:21
Right?
If you were to gain at the same Pace as the marketplace, which by the way when you're smaller is really easy, right is 10% a year.
If you were to grow by 10% a year by the end of the 40, Years, you would have a gazillion dollars, right?
But most people are always trying to beat the market.
When, in reality, if you just match the market, you would become extraordinarily crazy wealthy at the end of this game.
4:42
But because we are so frenetic.
And we have these insecurities that we project on our business.
And then Force our business to solve our own personal issues, we end up breaking.
The thing that is actually working just fine because we have these interpersonal needs that we're trying to satisfy and this was very hard for me to learn.
I'm saying this because for me, this was a mistake that I made over and over again.
5:00
Probably, for the first four years of business.
For me, I tried to make my business off my personal problems, when it really, just needed to solve my clients problems and I needed to do with my own personal stuff.
Right?
And so, one of the things that I wanted to give you was the ways that I create challenges for myself within the business without destroying the business.
5:19
All right, so let me give you two different things that have been complete Lifesavers for me.
So, I have desires for Innovation.
I have desires for new things, right?
And so, where to channel that This is not to create new businesses where to channel that is to create new friends or new back-end.
5:36
So meaning like how can I change the hooks?
How can I change the creative?
How can I change the, a daityas, the marketing?
The, the front ends that bring people in.
Because the more variety of there, the more different types of avatars I'm going to attract and ultimately grow the business.
So you can use that entrepreneur, lady DB use it in a way that's going to serve you, right?
5:53
And serve the business without rather than Breaking the business, right?
Whereas if you start creating more businesses to satisfy your add, Then what ends up happening is well, you know, you have lots of businesses and you don't have any money and so that's the first thing.
The second thing that I do that I will walk you through is understanding constraints, all right?
6:10
And so I one of the one of the lessons that I've learned over the last 12 months is multiple metrics for success.
And so I'll dive more into that in another.
But basically for a very long time, my life the only metric for Success that I had was how much profit and how much increase in net worth I had at the end of the year, that was it.
6:27
So I care about and I think that as we've gone to the We're like an increase in net worth the marginal utility of more money, meaning like the amount of extra good that I can purchase.
Or that more money can purchase me is very, very little, right?
There's nothing that an extra ten million dollars or an extra 50 million dollars is going to purchase me that the first, you know, 50 is a my me right, there's nothing right that it can, there's nothing that I can't already get, right?
6:50
And so, when you think about things like that, right?
Would it forces you to do is create different ways to win, right?
Because it's a game, right?
If your entrepreneurial, then you all you Especially if you become more successful, you'll see it as a game, right?
And so, you have this game that we're playing and we have these metrics for Success.
7:07
That originally are just increasing net worth, right?
But then you could say, can I increase my net worth and have a good marriage?
Can I increase my net worth and, and be in shape, right?
And so, one of the constraints that I'd like to offer you as a challenge to give to yourself, so that you don't get bored in the business that you have is a constraint around time, right?
7:26
And so that was one of the things that I did over the last 12 months was like, okay, I I want to build something that does a billion dollars a year in Revenue which is the goal for the portfolio and transparently.
We're not there, you know where to about 85 million dollars a year across our portfolio.
So we're still a little short but it's a good thing to focus on.
7:45
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
8:03
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its so free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast, so that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
8:21
Now the thing is is that I don't want to make and the way that I have to make that is it I can't not going to outwork to get to a billion.
Write it you have to make good decisions and you have to let compounding work in your favor, right?
Because if we have the 85 million and we give grow by 10% a year in, you know, 20 years will probably be there, right?
8:40
And so well, let's see a doubling would happen every seven years.
So 21 years would be double double double.
So that would be 2 4 8.
So 8 times 85 know, we'd still be so we need another double.
So we'd have to play 28 years from now.
We could be it if we just grow at the market rate, which is pretty encouraging.
8:56
I think so.
I think we can beat the market rate.
But anyways, the point is, adding constraints makes the goals far more interesting, because I think the first level of achieving any goal is learning how to sacrifice everything to achieve the goal, which I think candidly.
I don't know many people who are super successful who haven't done that, you have to be able to put everything you have on the altar of success and sacrifice it for what you want.
9:16
Some people may not like that idea and that's fine.
I don't, I just don't know people who are Ultra successful have done that.
That and the reason they are willing to sacrifice everything is because the deficiency they have in their soul is so great that the pain they're suffering from is like for not having the thing is so great that the put everything else on the Altar for their success.
9:32
And I know that I did that first hand and so I remember even when I when I was growing growing into this entrepreneurial role that I didn't tell myself, I'm gonna outwork everyone because I didn't even think that was realistic, I said I will out sacrifice, everyone's one of my competitors are going out to dinner when my competitors are hanging out with our kids.
My competitors are hanging out with their wives or being good husbands.
9:47
I was like, I will get ahead.
That was what I told myself and it worked But at a certain point in, this is why multiple metrics of success are important.
The new goals that I'm setting have constraints on it because anyone can just sacrifice everything to get what they want.
But the question is, can I build a billion dollar a year Revenue portfolio working two or three days a week, right?
10:08
And can I do that?
Also, while being in competitive, you know, competitive shape physically, right?
And working out one to two hours a day because I like it, can I do all of those things?
And so this is kind of the new levels of challenge I'm doing rather than trying.
Thing to break what I have and going doing ten other new things.
10:25
It's like, can I add constraints the existing game to make the game more fun for me without breaking the machine?
Because ultimately, like, the machine doesn't serve to, it doesn't exist to serve me.
It exists to serve the customer and making sure that I don't conflate those two things has been a very valuable asset.
And so, you know, one in the very beginning for me, I'll tell you the story.
10:44
When I, when I started the first time, where I really saw success was, when I learned how to sacrifice us to us saying sacrifice earlier.
So, I'll tell you how I actually learned how to do this.
So, when I was in college, I ended up pledging a fraternity and it was a very hard pledging process hard being like time-consuming, right?
11:00
And I think we had to basically every hour of the day - three hours and - class time.
So we had three, our study hall and we had whatever our class time was all the rest of the time we had during the day, we had to be at the house and doing chores and stuff.
And so that was pretty miserable.
And that wasn't like, you know, a ton of fun, but what ended up happening was I end up getting really good grades that semester in college, and it was because they forced me to 23 hours, a day, every single day, of homework.
11:23
And if you do three hours a day of work every day and this is what I realized in college, there's the days that you don't have work to do if you still work three hours, you get ahead on a future work.
And so I realized that for only 3 hours a day if I just did that.
I would I think that's mister I got like a 383 or something like that.
And so what I did after I finished pledging was I realized that all these extra hours of the day were mine.
11:43
And so what I did was I was like well if I can just study all the rest of the hours, then I should do really really well and that ended up being a really good.
A really good Methodology was I just sacrificed all of my day, so I basically went to the gym, went to the library and went to class, and that was it.
And I, that was it.
11:59
I never worked past 9 p.m. and I went out almost the nice that week, but by always doing it that way, not wasting my time, I ended up doing really well and it was the first time I ever learned how to sacrifice everything, which was everything else.
I just didn't do anything besides work out and that and go to class like that, was it throwing day?
12:16
And so when I started applying that same kind of concept to business, it was actually fairly easy for me because I was so used.
To sacrificing everything.
I just switched over what I was sacrificing for and I think that you have to learn how to sacrifice first in order to learn how not to sacrifice later.
12:32
Right?
Because a lot of people are like why would I want to achieve the success you have or whatever?
But I don't want to sacrifice X y&z.
I just I think you can say that.
I just don't know anyone who's done it.
It's kind of like saying, I want to get over the whole that money has on my life except I haven't made any money.
I think you have to achieve something before you can give it up, right?
12:49
I mean Buddha who Who gave up his worldly riches, like he talks about, you know, he walked the middle path because he had been extremely wealthy and a prince and then giving it all up and lived as a poor person and then walk the middle path.
It's, I think that in order for us to walk the middle path in life, we have to have achieved the thing.
13:05
In order, we have to achieve Mastery over the thing before we can truly Master it and mean and give it away, right?
And that's how we can eliminate the desire desire for the thing because we truly know what it's like to have it, right?
And then that means we can truly know why we don't need it.
And so I think that's I know it's it didn't mean to get 100% business philosopher on you but but that's that's kind of where I think this goes full circle.
13:27
So big picture here.
Multiple metrics of success, don't change your business just to challenge yourself.
Find new ways to either create front ends or new product lines or things like that, within your business that can satisfy your add.
And if neither of those things are what you want to do, then just use constraints to create challenges in your own business, that improve your life and other ways, right?
13:49
And you can always go back to my neighbor.
The guy who sold his business for trash is trash business for a lot of money and and just say he's like, why would I learn another business when I'm Already really good at this one.
He's like I'd have to learn everything from ground when he's like that.
Just sounds hard and stupid and I couldn't really argue with the wisdom of that advice because he doesn't use his business to satisfy his interpersonal desires.
14:10
He used his business to create wealth, which was the whole point.








0:00
They're 14, massive money mistakes that people make in their 20s that you do not want to repeat.
And this is one of those don't buy an iPhone by an Android bullshit.
Like, if you make these mistakes early, you will have to pay for them for years.
But the good thing is that you can avoid them very easily, number one under spending on education and overspending on status.
0:16
When you're in your 20s, you probably aren't Ballin.
And the amount of people on Instagram.
I see what their check mark that they bought in front of a Lambo that they would ever.
Like, we all get it.
They're full of shit.
We understand the people who matter are not impressed if I were 200,000 dollars, Watch all the buddies that I have, don't give a shit.
0:32
The guys who are ahead of you, they want to see you eating shit, living, poor learning, and hustling.
You drive around in your new roles or bands, or whatever thing you're maxing out, all of your expenditures.
So you can Flex to other 20 year, olds is stupid.
Now, you should take that same money and plow all of that into your own ability to earn more money and that's what somebody who's ahead of you is going to look back and give you that status and respect or like you can get status in your twenties from people who are ahead of you.
0:56
If you're doing the right stuff, if you show that you're on the wrong path, they Matically think they're like, he doesn't get it or she doesn't get it.
They'll never associate with you until you understand the lesson.
Number two, taking jobs to earn, rather, than to learn.
And this is one of the biggest ones we had 1,000 people who applied for a YouTube editor.
1:12
So for editing videos like that.
So we offered somebody very good pay and the guy said, I want an extra three thousand dollars a year Missing the fucking plot.
He didn't understand was that he was in a season of learning not a season of earning he might be able to go somewhere else and get 30% not even three thousand thirty percent higher.
1:33
The people who are going to pay that premium are paying the premium for everything you know and have nothing to add to you if you're taking your jobs right now in order to earn it's not the right season you're trying to cash in early the earning potential of you getting extra ten thousand dollars a year or twenty-five thousand dollars a year in your 20s is show So inconsequential on the long time, Horizon of the skills that you should be learning right now.
1:54
Three is that you save money?
That is a mistake.
Hear me out.
You want to save money in your twenties but not actually save it.
You want to not spend it or blow it on shit and you want to put it into a separate account, but that money, you want to invest not dollar cost averaging SP or whatever it is, you can do that.
2:10
By all means, it's a great way to like have some money later, but if you want to become Filthy Rich, which is hopefully, you know, what motivation is here to do.
You want to invest that money into you and your earning capacity right now?
You make so little that the money doesn't matter.
So like if you say $500 a month, C of thousand dollars a month, you can put that into the calculator and look what it's going to be in 70 years and like cool one.
2:29
It doesn't factor in inflation.
So when people see that they're going to be worth four million dollars for million dollars, in 60 years, is also worth like a million dollars today.
Think about how much more you'll get back.
If you spend ten thousand dollars this year and then you double your earning capacity, are you triple your earning capacity?
Instead of saving money to invest in assets, invest in them, when asset, which is you and increasing your earning potential number for decide how much you're going to enjoy.
2:50
Invest first before you spend money, prioritization comes from taking that silly pride comes first, right?
Is that you take the money off the top?
You say this money has been prioritized for my learning my education and then whatever you have left, that you can spend all that money that account, you can let it stock pile up and then you see something that you want to learn and then deploy the capital not.
3:09
What do I have left?
At the end the month.
Can I afford it?
You've got this big pile of gold over here.
The every month, you plan to and then when you, when you see the opportunity to make the decision to pull the trigger.
Number 5, automate, the investing and Manualized the spending, you want to lubricate how easy it is for you, to invest in yourself and want to make it harder to spend on shit.
3:27
That never comes back to you.
Dave, Ramsey, who talked about people having cash rather than credit cards?
They actually feel pain when you buy things in cash compared to using credit cards, the harder it is to buy something, the less you buy.
Like, the only one even hit your account is the money that you're allowed to spend the other money.
You've already allocated out to the other things.
So, I give you a rent account, maybe, and then you've got your personal investing account.
3:44
As a me, you've got your food and your car money, whatever, number 6, don't go shopping.
Let's be real.
You don't need another Nother set of sneakers, the idea that someone says I'm going to go shopping, like they have no agenda.
It just means, like I'm going to waste money today.
Stick with the list that you already have pre-approved in terms of your budget.
4:00
This is my list.
These are my groceries, this is whatever.
And if it's not on the list, you don't buy it.
It's a very simple habit but that will pay dividends for the rest of your life.
Number seven, get takeout, don't cook your food, very contrarian.
I know, as soon as you make more than $15 an hour, it makes more sense for you to work that day.
4:17
Get the takeout food and get the time back, it makes more sense.
Financially.
Most people can like if you're not being a weirdo, you can eat out for 10 bucks issue meal and you to out twice a day is 20 bucks a day $600 a month maybe if you wanted the grocery store, if you want 100 bucks a week versus $150 a week, is the net $50.
4:33
We can you not make that up for the meal prep?
Go to the grocery store.
Cutting cooking cleaning, your saving, their pennies rather than investing in the Mega Millions which is you number eight, people live with the wrong people, they have terrible roommates who break things you go out, drinking who are late on rent.
Like these are all things out of distract.
You from the thing you're trying to do that's like level one worst type of Of roommate above that, you've got people who are responsible etcetera, but they all have the same goals as you, they will speak over you.
4:56
They're limiting beliefs, and they will often times not actually root for you, and they will kind of undercut you when you're on this path, which is probably different than them.
And the thing is that in the beginning, what become success looks like, Billy, you're learning, you're not earning their already pulling, their earning trigger, their bragging.
On the fact that make 70 grand a year, whatever you have a different goal.
5:12
And so never listen to people who have smaller goals for your life than you do, making sure that you're living was a type of people who are trying to do the same thing as you are in your life.
Will encourage one another and you guys are kind of like in the game together.
That's what will shape the way you see the world.
I do think it's worth living with multiple people in your twenties because one, your choice can be lonely, but to it's also just a lot cheaper.
5:30
I live in a house with seven people in California and I was able to only pay 400 bucks a month in like a nice area which leads to number nine, your micro Community matters a lot, I would overpay for convenience in terms of being close to stuff, close to the highway so I can get on and off.
And right, two places I need to close to a gym and close to cheap places to eat if I can do those things and ideally if I can walk to them, I save time and gas.
5:50
Get outside.
If you live in the middle of nowhere and it takes you 25 minutes to get the gym in 25 minutes to go back.
There's all this time that gets eaten up.
I'm willing to pay a premium to save all of the ancillary costs.
That would go with living somewhere, less, convenient, less safe.
I would live with more people in a better area than fewer people.
In a shitty area.
Number 10, this is you model the wrong season of life.
6:07
Sometimes younger, guys, look at what I'm doing and I like I'm gonna do it.
House is doing things just like you don't have a track record and reputation is built on two things.
It's built on what you've done and what you say you're going to do and having both of them come true.
The thing that builds the reputation is not modeling what I'm doing now, but modeling what I did before.
You want to make sure that you model the right aspect of someone's life at the right time.
6:23
Flying private doesn't make you rich.
I mean, you spend a lot of money, sequence matters, number 11 measure money in how long it took you to earn it.
Let's say you make 20 bucks an hour if you want to go buy a shirt for 100 bucks.
You have to think yourself, okay.
I make $20 an hour twenty percent payroll tax.
6:39
I'm actually going to have to work six hours to buy that hundred dollar shirt with tax whatever.
So if someone said, I want you to work all day and I'll give you the shirt, what I do it probably not.
I worked at Smoothie King way that wasn't 50s, 15 years old, $7.25 an hour, a six-hour shift, right?
So I was making in 43 bucks.
6:55
People would go next door.
I remember noticing this, and they would spend 15 bucks and lunch.
Sounds like so you have 36 dollars after taxes for coming to work today and 15 of that is you going to lunch next door?
So you're working six hours for 20 bucks.
Number 12.
Get competitive with money around.
7:11
What you're saving, not what you're making.
So I told you, this is a season of learning not season, earning to know what you're going to learn.
You have to budget towards your investment, rather than thinking, I'm making five thousand dollars a month.
Than spending five thousand dollars a month.
Meaning I'm profiting personally, zero, say, I'm saving 25 hundred dollars this month.
To invest in me, I've had people who I know, have been making hundreds thousands, even millions of dollars a year and have nothing, they blew everything.
7:32
And so make your PR, your personal records around what you're able to put into that bank account every month.
Number 13, check your account, every single morning, until I started doing it.
I stayed poor, I didn't wanna look at my bank accounts that would hurt my feelings.
Seriously, I just I would look at it and I would feel poor, but that's okay.
7:47
You have to confront reality in order to change men, money's pouring out of this thing left and right.
Once I got a pulse on it, I knew it Tuesdays.
When I paid this Thursdays, when I pay for this, it's a habit that once you learn it, it's hard to forget, I promise you just like losing weight, you get someone to measure the weight every day.
Get some to measure the bank account every day, it'll improve number 14.
8:04
When is it okay to spend money?
If there's one thing that I probably could have done better is I could have spent money on one time experiences and what I mean by that is not going to the club and poppin bottles go to Europe and doing a you know sleeping in hostels for three months.
That's a cool experience that you're not going to be able to do when you're 40, you're just not going to do it.
So there are times As of Our Lives that are optimal for certain types of experiences and those windows closed.
8:24
And so, if there are experience that you can only do in your 20s, I wholeheartedly support them but you want them to be things that when you're 80, you're proud of giving yourself permission to spend on an experience in a limited fashion.
You want to drain your entire investment, right?
You want to go see the Grand Canyon for 3 days.
Go to the Grand Canyon.








0:00
I like trying to solve the problem rather than saying, cool.
That's the equation.
I have a fundamental belief about the world that like, if you ask the right questions, you can solve the problem.
And I just believe that if we're creative enough, we can figure out a way to make it grow profitably.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:21
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
We are here with the man with the greatest beard on the internet.
Who might enjoy talking about Chipotle even more than I do mr.
Alex, her Mosey.
Thank you for having me.
How you doing, man?
I may have to be here.
I'm actually pretty, I feel like you diss lightly disappointed.
0:40
You, you thought I owned a bunch of companies, you're not the first person because in my bio it just links them down below.
So people are like damn you and movement and ghosts.
And that's what I said.
I was many other two companies I don't know about It's all good.
I well, I'm glad that you work with those guys because it's still, very cool Brands.
0:57
Yeah, absolutely, man.
Well, why don't for people that?
Don't know you.
Why don't you just like to say, like what's your Uber pitch of if someone's just like, who are you?
What do you do in your life in a car somewhere?
What's your like quick little identifier started with a chain of gyms out this silicon for Nia.
1:13
I sold those kept the IP started licensing.
The model to just under 5,000.
Look, actually think we're just over five thousand locations.
Now, sold two thirds of that company.
Last year and some answers.
Companies that went with that forty.
Six forty six point two million to private Equity, Firm out of San Francisco.
1:31
And during that whole period of time, it was a very cash flow, positive company.
And so we started doing a lot of private investing.
And right now, we started acquisition.com.
Now, right now, I mean, two years ago, I've started Ecuador, not common that portfolio of companies as about $200, a year.
I was gonna be like, and I have and I make a lot of content now just to help other people do it too.
1:53
And Hopefully grow their business is big enough that we could, you know, invest in them someday.
That's what you would tell an Uber driver.
Yeah, that exact specific.
Well, I have a long ride, I got 10 minutes, he's gonna just have to listen to it.
Yeah, he's my goddamn I didn't need the whole life story.
Well, so like generally when I interview like any sort of guessed, I like to do some sort of you know deep dive on them so I don't come in fully look like an idiot but I like to also not you know know everything about them so I'm kind of fresh and I'm very you know you're on the internet you're the 100 million dollar man, Everyone likes to refer to you as You like that name?
2:26
I mean it'll it's a little under now and it's you know in five years I'll hate the name.
So it's kind of disrespectful to only call me the hundred million dollar van.
It's I mean, it's I'm honored, it's very nice and I'm flattered by it and a lot of it is because the book, so 100 there are offers was because I think at that point when I wrote the book, you know, we'd done 120 million ition cumulative sales.
2:48
And so I was like, here's the stuff that we learned about making offers and so I just put in the book and I think people just took that title and you know, Spit on me.
Do you think people who like own businesses where whatever, when they get 21 million dollars?
They like to refer themselves to as a millionaire is that like when the moment you hit a hundred million dollars like a hundred million?
3:05
Are I actually made a video about this but there's like, seven different ways.
I've seen people talk about like they're not worth most of them false.
There's like how much total sales I've done over the lifetime of my business is, like total revenue.
And then it's, you know, one step underneath that would be like the value of the Based on equity.
3:26
And then another one underneath it, that would be like what their current run rate is.
And then another one is like what their profit is.
And then another one would be like what their cash flow is.
And so I'll say one of the things that I have feel like I've learned is like the wealthier.
You become the more amorphous.
What?
Net worth even means is something worthless.
3:42
Yeah, it's just, it's muddy.
It's murky.
It's not a like when you're poor, you know exactly what you have because you don't have much and you can count it on your fingers, right?
When you have a lot then it's like, well, what's the value of the 28 percent stake?
I have In this business that we're not planning on selling and we're reinvesting profits into.
3:59
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, I could probably sell that to different people for different prices like, and then I, so a lot of a lot of assets aren't liquid.
And so, even even when you, it's kind of funny because they going through the sales process, you get a big chunk of cash.
And then after that, you then have to allocate the cash.
4:14
So when we were like, oh, this guy's worth a billion dollars, it's not like he has a billion dollars in his bank account, just own something that is worth a billion dollars, which is very different.
You know, the only time that it's I feel like it's more accurate is once you go into a public market.
It, the equities, you have our tradable and you can take loans against them, you know, immediately and so in that way you really are at least in my opinion like the billion is more real.
4:34
Yeah.
Then if you're in private equities, which you know, things are illiquid, it takes 6 to 12 months, to be able to sell or kind of transact in any way.
And it's based on what the market looks like, then.
And what buyers are available?
Do you think a lot of people say different you run up a lot of good points about when when I when you talk to businesses of like yeah, our business.
4:53
You know, it's like How much have you done to like, 50 million dollars?
That that's crazy.
Like, you know, 2022 that I called know, like, lifetime.
Do you think there's a reason why some people will like there's different types of personalities of business of?
Like, when I say a revenue number, it's that year, not Lifetime.
And then even it was relatively recent to me, I never ran into someone until talking about like, run rate of like, that's not what they're actually gonna do this year.
5:17
That's like, what they would do, if this best month continued for the next 12 months, that's what they would do.
Like, why do you think people?
I don't say they can inflate it but is doing, that's kind of like what they're doing.
Yeah.
Making it sound better than it, not that it's bad.
But yeah, I think status, yeah, it's like it's always a way of like bumping their status, like up one level, like, rounding up.
5:39
It's something that I actually wrote work on a lot is like try not to round up?
I like I'm not perfect at it but like I try not to round up your around Downer actually I want to be accurate so 46.2 and I was nervous that he said really like not more or less and then trying not to qualify because To very rich people that is nothing and two, very poor people that has everything and so I can't guess what?
6:01
Someone's going to see by that.
So it's just, that's what it is.
Okay?
And with acquisition.com, if I was a Goldendoodle, how would you explain what acquisition.com is?
We are minority investors in companies that are between 3 and 100 million a year.
6:17
And so we take minority Stakes.
Typically between twenty, and thirty three percent of those businesses.
And we, depending on the business, we're either Investing For Cash Flow.
So for some sort of return or we're reinvesting cash into the business so that we can eventually salt later.
Really just depends on the business.
Is it a long-term?
Hold.
6:32
Is it like a Fix and Flip?
It just depends on the business but typically, we are minority investors in those companies and we bring A lot of Hands-On help to grow the business.
And so we get discounts for the valuations etcetera that we invest in those companies because we are Hands-On, which is not typical for minority Partners, most times they write the check and they want to ride, you know just ride along and usually just get the the founder some sort of cash.
6:56
No cash.
Usually hit exchanges hands from us to the founder because we're either investing into the business so that it can grow or we're doing something in kind because it's based on the amount of value that we're going to provide I noticed when I went to acquisition.com, there's not that goldendoodle Spiel on it.
7:13
It's like as soon as you go in you just like have to know what is it?
Like, you have to know what it is to like you should know what it is before you even go to the website to everything.
I think it's just because the vast majority of people that do go to the site, do know what it is because they've consumed something, or multiple things of my like, in order for somebody to say, oh I'm going to go to acquisition.com, they would usually have consumed at least, you know, a few pieces of content of my before they would go there.
7:35
I mean, if they click, you know, investment thesis or any of the other, you know, links on there, but But you know, I come from a direct response background.
And so having something that's optimized for for conversion is always Forefront of mind.
And so you know, if I had a big paragraph of what we do on the on the homepage, I guarantee you I would have fewer deals that would be coming to me.
7:53
You think that fewer deals on a mm-hmm?
I could prove it.
Yeah and did you were able to snag acquisition.com?
Or do you have to buy that?
I bought it.
How much did the website cost you think's 370 something?
$370 thousand.
What the fuck?
8:09
Yeah.
Was, it was it?
Someone just will they call like domain squatting or domain shark?
Mmm, it wasn't like someone had a business and you're like, hey, do I can do better just the name, what the fuck man?
Yeah, you just lock it down.
Was the original price?
No, I just came in asking, they were in talks for somebody else and they not a negotiator.
8:28
I am, but it's like what's the, what's the goal?
You know what I mean?
For me, the cost of negotiating it because you had another buyer that they had been haggling with.
And so I figured that the seller was kind of tired of haggling with this other guy for like I think the number that they were at was like 325 or something like that, and they were trying to create some sort of payment plan.
8:48
As I was like, I'll pay 370 today cash, just wire.
It's like I can wear it tomorrow.
And so the deal closed in like two days and they had been in talks for like, two months.
Yeah.
And so for me it's like Like what's the ink?
Like is there.
Actually a difference in how much value?
I'm going to get out of something.
If I pay fifty thousand dollars less or the downside risk of me just not getting it for me is significantly higher.
9:09
And I would say that one of the things that I have changed over time is That I Used To haggle every single, nickel and dime.
And I value speed more now, because the opportunity cost of the time that I wouldn't have it, I will make more money having it sooner and I'll make up the cost difference with speed.
I guess, I guess in my brain not I mean I know you know it's all relative to I guess your income.
9:28
That you have.
But in my head I'm like, do you think like Nemo of like would you take 350 save you 20 thousand dollars?
It just wasn't it is what it is at this point, I want to just get the deal done.
How many of the businesses that acquisition.com invest in, would you say, get acquired?
9:45
Because that's the end and go like to the businesses that would sell, would you say you have, like a success rate or anything?
So, for us were two years in to them in R&D investment.
So even in a normal deal cycle, you know, I probably wouldn't sell like, unless we're just flipping a company, which is not really our model.
10:00
Like I would prefer to hold all of them forever.
That's my preference.
I am a minority in a minority position though.
And so if the founders like, I really want to sell, then we'll say, okay then let's get it.
Ready to sell, and that might take 24 months to like, you know, do a couple of low hanging fruit, increase the cash flow, you know, add a couple of value adds that would be, you know, significantly increase the Enterprise Value, the multiple we'd be able to get on the company and then we can, you know, go to market.
10:24
And that going to Market process.
Takes 12 months just on its own like once the company's ready, it's another year.
Do you think a lot of people invest?
Obviously they get it from you but like, do they expect that?
Alex is going to promote my company now?
Or is that not really part of the Cure going for my expertise of myself?
My team, it's not that you're going to be a spokesmodel for look at this.
10:42
Chapstick brand that I invested in correct.
So I am not.
I don't, I don't endorse any of the companies that we have and there's a couple reasons for that one is.
If I'm going to really endorse something, I do want to have it for a very long time or forever.
I usually want to I have control.
10:59
So I'd want to be majority likely or at least 50/50 in the business most times that mean there are special circumstances if it's a massive company and like it would make sense.
I'd be open to it, but it would definitely be an additional like an additional negotiating point the biggest risk for me is brand.
11:16
Yeah, and so like, you know, making an endorsement is is a big investment because I'm really betting that this guy gal company is not going to do anything, really dumb and that's tough because there's a lot of people.
Senses, you know if your head of marketing you know, DM some girl who's underage and he doesn't it's becomes this whole thing and then my brain gets Associated.
11:37
Yeah it's there's just like I can control me and so if I'm going to do it I want to have as much control as I can and so that's why I don't normally do that way.
It's also a little bit of a risk of the business because if I'm a huge driver of value to the business in terms of percentage of sales, Etc then it does make it more difficult to sell because then the acquirer would have to make a deal with me and a deal with the company.
11:58
All right, so we do this ultimately, to make the company's independently more valuable rather than make them dependent on us, which is kind of like the fast track Band-Aid, but I think long-term robs them of the value that we that they could make on their own.
You're essentially am not do people.
12:14
Just compare you to Shark Tank kind of sort of all the time like a better-looking.
Kevin O'Leary a more Jack Kevin O'Leary.
Yeah.
More significantly, more hair.
Yeah, you know speaking of everybody.
Speaking of I guess, like you know, bringing up shark tank in the acquisition and it and, you know, percentages minority Stakes.
12:34
A lot of people that, you know, and I'll refer to Shark Tank because I think a lot of people understand that show you'll see a lot of people come in and maybe, you know, people.
Hey, Alex.
I want you to invest in this.
We're doing what I see a lot on episodes is people under Valley valuing or overvaluing their company.
12:52
And a lot of times even I'm a little bit confused when the Sharks were you would be like, it's not worth that if If some of companies like, you know, we're doing ten million dollars in sales, our business is worth telling 10 million dollars and they get like, no it's not, it's only worth how much cash you have in the bank.
13:08
Like what is the biggest misconception people have with value with valuations Beyond like their own ego of like know it's worth a whole lot of money.
Yeah, so fundamentally when somebody's buying a company, they're buying a percentage of future profits, right?
And so the question is, how how profitable with a company be if it's in the future?
13:27
How long is that?
Sustainable.
And what is my risk associated with that?
And so if there's if there's a business that's incredibly transactional has a single point of failure that's founder LED and they're the face and they're the one that drives all the business that person gets hit by a bus the company's dad, right?
That person gets in a scandal, the company's dad and so you want to have as few like you would have multiple stream, you know, multiple different sources of acquisition.
13:49
You want to have customers that return for a very long time.
We would have some sort of unique mechanism if possible that gives any could not at this.
Even be about the product could be unique mechanism for acquisition.
It could be Unique.
Like just some element that makes it a little bit different.
That gives some sort of competitive advantage or cushion against the new entrant.
That's going to try and just copy and rip off the same thing.
14:06
Brand would be an example of that which is why I like Warren Buffett talks about buying big Brands like anybody can recreate the Apple iPhone.
I mean, shoot trying to does it all the time.
Yeah, but they can't recreate apple, right?
And so like a Brandon and of itself would be something that's viable.
And so when they're thinking about that, like, you know, values of businesses are so murky, right?
14:24
I'm gonna use a morphus but they're so, they're so variable.
I like the word he did.
I'm more fit.
I'm gonna add that into my vocabulary.
There are moving Target, you know?
It also depends on the the capital environment.
So if you can borrow money at a cheaper rate values of companies go up same like real estate because if you can get money cheaper in general, the whole Market starts creating higher, if it's money, more expensive than the the companies trade lower.
14:45
And so there's just there's a ton of different variables that go into and then also what the company is going to get from the acquirer.
So like if a strategic buyer, so a company.
So to Define that if a company buys another company and the company that Bought it would directly benefit from adding that company to its kind of portfolio.
15:03
Like it can cross sell its existing customers into those services or products.
Then that company will make more from the acquisition than what a financial buyer would be.
So like, if a family office, a rich, you know, rich guy just wants to buy a piece of a business or the whole business.
He doesn't have any strategic plays, he's just going to buy it for what it is.
15:20
And so like Financial buyers tend to buy businesses for less than strategic buyers do.
So you want to find a strategic buyer if you can.
But those deals Longer, there's more integration.
There's typically, you know, I one or two-year consult back period, where the founder has to, like, make sure it fully, you know, transitions.
There's probably some sort of burnout or kickers along with how well, it does with that transition, because some of the value, the Enterprise Value that gets described as based on how much more money were together going to be able to make.
15:44
And so, there's a lot of factors that go into how you value business.
But at the end of the day it's just what someone is willing to pay.
That's true.
It's kind of like, it's kind of when someone goes to sell anything.
It's like, no, it's worth this much.
Like it's only worth as much as someone's willing to pay for.
Market.
It's like if you have a 50 thousand dollar, watch her, you think someone to buy it, but no one wants to pay 50,000.
16:04
It's not worth fifty thousand dollars.
So in 2009 versus 2021, same business you get a different number.
Yeah, you know, I didn't really mean to go super balls deep on Acquisitions and whatnot, but I meant something else is a lot of people get caught up in raising money, a lot of businesses.
16:21
What is your, what is your take on?
The people who either are super prideful that they've never taken money and they're super cash flow positive.
Of and there I guess a slower grower right versus someone who's I want to raise tons of money dilute myself or my company because of this big exit.
16:39
I mean there's I guess their strategies to both totally.
So I think there's a right way and a wrong way to use to raise money.
The right way of raising money is that you have all the bass business economics.
Correct.
So I'll give an example.
16:54
So let's say you have a product or a service software that costs 100 bucks a month, right?
And somebody stays on average for 40 months so it's a four thousand dollar LTV.
But it costs you, let's say $500 to get that customer.
17:11
Well, that would mean that the business is going to lose money for the first five months, before they even break, even on gross margin, like let alone run all the rest of the business just on spending to acquire, it takes them five months to break even.
And then they'll make the first, quote dollar of gross profit that they can, you know, start paying payroll and other stuff in and that It makes sense for them, to raise money to more rapidly acquire customers because the fundamental economics of the business makes sense.
17:36
Where does it make sense?
Is where people will raise money to cover?
The fact that they're not making money so they can artificially lower prices?
And, you know, this is kind of the issue that boober ran into or is running into is that the model is different because if they their whole concept was, we're going to lower the price gain a lot of market share and then we'll raise the price.
17:53
But in a very real way, The price was a big part of why people wanted to use it.
Yeah.
If cabs are cheaper than Uber, then all of a sudden, the entire fact that you had this market share only it was price dependent and so that's where it's the, it's the tricky.
Balance of, are we using this money to speed up and acquisition cycle where we have the LTV decock metrics?
18:13
That this makes sense.
And we just need to do more of it faster to get a certain, you know, sighs the other instances when you're trying to gain market share, but doing it the right way.
Rather than necessarily the zubur example, I was giving.
The third piece with raising money is that you get insane valuations.
18:31
And so because like, if I say, let's say I want to sell point one percent of acquisition.com.
If I said I was going to do that and I posted it on my Instagram and for some reason, the SEC said, yes you can be a regulation and I went through all the hoops, right to do a public offering.
I could probably get a billion dollar valuation for acquisition, not calm today, because I sold so little and so many people wanted a piece and then just betting on my brand that it's going to be worth that in the future, which is fundamentally, what it is because you just have to Math.
18:56
It's like if I sold point one percent at 10 million dollars, then I would have a billion dollar company.
So I think I could get 10 million dollars from my audience right now to invest in acquisition outcomes that point one percent, probably, because also because most people aren't sophisticated, you know, whatever.
It doesn't matter point is, is that If you do it that way, at some point, someone gets hosed.
19:16
Unless the company, really does grow to a business that would, in based on its actual profit be worth a billion dollars.
So, theoretically, I could have, I could make, I could raise that money and then I would grow into my valuation and have, let's say a hundred million dollars in ibadah.
19:33
Or, you know, for people to do that is just a fancy word for profit.
Just leave it at that, you know, five years from now.
But the problem is, if my sales a minor Prophet goes up, people are going to bet that it's actually worth 10 billion because they think it's going to keep going.
And so, that's the game and normally those round, those fundraising rounds kind of results in when that when there is the IPO for that company, the people who get hosed is the general public.
19:57
It's the retail investor, who basically does the ketchup, for all the investors, they basically take out of their wallet for, for those people to be made whole, but now they have to grow into that valuation.
And so those are kind of like some of the things to think about with with the right and wrong ways of doing it, etcetera.
20:13
I have always been a no outside money guy and I do that because I think you approach business a little differently because I think a lot of times people will raise money because it's an option.
Yes.
Oh, I believe constraint drives Innovation.
And so, I would rather say okay, let's say that that five hundred dollar to four thousand examples like, okay, we've got whatever that is an 8 to 1, L TV, exact ratio great, for those who don't know, that means lifetime value of the customer, compared to how much it cost the cost to acquire them.
20:40
So, I do you want a good kak ratio and now, Savita CAC.
Yeah, and so, if we have that, if we have that a 2:1 ratio, right?
I would think, okay, if it costs $500, is there a way that I can say?
Can I add an onboarding figure?
20:56
Can I add a sign up fee?
Or can I add some sort of front end value add product or service that can liquidate my acquisition cost so that I can be NetZero on day one or day 30, where I can get a short-term credit line to acquire the customer that's revolving, rather than dilute myself an equity.
21:11
And so, I think it's like, I, I like trying to solve the problem rather than saying, cool.
That's the, that's the equation.
Let's go.
I just, I have a fundamental belief about the world that like if you ask the right questions, you can solve the problem.
And so that's why I don't I don't raise and I just believe that we can fight with if we're if we're creative enough.
21:30
We can figure out a way to make it grow profitably.
Hey, most efficient quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
21:48
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
I guess is, do people ever give you of like you don't, you're not about raising money, but your company is about, you want people to want to raise money.
22:04
It's not really.
Most of the times are not raising money, like not in the formal sense.
Because most of the times the I mean, more than half of the deals we have, we put no money in because we're like strategic.
Yeah, exactly.
So that's kind of a singer but that the Strategic partner it's like well if I can 10x your business, then what is that worth to you?
22:23
Yes, it is it Worth you know giving up a third to have a 10 times bigger thing.
So you are now seven times wealthier than you were at the beginning everybody wins.
I'm a big like, expand the pie guy.
Do you think a lot of people assume there's some sort of number that every business has to get to before?
Like let's say people are building a business to get acquired, is it?
22:41
Do you think like, hey, I need to get to 10 million.
Hey, I need to get 50 million headed to get 100 or like what is your perspective on how companies view?
Like, I want to see this company have success, they need to get to the certain number or I want to See the trajectory that I could be on, I want to acquire it before it gets so big that their that their value is significantly higher.
23:03
Like what do you how do you think people from whose perspective?
I guess both like of a business owner like how much money do I need to build it too?
Or is it just like just build a great company and worry less about how fast you're going to get to 100 million?
We call it and I'm from a business perspective like how do you think that they analyze businesses to acquire?
23:20
Yeah, so I'll start with the founder one, so founder wise, you know.
I would say that the big thing that we always try and find as missionaries not mercenaries.
And so it's people who are really passionate about the cause because somebody who's passionate about the cause will always build a bigger company because they're doing it for the reason for a different reason.
And so it's like the person who loves walking walks for the person who loves the destination.
23:37
And so when people are trying to build a business in order to sell it, they tend to just have a different energy about going, it's everything it just inherently is shorter.
Yeah.
Right.
But if you have an unlimited time Horizon, then there is no such thing as a rush and you can make the right calls for the long, right?
And that's what we really want because you'll get the highest returns with someone.
You can think five ten years out but it just won't Since for one year or two years, but like, they can make a huge move that's going to make it worth a ton, but if they're always obsessed about like that's why public company.
24:01
Is this like quarterly earnings calls?
Like they have to think, short term casinos are incentivized Bobble by wanting to do that, but from a Founder perspective, we prefer long-term thinkers in terms of them.
Getting acquired.
I think they'll line is just at what point you get institutional money.
So, institutional money would be like, private Equity, money and up and normally, that doesn't really happen below 10 million, in sales, most of the Time I'm excluding tack for like seed and VC and all that.
24:27
This is a different game than like what I would consider traditional business which is what we're in, which is there's less like this you do, but there's a lot of caveats to this like with what I was saying earlier, the fundraising that tends to happen, more in tech companies.
You know what I mean?
And sometimes like open a, I raised a ton of money to build artificial intelligence.
24:45
Did that make sense?
Absolutely did they have any way of making money until it started to work?
No, still made sense.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
So it's like it's trying.
To keep it within context, most businesses that are what I consider normal businesses that don't have a million acts possibility, oftentimes can solve their problems if they just think about it a little bit harder, but back to the founder, co-founder with institutional, usually 10 million in top-line sales is minimum that they're going to really be interested in.
25:12
You know, a million and ibadah.
Maybe but like, if I'm going to go to market, I don't really want to take anything to Market below five like an ibadah in profit per.
Yeah, that's because that's when you can, you can get what I would consider real money, you know what I mean?
You know, you can get a 50, you can get 100.
Like, that's, that's a meaningful enough size.
25:30
And it's like, if you got to 10 or, you know, if you're at 7 million and got one and a half million profit, it's like, dude we could just, let's just let's just get to 20 and have five and now this is a company that becomes very Very acquirable.
Okay?
And at a bigger multiple with, you know, you're talking all these different like Acquisitions things and how you're saying, you know, you could raise money from your audience.
25:52
Yeah.
Speaking of your audience, how did you get so popular on the internet and why aren't you verified on Instagram?
Are you pissed about that?
I mean, you know you got a little bit suck.
Suck, you know, help a brother out.
Now I actually feel bad about it cause there's like 100 zillion like fake or mozi accounts that are like hey invest in my thing.
26:11
And so Like Scamper out and I'll get a message, like, dude, you took my hundred dollars.
I get, I get call my YouTube videos, they'll get like a, hey, congrats WhatsApp sent me, 20 bucks and I'll send you a PlayStation 5.
And people DME like, is this, um, like dies?
Yeah, like Woody, come on.
26:27
Like, as if you have to ask, you ready?
No.
Anyways in terms of the the rise a lot of it was because the team.
So I mean the team that's off to the side here that you can't see.
Got Caleb, got Quinn got the boys with a z who really, really Ali packaged you know me well and make me look cooler than I am and so my goal every day.
26:49
It's me too.
And so it was really just you know applying the same things that we do with business just to kind of media and media is very new to us.
I mean I've really only been doing it hard for, I would say, a year, we started doing it in general.
Like I started posting like two or three YouTube videos a week of just me like screen recording myself.
27:06
Yeah, I think in September of 2000.
It's been to issue years right now.
And so.
But anyways taking it more seriously and actually doing like shorts and stuff.
We did about it a year and change ago is when we started doing that stuff and that started growing they lot of it is because there wasn't a lot of people doing it.
27:21
We got into the right time.
We've been we've been very lucky in a lot of things like that.
I got into Facebook advertising in 2013, you know with with the gyms in the Fitness business is like a super early on that.
I've just I've had a lot of things that just like, it worked out that I got in early and we got a disproportionate return.
But I mean, honestly, I think if I were to give you a real answer, I don't know.
27:40
You know, I think I think I think there's a little bit of a vacuum for what I would consider real business education because most the people that are teaching business, don't have very big businesses and people very big businesses.
Don't make content And I think that's, I think it's just, it's a crisscross of those two things, which is a very understandable story of legitimacy and then the quote advice, you know, that we that I, you know, put out there is stuff that people actually, I could do things all the time.
28:09
They're like, dude, I ran that promotion that you said I just made 50 Grand like all the time.
Like dude I change to your sales process and we tripled our sales.
So people are actually using it seeing the result and then they become True Believers because they're like, dude, this is better than all the stuff I've paid for.
Us to go, you know?
I just want I get like my selfish intent here is that there is a kid who's 20 right now consumes all my stuff and in four years is doing 10 million years.
28:33
Like dude, you've been on my vision board.
I want acquisition.com as a partner.
Let's make it happen like that's why I do it but it's a long game, was it, you know, although you have a similar beard slightly almost as Jax's liver King, you know, he had a strategy of like I'm going to become popular on the internet like it came out, right?
28:50
Well, I'm 50 pounds heavier than the bluebird, kidding, are you?
Yeah.
You look just Back then you're like a lump let the record show and you don't see testicles man.
Yeah, would offer a sincere three.
Well, there was that one time when here when I went to Omnia yeah would like was was there a point when you were like I want to become I want to become a thing on the internet because you said it was like 2 years 10 percent.
29:16
Yeah.
So it was actually it was like a series of so I'll give you the I'll give you the long real answer.
Which was I Really wanted to be rich in Anonymous and there's like one video that cables found.
If me being like, fuck content, like all the stuff stupid, like, I just wanna be rich and have no one bother me.
29:32
Yeah.
And I did that for a really long time, and then what happened was, like, the thing that was like, the first big crack is like, anybody's listening.
This new things is ridiculous, but when Kylie Jenner hit the front of Forbes and she was like 20 and a billionaire, I honestly, I was like depressed for a day.
Like I really was like, I think the world was depressed like why do I suck?
29:50
Yeah.
Ugh.
Why am I insufficient?
But I was like you know what Kris Jenner.
Organizer whole life, Kris Jenner's, the Jewish.
He's the one is really are like, she's just a figurehead for like Chris's Empire, Jesus.
She's also more attractive than you.
Oh, yeah, if I do, if I had her, but I wouldn't even be here, right?
Anyways, so that happened, but I like, you know, my ego is like, no, it's just Chris, and there was organized.
30:09
Okay, cool.
And then Conor McGregor came out with proper 12.
It was like, boom, 600 million tons of shit.
He did 600 million with that.
Well, the company's worth 600.
Yeah.
And then and then Huda Beauty, she sold a portion of her company.
For at 600 million.
30:24
Just a YouTuber.
An Instagram is no.
And then and again I was like, this is like, this is starting to become a theme and then the rock had to Ramona.
And then now they're worth like to 24 billion.
And so this just cat again, it was like these chinks in my armor of like you know all this Fame stuff stupid like why would you want to be famous?
30:42
Just being Bubba.
And so finally, I was at a buddy of Mines house.
He's very famous.
It was he and I don't want to name drop them.
He's very famous.
Well, I just don't want to, yeah.
I don't blow him up.
Okay.
And it's Barack Obama.
Yeah, yeah.
30:58
His friends going bar.
And so anyways.
So I was there and he's like and I was like, don't you get tired of like the weird messages and like letters at your door and people dropping off like threatening your family and kids and stuff.
Like it's not like, I was like, that sounds horrible.
Yeah, he said, if that's the price, I have to pay for the impact, I want to have, I'd make that trade every day of the week, and I just like it just like stabbed me.
31:21
And I was like, here I am saying that.
I like want to help people.
Make products and services that, you know, serve communities and what not?
And I was like, I'm just too much of a pussy to like, get out there.
We were doing a disservice by not producing content, right?
And that's exactly that.
That was like the and so at after that point I was like, all right, we're doing it.
31:36
And so, you know I got a couple vendors to new different platforms because I just started with agency so it's like I don't know what I'm doing and they were like just send us three videos a week, okay.
And then that was what started it and then you know we started recruiting, bring people in house and now you know our in-house teams bigger than our vendor team, But yeah so we just start you know just started pulling the thread and start get a little bit better and just try to add new platforms.
31:58
You know every every few months and learn how this whole game works and there's a strategy to become popular than in it.
Yeah more good content.
Hmm I've been doing it wrong for like 10 years man.
Fuck yeah, no.
It's like actually So for anybody who is trying to do this, it's quantity first so you just have to put out a lot of stuff and you do a lot of stuff.
32:17
Not because you're gonna get a lot of reach from it because you don't know what you're doing and so it tells it gives you two things.
One is it gives you feedback from the audience because they're gonna be Of the does better than others.
And so it's like cool, do more of that.
And the flip side, you'll also start to kind of learn your voice because if you listen so my older videos, I sound just different, just less articulate, you know, whatever.
32:32
I just I wasn't doing this as much.
And so quantity, first and then you start to learn how to increase the quality that's like doing the more of that good stuff.
So you start get you're like oh why did that video do well?
Oh, is that a topic thing or have a good hook?
Like what are you started?
Studying the things that are outliers that do a little bit better and then you really start focusing on quantity, so quality kind of drops a little bit and then you start quantity kind of drops and you start focusing on like, if I I put out one really good video.
32:55
It does way better than 10 shitty videos and so you're like I'm going to do more of that and I think the third phase is quality quantity where you can put out amazing videos and then more of them or you know whatever your version of content is podcasts Etc.
And so that's kind of how I see the some of the phases playing out.
33:10
So right now we're right at the I'd say cusp into the condensing down into more quality because we've just been boom quantity to learn what the market wants.
You know, I always want to talk about like LTV to CAC.
You know, ratios and like turn ratios and like Just different ways of like, onboarding, customers to increase lcv and like no one cares.
33:28
Sounds like huh?
But if Mike, hey, I care.
Yeah, it depends on the audience.
You know what I mean?
And so we actually alternate content that we're we're going into it.
So we'll alternate content words like there's there's top of funnel content, which is content that we think will just reach a lot of people.
And so that will like, if I make something about Chipotle which is reference the beginning, the show, delicious, right?
33:48
It got you, right?
And so, you might be, you know, it'll attract everybody, which means the net will also include bigger business owners because it includes everyone.
But then to earn trust with that person.
That's for the track.
You know, the track record etcetera helps like having the, you know, the companies that we have and the exits and whatnot.
34:04
But then we have deep content that doesn't get the same amount of reach as kind of like the more General content.
But then those people get to have, in my opinion, just like a deeper relationship.
That's my running.
Theory could be completely wrong.
So, that's how he's what I got from that is Chipotle is the reason for your success?
Yes, the common, the common thing among the people.
34:22
Yes.
And you chorizo, which is delicious.
You made a comment about Like I don't come like fake gurus or fake business people but I'm sure that was probably frustrating of seeing seeing popular people on the internet who you were like, Mom.
34:38
Something's not right there.
Do you ever get people that think you're a fake Guru?
Yeah, it doesn't.
I don't, I honestly don't think much about it.
Yeah, I'm sure there are people who I was doing a little Deep dive.
And first of all, I've learned to never go into, read it forms to in your life, right?
Because the it's dark side of the internet.
34:55
And some comments that I was seeing, which Which again is that?
Because I was doing research about you, right?
Is that people were like, there's no way that this man is just giving out information for free.
There's some ulterior motive, right?
And I think someone said what you some of your your books are super cheap, not if someone's and and they were like it's a strategy, which it might be.
35:16
But like what do you say to people who are being?
Like, there's no way he would just give all this information.
I'm trying to suck ass for money.
I'm super transparent about my intention.
I'm here to absolutely make money, but I just don't need most People's money.
So if I have one Facebook investment, I make more than I would sell.
35:31
Then I would, if I sold coaching and programs, and, and courses, and all that kind of stuff.
You don't, I mean, I don't need to because, like I said, if I make one, you know, like we have 16 company in the portfolio right now, like most of them, I could probably like My Equity stake is probably worth.
35:46
I don't know. 5 10 ish million just as a conservative medium.
How many you know how many thousand our courses are have to sell to do that a lot?
Yeah, and in terms of a brand that I want to build, I don't want to do everyone else does.
So I want to know, I don't want to live their life and to be fair, like most of the, like, there's a cap to how much money you can make, if that's the game, like you can't get in my opinion, you're not going to get like ultra wealthy.
36:13
So for me to get to a billion, I'm not going to get there selling courses.
Yeah.
So I have to I have to own something and or stuff that's worth a billion and so I have to play the game differently.
So, So for we were like you know, he's trying to suck ass for money.
I probably not trying to suck that person for money because the type of person that I'm going after understands exactly what I'm doing.
36:30
So they have nothing to fear but no I mean we have I have books and the reason I have the book it's 99 Cents and you know it's crazy.
Like so many people like Bangladesh and like Pakistan, like people really like they can buy the book and they're like it all these.
Thank you messages, which is cool.
But I also think it's like part of the reason I'm doing this is because I kind of want to prove a point which is that You don't have to, like, you don't have to play the game the same way.
36:52
Like, if and I just have this big belief that if you give the most away in the marketplace, you get the most over a long enough time Horizon, you get the most back, so everyone gets a little bit of Goodwill and they try monitor little bit about their body size, right?
But if you can just deposit and deposit and deposit and people are like, I don't know.
37:08
When is the other one?
It was the other shoe to drop and then and then, and then you just keep proving it wrong.
Then that doubter, that person actually ends up becoming your biggest fan.
Like, they become your biggest supporter.
I think people just want to Assume that everyone has some evil intent or I'm here to make money look like, I'm very yeah.
37:25
A lot of people that'd be like saying like not Apple.
Only comes out with new iPhones to make more money.
It's like no shit like, of course.
Yeah.
And like, what do you what do you think about will come fake gurus?
Like, or people that are trying to sell the people who soaked sell courses about how to build a business but their only business experience is something like making a course to out about how to build business.
37:49
Yes.
Oh, I I think so.
This is a really it's an I have a I have a lot of thoughts about this because I I've really strong views about the formal education system.
I believe that there's the supply and demand of like the demand for income-generating skills will not go away.
38:07
That's only going to get more right?
And the supply of people who could provide those skills in the formal education system was basic is basically nothing.
And so they their poor job.
Fact that they never adapted, they skyrocketed the price, which is subsidized by the government.
38:23
So that no one could bankrupt themselves out of it, which created these insane at tuitions and and no longer provided because they never changed.
So it's the same education.
You got 50 years ago, but the markets changed dramatically.
And so they just sell a really outdated product for an egregious price.
38:39
And so, the market continues to shift.
So every, every year for the last three years, college enrollment has dropped, and it's dropping faster every year because gen Z is like, I don't think it's all right, miss it.
Dance on Tick Tock now or whatever you do, I'll start a business because now because like when I went to school like YouTube wasn't a thing you know I mean Instagram wasn't a thing and so like the content that exists now wasn't there and how old are you by the way?
39:04
33 Samesies, there you go, same age, same physique, it's great done and so this Marketplace of alternative education sprouted from demand people want to have these skills.
39:19
Is.
And so a market will always appear where there is demand and so people started providing that.
I do think that we're in kind of still early days big picture on alternative education because there will be illegitimate players and there will be legitimate players because if someone wants to learn a skill and some says like I want to learn how to sell and there's a sale School.
39:38
What's wrong with that?
The problem for the alternative education seen is that is the expectations that people set?
And the track record that they lie about, so I'll dive into both those real quick.
So the expectations that our set is the primary issue that people don't have a problem with formal education and do have a problem with alternative education.
39:56
So people spend two hundred thousand dollars and four years and go into debt that they can't get out of because College promises, nothing.
I promise nothing.
Yeah, they don't say you're guaranteed to get a job.
They just say you'll have four years here you meant it.
Good luck.
What we do guarantee is that if you get grades, will give you a diploma, that's the guarantee.
40:13
And they fulfill that promise which there's a whole nother conversation by expectation setting.
On the other hand, a guy sells 1000, our course and promises that you're going to make ten thousand dollars within 30 days.
The course may be exceptional and may teach a lot of skills, but if someone doesn't make ten thousand dollars in 30 days, they hate the guy.
Yeah.
And so even though there may be in a very real way more value in that course than they do, get in the, in the four-year education.
40:34
Education in my wife's, father, is actually a former dean of engineering school professor.
And he said, and he's like bought some of the courses and he's like making money online now.
He's like I would never tell someone to go to school anymore.
He's like, I've learned so much more from these courses than I did from anything that we teach at school.
40:50
And so like the the game is shifted and now also because YouTube has just blown up a lot of really good stuff.
Is available online for free.
Yes, and so, All that to say fake Guru.
In my opinion, just comes down to deception.
41:07
So deception in terms of what you did to validate yourself to say that you are an authority.
So it's kind of like the example of like I own a hundred million dollar business and what it really means is like all of the customers that I've ever serviced over my entire life.
Make a hundred million dollars.
41:23
Yeah.
And you're actually an agency that has ten clients and one of them happens to be like if someone it's like if my if Vendor from in this this shit happens is a vendor of Mind, makes like one Tick.
Tock a month for me.
And he and then he would say, I, you know, my clients make half a billion dot with C, then he's even still putting clients in but some guys will go, you just drop the clients and be like our, you know, our company has 500 million dollars a year.
41:47
Like, that's a lie, right?
And so it's really about the premise, and the expectation that's being set.
If someone says I was a sales guy at a company and I was a top, 10% sales guy for five years.
I can teach you how to sell that.
Pretty straightforward like and he teaches somebody how to sell and the way that he delivers that is of course and some sort of like you know call feedback and reviews calls because you know maybe helps you get a job like that's a business and it's a demand and the person wanted to get a sales job, which there is no good college, career path for sales.
42:15
So the demand exists in the market created itself.
I think a lot of the issues with it is that it's like the further.
It goes down the rabbit hole of it.
Starts with good intent and then people teach people how they're going to like how to sell and then now they're Oh, I've learned everything from this course.
42:31
Now I'm going to get some people to teach them what I learned from this person and it just gets like, I don't to say dumber and dumber, but it's like less food.
Yeah, less from the authenticity of like the top of the funnel.
Hmm, it's interesting stuff.
It's and that's in that.
So it's either it's the deceit around expectations and it's the destroyed around legitimacy and I think those are the two core issues for why.
42:50
Like if those two problems were solved and like let's just play it out a perfect scenario.
If someone, you know, if Bob Iger from Disney now, Bob Iger from Disney.
Doesn't need to sell a course because he because he's Rich enough on its own on his own.
But if Bob Iger wanted to sell a course on how to be CEO and said I'm Bob Iger and I've been CEO of Disney and I promise you that all I'm going to teach you is the lessons that I've learned I don't think people would have an issue with it, right?
43:17
They would buy the course.
They wouldn't buy the course, whatever.
But like, he's not going to say.
If you do this, you'll be CEO of a company, that's where you get in trouble, right?
So it's what's my legitimacy and what are the expectations that I'm setting for the customers?
What promises am I am?
I making?
And can I deliver on them?
And so it's like, if we have these two things that are legit, here's why you should trust me and you're not lying or exaggerating.
43:36
And then here's the expectation, you should have and you're not lying are exaggerating.
I think you're completely in the clear, but most people can't do that because it's so easy to just push it.
Little bit just a little bit and and get way more people to buy and raise your price by a lot more and blah blah blah.
Yeah and I completely agree with you.
43:52
Did you do you?
Well, do you sell any courses on how to know it's all free on the site we have top down?
You know some things I look at is and I guess some people want to have maybe they want to pay someone to have this specific like I paid.
44:08
So I'm going to feel like I need to follow through with something because in my head and maybe that's just how my brain works.
Like why would you pay?
Someone, if people who are building businesses like you, like maybe even a garyvee or something, they're literally putting out hours and hours and hours a week of content of what they're doing, how they do it tips.
44:26
And I'm like, why wouldn't you just listen to these people?
So people should do that.
But most people aren't that way.
And so, there's a couple things that like, you know, a tweet that went really viral.
Mine was give away the secret cell, the implementation, right?
And so, you know, you could make the same argument, like, use all my stuff and get to 100 million which you an right.
44:45
But you also want personalization which is like does this apply to my company right now?
Okay.
Well, that requires nuance and I can't make personalized Nuance in a video, right?
And so a lot of people think and this is the crazy thing.
People think that if they give away their secrets are not going to make money, but you're going to make more money to give away is because you're just afraid of it, right?
45:01
And so you saw the implementation and so to your point, like fundamentally the entire Fitness industry is based on selling accountability like stop eating and move more like it's not complicated, right?
But the heart is in the execution and so That's so to your point, should people just execute?
45:20
Sure do they know demand market and so they're like, I need help.
I need someone to hold me accountable, I need someone to personalize it.
If I get, if I have a plateau, someone who's done this with 100 other people before me so that I can avoid the common pitfalls.
And so that that promise exists in every industry you want to implement a CRM.
45:37
Sure, you can watch the CRM videos but they're probably not perfect for you or your business right now.
So you pay for implementation, you know, if you have, you know, a garden Anything like, you can teach people to garden with this would be like, can you just do it for me?
Sure.
Like you know what I mean?
Like all of these things there's always an opportunity, like, you can provide all the value upfront and people will still want help.
45:56
And I think that that's a totally Noble and fine business.
You help.
People out who want it?
You have everyone else for free, it's a win-win.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
You either have direct personal experience with the problem that you're trying to solve, which is if you're new to, this would be one of my strong recommendations, because you probably aren't going to be too like, guess what people want?
But if you were that person, you know exactly what you want.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:38
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and Buffett a document to their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
Last week I gave a guest lecturer at University of Texas, when a class in entrepreneurship.
And the common question that I got in this aspiring group was, what do I sell?
0:57
And how do I make it profitable?
And so, what I'm going to do is explain to you one.
How I pick a first product or a new product line that I want to start within a company or business?
And then what I call the delivery cube of how I scale it and make it profitable to do this over and over and over again.
1:14
The first thing that I want to start with is the only 7th Is that you can sell and there's digital and physical formats of each of these things which actually give you 14 different things you can possibly sell as an entrepreneur in general.
Now, everything else that I have possibly thought of fits Within These buckets.
1:30
So there are unlimited things to sell.
These are just how I bucket them.
Mentally, personally number one is, you can sell products and for each of these six things, you have physical and digital versions of them.
So for example, with products, you could sell a physical product which would be like I saw water bottles, right?
1:47
I have a physical product that I sell a digital product would be something like a PDF.
That is a digital product category 1, the second category is services.
So this is stuff.
You do for other people in the Physical Realm, a service would be a massage mowing.
2:03
Someone's lawn fixing someone's car, it's usually solving a problem for another person, taking their trash out, Etc, on the digital side, often times.
That service is something that happens in the digital space.
So if you are an ad agency and you make ads, The ad itself that you're making is a Surface.
2:19
Also, buying media is a service, plenty of those things are services that exist in the digital realm, making an app building software.
Like if you have a service shop, all of those things would be Digital Services.
So Category 3, you have access you have physical access and digital access.
Physical access is like, you lease, a building you gain access to the building.
2:38
Digital access is you gain access to a library of digital content, like, Netflix underneath that category for is attention.
So you can Well or by physical attention, that could be like a billboard, right?
Like cars physically drive past it and see it.
2:54
And so you can monetize that to the same degree Facebook and Google have digital attention in the digital space and they sell the eyeballs and the attention of that audience Category, 5 like their arcade is risk.
So you can buy and sell physical risk, and Digital Risk.
3:13
So if you sell physical risk, it's selling insurance, right?
So you Ensure a building.
You can also ensure against in the digital format a cyber threat, right?
Both of those are types of insurance that you can buy, which are really risk.
The next thing you can buy or sell is money itself.
3:30
So that is.
So the entire banking industry is predicated on buying and selling money and the rate they charge is the interest itself and so you can have physical money, right?
Like the actual US Dollars.
You also have digital money, which not going to get into crypto, but that is a form of digital money category 7 is it?
3:47
Endorsement or brand.
So, for example, in the physical world I say, hey, you can use my logo on your shirt, and you give me a percentage of all your sales and you make money, right in the digital world.
If you endorse something or someone uses your brand, or they can like when they sell a checkmark on Instagram or Ilan sells a check mark on Twitter, that is selling an endorsement at selling a brand.
4:11
It's selling some sort of status that gets transferred, and a fee is paid as a result of that.
So these are the seven categories that I think through both physical and digital that you can sell in general.
And I have yet to think of an example of something that is not that.
4:27
So I had somebody that maybe like what about a rock concert that is access to an experience, right?
And so as you think through it, rather than trying to disprove it try and think does it actually fit in one of these buckets and it'll help you think through how many different things you can possibly sell.
So now that you have seven, physical and 7 digital versions of categories of stuff that you can sell what I was talking about With this entrepreneurship group is that they had a hundred dollars to start their business.
4:51
Now, that would probably preclude you from most physical products, probably most kind of digital, like, software type stuff.
And so, most of the time, you're going to start likely with some sort of selling your time, which is often Services.
5:06
If you're starting out, if you're in a business and you have Capital, then obviously the rest of these things open up, like you can't sell money unless you have money, right?
You can't insure risk and You have enough Capital to show that you can cover the cost of the thing that you're ensuring right these should be common sense things.
5:22
But I like to include them for the sake of completeness.
Also, because if you're an established business owner, and you sell physical products or even Services, you can sell the risk associated with it, which is like, ensuring the products.
So some people give guarantees, but you can actually get people to pay for a guarantee, which is Insurance.
5:40
That's what a paid guarantee is.
Is someone pays just like Apple Care is just paid for insurance.
It's a paid for Guarantee.
So, So I like thinking through these because it gives you unlimited variety so that you can see how diverse the things you can tell really are.
Now, in terms of picking, which one to sell, is mostly going to come down to two things.
5:58
One is the resources you have and your skills value experience.
All right?
And so, at the end of the day, this is my massive simplification for figuring out what you should sell.
Figure out the person, you can provide the absolute most value to and one of the key points here is that it can be a combination of those categories.
6:17
So If someone sells a rock concert, for example, you're selling access to an experience but you might also sell drinks and t-shirts while you're there.
So you have physical products and a physical experience that are there that you might record it.
And then also sell the digital versions that you, what I'm going with here.
But if you think through this way, it can help you organize your thoughts, the way a more experienced business owner might, but it's going to start with who cannot provide the most value to and how much is it going to cost me to provide that value versus how much money I currently have.
6:45
And so, if you Cross-reference that which is here's the purse.
I provide the most value to for the least amount of money to me.
That's where your sweet spot is as the first or next thing that I would probably package and sell y combinator looks for one very important.
7:01
They look for five characteristics but I'm gonna hit on one thats related to the product.
That Founders choose one of the things they look for is past experience in the industry.
Now to be clear, it doesn't mean because if you're a first-time entrepreneur then you're like well I don't have any other experience but you actually do and let me hear me out.
7:17
So Your parents did something and if you don't have parents, the people who raised you did something.
And if no one raised you people, you knew did something.
Alright?
And you were around them.
So, like, for example, my mom is a doctor.
She's an eye surgeon, right?
She did glaucoma and cataracts, so I know a lot of stuff about eyes.
7:34
So if I wanted to get into a space, that would be a category of stuff that I actually know a lot more about than you might expect.
If your dad was a mechanic, you probably know what a carburetor is.
I have no idea what it is.
I've heard the word before, but like it's something, right?
But somebody who Was raised in that household would have a huge leg up on other people, and that's category.
7:52
One of things that you already have experience with the other categories.
Often times, you've had little odd jobs.
Like, when I was in high school, I was a blender tenor.
And then, I did catering at an Orthodox Jewish company.
So, I had like experience with an interesting nature culture, and also catering for weddings and bar mitzvahs, and so, I had very diverse experiences.
8:10
And so the thing is that you can have the most direct version of that.
You can also take a step adjacent to that, so I could have a fur coat.
Experience but I worked in the warehouse so it might just be warehousing.
In general, I have at least a feel for how that might work if I since I did catering.
I also have an experience for what kind of hospitality and serving look like so I might think okay well I know what it's like to be a server in one of those situations.
8:34
I also know what it's like to be the person who's at the table because I've been on been on both sides so that's something that I have more context to I've also been in the kitchen there.
So I saw some of the inefficiencies there that I could probably solve.
And so one of the things that they want is that you either have direct personal, Experience with the problem that you're trying to solve, which is if you're new to, this would be one of my Strong's recommendations because you probably aren't going to be too like, guess what people want.
8:55
But if you were that person, you know exactly what you want.
Most a nation real quick, if you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
9:21
The other version is that you at least were one step removed from it, like a parent, a friend, you worked in the job, Etc.
And then you can transfer the experience that you had their to the new thing because there's a lot of ignorance debt of stuff that you don't know about.
If you go into a truly net, new industry, if you went from catering to trying to figure out payment processing without ever having done it, because you watch the Youtube video, you have a steep learning curve.
9:41
But if your brother was in payment processing for like five years and you are, your roommate was, you probably know a lot of stuff just from osmosis of being around it.
And so that's also one of the lenses that I look at in terms of.
Okay, we have these seven things, digital and physical.
Is there any one of these that are already have a little bit more experience with?
9:59
And then of those things, which problem is the biggest that I think I can solve given the resources that I have access to, and before I get into the delivery Cube, what I want you to think with is what I call the easy to sell hard to fulfill Continuum.
Okay, so just think on either side, you've got easy to sell hard, to fulfill and hard to sell easy to fulfill on either side of this.
10:18
When we run through this delivery Cube, you can probably thinking Okay, one of these, the more extreme version will be really easy to sell, really hard to deliver on the flipside, man.
That's not delivering very much, which makes it significantly harder to sell.
And So based on your ability, you'll find a sweet spot.
10:33
You're like, I might not be that.
Good at sales.
Okay.
So you might have to do way, have your own delivery and that's okay because you're just getting started and you're going to learn and over time you'll find the sweet spot where you can sell it really well and it's not overwhelming to deliver and that will ultimately Drive the profitability and scalability of whatever it is.
10:50
You want to sell Once you've established that, what I like to run the thing that I've picked through is how can I enhance or make it more or less valuable, or more or less profitable for me as a business owner?
And so I run the thing that I picked through what I call the delivery, qu, the delivery Cube has six pieces to it and they work like this.
11:09
And so, each of these is a mental framework that you can apply to whatever it is that you sell.
Number one is, can I deliver this thing 121?
Can I deliver in a small group?
Can I deliver it one too many?
Of these have different value propositions that are associated with them.
In my experience, I have sold products and services in each of these capacities.
11:30
So, if you sold semi-private group stuff, it's a small group of five people doing something, that's different than doing a webinar, to 1,000 people at once versus having a call review system where you review someone's calls to give them feedback one-on-one.
These are all different ways of delivering the same fundamental service, but with wildly different value.
11:49
Propositions that Sy its the delivery Cube.
So when I think about how much I'm in charge, I think through each of these things that give me more scale on the thing.
I'm selling the second frame of the delivery cube is.
Doing yourself DIY DW, Y, which is done with you as in you're holding their hand through the process of whatever it is you're doing or done for you where you do all of the work yourself and you sell them a final product or some final outcome.
12:12
Each of these give you different levels of scale, do it yourself.
You can sell an unlimited out, typically the value of smaller done with you.
You have in between Queen the two extremes of do-it-yourself and done for you.
Done for you is the most expensive, typically, sometimes the easiest to sell, but one of the hardest things to deliver on because you take all the onus and all the responsibility for the outcome.
12:32
And so these are our seesaw.
Is that you're thinking through her that I'm thinking through what?
I'm making a new product line, new service, Etc.
The third frame is what level of support am I going to do and specifically on what medium and so what that means is, am I going to offer support via chat?
Am I can offer support via email and I can offer support via phone call.
12:49
Is it going to be Zoom?
All these are all different ways that I can support, whatever the thing is that, I'm selling obviously, if I do email support and that's the only way someone can contact me is through by submitting something on my site that's going to be significantly.
More scalable, it'll probably also be significantly less valuable than somebody who's real time available to hop on his own call whatever.
13:08
They want right?
Polar ends of the extremes filter.
Number four is how do I want them to consume the thing?
So they could consume it visually.
They consume it audio-wise.
They could consume it live.
They could sue a recording, they could.
It visually via text.
So there's different ways we can have people consume some sort of thing, whatever it is anything that's live is typically going to be perceived as more valuable.
13:29
And if it's in person and live, probably the most valuable and probably the least scalable on the flip side.
If I did something that was recorded and was digital, it would be the most scalable but probably the least valuable.
And that's the Seesaw between how we eat, how much we can charge and how much value, we deliver the fifth lens of the delivery cube is the speed and convenience of what Ever were delivering.
13:52
And so this comes down to multiple things.
One is, is it 24 hours a day or is it just 925 that's many frame 1 Frame 2 is how many days a week a my maintaining that level of service many frame 3 is how fast is that response?
14:07
So I might be open 24 hours a day, but I have responses that are guaranteed in 24 hours, which is different than saying I'm open 9:00 to 5:00 five days a week.
But I respond within three minutes it's different and so thinking about what level of service.
Want to have on the speed and convenience for your customer, ultimately make something more or less valuable and the ultimate extremes are either your overstaffed but your customers don't have to wait because it means that you incur and efficiency so that they have convenience or they incur the inefficiency and all of your staff is 100 percent utilized because they're going to call to call to call all day long or support to support all day long.
14:44
Polar extremes different strategies, there's wildly successful companies that do both and frame 6 is What I like to call the 10x to 1/10 test and this is one of at least my favorite value frames.
When I think about any product/service thing, I want to sell is frame number one.
15:02
If I charge ten times more for my current thing, what would I have to change about my thing that I sell in order to for it to be worth ten times more?
This ultimately gets me thinking in much bigger ways.
About how much value I would need to provide.
15:18
Oftentimes though, there are solutions that I think about When I think of a, let's say I go from a 10 thousand dollar thing to 100,000 other thing that still would be profitable at a ten thousand dollar thing.
It just makes me think differently because I now have to justify my hundred thousand dollar price tag.
Once you've written out those ideas, the flip side of that is equally powerful which is if I had to deliver the same or even more value than I currently am, but I could only charge one-tenth the price that I currently am.
15:43
What else would I do?
That would be perceived as valuable but would not cost me enough so I could still justify 1/10 the price.
Rice.
But maintain my value.
You think through that, you get a whole nother list of solutions to make your product service etcetera, more valuable.
16:00
When I go through that delivery Cube and I apply that to the 14 different types of things you can sell, which is 7 times the physical and digital version of that.
This gives me a very good starting point to both, figure out what the first thing I might want to sell is and then how can I scale it and make it more profitable and, or more valuable to my in consumer and think through.
16:20
Ratio of how many people I would need internally.
My company to facilitate that all the way from.
I wouldn't need anyone to I'd need tons of people.
If I sold 100 units, that is the easy to sell hard to deliver a Continuum where, if you choose the most scalable version of this, you can have no employees and sell tons of units, but it would be very difficult for you to get a good price tag.
16:43
Because the value might not be there on the flip side, you might need tons of employees and it might be really easy to sell a super done for you.
That's 101.
That's in person that you respond to them 24 hours a day.
Within minutes, red thinking through all like the extreme versions of this at a 10x price tag of where you currently are, sometimes that's still a great way to start your business because if you don't have a lot of employees and you only have your time, maybe you should 10x or 100x, surprise.
17:07
And then make all of these other elements of value from a deliverable perspective, available to your customers.
And so when I'm thinking through each of these things, I'm taking off how I want to support each level of value within the thing that I'm selling.
And so this is what I was explaining with the University of Texas entrepreneurs or aspiring entrepreneurs.
17:26
So they could think through their choice of what to sell the same way, a more experienced business owner, might think of starting a new product line or starting a new business altogether.








0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
0:24
It means the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world with someone else you set the tone for.
How the organization is going to move, right?
How quickly thoughts become reality and ultimately how powerfully organization will become because of the speed, the wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
0:42
This podcast, the game is my attempt to documenting the lessons.
I've learned on my way to build an acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
Calling this fuck end of week.
0:59
And what I mean by that is one of the things that I've seen across the board when we're talking to you.
I foreigners and, you know, the, the gym on our community that we have.
Is that the one trait I see over and over again, that is clear to the people who are our winners.
Right?
The top 1%.
1:15
I'm not talking top. 10% of the top 1% is the speed with, which they execute after making a decision.
And so one of the definitions that, like, we Where the community is that differential power as I understand, it is the gap between thoughts becoming reality.
1:33
And so, if you thought about an omnipotent being write something someone who has unlimited power as they think that thing would be right?
And so if you were to believe in a creator of some sort than you might think as that Creator thought the universe became, right?
1:48
And so, if you think that is like the ultimate scale of power, then the closer we can get to that.
The more powerful we become the more potently are as entrepreneurs.
And so, I see this so many times, it's not even a no, like, this is associated with success.
2:04
Like, this is what creates success because the gap between where you decide.
Something is a good idea.
And when it actually occurs is the loop with which you can improve your business.
And so it's a lot like Cameron were the same ones but it's not like how old the car is good, but how many miles are on it?
2:23
And what I mean by that is like We're Young, right?
But There's been a lot of, a lot of iterations that have happened from, you know, when the business first started, when I started my first year until now and I think the key to that is the speed of the ooda loop and that's that's just a military term like observe Orient, decide act and it's just the loop with which that you can basically see what's going on.
2:43
Make a decision act on it and then do that whole loop again, right?
Because the faster you can pivot and iterate.
The more responsive.
You are an entrepreneur, the fast you can take advantage of opportunities.
The faster you can find out what failures are at then move.
Vaughn, right?
And so I want to talk about this within the context of running, a team and employees and then also within yourself and so from running your team, right?
3:06
One of the things that, you know, once once you're moving out of you doing things all the time, there's how do I get other people to do things?
And so that's why I called this, like, fucking of week, right?
Is that I one of the things, one of my biggest pet peeves is like, yeah, I can get you that, by, by end of week I'm like, why don't you just get it to me in an hour?
3:22
Because that's how long it takes.
And then all of a sudden it's like, It's like, well, I have a meeting, right?
Then it's like, is it more important?
This know?
Okay, well, then do it, right?
And you can speed like, if you think about how you can run an organization like that, if you can get things done end of day, right?
3:39
Rather than end of week, you were literally speeding up.
The organization 7x think about that.
And so, when you're thinking about deadlines, if you're thinking about expectations you as the owner could set the excuse of decadence, if people say, hey, can we do this?
3:55
And then you're like cool let's start right now.
Now you set the tone for how the organization is going to move, right?
How quickly it's going to orient, how quickly thoughts become reality and ultimately how powerfully organization will become because of the speed, right?
And speed isn't doing things fast.
4:10
It's basically just not being distracted by other shit.
That doesn't matter.
It's being able to prioritize, right?
And most people a lot of the times aren't doing something that's high priority, right?
A lot of times they're just doing nothing, right?
And so if you can, if you can speed up that Loop, And force and put apply pressure to your team to not do things by end of week or even end of day.
4:34
It's like, it's 10 a.m., can you get this done by noon, okay.
And then you can have that Loop happen three times within a day rather than it taking three weeks, right?
Because you set that Cadence from the beginning and then things get done faster.
I was talking to.
So I've been reading some really interesting books lately, you know, and I refer them out to a handful of my friends that I have that are all doing. 5 5 to 15 million kind of in that range and what was amazing to me is that every single one of them read the book immediately set me back their notes and what they were going to do with it and act like and basically we're asking feedback on on the angle that they were going to take with it.
5:12
And what's fascinating to me is that if you look at, if you look at lower level entrepreneurs, they and I'm not saying that in a negative way, I'm just saying, in terms of just objective rep, just having achieved as much, Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
5:32
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
5:49
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
The delay between being able to gain information and act as so much longer and that's why they how where they want to be, right?
And so it's kind of the same degree people who are like pay for our program and haven't gone through the podium.
6:07
Like, what do you do, right?
Like what priority, what education should you have?
That is not relevant to your business.
Like you're reading a motivational blog right now when you have to translate that motivation into a thought that you're then going to quote test and then you have to see how that test works.
6:22
And then maybe it improve something rather than just Following the Playbook that has already been tested and has already like the tree has been shook, right?
And so if you look at like Joey, for example who buy it by all definitions is, Jim is the is the number-one gym within Jim launch, right?
6:40
She was, he had already finished everything in Legacy by week. 8 is first eight weeks, he'd already implemented every single system and Legacy.
And so it's not like it's not like he has more hours in the day, right?
It's not like his business is different.
It's just that his level of efficacy in execution was so high because it allowed himself to get distracted by things and the moment he has something he needs to execute, its creeps this kitchen side of him that he cannot, he can't move forward without executing this.
7:08
So that the relief And if you can start to Foster that type of behavior in yourself in those attitudes about execution, you will grow faster and you will become more powerful as an entrepreneur, right?
If you think about your competition, who would you fear, right?
7:24
The competitor, who sees what you're doing, can immediately execute Implement and improve on it at a faster clip than you can even understand what's going on.
Right.
And that's where speed of first to Market and things like that.
Don't matter as much because of a competitor could execute and An outer loop, right?
7:40
Can speed that Loop up faster.
They could iterate improve on it fast as you can and then you have no chance to catch up, right?
And so if you're looking at your business, look at it from a context of speed of how long does it take us to improve things, right?
How long from understanding that are churn is high to executing the five Horsemen?
7:57
Right, how long did that take, we knew what the problem was.
How long did it take for us to do?
And if you can get real with yourself about how many actual hours, it will take to do something and then you look at your week and you think, okay?
Am I doing today?
That is more important than this and where can I put these two hours and start with the moment that you make the decision?
8:16
And then all of a sudden you'll be getting things, done that day that afternoon rather than end of weekend of months, right?
We purposely delay, these things because we just procrastinate for no reason when the problem will not go away, right?
And so, that is why within jamaat speed is King, is one of the core tenets of the business because like you have to, and the tone has to start with you is The entrepreneur, like you have to apply that pressure.
8:42
You have to say, Fuck end of week.
Why like, what are you doing today?
That's more important.
This right?
What are you doing in the next?
Two hours is more important to this tell me, right?
And a lot of times we get the answer like well I guess I could do it now, it's like yeah.
Then let's do it now.
Let's get it done right and that small change can 7x, right?
9:00
If you even go in from end of week to end of day, can 7x how quickly your business grows because the solutions that you need to implement to solve the problems and break through the bottle.
X happened today, not in a week, not in a month and then the reaction to the next thing that breaks the next bottleneck in the business happens not in a week, not in a month, but in a day.
9:20
And then that's how quickly you can pivot from where you are to where you want to go.
Because it's not one big thing, it's a million, small turns that will get you there.
So anyways, I hope anyone, you know, somebody found value in this if you have an employee or you're managing your team, and you want to implement new things start with today, right?
9:39
Start with end.
Of day, not end of week, start with end of the next two hours, and then work backwards from there and then apply pressure and push back on excuses for why something else, why something can't be done?
Ask for why, why do you think this thing that you're going to do is more important than this?
9:58
And I want a real answer, right?
And if they can't give you a real answer and it means that I need to help you prioritize and that's fine.
But this is now going to be your priority because this is what drives Revenue.
This is what drives our attention.
This is going to drive the business. - so, look at your schedule identify the bottlenecks you have and then start doing them now, not in tomorrow, not in a week not in a month because there's no point.
10:22
It's just the speed with which you can close the gap between your thoughts and your decisions and the reality that you create in front of you will dictate how powerful you are as an entrepreneur and even as a human being








0:00
There's tons of other businesses that you can.
Absolutely demolish for making lots of money just by doing the basics.
And if you execute on that for ten years, your business Grows by default because your competitors won't do that growing businesses is hard because it's different than people expect it to be.
The singularity of focus is so important.
0:17
We get presented opportunities.
Every single day that could distract us and thing is the bigger you get the bigger, the opportunity to get presented to you.
So the harder it is to say no don't tell a quick story about the woman in the red dress and I'm going to relate it to business in The Matrix.
One of my favorite movies.
There's Is the woman in the red dress.
And so it's one of the training programs that Morpheus takes Neo on the main character to teach him one simple lesson into their walking through a crowd, it's normal New York, lots of people, everyone looks different and then there's this woman in this red dress and NEOS head turns and Morpheus is still talking to him trying to teach him a lesson, right?
0:46
And then he looks back and more feels like we're listening is like what is that?
We're looking at the one in the red dress and he says look again it looks back at the woman and it's agent Smith pointing a gun to his head.
The thing is, is I see distractions and New Opportunities shiny object as the woman in the red dress.
And at every level of business, the woman in the red dress becomes more and more attractive because at first, you have to say no to a thousand opportunities than 10,000 and 100,000, you have to learn how to say, no again at every level, because I thought that once, I learn how to say no to the one, in the red dress, I'd be done forever, but that's not true.
1:13
She comes back every level she just gets hotter and hotter and hotter.
I used to think that like Innovation was everything and I think Innovation is important to very, very small degree but the vast majority of the business success is actually doing all the stuff that you know, you should be doing.
But you aren't A friend of mine has a wife who's really popular and they have literally 60 businesses.
1:29
He's an Excel She to keep track of all the businesses he has, and I think they make about total between everything, maybe he figures a year.
And some of you were like, oh, that's amazing.
But hear me out.
So we're having this long conversation and I just said, you know, if there were a magic wand and you could snap your fingers and eliminate all businesses.
1:45
But one how easy do you think of you to grow that business?
He was like, oh my God, it would be so easy to grow that to like 30 or 50 million is like, then why don't you do that?
And he said, that that question has messed with him for an entire year and he has since that conversation shut down business after business after business.
Just after business.
2:00
So he could focus on the one that he thought was the biggest opportunity.
Mark Zuckerberg didn't have side hustles.
If you do one thing and you do it, right?
And you would all the way you can get as big as you want.
You can have a long movie business that cover the entire United States, you could do that.
You could have a Cosmetics business that covers the entire United States.
2:15
You could have whatever type of business, you want that covers everyone.
If you waited for a long enough period time and didn't get distracted, it's one of my favorite quotes is by Neil Strauss.
You said, success comes down to doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing yourself.
You're smarter than you are.
It's the details that At pay the dividends the depth and the Nuance of understanding how to do something.
2:34
And so, for example, right now, obviously lots of opportunities that we have.
I still don't feel like we're doing the basics.
If we're not on every platform.
Why are we thinking about starting your business?
If we're not hardcore email marketing regularly and providing value, why are we gonna start in the business if we're not even building the SEO out on our site?
2:50
Why are we doing something else?
If we haven't completely, built out the sales training for our sales, team to keep their execution.
Hi, why are we think about doing other things?
And so, so many entrepreneurs that I see with Talking about how they want to grow their business, and do this next new thing or this exciting add-on aren't even doing the basics and the thing, and I've said this before, but being Advanced means that you never don't do the basics.
3:11
And if you're like, well Alex that's going to take so much time for me to do each of those things.
Welcome to building a big business because big businesses do the same things, little businesses do, but they do them better and they fill the holes in the bucket.
And so if you were to think about a business as a bucket and you've got water pouring in the top, which is the traffic or the eyeballs or whatever.
3:29
And then the bucket is what, you're keeping, right?
So the first thing that you're going to do, if you want to grow the amount of watch, having the bucket is, you don't have multiple buckets.
What you're going to do is probably fix the holes in the bucket.
You got number one, fix the bucket, number two, once you fix the bucket, increase the flow to the bucket, once you've done that and you've completely maximize that then you add new flows but most people have never done that.
3:50
And so the moniker that I remember about this is better more new.
And so whenever I'm thinking about our business or our business is in the portfolio, I think have we maxed out better yet if Have not matched better yet.
There's no point in incurring, the risk of more new because more is riskier than better.
4:05
Better is the lowest risk opportunity that everyone has do what you're currently doing.
Do it better follow faster?
Follow-up more make better copy, make better creative optimize your site hire better people, train them.
Better have better Management Systems better incentive systems be like but how is it sounds so boring.
Welcome to Growing big shit.
4:22
How you do it?
You literally fill all the holes in the bucket that, you know, you should be doing but aren't if you were to make a list of the top 25 Five things that you could do in your business that you are not doing the obvious things that, you know, would make you more money.
If I emailed more, I've been more.
If I did more reach out something more money.
4:37
If I made more contact, make more money.
If I train my sales team or if I did more call reviews, I'd make more money if I did, reorganize our customer onboarding process.
If I created a better cancer training for our customer support team across from you, suggesting we do make more money, put out every single one of the obvious bullets that you have that, you know, will grow your business.
Instead of doing the new thing, do those first.
4:55
And once you finish that list, what you will see happen and this is why it's spiritually difficult as an Because we stopped doing the old thing, we started the new thing and we got reinforce that behavior and so we learned the wrong lesson, we learned that when we start new things, good things happen.
And so we think we should start new things.
5:10
This is where it's difficult.
We have to learn at each level, you started the new thing and you got rewarded, but now if you start another thing, you will get punished.
And some people never unlearn that first lesson.
And so you have to switch from new to better because the Innovation already happened when you got the product Market fit.
As soon as people started buying the thing you're selling, that's when the new needs to end for a while because now you just need to do.
5:29
Better and more.
So you fill the holes in the bucket with all the better and then you do more, then you go from one piece of content, a day, 25 pieces of content a day from one sales guy. 25 sales, guys, from one video editor, 25 video editors.
It's about doing more once you fix the first one and make it better businesses will grow by default and they will beat their competition.
5:48
If they do everything their competition does.
But better, because what happens is most controversial divert resources from their cortex, think about the two paths boring entrepreneur.
Number one, who finally finds product Market, that people like the stuff that they're And then they say I'm not going to do anything new for next 5 years.
All I'm gonna do is do this better and do more of it.
6:05
So I'm going to do and then you think about the other guy who says oh we got some product Market, fit, fantastic.
Now I'm going to sell something else, but I get to get my rocks off, get my jollies off over here, thinking of all this new stuff, all this new marking, all this new product.
While the other business starts to wither away a little bit, because atrophy starts happen.
Because the things that were there, when you're overseeing, it aren't happening anymore anyways, and not only that, it's never improving and cost of media goes up cost of talent.
6:26
Goes up in the business is literally getting worse relative, the market over time if you're not improving.
It's you got these two entrepreneurs in this guy's diverting resources, that would have been allocated back to the same bucket.
To fill the holes, that is, instead taking some of that and trying to build another Bucket over here.
Meanwhile, the holes are getting bigger in the first bucket because it's getting worse and worse and worse.
6:42
And so then they find themselves with five buckets that are all tons of holes in them.
They don't have the bandwidth to actually go to the one bucket and fix it.
And that's when I asked the magic wand question.
So right now, if you have multiple things going on, how easy would it be to grow your business?
If I could wave a magic wand snap my fingers and everything ended, except for one pretty.
6:59
Right.
So why not stack the chips in your favor?
The thing that makes it hard is the discipline you have to have not the concept strategy is easy execution is hard.
It's the execution risk that is the much bigger risk for most businesses.
If you deliver dry cleaning, that is always clean.
Always, and always on time you'll have an exceptional business.
7:17
The strategy isn't complicated.
It's the execution is where everyone fails, but this is the thing is that the strategy is the new and exciting thing.
People allocate tons of attention, tons of time to new strategies new ideas, rather than making the Obvious.
Truth of.
If I deliver everyone.
Their clothes on time and they are always perfectly clean.
7:34
This business will work.
One of the things that we do when we're growing the business, after understanding better more new.
When we think about anything that we're growing, is what are the need to believes?
What do we need to believe for this to grow?
We need to believe that people will always want things fast do, is that something I want to bet on?
Yes, people always want a good product, so that we clean their clothes perfectly every time.
7:52
Do I believe that that's something that people want in the future as much?
They want to date were more.
Yes, people will always want good service.
Do I believe that this Improvement on the future or in the day?
Yeah.
It's one of the Beautiful Things is that when you enter a market, like something is boring as dry cleaner, boring is Lawn Care.
Boring is whatever is that, oftentimes, you're actually not competing.
It's the smartest people in the world, because most people are on Silicon Valley all trying to make next platform.
8:11
But there's tons of other businesses that you can absolutely demolish.
Who are making lots of money just by doing the basics.
And what makes them Basics is, how hard they are to understand but what makes you advances?
How well you execute them, like it's not hard to conceptualize that you take 10 guys, and each guy makes tuna calls a day.
It's 2,000 calls and it's not hard to conceptualize that.
8:27
How?
Well did you train them?
How.
Well, did you?
Recruit them.
What is their incentive structure?
Do you listen to calls and regular basis, is there a leader board?
Because you're thinking you're soft?
When you have that big list?
We need you to competition for the sales team.
I need to get that leaderboard setup.
Oh yeah, I need to be doing more call reviews.
That is the stuff that grows the business.
It's not the big idea.
8:43
People always want leaves promise you, you know, how to get leads, you know, how to get a better.
You will make tons of money.
People always need a place to live.
You have better buildings that are cleaner and things run, right?
And you treat your residence, while you have successful buildings, if you have a lawn care where everyone communicates well and is cost-effective and the Always looks great in the hedges.
9:01
Are clean lines at the Cadence?
That's perfect for most people.
You will have a good business.
You might be competing as people who are not, don't even think that way and so you can absolutely take their lunch money but you have to not get fancy.
So when I was going through the sale process for two of our companies, Bankers introduced me to a couple of other CEOs on that they had done deals with because I wanted to know what it was like after it seems like that, look how we can connect with these guys.
9:21
So I talked to one of them and the conversation changed my life.
He was a mercenary CEO.
So he was a third time CEO that private Equity by company.
Place him in heat.
Grow it and they'd sell.
And he had done that three times already.
Super season guy, was a long island guy, really thick accent said, you know everybody wants the super fancy trick plays.
9:37
You know it's like okay hike and then I you know, fix to the left and then we go, right?
And then it's actually going to be reverse, you know, whatever.
And then and then we toss it and then what do you know happens?
He catches it.
Then fumbles it and the other team takes down four touchdowns.
Like no, we're doing.
Simple backyard football.
9:53
He's like two fat guys.
In the middle.
Run to the right consistent yardage.
He's like don't be cute.
He said that and it really The way I saw business, you don't need to have any fancy play to be successful, you just have to be willing to get the consistent yardage people want, clean clothes, people want them fast.
10:10
People want good service and if you execute on that for ten years and you fill every hole in the bucket, your business Grows by default because your competitors won't do that.
This is where I say, like business is not hard in that, it is not complicated.
It is hard because people cannot stay focused on the same thing for a long period of time.
10:27
It's also, because once people make a certain amount, No money.
If they only did it for the income, they're trying to find the next index and make them more income rather than the mission of the business.
Because if you believe in the mission of the business you will be willing to do it for an extraordinary long period of time.
And I can tell you right now from all the friends that I have that makes shitloads of money, they've all been doing the same thing for a long period of time.
10:45
So as much as the world wants to tell you, you should have 17 majors in college and you should taste everything.
I think there's value to that, it will not fight against the reality.
Been Francis started Jim shark, when he was whatever 17, and now he's 28 or 29, we've got a billion dollar.
Think could he have tasted Stuff, sure, he tasted from like 14 to 17, right?
11:02
But then when he started that, he's been doing it for 10 or 11 years now.
Now he's a billion-dollar thing.
The work needs doing and you just need to decide when you want to start the compound and clock in your favor, which means, how long can I commit to this thing?
And so, I would say, once you've had a little bit of your entrepreneurial licks as fast as you can, to learn those lessons.
11:17
You think what need to believe is there that I do not think will change over an extended time Horizon and then serve that every day, all you do is you look at how to do better and how to do more of it and it's going to kill you inside because you like, Doing your shit.
And that's what was positively reinforced, your entire life as an entrepreneur in the beginning.
11:34
And then you have to unlearn that lesson because that's what it takes to get big.
As you do.
The same thing, you just do it that much better than everyone else and that takes time, it is arrogant to believe that you were going to out-compete other people who are fully focused on one thing when you were split on five like think about how arrogant it is to think that.
11:51
And the thing is plenty of people arrogant.
So many of you will still do this, but you also still be poor.
So, whatever, some dude is, he's got a lawn care business at all, he does is longer all day Doing your shit.
And that's what was positively reinforced, your entire life as an entrepreneur in the beginning.
And then you have to unlearn that lesson because that's what it takes to get big.
As you do.
The same thing, you just do it that much better than everyone else and that takes time, it is arrogant to believe that you were going to out-compete other people who are fully focused on one thing when you were split on five like think about how arrogant it is to think that.
And the thing is plenty of people arrogant.
So many of you will still do this, but you also still be poor.
So, whatever, some dude is, he's got a lawn care business at all, he does is longer all day








0:00
This is a clear example of the tragedy of the commons.
So like global warming that whole thing is tragedy of the commons.
So everybody has to agree that we're all going to long-term do this thing.
And if we don't, and any player can individually like benefit themselves, but players will benefit themselves.
0:19
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe with the angle of your like mass production, production of content that is teaching.
0:34
People, was there a point like when you made the the idea to become popular, you know, more popular than you were at the time, right?
Look, yeah.
Did you have to make a shift in your because obviously running a bunch of companies?
Is completely different in the time, it takes to running a bunch of companies and now I need to be a public figure and produce content, and be active and all those things.
0:57
How did that?
How did that shift of balance of work happen?
Or you just like delegate this now?
And now I'm I'm a instagrammer YouTuber guy.
Well the team is great.
So honestly I'm going to ton of Leverage from from this stuff to sit down for hours and whatnot to make all these videos.
1:14
I understand.
You're not editing them.
Yeah.
But you know to to sit down or do this.
Yeah.
And yeah.
You got a lot of podcasts which I'm like well a lot of people would maybe think of like I'm a business owner.
I can't do anything.
How is this guy?
So successful and he can go on to our podcast every week.
1:30
Yeah I think the nature of work looks different.
So I think the biggest misconception is like There's, you know, there's people talk about like there's in the business, there's on the business and then there's above the business.
And so like the portfolio companies have CEOs, like they have people running, you know, the their company day today and then, you know, at hold Kozak was not calm, like Leila is actually the CEO.
1:52
So Layla has a much harder time of balancing it than I do.
My job is more so get deal flow.
Like that is that's always been my hat in any business that we've owned.
It's just make sure that we have people.
Phones ringing.
Then people are knocking on the door and so this is a way of doing that.
2:08
So this is in some ways, my primary responsibility, but in terms of time right now, I would say probably one to one and a half days a week right now, and that's up from what it was last year and so my goal is to do more of this.
So I would like to continue to increase that percentage, which is different than like Gary Gary's like I'm running all day long.
2:28
And people are going to capture it.
We're going to be more purposeful about curated content.
Like I'm going to we're going, we will put more time.
Into our videos into our shorts into blog posts, into things like that.
And obviously the big reason is because like, I actually like it, I enjoyed a lot.
And so that's what we do, more of do the ideas that I call your videos of, you know, do this to make a thousand dollars, a day.
2:47
Whatever is that?
Do you ever get notes in your phone of like, when you think of cool ideas?
And then when you go to film them, is it I'm going to bang out 12 videos and change my shirt or not change my shirt or something.
Or is it?
I'm going to film one?
Have another idea.
Or do you like days, where you do it or is it sporadic?
Yeah.
So how many video ideas do you have in your phone or now, or in your brain?
3:04
So my video, you can look at my video idea of board.
Its public really my Twitter.
Okay.
So Twitter is my is my homepage so that's like it's so funny because we were like, I thought you were a ghost riders.
Like that's me all day long, just tweeting ideas of like things that I think are interesting or funny or whatever.
And then, the team grabs from that is like, I think this would be a banger video.
3:22
I think this would be a great short.
I think this would be a great whatever post.
And so all my like my Instagram post and the short videos come from Twitter.
That's for me that's my easy brain dump in terms of recording.
We've been doing every other week one day and that's where we do a few Long's and shorts like today is a recording dice.
3:43
I was recording before this and I'll be recording after this Fridays are usually my day and so that's how we do it now.
Now I would like to get to, you know, once a week.
So when I said a day and a half part of that's like the mental headspace of like, okay game planning things like conversations I'm having around the media, right?
And if you include the book then it's even more than that.
4:01
Because the book takes probably A day and a half a week to the book.
So, 100-mile offers, is the book that I put out, but I have a second book that's coming out after that hundred dollar leads, we had the gym launch book in the hunter million dollar off.
So, this is the third book, those books aren't related.
4:16
How do you have so much time in the day?
Dude, you're a, you're a machine.
Leila okay, Lela Lela Lela run shit like Leila.
It's a, it's a, it's a travesty If Layla were a guy and we were just business partners and not married, she would be more popular than I am by mile.
4:37
She just doesn't get the credit because she's a girl.
Hmm.
Why do you think that is because there aren't many girls who are successful.
I mean like if you look at the Forbes list of female billionaires like the top girls, like I don't 12 billion dinner.
No, she's not even close.
4:53
Yeah, it's Harper was like an old lady who has a roofing company.
What?
Yeah.
But like to be on the top on the Forbes on the top 100 self-made self-made because you can marry, you know, Mackenzie Bezos is number one, you know, technically whatever, but self-made, female entrepreneurs to be on.
5:11
That list is 250 million.
To be on the guys list of top 400.
So four times as many like to get on the list, you got to be like 3 billion, what?
There's just not as many and who know, nature-nurture whatever but like Leo supplier or like Leila's a gangster and the reason that my income you know, catapulted as soon as she and I hooked up It was her, you know, I mean, like I had six gems but like I would, you know, I wasn't raking it and I, you know, we made probably a few million bucks a year Top Line.
5:45
But not bottom line.
You know.
It's a low margin business and I know I'll tell you this.
I never felt like I had money and then when she and I got together, it was like, she just, she was just willing to do whatever it took.
Like I told her Like the number one thing that she's just fucking down like I was like we're going to go and not sleep for a month and like walk on fire.
6:10
She's like, all right I'm in damn guns.
You didn't sleep for a month and he walked on fire.
Yep, that's crazy.
And she was down as you like a ride or die, you know, 100%, that's why in the first book.
She's that's the, that's the thank you.
She is my ride or die.
So I think you got to find that person if you can because most people marry people who are constantly making compromises with them of like, you can only work this much.
6:31
We pursue this much of your dream and either you create a super distant marriage where one person just resents the other and it's like whatever or one or they both compromised, you know.
And I've been fortunate that I have a partner who wants to do just as much as I do.
And so we get 2 times, the output rather than half of my output or just one except my outfit.
Do you think that, you know, and we're not going to live in like an alternate universe here?
6:50
But do you think that if you found someone that wasn't, as business-savvy focused determined driven as your current wife?
Do you think it would have completed change your do you think that you You could you could still do the things you do and maybe have someone who wants to live that casual second part of like the day, the life, the evening type of thing rather than business-focused like you think it's important for people who are trying to be that grind entrepreneur that they have to find this other half.
7:18
That's like them with the same business mindset.
Yeah, I won't speak in half to, I can say for me.
This now that I have this, I don't know how I would not have this.
Yeah, I had relationships in the past and I have all the love and respect for those people, but the dynamic was much more kind of what you're saying which is like hey stop working.
7:39
Let's go, you know, be social and do that.
And I could definitely rationalize the fact that it's like, hey, it's good to have some balance in my life and whatever.
But like, In some ways balance is silly.
Because like in a different setting a different way, it's like, hey stop doing the thing.
You like the most and do something you like class That's balanced.
7:56
Like why?
Why don't you do more the thing?
I like more of like a lot of it is just ticking external judgments on what we're supposed to do based on some arbitrary societal Rule and projecting it on our lives and saying what we're doing is good or bad and I just fundamentally reject that like we do what we want to do and if we want to work for 30 days straight, then we work for 30 days straight and we want to take three days off, we take three days off like I just, it just is.
8:20
So, do you think that people?
I think there's a lot of the mindset, especially with the hole You know, red pill stuff of like, you know, especially when you're trying to build a super villain, I wrote that.
Okay, well, I guess the the best phrase to say would be, especially people are coming up and be like disregard women acquire wealth car currency.
8:39
You know, it's like that kind of mindset of like, I don't, I can't get a partner or like significant other until I get to this point, or do you think people can build something with it or like how is your thought on people who maybe are single and want to build a business?
8:55
Do you think they should only focus on themselves and not try to have that relationship balance or wait until they find the?
Yeah, I want.
Le I won't should because I don't believe in shirts but I will say If you make more money sooner, you will attract more attractive women.
9:14
That being said, they may be more attractive physically, but then if they came to you, because you have money, then, why do you think they're there?
And so it really just depends on what kind of relationship you want to have.
And so, you know, there's a reason that they have like the stories of like the Pauper and the prince are what, you know what, where the guy pretends like he doesn't have money to find a girl who actually likes him because I mean it's great for Instagram to have the the model next to you or whatever it is so that you can gain status from that.
9:38
But like when you're alone at night and the person that's in bed with you you like have no shared reality and anything that they believe about the world you hate.
Is it worth it?
That's some deep shit for me.
It's not, you know, my just to give you a little insight on my relationships.
9:54
I've been, I was single for seven, eight years.
And it was very transparent with that, on YouTube.
And I was like, the single guy for just, it was like, I was gonna be the single, I was with the cool.
Uncle has made the cool, you know, whatever.
And I, you know, started building businesses and became, you know, on a relative very successful at what I'm doing.
10:13
And when I found my current girlfriend who were a year in, Best thing that's ever happened to me, you know, we got a lot of or I got a lot of, you know, this person's only with you now because you're successful and I think a lot of people were you say you know hey build you know get yourself get to a point where you know you're successful and then the higher level of women or Partners like will be there.
10:37
A lot of people will just assume that when you get there the only people that you're gonna be able to find are people that are going to want you for your money.
So I want to add a kick out of this.
Cecil people.
Find women?
I want to I want to put a real word down.
Yeah, I think this is really good.
You want somebody who's attracted to you because of your character not because of your assets and so if the character is the thing that created the assets and that's what they're attracted to.
10:59
Then if you lose the assets, they still love you.
If they are attracted to because of the assets and what those assets can do for them and you were just a part of that package, then that is something that I would run the other way from, but again, that's me some.
There are people that I know who have that relationship and from everything that I can see are very content and they and they have clear expectations, they know that it's a transactional relationship Sheen in.
11:20
This isn't guy girl that you know the guy were the guys Making it the girl knows that when you know Daddy has to work, Daddy's going to work.
You know what I mean?
Then she understands that her lifestyle as a result of the fact that he works and she's less demanding because he says I can't have you demanding and if I'm here and we'd only see each other for two hours a week and it's when we go to the pool thing and you have your girlfriend's around, that's how he unplugs.
11:40
I think it's really not about the shoulds.
It's about like what works for you for me.
I want, I want a partner who I can share my life with the battles, the scars.
The things that were going through and for me, if I don't have somebody that I can share that with, I feel very alone and I don't like that.
12:01
And so, or rather lonely.
And so I've been in relationships where I feel unbelievably lonely, because I just feel like I'm the only person going through this.
And so, having her as my partner.
We can have, we can have we can talk we can talk about business all day which is what all I want to do anyways and so she wants to do and it's great, you know?
12:21
And again this is just what works for make.
Some people don't function that way and that's fine.
You know what I mean?
I would just say that.
If what you're currently doing is not working.
Consider an alternative.
Yeah, I agree.
I agree.
And with building building yourself up and building maybe to get to this point where again, where, you know, relationships and you super happy and life and you talked about the Forbes.
12:41
Lists, is there a number that You have in your head that, I mean, you're clearly someone who enjoys building enjoys creating enjoys the grind, right.
You know, whether you have internal improving myself, I can do this, I can get to this number, is there?
12:56
A number that will hit to that?
Will you know, satisfy you?
Well I'm satisfied playing the game.
And so, it's like the person who loves walking verse, the person who loves the destination.
I'm walking.
So, I'm good.
And because of that, I'll probably keep walking.
13:13
And so if I keep walking, will start, you know, knocking over Milestones.
But I'm walking as I like walking and the Milestones just happened.
The mile markers just continue as you just keep walking.
So, you know, the the tangent, you know, the hard goals are just Milestones that you hit, but like It doesn't matter and and you're not well as yeah, because he has certain point, more.
13:33
Money's not going to do anything for you.
Right?
And you know, an interesting thing is always like I want to create wealth for the Next Generation, the Next Generation and you're not so much of a tangible Bugatti, you know, Lamborghini guy.
13:51
I know you went through a phase where you sold everything.
I mean, I know you were I watched a bunch of videos and your mindset on how you spend your money is very interesting to me.
Out, you know, the the place where you live, rather than having a house where you had to maintain the house and have all the cleaners.
Yeah.
And even your opinion on food.
14:07
What is your like, why don't you feel like you want to have a fancy car?
Big fancy house?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Do you fancy watches or anything?
No.
What's the dumbest thing you've ever seen?
Mary?
Might spend your money on a boa.
How much was that 350?
I think and then when you got it where you like this is sick or you like I hate myself, it just it does nothing.
14:29
Yeah, I was like this is Another car, you know what I mean?
And it conferred no increment.
Incremental benefits my life.
So like I spend tons of money on gym equipment because yeah love gym equipment.
You don't.
I mean like I loved, I have too much of it and I still want to buy more and it's fun and it's one of the few things that I drive a lot of Joy from in my life, where do you put your gym equipment?
14:48
It will be in our office that we're building, okay.
But I mean before that it was my house.
I do full commercial gym in my house and you're big.
You spend your money on, I guess you could say experiences.
But like food, like your take on food, is very II.
Could agree with a lot of It.
Can you explain your only sour sour candies?
15:05
No I specifically sour strips everyone that's been my diet the past couple days but your I saw something on Instagram recently and it got the comments made me want to like smash my face against the table because I feel like it will take certain things for exactly the face value they're not like extrapolating it.
15:24
You said about like cooking food is dumb.
Hmm.
Buy all your food.
What explain that?
Yeah.
I mean it's just opportunity.
Just so like if you are, if you are something, I said, if you were, so if you're making $15 an hour or more, then the amount of time that it cost, at least for me, when I went to the grocery store like I've made my list checked, it twice went to Costco bought all the food came back.
15:46
Unpacked it prepped it cooked it, boxed it, put it in the fridge.
And then, every time I would eat it, I would take it out.
I would eat the food.
I would clean my dishes, like, all of that cost me more time than just working That period and then eating out like the incremental cost difference as a single guy with families.
16:06
It's a little bit but as a single guy if you only need to make for one, oftentimes have to cook twice anyways because like by the sixth day, the chicken starts looking weird.
Yeah, it's a sort of spreading a third third leg.
Like what the fuck is the top of my Tupperware container?
There's an eyeball growing in there.
And so, so now it's like, now I'm cooking twice a week, right?
16:22
And so, when I started adding up the math, as like, the math, didn't pencil out, and to be fair, I made more than $15 an hour.
And so, for me, I was, I've been selling since I've been in Entrepreneur.
And so I knew that if I just worked my leads for a day, I would make an extra Grant.
So there was just there was never it just never made sense and so my the the message of that is do the math.
16:45
Like, if you make two dollars an hour by all means, you know, go, like go to the grocery, you know, do do all that stuff but if you, if you make just pencil out how long it actually cost you in all the costs clean prep, cook, grocery shop, Plant, all of that cost.
For most people, it's like 10 hours a week.
17:02
Ten hours a week.
I'm like, that's a that's a quarter of a work week if I had a quarter to my income.
And then how much does the incremental cost compared to the groceries that Delta is more than 25 percent of my income.
That's probably the easiest equation.
If it's more than 25 percent of my income that that Delta, then I shouldn't I shouldn't do it.
17:20
Is that how your brain works?
Whenever you go to like this, do anything?
Hmm, it was like doing a swinging to just pull a be like, well I did the math on how long it would take to sit in that line over there and I believe that that McDonald's would give me more valuable time.
If I go through that Jeepers, that out.
You're like, brain works.
Yeah. 100%.
17:35
I want I want to hear with with optimizing your time and optimizing efficiency.
Yeah, I want to dive a little bit into AI because that's going to change the world and I watched your video and write what is why you so bullish on AI.
I mean I don't think we're going to stop a i yeah.
17:53
Yeah I mean I'm the only so interesting I think said there's two.
It's like I don't even know if Government intervention could stop by Like it's just the wheels of progress.
Don't stop turning.
They never have in the history of humanity to my knowledge.
Like they don't really stop turning unless it's super Niche and there's tons of money that can squash a tiny invention like a light bulb that lasts forever and then like Phillips and all the other companies, like, by the company.
18:19
And then don't produce the product as it cuts into their margins or whatever.
But this, it's already too big.
In my opinion and the wealth that can be generated from AI is too large for any person to stop and very And apparently I'm very afraid of it because every other Innovation to this point has been around a specific Improvement in human productivity.
18:41
So the industrial revolution revolution their agriculture Revolution, like these were all improvements in how we did things and we became more productive and the people just moved up a level and productivity.
This is an invention that can undermine the Human Institution because of a robot can human better than humans can than what is left for humans to do.
18:58
I'm scared to die, too, because I've seen iRobot and I know it happens in the fucking move.
Yeah, exactly.
It's just you in a dog and so it's not a bad life but but yeah, so I think that there may in a very weird way.
You might actually see people moving out of really developed countries into undeveloped countries because they don't have ai and they might be like back to normal.
19:17
That's like a weird like potential prediction all throughout their Black Mirror shit.
Yeah, you might see people moving to Africa because like AI hasn't taken over yet.
Do you, I think one of them.
There's a lot of people's opinions on that one of the large ones, I would say is, Is like, you know, the South Park, like they took our jobs, you know, like they're taking the jobs of the people and what's interesting is people really want to fight it.
19:40
Because, you know, we want to get, I understand like we want to give jobs to people, but then there, when they go to the grocery store, they hate stand in the line for the one checkout person.
But they're like, they love the self-checkout because it's so fast.
Like, they're starting to like, well, that's okay because it's really fast for me to get in and out of my groceries, but like it, like, when it affects them in a certain way, they allow it or like don't mind it but But they hate how, you know, at McDonald's instead of needing a person to take her order.
20:06
Yeah.
You can just tap on the machine.
Mmm.
So this is this is a clear example of the tragedy of the commons.
So, like global warming that whole thing is tragedy of the commons.
So everybody has to agree that we're all going to long-term do this thing.
And if we don't, and any player can individually like benefit themselves but players will benefit themselves, right?
20:25
And so the example you gave with McDonald's.
It's like no one like most people don't want global warming, most Most people don't want a, i to take, they are job, but they're okay with it.
Taking someone else's job and the thing is, is that we're going to vote with our dollars in the way that's most convenient for us.
20:44
And so, we will vote locally.
For the things that's convenient for us but in so doing invest globally in the thing that will put us out of business.
And so for that reason, I don't think it it will be stopped because you said, I think people are going to vote with their dollars that they're fine with an AI checkout person.
21:00
They're going to have a an entirely automated Starbucks.
Like I think that they will vote that way because they'll get cheaper coffee.
Look at it faster, they won't mess up the order, I think it just shifts.
You know, instead of the people working, you know, that the machines replaced, now, they will need people to build the machines.
21:16
Make the machines until they have machines that make the machines, but then they'll need machines to build those machines that build the machines.
Hmm.
Well, how do you think it's like, when do you think it'll stop in terms of The Cutting like, I guess, like, what is the future for the jobs for basic entry level jobs?
21:34
When machines, and a, I can do all of the things for you.
The chat cheapest here.
Yeah, it's like things like that of right, right.
A website write a code.
Create a, you know, thing of you know, where is The shift of where jobs you think are secure because people need to get there.
21:50
We'll go there.
Look, wise, you guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
22:08
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, but taking 10 seconds, or one type of the thumb, to means the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
I've stumped them.
22:23
I've stumped them.
Everyone.
I don't know because again, as soon as a I can human better than a human can, it's tough.
Like, right now the knowledge base skills are going to go first, which is reverse of what people thought they expected it to be blue collar.
Like, if you had asked people to years ago, what's a I going to fix first.
22:40
They're gonna be like, well, all the low skilled jobs.
All the labor that's going to replace first and then we'll be the slightly lower skilled White Collar jobs, and then the higher score, White Collar, jobs, like programmers, and things like that, and then, finally, maybe the creatives, but it's been the exact opposite of that.
It's Started with the most creative things like making images and paintings and and pictures and and essays and words like most of human Communication in a creative venue.
23:04
Like it can do that first and Robotics is already there in terms of being able to do better work than what a human can, it just hasn't become cost efficient, but we know on any time Horizon that technology becomes more efficient over time.
And when that AI brain meets this robot body, it can now do what humans can do in the real world and so like where do humans go?
23:23
That's fundamentally the issue.
They've have a four-and-a-half-year Ubi study that's being undertaken, by open a.i., because they, I'm pretty sure know what's going to happen, which is that many, many, and like, even if there are like to your point, like, even if there are jobs that like some humans can do most humans can't And so like chatty BT rights better than like 60% of Americans in 15 seconds as well.
23:46
It's right.
And that's today.
The question is, which at P&G bt100 can do maybe rides better than all humans?
Because there's something called the drift, which is right now, ai is learning from humans, right?
It's learning from the stuff we do and it's mimicking that.
But in a future iteration it will learn from itself.
24:02
It'll be a i learning from Ai and then at that point to starts to drift away from what we know to what is purely a i generated.
And I mean I've been very transparent.
Like I'm I'm very, I'm very worried about what will happen for the vast majority of people, you know, I'm a competitive person, we absolutely have embraced a, i within our company and it's because we don't have a choice as far as I see it.
24:27
You know, I Ilan has far more clout than I do and he lobbied with the government for years to get AI regulated and they refuse to hear him out at all.
And the thing is even if the u.s.
They did it China won't and we need to stay competitive because if they use that against us, you know, blah, blah blah.
24:46
So it's tough, it's tough.
It's super tough.
And you know, like what about education and things that schools like, you know, they're like no School.
Technology can use chat to BTS like yeah, the kids don't have phones.
That's like saying everyone don't use your TI-83 to cheat on this essay and you're like, that's fine.
25:01
I'm going to my notes right now and I got all the formulas written out.
Yeah so it's it has really profound implications and I think humans are really bad at predicting things.
So that's what I can say.
Like the fact that AI two years ago, people just said, blue collar jobs and it's only the last thing as being replaced.
Just shows you how bad we are predicting.
Yeah, so my predictions are weary it.
25:18
Best to guide.
Hope rushers in a golden era for Humanity.
I hope more than anything we you know we do nuclear nuclear fusion and we, you know, we cure all diseases and we can reverse aging like I hope we can figure all that stuff out but If you can get your logo designed in 5 seconds and get 10 different versions who gets fired.
25:40
Yeah, and get the designer turn, it alternate versions alternate colors in a millisecond in the short term.
And I said this in the video, the short term, the people who are going to do quality assurance on the stuff that chat GPT spits out will be the opportunity, they'll actually be have an outsized opportunity.
So like if you know how to write code, then what happens is now you can write ten times the code so the execution has been delegated.
25:58
But you still have to think is you validate?
The code is correctors goat or does the job that it needs to if, like it Right code.
If I were to ask you to write code, I don't know how to read code.
So it doesn't matter that it can write code for me because I don't know how to judge it.
So I still need a human to do that and that human can now check ten times as much code or 100 times as much code which means the value of an expert increases in the short term, long term.
26:18
Once the a, I can check itself and can do it better than human can check.
Millions of lines of code.
Outside of business related.
Things just to go a little nerdier deep on that neurolink.
Yeah.
Are you, what do you think the future of, you know, we have essentially what, like, petri dish babies.
26:37
Now, I can choose their the eye color, the hair color, what gender they're going to be and with the neural link, we might be able to what was it?
You that was watching a video that was, you know, some people can do certain tasks that with the knurling.
Maybe everyone can have these attributes to them.
You know there are some people with photographic memory Hurry.
26:54
Now what if everyone has access to photographic memory ever become super humans?
What do you think of the future race with?
If everyone's just perfect, I mean, there's gonna be sick, they be better than the current race.
Damn.
I mean, at the end of the day, you know, survival of the fittest means the survival of the most adaptable.
27:12
And so, if you have a, you know, if you go from bio flesh, that can get disease, they can get hurt it, can it ages and Haze, right?
And you have a robot that's, you know.
Times a strong can upgrade itself.
You can like no one gets old because you literally just upgrade yourself as you're going.
27:30
I know we're bordering it is you know science fiction here.
But Point is, what in our lifetimes, some of the stuff is possible, you know, and if a I can start innovating on its own, then there was a futurist who said, like a I will be the last invention Humanity ever needs to make because then it will make all Innovations after that, faster better stronger than we can.
27:48
And if the future race is emerge between humans and Ai and Cyborg, then that would be interesting.
The question is why they would need us.
Robots going to take over its initial intake, but I will say though, I disagree that robots like how like strong they can because I mean, I can deadlift 650 pounds.
28:07
There's no way robots gonna be stronger than me, period.
With the whole a I think look I do a lot of dumb jokes.
What do you think about that?
Just Ukraine's, man with AI?
28:26
The whole idea is that you're offloading Tassie.
Don't need to do back to kind of business.
What is what is your a lot of people you always hear about Outsource Outsource delegate delegate.
When do you think people need to get to the point where they Are doing it, like what are things that people shouldn't let go of and things that people should let go of immediately that generally the hold on too long.
28:49
So again, I won't say shouldn't shouldn't but I would say if you're optimizing towards making the most money than you have to trade up in higher leverage activities, so it's what do I?
So Leverage is just defined as the difference between inputs and outputs in a system.
So if I do this, then I get this output.
And so the Leverage is the discrepancy between that.
29:06
So if I have a one-to-one ratio, I have low leverage.
If I have a 1 to 10 ratio of higher leverage, right.
And so when we are leveling up as entrepreneurs, we need to trade out the things that we get 12 to on and trade in things that we get 1220 on and you just keep trading the whole way up and you just keep going.
And that's the kind of unending infinite game of business.
29:23
What do you think is like the number one thing that people shouldn't delegate?
Like when you start a company right you have passion behind it.
There's still something like what's the point you get to when you're just like it's you're not even you just collect a check and you don't even like live in the world of that business anymore.
29:39
Like, do you think everyone should Get to that or like even with acquisition.com or steal your stuff.
Like you think there would be a point where you're like I don't literally do anything.
I just own it, you don't need to look at it ever like it.
Did you lose the interest in the passion for it?
When it gets to that point, though?
Well, if you get to that point, then you're probably inherently disinterested.
29:57
So if you like, so again I won't do shuds if you, if you like doing something then by all means do it.
If you're optimizing for how much money can I make then?
It's Theoretically, if you can get someone to do the same thing that you're doing and do it for less than a hundred percent of your Equity, then you trade up.
30:18
And if you get lots of people to do that, then you make more money.
So the idea is to actually is solve for zero, so if you solve for no time no energy, then you have infinite leverage on that thing.
And so if you have lots of zeros, then you have all your time and you have checks that are coming in, in terms of, like, fly fulfillment.
30:35
That's a totally different question.
But if you have no commitments and you have cash flow that's going in, then if you want to, you could pursue the next business, you know, if that's what you're interested in or if you like painting or whatever, you know what I mean.
So what are the things that People should not Source, nothing.
You should be able to, you know, you can Outsource whatever you want.
30:52
I think it's just what goals.
You know what goals do you have?
If you love painting and your whole business is painting as soon as you hire painters, you're no longer painting anymore.
Is that what you wanted?
Yeah, some people, yeah, some people know, because the difference is, if a painter wants to make money painting, that is different than somebody wanting to start a painting business.
31:09
And so one is a business career, the other is a Technician career and a lot of people that's actually a really big one.
A lot of people who are technicians, love the craft and hate the business.
They need to decide whether they want to be business people, or they want to be technicians and I don't think there's a right or wrong answer, they to decide for themselves and then stop their expectations about having both because the businessman wishes you could paint all day the painter, which is you can make the money that businessman, you know, a relative thing of that is I have a buddy who is a leather craft?
31:37
Or I guess you will?
He makes leather leather goods?
My wallet is made by him, right?
And we've done a lot of clubs in, he has to make them in this haiquan and he's physically doing everything to make these Eyelets.
And at some point he's like, oh, like there's X crazy amount of hours in here and I can't create eye out, but he wants to continue to grow the business and like, whoo Wilbur, like why don't you just hire people to make the wallets with you or to do it?
32:00
He's like, well, then I'm not going to be it's not gonna be a Handmade by me and then, you know, he wanted to create duffle bags because I can't create these and he Outsource them, you know, when it starts losing touch but he's so like obsessed with him needing to like make the wallets and I'm like are you trying to make wallets or build a business?
32:16
Yeah.
It's interesting in it and having passion in your work.
I would you would you say that most people should find a business that they're passionate about?
I don't think people should or shouldn't do anything.
I think they Behavior word should know.
I don't like shit.
32:33
I think people can, if they want to make more money than you, optimize for the vehicle that will make you the most money.
And then you do that, the, the whole passion piece teases out the psychology of humans.
Because if you're just Looking at first principles of like what has to happen, like build a business that has the highest leverage that has the highest total addressable Market, that has Highest Potential growth per customer and do that.
32:55
That's what you would need to do if you wanted to make the most money if your but if you as soon as you add in the psychology of humans it's like when you get tired of this when do you lose interest in it?
And so the big thing for me at least is that I love business.
And so, as long as I'm doing business, I'm good.
33:12
And so, the nature of the business, doesn't matter as much.
And I would say, a lot of entrepreneurs are that way.
And so the The big, the big decision is do I want to be a technician or do I want to be an entrepreneur?
And they are very different paths and I just don't, it's very difficult to have both.
Like if your buddy like he needs to make that decision of like, okay, I have more demand for my wallets than I can fulfill.
33:33
So he has two options, he can hire and train other people or by a machine that can do the same quality thing as he can, and he becomes a business owner of a wallet or leather company.
Or he raises the price of his wallets, because he has more demand than he has time.
And so over time, his business does grow, but based on quality and based on the fact that it's handmade and it's, you know, bottle on his special, his special touch and he kisses and he sings it, send it, you know, sleep every night.
33:58
And so, but like that's the that if he wants to keep making wallets and he wants to keep making money, he will have to do that.
And his profits are going to go up, he's probably not going to build a billion-dollar wallet company, but he could make a few million dollars a year.
So it's just like, what does he Aunt.
And I actually think that's, he says to the core issue which is most people don't know what they want.
34:18
Are you would you say you're a passion business business business?
Would you do what you do things that for example, I had a friend approached me years ago and was saying how much money he was making from.
It was super popular and probably still is to do the Amazon Drop Shipping thing and he was telling about all the money that he's making.
34:36
I'm like, oh, that sounds really cool.
Mean like what do you selling is like plastic, shower, caddies to put your soap on.
But again from China I'm like, what a year interested in making shower, caddies.
That no, no.
Like, I was going from China, a fuck about the shower, caddies, but I was making, I was like, why do you care to sell shower?
34:54
Caddies.
Like, I'm making money.
Like, I guess it's just different strokes for different folks of, you know.
Do you like making money?
There's a balance of the passion and it's not necessary to be passion is around.
Like, I like the game I want to like we're like said differently.
I love looking at a market place and finding where there's a supply demand mismatch.
35:13
And I know, and I love talking to, you know, to and negotiating with these third party.
You know, manufacturers and getting the stuff over here for as low as I can.
And I love marketing it, so that I can get all these people to buy it, but he's passionate about finding the opportunity, rather than the opportunity itself.
Like, it's the hunt that he's passionate about rather than the product.
35:31
These passionate about, which is fine, it's all fine, you can do whatever, you know, like, there's a million ways to make money.
We're really A Million Ways To Live.
It's just and that's not good or bad in my opinion.
Yeah.
But the guys who the guys who are super passionate about the product and become evangelists for it, in my opinion, they Oh, the biggest the farthest because they really are?
35:52
It's in the only reason for that.
Not only reason, my, the my bet for, why?
The one of the biggest contributors is People who think that way think in an infinite time Horizon and if you can play on an infinite time Horizon it's hard to beat you.
It's hard to beat an infinite player because you never went because they never stop.
36:13
I agree.
What everything to you.
You said is a very like you go.
So in depth with it and it seems like your knowledge is of infinite expansion, right?
And it's cool to hear you talk.
Say, words, you probably, you probably like hearing yourself talk with the with the head for the headphones on this trip.
36:36
I'm still like, I feel like I'm echoing first-ever podcast, you know, done with these first ever.
What do you think your biggest single trait is that is allowed you to get to the where you are now. and, You know, the first thing that came to mind, Chipotle luck.
36:54
That mean little bit of luck.
I mean, there's the luck skills and a lot of luck.
Yeah.
Why do you think I lucky was born in America?
I was born to higher SES income family.
My dad was a doctor and I was an only child.
37:10
So I got personal training from a doctor on how to human lot of people don't have that.
I I was born genetically gifted for muscle.
I put muscle on really easily.
I can tell I had a bilingual family, so French is.
37:27
My first language, English is my second language.
When you have when you're born, like I didn't pick that.
I just got that but it develops better language centers to you or you're able to take on more languages, faster more easily you have better vocabulary if you're bilingual or more, I I mean and if the average person around me was a physician than the the words that they're using our higher.
37:50
It means higher grade level in general and so like all of those things together like I think the stars were already aligned for me.
And so yeah, the single greatest thing was lock.
I already was like at the 5-yard line that's like a really that's not the answer that I would expect really from anyone.
38:11
What would you tell to people who don't have The luck which would be the majority of people, right?
Of and and know there's a lot of people and even individuals that I know of what was me, everything bad happens to me.
There's this black cloud following me.
I'm I can't be successful because of this because of where I live, because of the like what words do you tell people who have the complete opposite upbringing as you?
38:34
Well, you that want to have that want to beat be.
You will you stay in poverty until you learn all the lessons that poverty has to teach you.
And the first two words that get you out of that is my fault. and so, Even though it may be true, that you were not born in America and your parents hated you.
38:53
And you were born with one language and everything was stacked against you, as long as you keep your finger pointed outwards, to all the reasons that you can't be successful.
You will guarantee that you are not.
But until you say like well what things are under my control and the fact that I'm not doing at least those things is my fault because those are the only controllables and then just piece by piece Brick, by Brick going from there.
39:19
Damn, what an answer.
Didn't expect to get so deep on this podcaster.
Hey man, this is good, man.
Well, I don't want it, I want to kind of wrap it up because I know you're a busy man.
You got to make 800 pieces of content.
After this, you know, and why not to spend any money cooking, your food.
39:37
And I just want to say, it's been an honor to meet you man.
And again, I'm a relatively new follower of your content.
And it's a really cool to see what you've done.
What you've built is there anything like a What's next for mr.
Alex, we're going to continue mastering the mundane middle.
39:56
You know, the starts fund, the Finish is fun, but the middle is the, is the part that no one wants to do?
And that's, that's what we will do, we will do the work.
And you're going to, are you going to you going to get to the I don't want to disrespect and say the hunter Million Dollar, Man.
Obviously do you think you're going to you're going to get to the billion dollar man?
40:13
Yeah, I mean, I was like die.
I mean that's definitely awesome.
I've been fuckin AI.
Robot comes in smacks.
Dude I could die.
I mean very, I mean, but I think a lot of time Horizon like because thing is just like we're on a conservative estimate where we're probably about 100 bucks.
Now, you know, if I value the other things more than to be hard that but like conservative is about 100 bucks.
40:32
If I do nothing Over.
If I put all of that just in the SP and did nothing at 30 years from now we would be worth over a billion.
So if I do nothing will get there and so as long as I don't lose money and do something really boneheaded so it's like I can't die and I can't do something to get me 20.
40:50
So those are kind of my two big risks and so as long as I don't make bets that would get me 20 and I don't die.
I think there's a high probability that we'll get to a billion.
Wait, wait, wait, you said something there?
You said you're going to put all your money in stocks and you're going to be worth a lot more.
That's not what's happening to me.
Because I put all my money in the stocks and I have less money, but you gotta put it in now.
41:10
You gotta buy the fucking dip man is the never ending months later.
It's like, is still waiting for said that was.
You gotta buy more than them, like the dinner, like I don't have any fucking money.
There's no more tip to buy the dip keeps dipping, man.
Well, thank you so much for coming on the show.
Hopefully, my jokes didn't come off, too stupid.
41:27
And I mean, did you can deadlift more than a crane something?
All that matters.
I was my biggest takeaway.
I really can you're telling me a crane can deadlift over certain, I should do a YouTube video of you versus a crane.
It's the old John Henry story and she do it you versus a crane what I would win.
41:45
I know that's why I would be a viral video actually one more question.
Do you have your jack?
Dude, what are your?
What are your three max list?
What are your bench Squat and deadlift, Ivan, maxed out and yours.
That's someone who doesn't have a high.
Max would say, I don't know, I did 475 for 20 or 17.
So wait on what Oh deadlift, 425 for 2017.
42:04
I think I got it.
Actually.
I've tried to count the Reps in the videos a lot.
Tap and go.
Yeah, straps straps.
Yeah, okay.
You did about five reps.
That's all right.
No.
I I think I see a bench 390, I have four or five.
42:22
I'd be 45 is like so close and yeah, bench 390.
Ice water for 5 for 2405 420.
Mmm!
I was bigger though.
They're big, those legs.
They're bringing those Birkenstocks.
Yeah.
42:37
Did you spot in the Birkenstocks?
No.
No, no, no, no.
But I was bigger than I was to us to 35.
How much do you weigh now?
Like to 15 ish?
Never in my loaded, like, to be over 200 pounds because I will never in my life, Bo could totally be over dinner bones now.
42:55
I promise you, man, you see these legs?
You think, do you think the mass is going to go here?
It's not going here.
I can squat.
Squat squat 501 pounds in competition with these little fucking ham hocks, it's amazing.
The mass doesn't apply to me.
I don't gain weight well, so not eating enough, take whatever you want but you know, I had this thing where I couldn't get over 200 for a really long time.
43:16
So like, I trained for Or guess what?
I was.
I was 20 23, I've been training for eight years at that point.
And so, that was the last time I powerless when I was 181.
And I was 21, was the last powerlifting competition, I did.
And that's when I was at 181, I did, I think for, for 70ish, for Squat and deadlift, and then I benched 340 when I was 20, 20 or 21, whatever that was.
43:43
And I just, I was like, I'm a hardgainer and I looked, honestly, I looked at very similar bill.
Sounds like an excuse, right?
Yeah, it was and it was like I've been training for years.
I'm already passed on my new begins like this is all I can achieve naturally and then I read this thing by John Meadows about insulin and I was like, huh?
44:02
Okay not injecting it just like eating more carbs and so I started eating more carbs and then I started Living with a guy named Greg knuckles for familiar with him.
If you're the pilot thing was friends with Sonic right?
All right.
Okay yeah.
Break strong as shit.
44:17
Yeah.
Oh yeah, Greg's need to look for in a crane, you can.
You can deliver more than you.
He's very strong and he basically reframed, my whole thinking around a lot of stuff worth per volume.
And so he got me going on way more volume than I was used to from the powerlifting days.
44:35
And so, you know, I used to only trained pretty much like six and under, you know, really, I like anything over six is cardio, you know what I mean?
My raps.
Yeah.
There you go.
And yeah reps, right?
And so, I started training, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 s, you know, in terms.
Reps and I just blew up sounds miserable.
44:50
Oh, it's horrible.
And I started eating like a tank and eating a lot and I grew and it had been after almost a decade.
And I, you know, I was an advanced, you know, left her at that point and I competed and and, and then and then I just started doing all this volume and I never really went back to par laughing.
45:06
That's why I like those rep.
The rep ranges when I was like 17, 20, all that stuff.
That was because I just never needed to max out anymore.
I just didn't, I didn't care.
Remember like I would hit a PR and I look around at the gym.
Jim and no one gave a shit.
Now I make sure to have like a deadlift ritual.
45:22
I'd jump around and kind of go hoo-hoo.
I make sure that everyone in the gym is watch when I'm dead lifting.
That's that's good.
I've always had most of the time I've had private gyms.
So like I haven't had people around me.
So it's just been like a silent victory of myself and then I'm like you know, my name is do that.
Yeah, my hips kind of hurt and no one cares and so I just, I was like, you know what?
45:41
For me, what was more functional was looking jacked?
And so I transition like that like I remember because earlier on, I was like that.
Functional like follow Allah and all my Powers.
He buddies used to make fun of me.
So I would stay afterwards like, do delts, you know, I mean like, do my calves and stuff like that.
They'd be like she's got a good as Beachbody, you know, whatever.
45:58
But it was way more functional for me to look jacked in my life.
Every video I use it versus, you know, whether I can, you know, wait 12 weeks.
Do a shitload of joint stress and then like add another, you know, 15, 20 pounds of my dad left me to be honest.
It's kind of, I've been powerlifting for a long, long time.
And it's like, what's the point of being so strong while looking like this?
46:17
You've motivated me dude, 20:23, we're going at 200 pounds, ladies and gentlemen, could do it.
I'm gonna, I'm dead.
Fucking serious amount of the amount of food that I would have to eat is like a, it's not an enjoyable.
It sounds like you're saying is hard.
No, it versus I can't do it.
46:33
No, no, no.
I'm saying, like back in college days I would do the, you know, cup of oats milk, peanut butter, you know, olive oil, all that shit.
I mean, I don't want a fucking drink that anymore, so it's just was so getting to understand enjoyable for you, correct?
Okay.
Well, yeah.
Those other you can't do it.
Just and I would the process of going from like 175 to 200 and to look good at 200 would the process to get there?
46:55
I would hate the way I look on a daily basis.
You could do it slow. 20:24.
We're gonna I've been inspired that will wrap up this episode.
Thank you so much, man.








0:00

So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15

On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
And so if I want to To acquire skill or a trait.
0:31
I have to look at what I have to do in the certain situation and then repeat that enough times that I can say.
Hey you know what?
In these types of situations, I tend to act this way which means that I believe not a my patient or not, that I'm pretty patient.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:50
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
Yeah, one of those weird things that I kind of enjoy is that like, I walk into places looking the way I look and I get treated poorly like plenty.
1:08
And I just like, I kind of like it in a weird way because if I do a lot of business anywhere like eventually they do find out and then I like seeing like who treated me well and who didn't before that point and that's just like for whatever reasons, like a sick experiment that I like running all the time, I did one photo shoot where I was wearing a suit that I couldn't afford and that was when I was the poorest I've ever been.
1:27
It's interesting, though, because as much Such as like, I'll poopoo the the that Vibe like from Art of War, the whole idea is to look strong when you are weak and look weak when you are strong.
Like it's an art of war.
And so it's like the idea is like when you are when you were weak you want to avoid as much conflict as you can by fronting, right?
1:45
And so like there's elements that make sense to it.
I don't agree with it but honestly there's just one photo shoot the rest of my life.
I was in like t-shirt and whatever because I was the gym owner, this regard that whole food thing mostly because there was a guy that who I like sort of hired to like, Me build personal brand.
2:00
And he basically just made me into what he wanted.
Like, he thought I should look like, which is like everyone else and there's a reason I think that I never wore it again.
Like I never wear the suit again.
I hated the haircut he gave me and I was like, that's it for me.
So I think that the best way to have status is be confident.
2:18
And I think the best way to be confident is to have proof and so it makes sense that you're not confident.
If you don't have proof of why you should be confident, that means that you're not delusional.
And I think that that's a good thing, I think having being an accurate representation of where you're standing is is not bad and so I think that that gives you awareness to improve your relative standing by like working hard and stacking that proof so that when you do walk into a room you could say this is what I have done and so I don't need to beat my chest and have Privado and Charisma.
2:44
I can just say like here are the facts and you can choose to make whatever whatever decision you want off that but I will just present to you.
What is and the thing is is when you present what is there's no one who can refute that, and I think that's always a position.
I prefer to be in.
I was having a relatively heated conversation the other day.
With someone I basically was like I don't really know what you choose to believe about me.
3:05
I was like, but like here is the evidence that I have was like, so you can do what you want with that as I but you can't deny that, it just happened.
And so I think that the hardest person to convince his yourself when you're starting out.
And so, since I'd like, for me, I definitely have for sure been more insecurity driven than like, passion-driven, especially in the earlier days.
3:24
And so, if you have a lot of negative, self-talk, you want to give yourself irrefutable proof.
That you are that you have done the type of work that the type of person you want to become does.
And I think that was like, a really big key and kind of like solidifying, my identity was basing, it on the things that are facts and then like that's it, like knowing I can't refute them.
3:45
No one else can refute them.
Like, am I good at sales?
No idea.
I have done this, many of them.
So I would believe that I've done more sales than other people have.
I can state that right?
And so, like, trying to stack these bricks that no one could refute gave me a little like Most of an identity that I could build confidence off of, but it was based in reality and I think that's, that's why I hate the whole fake it till you make thing because the big disconnect that people have is when they hear me talk about the stuff, they're like, but I haven't done anything yet.
4:14
But the reality is that you need to chunk down what the things you have.
Everybody's done stuff, you've been alive for your whole life, right?
It's just that like the how you extrapolate the skill or the trade or the ability, you have to General, you trunk up one and then transfer it down.
So it's like okay I've never I told before.
4:30
But what have I done?
Well, I was prom king, or what do you do me?
Like, I was able to ask girls to go out on dates, okay?
Like, you're able to approach strangers when there's high stakes, see like, trunk up and then chunk back down into sales.
It's like, how can I transfer?
And then telling yourself and reminding yourself of the Situation's of fact that you've done something similar in nature to the new thing you want to do, is basically how you transfer The Confidence from specific to General over time.
4:57
And so over time, if you've done that, It's for its and acquired new and new skills.
Then you can level up and say I am good at acquiring skills quickly because I have done it many times, right?
And so like the more General you can apply that.
I think the more General confidence you have whereas many people and rightfully so have more like specific confidence as in like I'm really good at video games like you can see a guy who's a complete dweeb, can't talk to people can't whatever but like you put him in Call of Duty and all of a sudden you've acts like a fucking God, right?
5:23
And he has like the biggest ego and whatever.
No mind you probably need to fix that but like people have domain specific, expertise and domain-specific.
I think confidence and so I think the idea is, how do I transfer that domain-specific confidence to General confidence to multiple situations which is you do step by step.
You take that you know what, I was able to work hard at video games in terms of what I did there.
5:42
I spent five hours a day for three years, playing Call of Duty.
I'll bet you if I spent five hours a day for three years doing this that I would be as good as this as I am at Call of Duty.
So now I have a reasonable way to transfer what I did to a new skill.
5:57
And so the more times you make that transfer the Generalized, your skill set becomes and I think that then becomes the internal confidence where you can say.
Like I feel confident that I can learn this thing, do this thing because of what I have done, I think it was just introspection of like why am I confident at these things?
And not confident these other things and then I would always have the answer.
6:14
I was like, well I've done that a lot I'm like, huh?
Well, maybe if I do a lot of other stuff a lot, I'll be confident those things too.
And then, if I wasn't confident in something, then I would think.
Well, I'll bet you.
That's why I have these simple things like, will, if you do more of it, you will saw class, right?
Like Like, I love the Chinese proverb, which is that everything must be hard before, it can be easy.
6:33
It's so, just like, well and framing a lot of social situations as skills.
Even character traits and skills.
Like, how is someone patient?
Well, they do this thing, which means that if I present someone with a similar condition over and over again, and then they change their behavior, then they have become patient, which means that a trait is a skill, which means it can be learned.
6:52
And so, if I want to acquire skill or a trait, I have to look at what I have to do in the certain situation and then repeat that enough times that I can say.
Hey, you know what?
In the these types of situations, I tend to act this way which means that I believe not a my patient or not, that I'm pretty patient.
Real quick guys.
7:08
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
7:26
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And the longer I continue to act that way.
The more I'm more patient, I can say I am and have proof that I am because what I've done because what I say I would have a tough time saying, no, because fundamentally everything is human behavior, in response to conditions.
7:48
And so if there's anything skill or trade based trait, which is really just like a more generalized skill that applies to more situations, it's just stimulus-response.
And so, if we want to have a different response or basket of responses, that we need to train that responds with repeated exposure, to To the same stimulus so it's like if you want to be good at sales then you you get into situations where selling happens and you do it over and over again and you train the outcome that you want.
8:12
And if you're like wow I've never had confidence in that again you chunk down and think okay well what else what else I've done that's similar to this that I can transfer over.
Like this is where you going to the whoa of like telling yourself the story, but it's really just giving yourself the proof of what you've already done and how that applies to today.
And then that's why it's always just leveling up from the things you've done in the past.
8:28
It's like, okay, well, I built a company to 100 million before.
So how do I build one to a billion?
Well, do I know I can build it to a billion.
I'm Often.
And I can because I haven't done it yet, but I have evidence that I've done this and so I think it's reasonable to believe that.
If I do this for five times, the length of time that I could build that, okay, then that feels like a reasonable bet and I think that when I'm 70, I'll be more confident than I am now and confident said differently is just secure in who I am.
8:53
It's I think I'm significant more secure now than I was when I was 20 and it's because a I have fewer things to prove to other people because I proven more of them to myself.
And so I think that there's this great quote by Epictetus.
I love I'm going to read it cuz it's really good.
You compromise your integrity when you seek outside approval, be satisfied that you live up to your, rational principles, be your own witness if you need one, you don't need any more witnesses than that.
9:14
There's different translations of it.
But basically, if you need someone else to be your witness, it means that you sacrifice your own Integrity.
As you're saying, why can't you have enough Integrity to be your own witness of whatever the thing is, why do I need someone else's approval because they would not have nearly the context.
I have, because I lived it.
So if you're like, I am this way, and someone said, no, you're not.
9:31
There's a degree, where what evidence do they have?
What evidence do you have?
Should always have more evidence than them.
And so, like your opinion of you should always have the highest standing, but inversely most times it doesn't.
And so, I think a lot of the path of like building confidence is simply overtime, value your opinion, more than other people's, like the shoes.
9:48
I wear look, probably not fashionable.
How much do I care?
What other people think about.
The clothing that I wear that they have, they're not wearing it.
Why do they care?
What I wear?
This is great for heat.
I don't sweat as much.
They're waterproof, I can go to a water park and then I go to a restaurant and I can work out.
10:04
Out on the same thing.
Minimizes the drag on my life, like cool.
So people like that, looks really weird.
Am I couldnt don't wear it, wear whatever you want to wear.
I don't care what you wear, right?
And so, a lot of times, it's like deflecting people's judgments on you that they don't that.
Why would I care?
Like, what weight does their opinion have on my life at all?
10:20
Besides that they have one?
So early days, people like I would never live my life, like, you live your life and I'm like, good.
Why are you sharing that with?
Like, a lot of times people just make noise at their faces and it does, it has no impact on your life.
Like, I'm going to change my behavior in, no way, which if people say things to you and you don't like what they're A question is, is there elements of Truth to what they're saying?
10:37
If there is fix it, if there isn't then learn nothing from it.
Because like some learning is the wrong learning, like you're taking the wrong lesson from your mom who says, you should stay home?
Should I?
I don't know if I change my behavior.
It means I learned from what she said, in one way or another.
Now, if I might learn in the marble floor, right?
10:53
But just thinking through that, and I think the biggest thing with, at least for me, it's just been continuing to try and value my own opinion more than a fictitious or arbitrary.
Third party that doesn't even Even exist.
And usually it's one, two, three, voices, that that I play over and over, in my head.
11:09
And those people don't even know that I'm playing their voice in my head and then wondering and asking myself.
Do I want this fictitious version of this person's voice to be the main thing that directs my life that gives a lot of power to this person and then I ask myself.
Do I want that person of power of my life and then usually, the answer is no.
11:24
And I'm like, who would I prefer to have power over my life and then usually it's me and so, then it continually, like, Brick by Brick.
Keep continue to build the identity of who of the type of man I want to listen to Try and act in accordance with you, I think that guy would do.
And then if I have enough evidence eventually, the idea of who I want to be and who I am start merging.
11:41
And eventually the same person, I do not as many and they're quieter, like, they're there.
But they don't hit me as hard.
They don't weigh down as much and I think a more aware.
I'm like, huh, that makes me think this again, I go through the same exercise of like, does that person really think that a do, I really care what they think?
11:56
Be do, I want to give that person the same power over my life that I give to myself?
No, okay.
So it's like these bombs that have gotten faster and faster defusing So I can keep living the life that I want to live.
I think one last thing is like I think about this a lot which is like 85 year old version of me, right.
I mean I think about a lot of frames a lot, one of them is that none of it's going to matter but the other frame is like 85 year old meat doesn't care about a lot of shit and so I'm like man if that guy can not care about a lot of shit and it's the same person.
12:21
Why can't I just start living that way now and so old people don't give a shit if they're wearing fucking comfortable sneakers.
Like, at what point did they go from?
Like, you know what, I'm going to wear these fashion.
He whatever things too.
I'm going to wear these New Balance its right.
Where does that happen?
And I think there's degrees of like just being okay with you, that allows people to make that shift and I think a lot of people really envious, like there's good old people and there's nasty old people, but like I think like, I would like to be a nice old person and I think that they're really like, Jolly and easygoing and I think self accepting and I think that's like, I think about that guy all the time and when I have these stressors, or I had these insecurities, I think like, what would that guy think right now?
12:59
And that guy usually has very good answers, which is kind of weird because it means that you have these answers inside of yourself.
But you, Just choose not to listen to them.
And so I think he's just making that voice louder while you make the other voices, quieter.
And think you do.
I care about my 85 year, old self opinion of me or be fictitious opinion of this rival that I have right now and then always remembering that the person with the longest time Rising winds, because there are people who are ahead of me now who on a longer time Horizon.
13:23
It doesn't matter and then on the longest time Horizon not of matters but that has helped me decrease.
The pressure in my life, which I think is a lot of me to make better decisions, which I think ultimately, you know, allows me to do the things.
More of the things that I want to do rather than more of the things that I think other people want me to do.








0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
0:24
It means the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world with someone else.
No amount of money in the world.
World will satisfy you and that is what's going to unlock, your ability to become greater, and for you to build your business.
To something that is much greater than yourself, the wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
0:42
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to build an acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to bring her business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to under million dollars from the odd.
I hope you share and enjoy.
What I wanted to talk about today was Eye of the Tiger, so I just had our like a 3-day Master.
1:01
My type thing with the top sellers.
So, two of The Three Gems, who came here were over seven figures and the other one is gonna probably hit it within the next three months.
So it's really, it was great because it's really higher-level conversation and I like, typically have with a much worse was just fun.
And what we talked about was, kind of more and more pissed, but I think it's incredibly valuable and I think it's probably the one thing that sets apart, the guys who are really winners / cows, who are really winners and the ones who are in, It's really just around hunger.
1:28
And what I mean by that is some of our older OG gym or it's been a while, you know, I mean, they turn their gym around, they bro, there at, you know, close to seven figures or right around there.
And they've been doing it for a while, and they were complaining about show, right?
So hey, our showrooms are low, you know, you go through this in while you're doing the reminders, you don't listen Paul.
1:45
Yeah, we're doing all this up.
Okay, cool.
And I did a little bit deeper and I look, and it turns out that they're only open one hour per day.
At 7:15 a.m. availability for new clients.
And I'm like, how the fuck do you think that you're going to grow your business?
If the only time that you can take new customers?
2:01
Is that 7:15 a.m. in what world does that make sense, right?
Like imagine a grocery store that's only open from 7:00 to 7:30 because that's when it's convenient for the owner.
What chance do you think that that grocery store has at succeeding, virtually none.
And so what happens is, people have success.
2:18
They Implement tactics, they use Jim wants and then they make money, right?
And then what happens it, comfortable, they get complacent, right?
They lose their hunger after that point.
After you, like, quote made it in your mind and that's what's funny is that making in some people's mind is like having ten Grand in the bank account.
2:34
So, like, it's scary in terms of what level of making it is.
But like, once people have made it, I almost want to say, like, none of these tactics matter, because you're just not hungry.
Look, it doesn't matter.
Like the obvious shit you aren't doing, you know what I mean?
I like, I'm trying to like wrap my head around it.
2:49
Like, if your if your child was going to die or your spouse or your significant other, your family member, whatever it was right, it was Was going to die unless you succeeded unless you've got more clients unless you made more money with your gym.
How would you approach it right?
Would you only be available for one hour a day?
3:06
Would you only be available from 7 to 8 a.m. right?
Would you only set aside an hour a day to prospect for new customers?
Would you only reach out to your existing customers if they hadn't shown up for a month?
Like, sometimes people ask questions that they already know the answer to, it's like duh no shit, right?
3:22
And it goes by the main thing, which is like, what drives you Brother, what drives you, what drives you to be better, what drives you to continue to want to win?
It'll, I was asked that question yesterday by the generous ever here, and I think, honestly, it comes from a dark place and I think I've said this before, but like, I'm saying it again, because I think people need to hear it.
3:41
Sometimes you have to wonder, like, why is it that only win someone else's life is on the line, right?
Do you then actually try like why is it only then you actually cut all the noise out of your life and then would go laser focused on Really succeed.
Why can't we do that all the time?
3:59
Really?
Why can't we do that?
Because it's a world that I wouldn't be happy whatever right there, like whatever happiness means.
Right.
And so the people who are the most successful in the world are driven by something that is deep inside of them.
That is normally an insecurity or fear of some sort.
If you are only trying to make enough to live on, you will always only make enough to live on and you will slack.
4:21
The moment you get comfortable and you will wonder, why is it that as soon as I Start making money.
I stopped because you actually don't want to make more.
That's why you actually don't want to make more.
And so your internal motivation is not there like because you've accomplished what you set out to accomplish.
4:39
And so the real question is do you actually want what you claim to want?
Do you actually want it?
Because if you did you'd already have it, you'd already be willing to sacrifice other things in order to achieve it.
And that might mean like maybe waking up earlier maybe you like working for to 8 p.m. to take sales appointments or whatever that thing is.
4:56
Is right?
It's just the obvious shit.
Like, if you were coaching you, what would you recommend you to do, right?
Like a lot of times, if you think about, like you most of the time, know what to do like you do on some level, like you probably know that you're like, man, I do stupid shit sometimes, right?
5:12
You probably think that on some level sometimes, right?
Then you like men, if I were, if you could step out of yourself and say I need to coach myself, you probably have the answer, right?
And it's just that you don't do it for some reason.
And so all of your attention should be on that reason.
5:29
Why is it that this thing is preventing me from doing the things that I already know I should do right?
Most like this last semester that I had served the, for the top sellers was really interesting for it because it was the first time that I had no one who had extra shit.
I didn't have any, like, everyone.
There had really like clean lives outside like really focused and just focused on doing the things that were going to run the business.
5:49
And so the conversation directly really easy and very direct most times it's like, okay.
Okay, well, here's the obvious hole in your business but you're not doing anything about it.
So let's attack why you're not doing anything about right?
And so then I have to spend the next hour and a half digging into why they're not doing anything about it.
6:08
Which has much more to do with, how they manage their head space and how they manage their relationships and how they manage their, you know, because what ends up happening, is they start focusing on the business, the personal life goes to shambles and then they then are like, oh my gosh, my personal life is going to shambles, I need to stop paying attention my business.
6:24
They go to pay attention to personal life and Jim explodes, right?
This is the this consistent cycle because they just don't know how to just do both right or they don't know how to prioritize.
And so all this to say, like it's just like hungry, are you like how willing are you to put in what you need to achieve like and if you're not, then that's cool.
6:43
Then just to stop stop saying you want.
Yeah.
I mean, just be like, I only want to make ten thousand dollars.
What that's it.
It's like cool.
Then just say that and be good with it rather than constantly complaining about how you're not because you're not even willing to To do the things that that you already know.
You should do it like, like, right now.
7:00
I get on the phone with Jim and Ursula, like I know I should work.
My leads harder, I know, I should go through the sales trainings more.
Like I know, I should, you know, go through the portal.
I know I should, I know I should meet with my team or I know I should format.
Like, then, why aren't you?
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
7:21
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Why aren't you like I know, like, I know you have time because other people have Simon had the same business as you so you have some time.
7:38
So why aren't you?
It's like what?
Like because once you have the tactics, right?
And this is one of the biggest, the freeing and also most soul-crushing parts of Jim lunch is that once a janitor joins, Jim watch, you know, how to make a seven-figure jet, you know how to do it.
And so then it reflects back on to you, it's like, oh shit.
7:54
I'm the reason that we're not there and you have to swallow that red because up until they go to gym, lot of people been doing it for five years or seven years, eight years.
And they're like, I don't know.
Oh how and then once they see how then they're like oh shit.
I'm not sure if I'm willing to do that.
It's like cool now, but if they know that there is no secret, there is no hack.
8:10
It's literally like a microphone was he uses the term?
Chopping wood?
Like I call doing the boring work is like chopping wood.
It's reps is day in day out.
You got to reach out to people, right?
You gotta give great service, right?
The handwritten cards like remind people to weigh in.
You have to work the leads.
8:26
When the person comes in the door, you have to be enthusiastic, got a green with a smile, you have to ask the same questions over and over and over.
Over again because to that person is the first time they've ever heard right?
And it doesn't matter if the hundredth time that month, you asked the same questions that person to that person, stay warm.
8:43
And so, if you were trying to be successful, do you think that only had an availability for sales appointments, at 7:15 to 7:45 in the morning?
Once a day, it's going to get you the optimal outcome.
Do you need a coach to tell you that really you know what I mean?
Like really or there was another one that's all there was like between 9 a.m. and eliminate that was their availability.
8:59
Hmm.
Good luck with that.
That's when that's when the people who have the most money are available, right?
I do a lot during the week.
So like we know what to do, right?
Anyone who's in our world like you know what to do?
It's just you have to figure out why you're not doing it, right?
And then tack that because the tactics aren't the thing in, right?
9:16
The tactics are there, you can read a book and give it away for free, right?
Like you can do that, like, figure out why you're not hungry, figure out why you're not like, why you're not trying.
They just figure it out.
Like there might be something inside meeting don't.
Wow.
And like, you need to discover that.
It's like, okay, then, like, don't know but like If you claim to want more and yet you can't do what's necessary to get more than that's where your attention should go.
9:38
And you should figure that out because otherwise it doesn't matter what tactics there are, you're just not going to do them anyways.
So what's the point?
So anyways it was incredibly refreshing to have the three guys who are out here.
We had attorney microphones about those guys have been over you know some figures when rates for a while and doing really really well para Stafford.
9:56
Just started inside of three hundreds of people in its first six weeks.
I did like eighty thousand dollars and something sales and six weeks.
It's pretty cool.
So any of those guys were just like what do I need to do?
Like because they like their clear ice, you know, toes forward know exactly what to do.
And I was like, why is it that these meetings are so much easier than some of the other means I had.
10:15
And so we've probably spent a little bit of the day kind of digging that.
It's just a question of how about you want it?
I really think that's it and like, figuring out why you're not doing, what you already know you should do in order to achieve it.
Like do you need to go pay someone a bunch of money in order to then get motivated?
You know, like hopefully your kid doesn't need to be kidnapped in order for you to get motivated.
10:32
Your business, it seems like, what, what is that thing for me?
It's just fear.
It's just fear and insecurity fear failing, fear of, not being good enough, fear of people, who hated to be right.
You know what I mean?
That's what my fear and so I did just like that.
So drives me.
It's not about money because like it couldn't have been about money.
10:47
So I don't need any more for the rest of my life, like at all.
So I guess it can't be about that.
But if it is like about that for you and you feel like when you make your first twenty thousand dollar take home with you first $40, I'll take them months.
The first fifty thousand, hundred thousand dollar check from lunch.
The first time you hit that like if that's where you're like, oh and you feel this?
Big sigh of relief.
11:03
Then your motivation is not coming from the right place.
And so I'm telling you straight up.
If you feel relief, when you make a lot of money, when month, your motivation is not coming from the place of a champion, if you want to be the best in the world at something, that's not going to do anything for you.
You shouldn't feel anything from them.
What do you feel?
You feel nothing.
Really because it's not about that.
11:19
It's an output from internal efforts and should be focused more on the internal efforts at all of the deficiencies that you probably had in still hitting 100 K.
It's like, oh my gosh, if we hadn't done this, this and this, you would have been less, right?
And if we had done this in this, Would have been more like, that's what you're focusing on, and you're only focusing on those things.
11:37
If you can do that, then you'll be able to unlock something inside of you that's look stronger than what might currently be driving.
Anyways, guys have an amazing day and I will catch you guys soon.
Hopefully, that was viable for somebody who is on the fence, who's like not sure about why they can't achieve what they want, why they can't be consistent because your motivation is not coming from right place, right?
11:55
You're just trying to make enough money to live on and the moment you make enough money, you stop working and then you wait for things to blow up again until you Try her again.
It's like it's not how many times.
All right.
I'm going on.
S little ramp.
How many times have you needed to make money?
And then immediately made the amount of money that you need it in like a day in like a weight's, right?
12:15
Need to make payroll, I got to make 10 grand the next three days.
Howdy how many times has that happened to you and you always make it work.
Why?
Because you already know what the fuck to do, right?
You just choose not to do it.
You choose not to do it.
You choose not to make money when you know how to make money because when if you need to make money you make and so that's what you have to attack.
12:32
You have to figure out why when you already know how to make money, you don't do it.
That is the the summary of this, entire this entire talk, that was trying to get out of myself as like you already know how to do it when you need to do it, you do do it.
So why aren't you doing?
That is what you need to focus on.
12:47
And if you can conquer that piece, no amount of money in the world will satisfy you.
And that is what's going to unlock, your ability to become greater, and for you to build your business.
To something that is much greater than yourself, because if the only thing that you want to satisfy is you you're going to see this fall.
It's a your see this big because it satisfy a single person or a single family, doesn't mean a lot, right?
13:09
But if you want to satisfy Community, you want to satisfy State, you must satisfy Nation.
You must satisfy entire group of people.
It has to be bigger than you.
So is hopefully that my resonated with somebody.
If it didn't, then I apologize for the extra aggressive.

What's the millionaire morning routine?
A lot of people ask these questions.
If you look on YouTube Instagram, Tick-Tock so-and-so's morning routine, the five things.
So and so does the moment he wakes up, they think that there's some magic pill or some super five-step thing that's going to somehow get them to do the work at the very end of this video.
I'll give you my morning routine, everything that I do between when I wake up and when I work, we have to Define what productivity even means.
0:21
Productivity is getting more done per unit of time, people who move faster in life, don't actually move faster, they get more done per unit of time.
I this guy reach out to me, he's like dude I got this coach each other.
Me doing like morning walks red lights on and I do a cold plunge and I did my gratitude Journal.
He's like by the time I'm done my morning routine is like 11:00 a.m.
0:36
I was like do you think you'd be more productive if you just Prospect it or three hours a day is like?
Yeah probably and I was like, doesn't sound very productive?
What's interesting is that people approach the problem of the fact that they're not getting enough done per unit of time and they think that I should add more things that are not getting things done, did become more productive per unit time that doesn't make sense, right?
0:53
Why do people not think that way because people don't Define the terms that they use.
But if you Define productivity, as the amount of work you do per unit of time, Probably would stop doing a lot of the things that you're doing that aren't work.
When people give you their advice for how to become a productive.
Think, is this adding things that are not work to my calendar of the work that I'm doing?
1:11
How much leverage am I getting from that work?
So I can multiply even further the work that I do.
You order your tasks in order of the leverage that they have.
The definition of Leverage is you get more output per unit of input by do a little bit and I get a lot.
I have a lot of Leverage, you simply have some things that you get more money per period of time and less money per period of Time that's it.
1:30
What are the tasks that get us the most output?
For example I could make sales calls that is going to be a one to one input of like I'm do this effort and I get sales out of it with that same level of effort.
If I could go recruit A salesperson, which would take me a finite period of time and then that person replaces that my ongoing support for that person, it's going to be 23 hours a week.
1:49
So I gained back 20 hours a week of prospecting in exchange for 2 to 3 hours a week, plus money.
And so, the act of Entrepreneurship is simply consistently, making these trades of, what can I buy my time back with even to the point?
Where An entire company leading to one person and that person talks to you.
If we were to try and think of like the perfect morning routine, we should think about the reverse of that, which is, what's the worst morning routine.
2:08
How can I create a morning routine that would make me the least effective one?
I'll make it long as humanly possible.
Number two, I'd have lots of steps and processes involved so that I could use up lots of mental energy before I could even start.
Working number three, is that I would become very, very reliant on that thing.
2:24
If I don't get this one thing in that it means I cannot work.
You have to make your bed in order to become a millionaire.
The problem with that is that That we're separating fact from psychology.
If I make making my bed mean that I'm going to do the things that I said I'm going to do then it's super productive but it's not the making the bed.
2:42
That's the thing that's important.
It's the fact that I'm committed to doing the things that I said I'm going to do gurus will get on this Superstition around these things that they do but not describe the meaning that they've ascribed to the thing.
Oh, I do this thing to establish discipline, then it's not the thing, it's the discipline in which case you could replace the thing with any other thing, or you could just tell yourself This money, don't need to prove it to yourself.
3:01
The easiest way to disprove something is to say, let me find an instance where this doesn't exist and I still have the outcome.
That's how you describe something in like science.
If there's a millionaire morning routine, then it would have to be the same thing that all millionaires.
Do you have to wake up early?
Tell you right now?
Plenty of millionaires, don't wake up early, you have to have seven streams of income.
3:17
All I have to do is find one person who does have seven streams of income to show you.
That, that's not true.
Do you have to do real estate in order to me later?
No, you have to be in software.
You have to be in web free.
By the way, buddy, doing 70 million a year with janitorial services A big buildings boring as shit.
The anti routine concept came from the fact that I get asked by so many fucking people what my routine was because I thought there was some magic pill of how I got stuff done besides getting stuff, done that somehow is going to make them confront.
3:42
The fact that they're not working because they don't want to work.
You don't need to create some magical morning routine where you sing a flute, natural dance outside and seeing the rain and the journals and all the other shit, like, there's work to be done.
And the question is, how quickly can I begin that work?
That's it.
The perfect routine would be you wake up and you immediately work with you.
3:58
Train yourself to be able to do it if You are one of these people who has a 90-minute morning routine before you start working, try waking up and walking straight over to Begin work, don't even check your phone.
Most people spend most of their time doing shit, that doesn't matter and for the people were going to say isn't the morning routine kinda like a warm-up before workout aren't you like need to prepare yourself before you start working.
4:18
How long do you really need to warm up your brain?
Do you think that your ability to warm up your brain is trainable because if it's trainable than your routine should shrink, and your number of hours of work should increase, it is we were like, I get more done if I have them.
Running routine.
Cool.
See if you can just compress the morning routine to take less time of the ten things you do remove one.
4:35
See how you do remove to see how you do.
The fundamental equation of productivity, how much you do X?
How much leverage you have on the stuff you do.
If we're defining those things is the equation for productivity.
Then the perfect morning routine should be one that maximizes.
The volume of work you do and The Leverage that you create from the volume.
4:52
And so for me that looks like waking up having a cup of coffee and getting to work and then ordering my day in the The order in which I have the highest leverage activities to the lowest leverage activity.
The order in which I have the highest leverage activities to the lowest leverage activity.








0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn-out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show and everybody happy Friday, man, I was fired up this morning because one of my team, brought something up and it just made me think I was like, you know what, I went on a rant and they're I mean, we should have reported that their sales like, you know what, I'm getting this call right now and I'll go make the content so what to do when someone bashes you so inevitably you will get bashed if you are good, right?
0:48
So I like to always think to myself and this is something that gives me.
Peace.
Is that like whether you were believer or not, whatever.
But like if you think of Jesus Christ as a good dude, right?
Or hopefully, you know some of you guys say goodbye like I'm good, dude.
He was literally like stoned mosque and crucified for being a good dude.
1:07
And so at the end of the day, you're always going to have people who are going to stand up against you.
And the question is not, whether it's going to happen, but how you're going to respond a and then B, who are those people, right?
So for me, it's like, if I've got some like, fig booze and agencies or whatever, we were like, standing up against us and I know that, like, based on like their experience, their over, Promising and you're not delivering what they say they're going to do.
1:34
Like I'm cool with that.
Like I hope to piss some people off because some of the stuff we say is pretty out there, right?
And so I had this um this is recently just a funny story.
There's a guy who self-proclaimed Fitness Guru and his wife signed up for our program and I found out and I was like, Hey listen, you know, You can't really use like, sign up for our stuff.
2:03
I didn't know that you guys were connected, and anyways, I ended up recording the call.
And so I had his wife in tears, on the phone crying about how their gym is going to close, because they can't pay bills.
They're going to lose the house all sorts of stuff, right?
2:20
And so I was like, you know what, what would Jesus do?
And I was like, well, you'd be wise but I was like, you know what?
And the guy was like this in your in a totally different like different leaking meal.
Like, we're just, you know, I just do this on the side just to pay some bills.
Like like it's not, it's not the same.
2:37
No, I was like, alright, man.
And his wife, like, please, please like, I really need this and so I was like, sure you guys can stay and so fast forward, six months, you know, they execute joint Legacy, right?
And then and then they start going out and bashing me, right?
2:56
And so, you know, at first you think like, wow, like Like the nerve, right?
Especially when I got like, literally full text conversations about them looking like, oh my God, you secret gym, like we can play payroll be purebred or so grateful, right?
And then like three kicks it, right?
3:13
And so, like first person to blame is me because I already kind of knew it when I saw when I say, okay, right.
But, you know, there's this, there's this balance point of like why do you do this to help people?
And so that's on me first off.
But the other thing is like, what do you do, right?
3:30
And so I was told My team this morning I was like for the rest of the Year.
This guy is going to try and Bash us because like we're in the spotlight and so the only thing you can do is try and gain trying to bask in reflected Glory, right?
Like trying like capture a little droplets that sprays off the main thing and for you guys in your Marketplace.
3:50
A lot of times you're in that same situation, you're getting all the attention because you're crushing, right?
Because you're blowing up right now because of all the stuff they were, you know, that you're doing and so it's natural.
For other gyms their people to start posture against you like Pepsi bashes Coke.
4:07
You don't have mean Coke is way bigger and has never acknowledged Pepsi right?
But Pepsi by brand will put Coke on their advertisements to try and Patch them strategically, that's when you're supposed to do, right, until you're bigger and then you don't mention it.
Like, that's the game.
4:22
Apple bash PC until Apple got bigger than PC, and then stop action.
That's the game, right?
And so if you get good at stuff, you can't get.
But hurt by the fact that people are going to bash you.
It's just part of the game, right?
And so the only so that my son is my team and then and like at the end of the day kind of revert back to other gu, right?
4:44
I was like he's gonna put it at all.
This concert for the next however, long the end of the day.
We know this product is shit because he had to come to us to save his acts weird.
You know that right Rudy know that.
So we know he's got nothing right?
It's always going to do is over promise and under deliver just like Everyone else, right?
5:03
And so maybe he'll hustled his ass off, and have to go super one-on-one, like, I'm going to call you every week relationship for coaching, giving you wrong advice, and really just becoming a therapist for you, which is what most of the fitness industry coaching, is anything is right?
Because I don't have a product, they will have something actually solve the problem, man.
5:19
I'm going off today.
I'm sorry, but but he's going to work his whole his whole year to get 15 people to panic last month.
I was like dogs.
We set up 25 people.
This week, who cares, you know, I mean, like, we're so much bigger than everyone else and it's because we're focusing, and I'm imploring you to do the same thing.
5:40
It's just focus on your customers, focus on solving their problems.
And the thing is, is if you focus on them, you don't have time to think about that stuff.
Hey, most addition quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
5:57
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
You just don't everyone else is thinking about you because you're stealing their lunch money, right?
6:16
But all the grooves right now, it's either.
They're copying us, if they're smart, or they're bashing us, if they're done, right?
Because if you're copying us, at least you're copying the thing.
That's working your second because now you're copying the leader but at least the stuff that you're doing producing a result because we did the work to figure it out, right?
6:34
But if you're if you're bashing this, you're just aligning yourself with soul live, like it's their stuff doesn't work.
You can't say that, but we're killing James when I'm just like posting a video every single gym.
That's triple 3 ft, right?
Like, I made that video the other day, just to, like, just say for all up, just for anyone who's curious, but the gym owners, who are like just new to this group in her life, what is this all about?
6:57
I just wanted to post that there to be like you're in good hands like you're fine but I can understand how it's confusing to you get lots of voices.
You don't know who to trust, right?
Because like, I don't flex really hard about a bigger we are than anywhere else I got.
I don't flexor Ricardo Flex our house.
I don't like my bank account like I don't do that because like it's just not my thing, you remain.
7:17
But like to give you an idea, like most the guys who are bashing us are doing quarter million a year, we do a quarter million in two days.
You know what I mean?
Like, it's a rough, its its size its scope here.
You know what I mean?
7:32
And so like, like that acquisition model doesn't work.
It's like, well, then how are we out acquiring customers and u21, right.
How are our customers bashing your customers, like in a marketplace, right?
So anyways, just to wrap this up for anyone, who's a gym owner, if you have trainers who leave you or clients, who leave you and then bash, you keep focusing on your customers, keep over, delivering value key.
7:56
Keep just focus on solving their problems with everything else.
Will always take care of itself, right?
Well, if Jesus was focused on his mission, he was like, I'm Gonna Save the World like, that's what I'ma Do.
He wasn't like, man, Pasha pilot.
Like, I'm coming after you.
Like he didn't say that because he didn't need to because like, I'm God, right?
8:13
Or if you don't believe, you know, like I'm a great dude, but everyone to get into that.
But like coin is, is like If you're, if you're being good and you're and you're impacting the marketplace, it means you're making noise.
People will notice.
And invariably, if you think there are assholes in the marketplace, there are you think there are liars in your Marketplace?
8:33
Absolutely.
So the why would we be surprised if they would stand up in fashion, right?
The only thing you should do take care of your customers.
And if you want postings reproof, that's not specifically bashing.
Like, I put that EFT thing up there.
Just so that anyone who's unsure, like, just because I get it so you guys don't know like just go watch the video.
8:52
I'm like watch 200 other Jim say they tripled their eft-1 from 2001 to 30,000 right?
Like you running like just with the proof talk you know someone's got 33 testimonials and they're all two years old maybe they're not the best choice, right?
9:11
You've hurt me like, someone's someone's, charging me for one-on-one coaching and they're talking to you about.
How they're going to leverage and scale their business and yet their business isn't leverage for scaled.
Right.
So anyways, guys, that's my, that's my Friday message to everyone is like, don't worry if you're getting bashed, it is normal.
9:35
If you're getting bashed, if you're doing good things, and you're impacting the marketplace, and the only thing to fight that emotionally, it's just go all in on our customers and continue to look at their problems and not your own, and when you solve their problems, and don't think about yourself because all that really is is when you like get upset about, it's like, you think about yourself and you go flares up your like how dare they procure them?
9:56
Do you know who I am?
You know me.
Like, that's all that plays in your head.
Like you so much better but whatever you do.
I mean, like, just focus on your customers, focus on their problems and you can, then you'll forget about your own.
And then, what do you know, you'll outsell your upper body and your just keep growing and keep crushing it?
10:12
Well, everyone else is spending all their time, trying to posture against you.
All you're doing is just going on in your customers and crushing with.
So, anyways, guys have an amazing day who longer than normal, but hope you haven't had an amazing week so far.
If you are a gym and you have not signed up for too much, you should do that unless you hate money, which case don't do that and you guys could we're sharing like little videos on Instagram and we'll sales overcomes stuff like that.
10:39
I'm trying to build that up.
It's embarrassing.
But I kind of like that every day beginning, you know, 30 40 people.
It's kind of fun, kind of reminds me of that of the struggle.
So if you guys go there it's at under I'll tag but Alex foremost.
If you search, it will come up.
10:54
There's lots of guys.
Have an amazing day that you soon.









0:00
I feel like I fundamentally a lot of times don't understand the world and so I think the reason that some people have found the content and things like that, good or useful is because they feel like they can understand it.
It's just because like I didn't get it right?
And so I just make an attempt to define the terms that a lot of us use every day and then it makes a lot easier to solve for those things in business.
0:21
Welcome to the game.
Where we talk about a get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I spend several hours consuming all of your content across multiple channels.
0:37
What is the aim?
What is the mission?
What is the the intent if you were to try and summarize the content you're producing and the value you're trying to add and to who you trying to add it to.
To make business accessible for everyone that was the mission of the company.
0:57
And so our whole idea was We'll put everything out there for free, so no pay walls.
So there's like, we have courses on the site.
The books I have for 99 cents so that anyone can get them and, you know, continue to produce as much as we can and we share the learnings that we have from our portfolio companies in order to keep the stuff that we are putting out there relevant, new fresh Cutting Edge, because this is what's working today.
1:24
And by doing that, it also brings other companies to us because they get value from the stuff.
And our goal is always to hopefully provide more value to a company before they ever spoken to us like kind of pay for ourselves in advance.
Is kind of like the thought process even though we're buying it.
1:41
And that's that was kind of the thesis when we started it.
I didn't know it was going to work but it seems to have gone pretty well.
And it was just kind of just like if we just give and keep giving and keep giving we just focus on the value and delivering to the audience, it'll come back eventually.
1:59
What are you giving them and Who you giving it to.
Entrepreneurs at all stages.
We've surveyed the audience. 25% of the audience has a business 75%.
Is not have a business but wants to start a business and so that's just kind of overall.
And then within that 25%, it just kind of categories all the way up to you know, business is doing 100 plus a year and so it's everyone and so we try and are one of the things that we talked about is like going wide.
2:22
And deep is like, how can we figure something that is relevant to somebody who's, you know, launching their first product and also make it accessible or interesting to somebody who's launching a new product line.
Within a division of their conglomerate and just trying to think about both people at the same time, which becomes more challenging, but it's also kind of fun, kind of like a funnel, isn't it in some respects?
2:42
That's exactly what I saw from your content Europe.
You're making great content.
That's helping people that are at the start of their Journey or you know, 100 please deep into their Journey, trying to figure out how to scale your making content.
That's Bringing down some of the barriers where the psychological practical to enable them to reach.
3:00
Whatever, do you may have.
Let's go way Upstream then.
What do I need to know about you to understand the life?
You've LED take me way back to your childhood and early contact.
Both parents are immigrants to the US.
Mother was born in France, came here, but father was born in Iran.
3:19
They met in medical school in Europe.
And then my mother brought him back with her to the US.
And then they had me.
And they split, my mom had a lot of demons, had a lot of things she struggled with when I was coming up.
3:34
So I pretty much was raised by, my dad had no siblings.
It was just me and my dad for until I was about 15.
He got remarried.
It was a short stint in terms of how long I was like, kind of in the house.
You know, like right at that stage is when you can drive and I was kind of on my own almost that point soon as I could work and drive, I was kind of out of the house.
3:54
And then, from there, Did the thing that most people try to do which is I worked hard at school most because I just didn't want my dad to be upset with me, which was the main driver for most of my achievement of my career.
For the first half, was all just trying to gain his approval.
4:12
Did all the things that I thought he would want me to got a job at a Government Contracting consulting.
Firm defense, Contracting is space, cyber and is are so, it's intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance for the military sounded.
Cool was less cool when you were in it and I was very, very sad at that point in my life.
4:35
And so it was very much like, I didn't, I always hoped, I wouldn't wake up the next day and it was truly, you really mean that 100% 100% because I remember when I was looking at a lot of people have like rock top moments, sorry, Rock Bottom moments.
4:52
I think I had more of a rock top moment, which was I was 22.
I had done everything that my dad had wanted me to do at this point.
I was looking out from the condo that I had been able to buy with this job that I had and I was like, is this it?
5:08
And the whole time I just really didn't enjoy my life and it was just, you know, not wanting to wake up and it was The decision to.
Leave Baltimore, which is where I was from to quit that path.
5:28
To decide to start a business of my own was still to this day.
The hardest thing I've ever done by far all the things we've been through to build.
We have the hardest decision was taken a leap for me anyways, because like I knew that my dad so much wanted me to do what I was doing because he was so happy that I was doing everything you wanted me to do at that point.
5:50
And I had told him over and over again that I wanted to do this other stuff.
And he's like, yeah.
Are you later?
You know, it later.
And so I knew that it would probably put a big dent in our relationship, if I left, but for me, it was actually confronting the fact that I didn't want to be alive anymore, which was the thing that gave me enough courage, or do you want to call it to actually make the decision to leave home?
6:16
And so, I started driving across the country.
I mean, it took me six months to do this, like when I'm between, when I decided, I really wanted to do this and when I actually Did it took me six months?
And I called him when I was like halfway across the United States and was like, I'm going to California.
I'm gonna open a gym.
6:32
I'm going to get into fitness, and he was like, why are you so extremely like lost it?
And then we didn't really talk much for a long time when you started.
Realizing that your life was one way, you didn't want to wake up in the morning when you had that job in management consultancy.
6:50
Mhm.
Did you experience suicidal?
Ideation, is that what you're saying when you say, I don't want to, I didn't want to wake up into my life every day.
It was never like, I've never had a like, this is how I'd kill myself.
Nope, never had that.
I just always liked the idea that I could not wake up the next day.
7:05
Sounded good.
When you look back in hindsight from that moment backwards, what are the series of decisions or the things that led you to find yourself in the position.
And I ask that because there's a lot of people that can probably relate and and there's probably quite a consistent set of frog pads or stones that one has walking down for whatever reason that lead you to a position.
7:30
We go.
What the fuck whose life is this?
I think they'll like the one-line summary for me, was there, like, I felt like, I I had to let my dad's dream die for mine to live and I felt like my entire life had always up to that point had been like go to the school, do these studies I mean it's a common thing like it's not like I had something that a lot of people don't have many people and to be fair, I'm very grateful for the skills.
7:54
Discipline etcetera that that instilled in me because I think you you you have the hard hand of an authoritarian parent when you're growing up and it teaches you a lot of skills.
And then you know, the flip side is if you have a very less Affair parent, like you never learned the Bills, which then benefit you later, so you know, who knows?
8:12
But for me, I knew that he just wanted me to be a doctor.
That's what he was.
That would have been his dream.
I went to school as pre-med and then I, it was like even changing my degree from pre-med to just a business degree was like a huge deal but he was okay with that.
8:30
As long as I follow, like the business path.
And so when I did my two years of consulting, which is kind of the typical like two to four years, you do Consulting, and then you apply to go to Business School.
Cool.
When I was going through that process, I was answering the question for like the Harvard MBA and was like, how will Harvard MBA, help your short and long-term goals, and I sat there for like two days trying to answer the question and I was like it just isn't I want to start a business and so that was when I kept trying to, you know, start that conversation with my dad and it just wasn't really happening and so that's what that was kind of the breaking point for me was I just felt terrible about my life and I didn't didn't like the way it was going and For me, it was such a key point because the biggest line of reasoning I had for myself in order to convince myself to confront my father or at least disappoint my father, or the version of myself that he wanted me to be, was to say, the, like, I have to be comfortable dying in his eyes.
9:20
And a lot of people would like, and many people might think that was hyperbole, but for me, it was very true.
Like, I knew that I would die in his eyes and I did to give you context.
So I had the gyms and I opened up multiple after that.
9:37
Got to about six locations, sold those starter Jim Turner.
A business did that for two years all the while we weren't really in, you know, we were like, okay, in touch.
And then we started the licensing business which is Jim launch.
And that's the one that like really took off and we hadn't been super in touch and I got a call out of the blue and he wasn't like a cold call, you know?
9:59
I mean, Like this is weird so I pick up the phone and he's like you're going to want to sit down for this and I was like, okay, what's up?
I was thinking like cancer, you know?
I mean I'm just like what is it going to be?
It was like, I'm sorry.
And I was like, for what he was like, you know, everything.
10:19
It was like, okay.
And I was very angry still because in this is what I told him.
So I was like it's like, you know that point when people like get onstage and they accept the awards in mind you at this point, I think we're doing.
We're probably taking home One and a half million a month in.
10:38
I mean and take home like personal income from the licenses is a decent size.
I like is it ever not you know conglomerate like probably but it's decent sized business and I was like, you know what, people get on stage and they accept a words for things.
I like the first thing I always say is like, hey it's will thank my mom and dad for always believing in me.
10:54
I was like I'm not going to say that I was it because you did it.
I was like you're only saying this now once everyone believed because it's not belief anymore, it's fact it's evidence.
Like so you're as like this apology means nothing to me.
And besides that, I stopped caring what you thought six years ago, which is why I left.
11:16
And so I had like, that's like I could have just accepted it and I didn't do that.
How do you feel about that?
I probably like today I probably would have said things, I appreciate it, I know where he was trying, he was trying to extend an olive branch and I just wasn't there.
11:34
I was still seething.
I was still very angry that I had not gotten any support during that process and maybe that was very woe is me, but I was still very angry at that point.
And you know, to give also a little bit of context, you know, his response to that was like, well we'll see how long it lasts.
11:50
Uh-oh, King know.
So like my father not like he is a very strong personality and so do I and we both think we're right, the angry about it now, Honestly.
No, I mean like I think I can still feel the emotions, but I feel like I have, you know, thought about it enough to say that I can logically say.
12:11
I think you absolutely did the best he could with what he had is a single dad, another country, raising a kid, trying to get that kid to fit in and do the things that like, one of the things that I think, my dad always wanted me to be able to do is like, because he's darker skin than I am.
He's Middle Eastern.
He always wanted me to like, have access to like the back.
12:31
Rooms were like deals were made that he felt like he wasn't a part of and so he just wanted me to have that and so I think he just drove me as much as he could to get that.
It's just like when you're on the other side of it, like all you feel is never succeeding.
12:47
But I can appreciate it now in retrospect, but it definitely was still it hardened me a lot.
But that hardness.
I think has benefited me a lot in business.
I had someone in the podcast say equate, which I've never managed to forget.
13:03
They said you've got to realize that Everybody, you encounter everybody that does you wrong?
If you were them and you'd been through what they've been through and you heard their brain, you'd be doing the exact same thing.
And it sound is obvious and one hand, but it's also very kind of Illuminating that think about the person that's wrong.
13:20
You the most if you've been through that their shoes and you had their genetics, you'd be doing the exact same thing.
Doesn't mean you have to let them off, but at least it evokes, some empathy.
If you're, you cannot both hate and understand someone at the same time, true.
Like if you truly Stand someone then you can't hate them.
13:38
Because you understand why?
Like, a lot of times they hate us from the unknown and not like, because you hates because I mean, you almost say you're like, how could like, it's literally a statement of not understanding.
Hmm, like how could you if you understood then you would know how and that resentment is a byproduct of just not understanding as well.
13:55
I was just thinking about resentment that I've had in my life when I think, someone's wrong me, that sense of Injustice.
You're right.
How could ya did I dare you?
Did you ever manage to get your fuel to burn less dirty?
Are you burning less dirty now?
I think so.
You think so yeah I think so my team tells me that that's true and if you look at like because I do have some older videos that I made from like years ago and there's definitely a different vibe I'm significant friendlier.
14:24
Yeah that I was that I'm even the way I interact with customers and you know the team was like purely fear-driven like I was absolutely.
Because I didn't understand influences while yet.
So only only the stick.
I had was like, if I, if people are afraid of me, then they will immediately comply.
14:43
And it's effective for short durations, but not for long durations.
It's but I didn't know any better at the time.
And then I slowly that's when I, you know, right around that point is when I met my wife and then she just, you know, changed my life and she started running all the businesses and I'd see her and everyone loved her and I was like man should do more of that stuff and less of my stuff.
15:03
She changed your life.
Oh, yeah, for sure.
Bar, None.
I mean, she's like, The best.
How did he change you?
She is brought out the absolute best in me.
I can just about every way, like, Didn't think we're going to go here.
15:27
She just she believes it.
And I think that's what most guys will truly, at least for me, that's what I want or need it.
I'll tell you story to illustrate it.
So We met talk for four hours on the first date, only about business because that's all I wanted to talk about and I pitched your own working for me, I like quit your job work for me and she was like I just met you logically make sense.
15:55
She was a personal trainer, I had a bunch of gyms and I was like you're this good.
You should totally work for me.
She was like well let's you know, let's see how this goes and so I had this idea for the turnaround business and it was right as I had five, five locations at that point and I wanted to try this thing out.
16:10
So I You outdid three turnarounds flew back and they started working and then I sold all my gyms because it was like, okay, this this makes even more money.
I took all the money and put it into this gym.
That one of the guys I was doing a turnaround with was like, dude you just crush this like I'm a really good operator.
16:28
Instead of turning is Jim Duron walking away with just the money.
He's like, you should just keep owning them and I'll just fill up, fill them up behind you.
So I could I could launch one, two, three, gyms a month and then on the mall is like you leaving so much money on the tables like okay.
Did this first launch of put all the money and he was like, of course you had financial difficulties and I had a personal care that, you know, personally guarantee the least normal stuff.
16:49
And so I crush this launch and then, I wake up one morning, I checked the bank account and it's completely empty and I was like, What's happening?
So I called him up.
He was like, well, I know you're skimming from the business it was like What he's like, I know, you're, I know you're skimming.
17:06
I was like, we just, what know he's like?
Well, that was my half.
And so I was, like, what is happening.
So, I printed all the bank, the bank statements, I went line by line.
I was like, let me, I'll walk you through all the bank statements.
Let's just, let's get to the bottom of this.
17:22
And remember, we sat in the meeting and he was like, obviously, that he pushed off the table and I was like, oh, okay.
I immediately was like, oh, he, I just got fired and he'd already been indicted for fraud.
Dad.
And I knew this getting into business with him and he was just a big misunderstanding.
17:39
And you know the saying goes like when experience meets money, money gets the experience in spirits, it gets money, very much love that.
And so after I had all my gyms, I sold them, put all the money in this thing and then it all got taken.
Its, I had nothing and Layla's with me at this point, for this, like, this exciting period.
17:58
So I was like, okay, she's like, hey, you know, maybe we should keep doing these turnarounds instead of this weird Lon, Go thing, you side sidelined for I was like okay we'll do that.
And so I was going to launch a gym, the next month and there was a guy whose local to that gym.
18:13
And since I was refocusing, those are.
All right.
I'm going to build all the infrastructure.
I'll send the sales guy out to do this thing.
And he crushed the launch did like 120,000, which for us was a big launch in like, three days and three weeks.
And so now I'm at laila's parents house because like, we don't really have a house at this point.
18:33
And I'm the guy that you met from the inner that you quit her job4, who just lost everything.
And I was, I was I needed this hundred grand to come in from this launch so that I could recapitalize and The money wasn't hitting.
18:49
I was checking the bank.
I was like, where's this money?
Like I could see the processing, the transactions and it was all successful.
What's going on?
So I called up the processor up.
I was like, what's up?
And they said, it's a routine check.
I like it with you guys.
Six years has never been a routine check and they're like, call again later.
I was like, okay, so I called out the next day, next to nothing.
19:04
And then finally is Christmas Eve.
And I owed this guy money for the commission's from the sales.
And I was like I will not get off this phone until you send me the money that I am owed and the payment process.
Mmm.
19:20
And they were like, long story short, you were doing stuff in different locations and I was running this all through a local gym business.
Even though it's all over the nation and they were like this is a little irregular, we're just going to hold onto this for six months.
Shit right now, I owe the guy 22,000 dollars in commissions.
19:36
I in total now had 23,000 dollars.
So, I wired him the money and I had a thousand dollars left and it was December of 2016.
And I was like ice cream products.
I still have the screenshot on my bank account.
So I went from like six, Jim's, turnaround business, all the stuff to $1000.
19:53
I was like this socks and Layla had just got six of her friends to quit their job.
To come do this turnaround business with me and they were starting two days later from the 24th.
So the 26th of December, because I plan on getting this hundred grand in and then being able to launch six gyms because it took about, you know, whatever it was thirty three hundred dollars a day in cost.
20:16
Just to have six guys out there in the field selling. 3300 a that I did not have.
And so I sought a credit card that hundred thousand dollar limit on it and so, I'm at her parents house, like, in an extra bedroom, I haven't lost everything.
20:31
And the my one, Hail Mary play of this launch.
The money did not come through and I was like, I think you should leave me.
I I think I'm a sinking ship right now and I would respect you like we're cool if you want to walk away.
20:49
Like we're good.
Like I won't think less of you.
Like I would walk away from me right now.
Is this could this has a very high likelihood of not going right?
And You pulled my chin towards her and she was like I would sleep with you under bridge if it came to that. and it's hard to comprehend but like I had nothing you know, like heard of that kind of belief was who's very oh It was deep for me so it was like, fuck it.
21:18
Let's go.
You know I mean instead then we we launched the gyms doing thirty three hundred dollars a day and mind you.
I had no way to process money still.
So I'm collecting 6280 contracts a day that I can't process and we're getting calls from customers.
Okay?
Why would you ruin my car?
I have wife.
And you're my card calling all these processors, just be like, hey can you plea?
21:35
And as soon as you get shut down from a processor, it's like a black mark, it's like going bankrupt for credit cards.
They're like, oh no, something's weird.
We they just won't they've other people that can Just the money for finally.
I get like a high-risk processor that does like porn and casinos and stuff to like give me and they were like, yeah.
21:52
So it's going to be like 8% processing and we're going to hold ten percent as like Safeguard and I was like Jesus.
Okay.
Yes they're like and we can only give you fifty thousand dollars as your limit.
I was like I need like 200 he's like well and I got this on the 29th of January.
So this whole time thirty three hundred days running on this card and I have no money and I have no way to process it and 29th of January Arie I can run 50 Grand, I run 50 Grand in a day he's like, but it's by month he's like so February 1st.
22:20
You can run another 50.
So February 1st, I run another 50 that hundred covers my costs from the month before and then I get two more processors. 450 boom, boom!
Run those and then like I got a third one or fourth one like two weeks later and I was able to like start moving things around and at the end of February we'd made like a thirty thousand dollar profit and like Okay, I think we might be out of this.
22:47
The next month we did a little bit more and I was like, okay I think this is working and then all of a sudden Layla test me on the shoulder one morning and she's like, she like turns or laptop towards me and it's our bank account and has all these - transactions like hundreds of them and I was like what's going on.
She's like, well, all these clients are calling me saying that the gym that we did this launch at month and a half ago.
23:07
The guy got in his chair and was like hey there's too many of you here like just go home just refund because I was To hold the money.
They had to do the delivery that was the model is like I would fill a gym up.
I would sell I keep the money and then they deliver on the services and after that they could keep the customers.
23:23
Those kind of like that the setup.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
23:44
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
24:02
And then another gym the next week said, hey, this guy made 100 grand out of my gym.
The average homeowner makes thirty six thousand dollars a year, take home like this kit from the internet took 100 Grand a month, screw that kit.
And so he told all the customers were there after we had left.
Hey, I'll keep living your thing.
24:18
Refund him, just pay me half what you paid him.
So after we you outright, it was a flawed model.
Like I didn't understand like I didn't get it at that point and so we'd 150,000 dollars in refunds that I had to.
Hover and I had no way of doing it.
Why do you like Leila's?
24:34
Like we're gonna do this, I believe you.
And so, I'm like, I'm, like, I can't sleep.
I remember because what would happen is like the more we sold the more, the refund, like it was a vicious cycle.
So I had to sell more to cover the refunds from the ones that were coming in.
And so our sales were going up and it was just like I just I couldn't breathe and I was just I wake up at night anyways and so I'm like riding on these ideas.
24:57
If like, what I think I could do, we date launches that were supposed to Launch, Next month.
So I said, hey Layla, you have this little weight loss business cuz she had her personal training business, you converted her, all her in person class online during this whole process.
So she's making like three or four thousand dollars a month and mostly because like I'm not stable, I'm like making all this big money and losing it all the making and losing and she's just like paying groceries and actually like making sure that I can eat and I was like, tell me more about that.
25:21
I said, what's your over and how much time does it take you?
And then bubble was like, We're going to, we're going to do your thing.
We're going to we're going to call Queen transformation.
I'm gonna start running ads for it and we're going to take the sales team and we're gonna put it on your thing.
And so within 14 days, she starts taking the phone calls because he was a good salesman.
25:37
She's doing a thousand bucks a day online.
No, all margin.
What's up product?
It was at 16 week like we lost program?
That's mine.
Yeah online.
Exactly.
And so it was 500 bucks to Stone to him a day.
And so it's like man if we get to take a guy's going to have eight thousand a day 240 after ad smells like, I can make 150 in profit and like we'll be in the clear.
25:59
So I called the eight guys that were supposed to launch the next month.
The gyms.
Second on the phone with the first guy was like, Hey, we're going another Direction.
You know, we're going to, we're going to be a weight loss, companies sell direct to Consumer and he was like, dude, you launch my buddies gym like two months ago and like he can't stop talking about you.
26:15
It's like it's packed because there are other gyms that everything went fine with just, the ones that didn't is the ones that crush the business.
He's like I know you can do it.
And I just refinance my house and I maxed out my credit cards to to make this gym happen and I'm going to lose it and given what I had been through up to this point I was like that's tough man, sorry about that.
26:39
And then finally I was like can you okay instead of flying can you just show me what you did to help my buddy out?
Can you just give me like the system and since I was like I'm going to get out of this gym business.
I was okay like selling my secrets and so I was like all right man I'll give You everything I have, but I'm not going to fly out there to save your eyes if you can't sell any said, no, no, it's fine.
26:59
And so I picked up the highest number, I could think of because your he told me he was broke.
So I figure I could get them off the phone so we could move on.
And I said, six thousand dollars and he was like 64 and I was like, yeah, it was like I've done and I remember like looking at the phone and be like holy shit, six thousand dollars and I was like, oh what card you want to use for that road, like a cardboard box and then the next call had the same thing.
27:24
And I was like, whoa.
You have to make this thing known.
I was like same conversation.
He's like how much I was like, eight Grant and he was like, yeah.
Okay.
And I each of the calls was like next call, same thing, 10 grand, next call, same thing, 12 Grand.
And then the next you know the end of the day I told 60 thousand dollars in licensing packages for all of the stuff that we did to do the turnarounds is that monthly or is that just what was a HOSA?
27:46
It was a, I didn't have it.
I was just like I'm just giving you everything I do.
Yeah.
It became more calm feel like more.
It became a recurring model over time, but it was a PDF with somebody who's actually all my internal stuff.
So it was like, what I used to train my sales teams that would fly out.
And like what I would use to train them on how to do the attrition orientation.
28:04
Like it was all the internal stuff.
The only thing I actually made external was I had to create the, the advertising material.
So I had to basically make a white label landing page for the gyms that they could put their logo on.
And then I gave my license in the ads themselves that we're ready to convert it, right?
28:19
So like the video is the copy everything they used, like videos of May that we knew converted and I taught him how to run them and then that's that's what it did it.
And we made sixty thousand dollars in a day and I like Layla came in from her two sales for weight loss, and I was like I think we're still in the gym business and she was like, what I thought we were doing weight loss.
28:39
Like you just told me you sold me on weight loss being like the next day.
I was like I just I just think her doing it wrong and so I explained what had happened and she's like, so is this what we're going to do now?
And I was like, I guess I was like I can call the other 30 gyms that we did the turnarounds for us.
28:55
Like they know we can do it because we just did it for them and so I called all those guys up and we did like three hundred thousand dollars in sales a month and it was basically all profit and I covered the Funds and I covered the everything and we were like in the clear.
And then and then it was just and then all those gyms that we did that we sold the average gym did thirty thousand dollars in extra cash collected in their first month using our our system.
29:19
And so, the key was that like, if they didn't have to pay the overhead of the sales guy who's there every day at the hotel, the commission for that guy, like the rental car, the per diem, like, all the stuff that you have to set of eyes and just like, rent it out of their own gym and work, the leaves themselves, it became incredibly profitable.
29:35
For them and and then it just took off like wildfire.
Like we went from like our first full 12 months of like January to January we did 26 million Top Line, 17 million it.
Ibadah our first 12 months like it was it was insane.
29:53
Like it's hard to comprehend that like I like that was the moment.
I had been like dead broke in her parents house and then like six months later I have three million dollars in the bank account.
And then like 12 months after that, I've got like 20 million views.
It was, it was insane and not even know he could pay taxes.
30:11
Like I didn't, I was like, I was figuring all this stuff out but through that whole thing Layla was just like you can do this.
Like, we can do this.
Like we've got this and I think sometimes you just need one voice behind you, that just just keeps believing what happened then, so that's 2016.
30:29
You turn things around over the next couple of years.
What happens, if you know, leading up to where Today in terms of your business, can you get a top-line summary in terms of what?
Yeah, I'll give them.
Tldr continue to grow.
Jim launched.
Two years later, we started cell phone company called Prestige Labs.
30:47
At this point, we had thousands of gym owners that had licensed.
The business model in the ads and all the stuff that we were doing.
And so we sold through that distribution base, that company grew pretty good, pretty big pretty quickly.
You're after that we started a software company that also helps Jim's get leads in the doors just like an automated lead thing and then 20:21.
31:07
We sold all three of those companies, the supplement, and the licensing company was sold to American Pacific group which is a private Equity Firm out of San Francisco.
For forty.
Six point two million.
For we saw two thirds of the company and then the software company, we actually sold to a strategic buyer who had like a massive base and we had a better monetization system, they did.
31:29
And that was an all-stock deal.
So, we're just continuing to grow into their own Briella and they'll probably sell For five years.
But from that and what we had taken in dividends during the licensing business, for the five years that I was rocking, it still is group rocking and rolling.
We started acquisition not calm.
31:48
So that became kind of our family office.
And so we started our first Investments, I think, First Investments we did was in 2020.
So there is some overlap there.
And part of the reason that I was willing to sell, it was because they were the Investments, the first three or four Investments.
We did did really well.
And I was like, okay, this is Is what I want to do is the next things that you know.
32:07
I do want to be the gym guy for the rest of my life because I'd been at this point, I'd been think more than a decade that I've been from like sleeping on the gym floor to having multiple occasions to doing the turnaround business to doing the licensing.
Like, I'd been in that game for a long time and I think that maybe I could have stayed there and could have just continued to compound it and started doing Acquisitions under that Fitness umbrella.
32:27
But I wanted to do more General business stuff.
And so that was, that's what we did.
And so now, we now, we buy chunks of companies, usually, usually minority Stakes 25 to 49 is percent.
I mean, we have one that were in the talks of that.
32:42
We were originally a minority stake in and we're going to take majority because it's been a great company and they want to founder in the same position as I was like.
Just wants to do other stuff and it's a great business and so but that's kind of how we see it.
As like growth Partners we come in, we write a check, we add value to help grow the business.
33:00
What are you brilliant at?
You know, you kind of, you kind of come to learn what you're good at based on comparison.
But you kind of understand your area of expertise.
What is your area of of brilliant?
Brilliant sir expertise like really want to ask.
Caleb.
Caleb was Caleb.
33:16
We can barely see.
So Caleb sat there on the sofa in the corner of the studio.
He is a friend in creative director of Alex and I'm asking Caleb what Alex is good at what's his era of brilliance?
Unlike you solving problems for companies simplifying complex things into more digestible actionable Solutions as well and it will, how would you answer that question if you were answering it for yourself?
33:44
I feel like I fundamentally a lot of times don't understand the world and so I think the reason that some people have found the content and things like that, good or useful is because they feel like they can understand it.
It's just because like, I didn't get it right like terms, like value, right?
33:59
People like provide more value more.
I mean.
And so I just make a make an attempt to define the terms that a lot of us use every day and then it makes a lot easier to solve for those things in business.
And so, you know, I feel like I want to grow my business and we are, what does that mean?
Well, I'm get more customers, make them worth more.
34:15
Okay, so it's one of those two things.
All right, well, how do I make it more customers?
Like, well, there's a ways to do it.
Here are the eight ways.
Which one do you feel like you're best at?
I'm just like, kind of thinking through Frameworks that ways.
It's just for me, it's just been my way of being able to be relatively confident in a world that feels confused.
34:30
Using like, there's a few things, I feel like I can understand, I just hold on to those.
I mean, that's the very nature of innovation.
Isn't it?
Like, asking the question?
We so, so often Our Lives just accept words and phrases and ways of doing things.
Then there's a few people who are really good luck elon's one of them, I just like asking why?
34:50
And then, when you ask why, like why can't you make enough affordable?
Quote, unquote, electric vehicle.
That is fast.
Everyone else.
Did you can't.
Why, you know, and then he's Great at, breaking it down into like the core components of that Innovation.
So, well, if we buy the metal on the, the iron exchange, we do this.
35:07
And this, then we can do it.
Yeah.
They said that such an important thing in entrepreneurship is in it.
There's some people who just ask why Naturally the seriously to the point like the Elan.
It's like I don't understand why we can't.
Yeah, I just explain to me why we can so that I can not think about this.
35:25
Yeah.
And I feel like that's, you know, I would say that that's the most comforting likewise in this company growing like I don't get it, like will explain it to me.
And then usually, a lot of people it's like, they're there in this caught in this Loop.
You don't mean of doing what they've always done or like believing that this is the only way.
35:42
And I think a lot of times I've been Benefited from like not knowing because I my questions don't seem stupid to me, but only to somebody who like knows what they're doing.
It seems stupid.
And so from there were able to like I guess to your point innovate just by being, like I don't understand, that's what Steve Jobs from everything that I've read about, Steve Jobs in my brief conversation with Steve Wozniak.
36:03
Once upon a time is he was just the voice in the room that never understood why they couldn't.
And even like when we think about him removing the keyboard and doing you know not refusing to use a stylus and all these other crazy things he did not using JavaScript I think at the time and changing the poor and removing the iPhone Jack.
36:23
That that is somebody who is so strong in their convictions in terms of like doing things.
Anyway, how important you think that is generally at like what in your view?
What makes a really good entrepreneur / leader.
I think that they have to have the power to influence and that is across lots of things.
36:43
Just they have to be able to move other people and you can Define sales as the ability to get people to comply with your request.
You can define leadership the same way management marketing to a degree is getting people to comply with a larger request, you know publicly.
But I think that fundamentally is a skill that people have to have, if they're going to be successful at entrepreneurship, they have to have tremendous Drive whether that's a combination of towards or away.
37:04
So they have a big mission that they really want to achieve or they have I'm very big fear that they're running away from either way.
I think the fuel works just from a pure entrepreneurship Perspective.
Third piece is impulse control is that they have to be able to say no to things on a regular basis for an extended period of time.
37:25
And I think they have to be able to boil down the success of their business into inputs and outputs.
Like if you do not know the inputs that are going to get the output that you want, then what are you doing?
and so I think for most of us, like if they have those things, if they have the ability to lead other people, / cell just influence they have some big motivator they can control themselves long enough to keep on going during that period of time and they are doing the right things because they know the inputs and outputs to be successful to create their out.
37:54
The thing that they want becomes a very difficult person to be on that.
First point, then sales, one of the things I read in some of your work, is this idea that if everybody just went and spent two years doing door-to-door sales, then why is that At important.
38:12
Why do you think total sales is a key thing?
I think it's just for white for broader definitions for the audience, I think it's just high, volume transactional sales.
So whether that's you doing door-to-door.
You cold calling or you work in the front desk at a gym where you do 20 consults a day, like just having a high volume because in order to learn a skill, you want to have as much exposure as you can to repeat the action.
38:36
And then you want quick feedback loops so that you can learn what you did wrong.
So the perfect scenario would be Mentor-mentee repeated exposure, fix this try again fix this try again.
And in sales, if you can survive that long then you are good enough that you will have gotten enough feedback.
38:53
Like for most people, if they can weather the first three months of sales, then they'll usually be fine.
And so for the people who are coming up and I always tell them like, go Shadow the best guy and do twice the volume he's doing because you're not as good as him.
So, like, do twice the volume that they're doing work, all of the hours and you will get better faster because you're doing, you have to Suck 4X period of time.
39:13
And so if you can condense, how, how long that takes you in terms of calendar days?
Not hours.
You can get there, faster.
But I think that it's important because when you have to learn how to get rejected and still keep going, and I think that's a very valuable skill.
And then to there's lots of like, little things that you learn in just interpersonal communication that allow you that you can use with teammates later, you can use in marketing because a lot of the best marketer started as salespeople and marketing is just sales.
39:35
One too many is least as I understand it.
And so, having that kind of repetition to Develops a deep understanding of human psychology, I think.
And I think it's important for if you want to get people to give you money for the thing that you have having that as a base skill comes in handy, I think a lot of people aren't orientated towards developing skills.
39:58
I think that orientated to Lifestyle to what I can post on Instagram, too.
Cool, whatever is cool.
But this idea of developing skills requires this thing that's kind of absent in modern culture, which is patience.
And a lot of like you said, rejection who wants that, you know, it was there was no Glamour and what you said.
40:18
Yeah, it's funny.
Because a lot of us want traits, right?
We want to be patient, we want to be humble, we want to be, you know, long-suffering whatever words you want to use.
But in order to, if I would say, hey, how would you create if you had to create a human, what would you put them through to make them tough?
40:36
It probably wouldn't be a really chill life.
Yeah.
Would you put them through to make them patient?
We probably wouldn't give them things immediately and so it's like we want these traits but each of the traits has a price tag attached to it.
It's just like do you want to pay the price tag to get the thing?
And so I think if people reframed the the period of life that they're going through as the price that they're paying out of their wallet, but the wallet is their time as the seconds of life that they're trading for it.
41:00
Then I think more people be willing to make the trade because at least when I look at myself, like when I'm 80 something years old and You back in my life, I want to have these traits but in order to have those traits I know have to go through these things.
And I think for me, that's given me a lot of comfort in hard times.
One of the things that kind of adjacent to that which cools his patience, is the belief that you are at some point going to get there.
41:22
So like, you know, it's all well and good.
You saying to me, you do this for five years.
Steven, you'll build the skill, but I go.
Well, listen, if I want to be a millionaire and I have a low self belief, I'm going to have low conviction, so I'm not even going to take the BET.
Yeah.
So how does One build that's self-belief.
41:38
Self belief is such an interesting thing because it feels like this real.
It's clear to some degree that you had it in that moment of turmoil.
It also the reason I say to someone who is because it didn't seem like you had a plan B.
Anyway, you were ready, you bet you like your parents and those playroom whatever.
41:57
So yeah, you're nothing to lose so I don't know how much self belief is applicable but regardless to keep Grayson those hurdles self, you need some kind of conviction that like this is the right way to go.
How do people build that you?
So I hear that into it like to Echo the point.
42:13
You just made.
I hated my current existence and so I think some people like don't hate their current existence enough.
And so like I don't think, you know, like you either have to really believe that this thing is going to happen or you have to know that your life sucks and I knew that my life sucked.
42:29
And so I knew that if I did something else it would have it would have a higher likelihood of changing my life, the not doing something.
And at least that's how I say that I probably saw it in the beginning.
It's like I didn't know if it was going to work, but I knew that I wasn't going to stop.
I read I had a quite some ten years ago which we just came to mind when you said that on some YouTube family.
42:51
Ugh, why he said change happens when the pain of staying the same becomes greater than the pain of making a change and in your situation or it sounds like, well, this is less painful 100%, I think.
And I think that's the basis of most are either.
You have to have a reward that is that, that incentivizes, you, it's the hallway towards or away.
43:09
It's either, we're going away from pain or went towards pleasure.
And I think a lot of people really looking for that passion.
It's gonna be towards, but I think early days and I talked a lot about this but like I think - motivation is pooh-poohed too much like If you are angry, use it, if you are sad, use it because like what else you going to do with it?
43:30
Like you might as well let it help you like or it uses you either.
It mean, and so I always like to see when I was in my earlier days, I felt like I was wielding my anger at least in a direction.
And I think also a lot of people think that they have to get like it right on the first shot.
But one of the beliefs that I had was that I just want to be directionally correct.
43:49
Like, if I move, I like, I know that I don't like this and so this way is not where I am.
And so I will start taking steps this way and from the story that you've, at least heard, it's like, I'll ping pong a little bit to try and Directionally move that way.
And it's funny because Caleb seen plenty of things.
From what we do at acquisition.com were, like, we'll try it out.
44:08
And if it doesn't work or like, oops, all good.
Do you believe in yourself?
I think that.
I have a high likelihood of repeating activities that I've done in the past.
And up to this point, I have lots of evidence that would suggest that it that I will continue.
44:27
Why didn't you say yes?
Because I based the answer on the question of what I've done before and I think it's been it's just based on evidence now.
So it's not like I like Charisma thing at least for me it's just like I've done these things and so I think it's probable that I'll be able to continue.
44:45
Is there a deeper reason to why you didn't just say?
Yes, that's actually how I think about it is that because it's feels difficult to say, you believe in yourself.
Yeah.
Feels weird.
And if it ho chi is the right word for what that feels like for me.
But like saying the way that I said it is how I is how I feel about it.
45:04
Have you been on a journey of in terms of self-doubt over the last, you know?
Thirty years for sure.
I think it was.
I mean, fear was my biggest fear and anger hand in hand or my big motivators in the beginning.
And I mean, maybe that's from soft app.
45:22
I would say that the I was very certain and I can, I can, I can feel this.
And I remember this, I was always certain that I wasn't going to stop like that.
I can, I didn't know, I didn't know whether I would succeed, I thought it was probable.
45:40
But I did know, I wasn't going to stop.
And so for me, that was like enough to get me going, or keep me going was like, what are the controllables me?
Okay, well, if I do this, so I'm big on making, like unreasonable, like unreasonable that it doesn't work out statements.
45:55
Just like if I do sales and I do more volume than everyone else on this team and I've shadowed the guy who's the best and I do that for five years it's unreasonable that I won't be at least mediocre, it will be probable that I'm above average.
And it's also probably that I'll learn other things along the way.
46:12
And I'll also have the resources at that point in five years that I can jump into things now that I have more context or perspective from which to make a judgment on what a good next opportunity is.
And so, I like very easy to believe statements and then having the input output equation, being like the output is that.
46:29
I will be a very good salesman.
The inputs is that I have to do.
I have to collect 5,000 knows, I collect. 5,000 knows, I'll be very good salesman.
And that for me, like, when I was a kid, I played video games, I'll beat the same level over and over and over over again.
So that when I got to the next level, I would crush everybody because I'd had all the experience points maxed out.
46:46
And so like those input output equations are really helpful for me.
Like, when I took the GMAT to get into Harvard, my first Corps was like, okay, it wasn't great, but I read this study on how to do well on standardized tests and they had this graph and it was like this, it was just a straight line.
47:05
It said number of problems practiced on GMAT, Or so, like the more problems you did on average, the higher your test score was and I was like done.
So I bought 16 phone books of like they're like these thick like test prep books and I did four hours of problems every day for three months.
47:23
Every day I'd get home from work.
How do you dinner ready for his problems?
Had a timer it every day and I scored 99 Point whatever percentile because it was just input output.
Like I didn't, I didn't, I was naturally not even that good at math.
But I just was like if I do 10,000 fucking Problems.
47:39
Like I'll start to just understand how these problems get asked.
And so like I was trying to find like, what's the input output for this?
The content game?
I was like, okay, well, if you post once a day on one platform, we will get some eyeballs.
If we post on every platform every day, we will get more eyeballs.
If we post multiple times a day on every platform, will get even more eyeballs.
47:57
So let's do that.
Let's build that system, 100%.
And so like, those are the like I try and make statements that I believe are unreasonable that.
If I do it enough, it will be true.
And so that's for me.
That's what gives me the confidence.
And it's to say, like what if it's not working like, it will eventually, like if we just keep doing, it will work.
48:17
What does it take to want to do something potentially for years so that you can get a good at it?
Because, you know, there's gonna be people think.
Well, I want to be a great DJ but I just can't find the motivation to spend everyday.
Three hours.
Practicing, Alex.
48:34
We're looking probably a good DJ.
But I'll be like I'll be like you like your current state enough that you like the pain of change thing.
I like you're not enough pain.
I've said that to plenty of people we go speak and someone's like how do I get motivated him?
Like I can't get motivated.
48:51
Like you have to hate for me I'd like it automatically.
Go there.
Like you have to hate something like for me, I just hated my current existence and so for me that was powerful enough to get me out this going to be another way though.
You know I was thinking to that moment.
We took the leap.
Hmm?
You know there's I feel often Feel like most people that listen to this podcast, often are at a point in their life where they're considering a leap.
49:12
Yeah.
Feel that we dropped drag.
Those type of people in.
We kind of like, we're a magnet to those people.
So if they, if they're in a situation that they don't like, but it's not that painful and it's comfortable.
That's the worst, it's comfortable, but little bit miserable.
Yeah.
How do you get them to take the lead when it's so comfortable?
49:29
My boss is promising me a promotion.
I think about death all the time.
It's like, I'm going to die and I think you have to agitate the Enter yourself like if the Stoke the pain like if you can't get through because like it would be it would be odd that you would be motivated by some weird passion like not everyone's Mozart and just like I just love music and I've been I see and you know see numbers and colors you know whatever like some people are like that but most people aren't and so if you're not that then you only start really liking stuff when you get good at it in my opinion.
49:59
And you only get good at it by doing it a lot of times before you're good.
And so, if you this is why I'm big Big believer in this is that when you are starting out, I think you got to find the thing.
That's the pain and like pain motivate significantly faster and stronger than pleasure does.
Like we were like no passions the right way.
50:16
It's like point a gun at a family member, all of a sudden, 10/10 motivation pain and so like I think people should use their pain more and if they don't have enough pain, then one maybe that's fine and you're a dreamer and that's okay.
50:32
But I will tell you that a word that I can read in my like six-month Journey between Tween what I wanted to quit and when I actually quit there was this word that just like pissed me off.
And it was this in the South hop or entrepreneur book and it said there are entrepreneurs.
And there are Watcher printers and I was like and it was like watch burners or people who read these books and don't do anything above.
50:51
And I was just like I don't want to be well, I was like I am one of these right now and I just it just like felt so powerless.
And I think that my entire life has been a lot of trying to Have power.
And I mean, that in the true sense of just being able to direct influence and events, I've wanted to have more power to protect myself, protect the people I care about etcetera and I felt very powerless.
51:15
And I think that I was in that comfortable, like my dad approves of my current situation, I had a job that when I told people they're like oh that's fancy but I felt powerless and I hated that more than anything.
And so I think I think if I want to say this to anyone who's listening, if there's anything you listen to, All the stuff that I described that was really tough.
51:36
That I went through was not as hard as me quitting my job.
By far, the hardest decision of my entire life Bar, None.
Because the things that I was actually caught up with were the opinions of other people.
51:52
Pain is my father, and he pins of the people that I went to school with who I thought would judge me for leaving this.
Good job, to probably become a failed gym owner and how lame that would sound compared to consultant going to Harvard.
And while, but like I was going to go from Peak white collar to a very blue collar area profession making Be less because I quote loved it, and like, I'll say this again, but like sometimes you have to let other people's dreams for your life died, four years to live.
52:22
And for me, it was like, when I, when I continue to Everyday, not want to wake up, that was my wake-up call.
Where I was like, either I continue to live this way and not want to be alive.
Or I just risk.
The fact that I'll died everybody else.
52:38
And I think that that like it was the hardest decision of my entire life by far.
All this, all the hard stuff we went through, still the hardest decision of my life, how much was money on your mind.
When you made that decision, the desire to be financially free to the point where you had Millions.
It's weird money.
Kayla but know this money doesn't really motivate me.
52:56
I would say that.
I mean, I love the game for sure but I love playing the game and the tokens are there.
But for me, it was, it was, it was, it was beating my dad.
You're I mean I didn't want him to be right?
Like, that's what it was like, I didn't want him to be right?
53:13
I just I just, I remember like, I would be sleeping on the floor.
I'd be miserable at, you know, when I had my gym and I had no trainers out teaching all the classes.
And so, I'd wake up, I do for a M5 M6 M7, it am sessions.
And then I would then work out for myself.
And then I would do, I do all the marketing in the ads and the stuff Have to delay it.
53:34
Then I would teach the fourth the 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. this between 7 p.m. and then I would do sales consults at 8 9, 10 11 and then I do the billing for all the all the contracts from 11 to like 12:00 12:30 and then I wake up again and I did that for like six months and like I started like lose my mind cuz I wasn't sleeping.
53:52
But even during like those times I just literally I would Envision going back to Baltimore to my father and have in knowing that he would give me the false modesty of like I know you tried to worry about it.
54:08
Now let's get you back on this thing and I knew that from that moment on he would own me.
And I just couldn't, I couldn't I couldn't do it.
I was like I will do anything but go back to that and for me, that was my I would do anything and so whatever that may be, you need to agitate some pain in your life, you know, to get out of your current circumstance and just as a total side note, Play it out.
54:34
What if you just never do?
Anything is like maybe some people just need to stop dreaming.
Maybe they need to accept their current reality and actually enjoy it.
Because there's a lot of people in their 70 and 80 and they didn't do their dreams.
And if they went back like they didn't do anything but that whole time, they were dissatisfied because they didn't try But what if they were just like I have a good life, I have a wife who loves me.
54:57
I've got some kids.
I have a job that I, you know, like I don't mind.
It pays the bills.
I mean, if you go back 500 years, it wasn't people like, man, this is my passion, he's like, dude, I'm just rowing, rowing a boat across a fairy, and that's what I do.
And this one, my dad, didn't his dad didn't, like, this is how we eat.
And so, like, we have these these idealized versions of purpose, that I think Instagram and all this stuff kind of make terrible.
55:18
But like, I think there's a lot of honor and work period.
And I think a lot of people Fool themselves by thinking that what they do for some reason is not honorable and I think a lot of it is like the internal versus external scorecard of like, I've seen what I said earlier about, like I believe these things to be true about the universe or like the world, but a lot of those are like what do I believe about myself?
55:39
Which is like I can choose to do work in this way?
Which then I can derive Joy from.
So like if I'm Shoveling shit, I can choose to be like I will be the best shit shoveler because I believe that I will figure out how to do this more efficiently and I will you know, I will I'll get better and I'll have calluses on my hands and I'll have a better back and whatever, but I will do this.
55:58
Well, And I think you can find joy in work if you decide to do it.
Well.
So on one hand, if you are if you are if your dream causes so much pain then you will quit what you're doing and do it and if it doesn't cause you enough pain that you're not pursuing it or that you don't like if you don't feel like you're in a cage right now, Then maybe you're not in a cage and maybe you just need to like the life you have and that's cool too.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, I like to find ways that I can put some sort of compounding vehicle in the business because otherwise the only way to use scale is by force and that is more difficult to sustain when you're trying.
0:30
To go to the big numbers, like 10 million a month.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
0:46
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
My wife and I have been public about going from a hundred million dollars in net worth to a billion dollars net worth through our acquisition.com vehicle which if you don't know is a portfolio companies that does right now, north of 200 million dollars a year and it's what funds, all these and I make this stuff so that we can attract more companies to invest.
1:04
And that's how we make our money.
And what I want to do is break down, what we look for in companies that we invest in.
And if you're a business owner, you're an investor.
If you're a business owner, you can think about these Frameworks as how can I use these to make my business more valuable?
And if you're an investor, you can think about these are the things.
1:20
Are the lenses that we use in order to invest in businesses because if we're going to try to get to a billion, we better have a darn.
Well, good idea of how we're going to get there.
And so these are the actual Frameworks that we used to make the decisions about what who's in and who's out.
Or if you're thinking about starting a business of your own, you can start it the right way because it's much harder to fix a business that's fucked up than it is to start on the right path.
1:40
And so if you have the opportunity, I mean you may not even know this.
But the first thing I did before I started my first real business was actually joined a group of other business owners and I did it was a bunch of gym owners.
And I'd even have a gym but I wanted to learn from all their stuff so that I could start and try and make a few mistakes as possible.
So just consider the things that I'm going to outline in this as like you meeting other business owners might be further ahead than you saying.
2:01
Hey when you're building it trying have these elements inside of it so that you can build the right way the first time until we break this into the hard stuff and the soft stuff.
And so the hard stuff is all the business metrics.
When I get to in a second of all, I like the hard stuff that we'll look at that, a business must meet and then the soft stuff is the more about the team more about the people.
2:21
The more nuanced and subjective component but I might even argue the more important component about why we choose to work with some companies and others.
So right off the bat, there's some some basic business things and I would encourage you if you're ever going to invest in businesses especially private businesses which increasingly is becoming the Vogue because it's becoming more and more difficult to become a public company because of the reporter requirements.
2:43
And so like, you know, 40 years ago, it was way easier to go public because reporting wasn't as hard, but they continue to make reporting harder and Harder.
Which I actually think is a bad thing because it means the public, the general public has less access to private Investments and only accredited investor.
So wealthy people are the ones who are able to participate in more and more big private companies.
3:03
So I think that's big picture.
A Down thing that I think we need to decrease the expectations on companies for reporting, so that more companies be willing to go public, so that more of the public market who are not accredited, could participate in that growth, so that's just a two seconds on, you know, my two cents.
3:19
But we do Only private Investments.
And so we look for cash flow.
Positive companies meeting every month, they spit off more cash than they take to grow.
And that means that after growing, they still are cash flow positive.
3:34
Now, there's a difference between being cash flow positive and being profitable.
So this actually has to come down to accounting rules.
So there's two types of account.
Oh, there's different types, but we'll just call it.
You've got cash basis accounting, and then you had a cruel.
Alright, cash-based accounting.
Just means like, what comes into the bank account every month?
3:50
What goes out, right?
That's how most small businesses operate bigger businesses operate off of accrual which would mean that.
Like for example if you ran an event once a year and cost you a million dollars that month to run your event, it would look like you had a huge loss that month when realistically you'd be saving for the year.
But then you also have a huge amount of Revenue that would come in that month or the next month thereafter.
4:10
But what a crew does is it spreads that over the year?
So you have a much more balanced idea of how the business is operating over all.
And so we want cash flow positive and profitable company.
That are growing and founder LED.
And so that means the founder is still the primary driver of the business from a size perspective.
4:29
We have tweaked our requirement.
So originally it was their doing over three million dollars in Top Line we have since tweak that to at least a million dollars in profit.
And when I say profit, I mean, cash flow profit, not paper profits and the reason we do that is because we are cash flow investors overall.
4:46
And so we invest in assets that hopefully make us more money over the Long time than it costs us to buy them and so in terms of size is the biggest company.
We have a portfolio to 20 million dollars in profit last year and in the smallest companies are like a million, right?
So there's a range there but that's kind of the see the midpoint probably like five ish in terms of profit.
5:07
Meat is so there's obviously outliers because and that's kind of common investing that you have two or three companies that carry a portfolio and that's just because 80/20, carretas principle and I won't even get into that.
But That's, it's common.
Now, the things that make a company attractive that we're looking for now is that I look at companies that I think are boring and simple in terms of they don't have a lot of moving Parts.
5:30
I don't think they're going to be disrupted by AI or they have a lower likelihood of being disrupted by AI.
So for example, one of our one of our Brands is enchanted fairies.
And so that's a photography chain.
I think at this point we have 40 locations open when we first invest in them, they had one.
And so that's been 30 months, and so we've gone from 1 to 40 in 30 months.
5:49
So, kudos to them have an awesome product, awesome brand, but a company like that, like I think about AI in the future.
And I think like, you're still going to have to like take, you know, take your body in and get pictures taken of you to have that kind of experience.
6:05
And I think a lot of it is about the experience itself, it's like.
And so I feel like that is a, that is a company.
I feel more confident.
Like if you have a lawn care business, I feel pretty confident going to get the lawn cut.
Now, will their rope be robots in the future?
Probably So the question is, how long and I think that we have more time there than we say, you know, we might in say, you know, a design agency, right?
6:27
That might be a little bit harder to defend with some of the the stuff that's coming out with AI in the future.
So it's not will a discrete disrupted or not?
It's how long a way is that disruption and how profound will the disruption be.
And so, that's a big factor in some of the companies that were looking at taking on right now.
6:43
Another factor is that we want it to be just a solid product because the company either has to have an advantage on there.
Exceptional and marketing or they have to have an exceptional product.
They have to have one of those two things.
The mistakes that I made investing is taking on companies that had neither, they're just like kind of mediocre, I'd product and the kind of mediocre at marketing and those ones are just they don't have anything good.
7:04
And so that's the that's the harder part of growing them because once you have the right product, you can wrap them around the systems that we were to, you know, grow the business, bring the players in and then explode it.
So, part of the way, that we measure how good the product is, we actually just look at reviews online, so Just like a customer.
7:20
Might look at reviews, we look reviews, we look at Glassdoor.
That's from an employee's perspective.
We look at the trip will be to see if they have some massive issue that's going on.
We look at online reviews, we look at the trustpilot reviews, we look at all the different places that there are reviews to see.
Now, mind you, every business, especially if you have, a lot of volume is going to have someone starts that's just like, that's part of doing business.
7:38
But overall, we want to see that the majority of people are very happy with the outcome because fundamentally all of the money that you're going to make is going to be based on an extrapolation of the core unit of value.
Well, you can provide to the end user.
So if somebody can create some very important outcome to a specific type of person, the more valuable that outcome is the more profit you can.
7:58
Also, we generate from the business as you expand and take over the market that it exists in.
And so that's probably the thing that we look at the most from a business perspective of like, how valuable truly is the thing that they provide and is there any element of that is unique?
Hey Mose, an Asian quick break.
8:14
Just to let you know.
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
8:33
Now zooming out to a business strategy perspective.
I like to figure out a way to have one element of compounding within the business itself.
And so in my experience, there are only two ways to have a compounding vehicle within the business.
Well, maybe three, but I'll get to that in a second.
8:51
The first way, is that every year if you don't do anything more customers by the thing, and so that is negative turn so, ideally.
That means that 12 months from now all the customers.
You have now are still buying and ideally buying more, right?
That's what makes an incredibly valuable company.
9:09
If you buy Coca-Cola in the beginning, you'll probably keep buying Cocula brands for the rest of your life, right?
The other way of having a compounding vehicle is having a selling machine that compounds into an of itself.
And so, most of these times, it's Word of Mouth, which is always the compounding vehicle either from a customer perspective, or from an employee perspective.
9:26
All right?
And so I'll give an example of an employee compounding.
So if you had an insurance business and you had sales guys that did Sales for you or you had a mortgage sales business or a solar sails business and you could get each of the salesman to recruit other salespeople to continue to sell for you.
Then every year, let's see you grow by 10% in your sales staff.
9:44
Are let's say every month you grow by 10% in your sales staff.
Then you're going to go really really quickly and that thing will continue to compound onto itself and so I like to find ways that I can put some sort of compounding vehicle in the business because otherwise the only way to use scale is by force and that is more difficult to sustain when you're trying.
10:03
To go to the big numbers like 10 million a month.
It's easy to force growth that, you know, 200k a month, 500 a month million a month, like you can force that growth relatively gue easily with paid ads or maybe some Affiliates, but if you want to go to the big big numbers, you need to have something that compounds onto itself.
10:18
Otherwise you'll flat line.
And then that's when the company becomes significant is valuable another element that we look for is a niche, that's easy to win in.
And so, you know, if we were trying to get into like a i something, right?
There's going to be a lot of it.
Probably well-capitalized players, who are really smart, who are going for the next twenty dollar thing.
10:38
Now, not to say that that's not a good opportunity, it is, but you're going to be competing against the best people in general.
The people were trying to build billion-dollar companies in Tech.
I would say, if we had to take a midline of IQ levels is higher and they're better capitalized.
And people trying to build a billion-dollar lawn care business and I see that as an advantage to having a lawn care business, you just have fewer incredibly smart, incredibly capitalized, people competing against you and so a great investor friend of mine said, Don't fish with the fishermen.
11:04
Are he said fish?
Where the fish are, right.
It's like don't fish forever and also trying to fish.
He's like, just try and find an open pottery, don't have to be the best fisherman.
There's plenty of fish and we've tried to stick to that kind of thing, and we try to stick that same mindset.
Now compounding, a compounding vehicle is basically the fundamental of what every recurring Revenue business seeks to get.
11:21
Now, there are two types of recurring businesses, you have reoccurring and then you have recurring.
So a recurring business is like you were on a monthly subscription for Netflix.
They are a recurring business model, a real.
A business would be something like Facebook ads.
Like when you pay Facebook as an Advertiser, you don't, you're not on a fixed amount but you will come back and buy again.
11:42
If you buy Coca-Cola from Coke, you're not on a subscription monthly box.
They just make sure their products good enough.
That you buy it again, right, Yuri ochre.
And so what we look at is is there a way that we can add an element of this that is either recurring or reoccurring that we can predictably know a certain percentage of the people?
12:03
We sell today will continue to buy from us, five years from now.
And this is like probably the biggest strategic point that I can make in this video.
And arguably like in business, in general, like this is very important.
If you don't get credit for the sales that you make today, in two years, you're always starting at Ground Zero.
That's very hard to do for 20 years and so I want businesses that we get credit for the stuff we sell today in five or ten years and so, whatever we have to do we try and either find businesses that already have that element or we take businesses that I think we can configure ourselves an element within their current construct of how they create value.
12:38
So that customers will continue to want to buy in the future from them.
And that is where you can unlock huge amounts of value in cash flow and Enterprise Value.
Because think about it this way if you were to spend ten thousand dollars a month and get 10 customers month, okay?
12:54
If you were to keep doing that and those 10 customers never left.
In 10 years, you would have 1200 customers but you'd still only be paying ten thousand dollars a month in advertising.
That would be an incredibly profitable business because you don't need to scale your Marketing in lockstep with the number of customers and profit are ultimately generating, and this is a huge profit.
13:15
Enhancer and profit, is ultimately the thing that drives business is values and now, and in the future, and if you think about the value of a business, as the all future cash flow that it generates from now until it dies, then, knowing that every single person that you've sold up to this point is going to continue to pay you for the rest of time, makes it incredibly valuable and the knowledge Everybody you saw from this point going forward also continues to stay in pay also makes it incredibly valuable.
13:38
Those are the hard mechanics of the things that we look for it.
Acquisition.com in terms of companies like I said one to ten million dollars in profit per year is kind of like I would say the majority of the well one is the minimum but one to ten is kind of like I'd say The Sweet Spot like I said we have outliers that are at 20 but that one when they came to us worn at 20, I think they were at six when they came to us.
13:59
And so like, obviously, we seek to grow companies, but that's typically where people come in.
Those are going to hard stuff, the hard Sciences of the Investment Portfolio, like the buy box is what they call the investor was like, what's your box?
The other part is the soft stuff and this maybe not met.
14:14
It is actually the thing that we wait more, which are two elements founder fit and leadership team.
And so, I'll start with founder fit.
So when you get into a Business Partnership or you do you invest in some ways company like you're in your co-owners, like your now locked in, it's like a marriage, right?
14:31
And so you want people that you think Could be married to and five years, right?
You want to be people that you that you look forward to speaking with and on a personal level.
Like I want people that I want to see rich, like The Moment.
I feel like I don't want this person to be richer, like, I don't want to help this person, get rich, not a good deal for me, right?
14:49
And so we try and find exceptional, Founders, that live by are three values, which is sincere, Candor unimpeachable character, and competitive greatness.
And those are three simple sayings or three simple isms but are very hard to find.
It's hard to find people who even have one of the three let alone all three.
Which makes finding great people difficult.
15:05
And that's kind of the fundamentals of most businesses, is that people are almost always the problem.
And so we have a very rigorous screening process to find the right Founders.
The reason for that besides are obvious state of mind is like, if I want to maintain excellent talent in my business, the easiest way to kill that would be to work with City Founders.
So for me to protect the, the talent that I have at acquisition.com, I have to only bring in excellent Founders.
15:26
The other piece is that if we want to grow these businesses, what do you think those Founders need?
They need an exceptional team and exceptional, teammates will not For city leaders.
And so, if we want to build the business, even if we have some super smart hardworking founder who's charismatic, but like if shitty ethics, they're not gonna be able to keep a team who's really smart and hardworking, or who has experience.
15:46
And so when we find a Founder that we like a lot, we think ourselves.
Will we be able to attract the level of talent that's required to get this person from?
Let's say a million a month to 10 million a month, right?
That's it.
That's a who question more than a, how question.
And so, the bigger the investment, the more, the leadership team matters, the smaller, the investment, the more, the Under matters because then we're going to surround them with the leadership team that we need to build because one of the big limiting beliefs that a lot of Founders have is that they feel like they have to learn their way from 1 million to 10 million when it's much more about becoming the type of person who can attract the people who can help get you to 10 million a month and Beyond.
16:20
And when we're looking at those teams, we're looking at.
How many is people have been there.
Done that.
We, like, we say, like, how much gray hair is there on the team?
Like we want at least 20% of the executive team or the leadership team to already been there.
Done that in a business.
That is like this one.
So if they're at let's say 20 million in top-line revenue and seven million ibadah.
16:36
I want to make sure that there's at least 20% of leadership team, who's been to a hundred million once or twice in their career during that path.
So they know some of the roadblocks and they can speak and Mentor.
Some of the other people in the business in terms of having exceptional product.
I measure the value of the product in a few ways.
16:54
One is the sure there's reviews.
The second is more of the hard metrics, which is, if we can quantify how much value the product or service provides the Each customer, which you can track how much of that is being captured in monetized.
So if we feel like it is being under monetized based on the values being provided, that's a big opportunity for the business.
17:13
Both from a pricing perspective or either how we package the services, the biggest metric is always going to be the percentage of customers that come from referrals.
And so if a large percentage of the customers come from referrals, not necessarily all of them, but a significant percentage, which for me is like, 25 to 30 percent of the business comes from Word of Mouth.
Then I know that this is a solid business that automatically, whenever we spend money to acquire customers.
17:33
A 1/3 discount because one out of three people is bringing another customer in, right?
So you can factor into how much money you make.
Now you think about this from a from a profit perspective if one third of your business comes for free that a lot of that extra that added or incremental Revenue drops straight to the bottom line.
17:49
And so that's why having strong word of mouth is such a powerful thing for the profitability of a business.
Now, a lot of small businesses continue to grow off ads and no word of mouth.
But what actually happens is, they have negative word-of-mouth working against them.
So, if I see no word of mouth, I actually know that that Word of Mouth monster is always working.
18:05
It's just working.
Eat away their profits.
They're making less profit, they otherwise would have it.
They had no reputation.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
And so, the reason I tell the story is because I just missed out on a bunch of Revenue that I should have been able to make because we were solving the wrong problem.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to build an acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:36
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to under million dollars from the odd.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I was sitting in my quarterly leadership meeting where everyone had flown in to Vegas for two days to talk about the next quarter, and our goals for the company.
0:52
And I stood there and I was listening what they were saying, and I wanted to live my head on fire.
What transpired next was a problem solving process that I want to share with you because it's unlocked, 10 million to 12 million dollars in annual revenue.
For us that we had not been able to unlock for two quarters because of one simple misdiagnosed problem.
1:13
And so the purpose of this is to hopefully get you to one avoid making that mistake but to be able to use this framework so that you can solve the right problems in your business.
So inside of our quarterly meeting for two quarters in a row, my sales Manager set the goal that they wanted to add six more outbound rows, two quarters in a row quarter.
1:32
Came quarter left quarter, came quarter left.
This is the third time that I've been hearing the make this goal and everyone is nodding their heads and writing down and it seemed like everything was hunky-dory.
And I stopped and I was like, guys, we've had this goal for, for two quarters.
1:48
Why do we expect it to be any different?
This time to set the same goal and nothing's going to happen?
If for context, the reason I said 10 to 12 million is because every outbound route, Generates about two million dollars a year in revenue for my business.
And so for me to have six, more reps is about 12 million dollars.
I'm not spoiling, that of nowhere, that's where it comes from.
2:04
Back to the story, I asked him was like why weren't you able to do this?
So well, you know we lost a couple wraps this last quarter even though we hired some new ones and we pretty much have the same amount as we had four and I was like it is that would happen the quarter before that too.
He's like well yeah it was like then how are you going to solve this problem?
2:21
It's like I don't know and then it hit me.
I have been driving this guy.
And putting my pressure on this guy when he was not the constraint of the system, let me explain in every system you have potential and you have constraints most entrepreneurs, spend all their time trying to add potential to their business thinking that they are solving the constraint, but we will always grow any system will grow up to its constraint and no further.
2:48
And so right now, your business has a constraint, you have to identify it.
And what makes macro speed happen is not is not the friends Enos in the Kinetic energy, it's knowing which problems to solve in what order in the example, I'm going to give you is showing you exactly why they didn't happen.
3:04
For one of my companies, for this specific Channel, we were marketing on which is outbound had we identified this problem to your quarters ago, we would have added 10 million to our top line for this year, which we won't have.
So instead we're going to get one quarters worth of that.
So maybe add two million or two and a half million to top on when we should have added 10 or 12 because of this one problem, it from the outside people going to say, oh well, it's because of x, y and z.
3:27
But they didn't diagnose the problem.
Do you know what it was?
I'll type.
So I then turned to my HR director and I said, how many, how many people are you sending the sales manager per week.
She was like, well I sent them about one qualify candidate a week.
I was like, okay, how many interviews is to take you to send one qualify?
3:46
Can it?
She says it takes five.
I was like, okay manager.
How many of these final interviews is to take for you to get one person hired?
You guys like for now it's like so it takes us 20 people that We got to get through to get one new up, Agra is like yeah it's like okay now given the churn that we had in the last quarter and two quarters because just FYI for everybody Frontline positions in general tend to turn more than manager and Leadership positions just name of the game.
4:11
It was like okay so what is our turn in that position?
He was like it's about 20% of quarter was like okay understood now, simple metaphor, if we have 10 people who are working out about, that's not the number.
But let's just say it's 10 and we lose 20%, Then it means we're losing two people, a quarter.
If Right now, the process that you have gets his one new up on rate per month and we're losing to a quarter.
4:32
That means we would net one.
New person per quarter that is going to be very short of our goal of six.
So what do we need to do, we need to fix the actual hiring process in order to meet the goal.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
4:53
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can fly anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And so what we did was we actually asked the HR Director said, why are we doing these 101 just like wide thought we had to do that miscommunication, right?
5:13
Saul was just a miscommunication, so we don't need that for this position.
What she now did the solution to this problem was that she setting up.
She still running the ads, she still organizing the interviews, but she set them all up for the sales manager to do group interviews.
And now he can do five group interviews for one hour per week.
5:32
And now he can pick one or two of those people and get them all.
Board it quickly, and he can start hiring, he will be able to hit his goal in that way.
And so, the reason I tell the story is because I just missed out on a bunch of Revenue that I should have been able to make because we were solving the wrong problem.
5:49
All of the focus is on the sales manager and, and who he was bringing in and how he was treating them rather than because that wasn't the constraint of the system rather than what is the acquisition process for talent.
And so, I'll give you a framework that I wrote down somewhere that I'll probably shared another but It's a something called the quad marketing calendar.
6:08
Most people have no marketing calendar, smart people have one or two marketing calendars.
So the first marketing calendar, and you can draw this.
You know, what, I'll do for you right now.
Alright, so, the quad marketing calendar.
Looks like this here, you've got internal, and you've got external, so, here you have employees.
6:26
And you've got prospects internally, which is this way, you should be marketing to your employees.
So that you tell them about the vision.
What about the mission about?
Why you do what you do?
This has to happen all the time, so that people continue to want to work for, you internally to your prospects which are now customers over here.
6:46
You need to continue to Market them to get them to buy again and again, right?
We need to keep them to keep.
I over here in external for prospects.
You need to get people to become customers so we're marketing externally, most people understand this one.
7:02
This is the one that most people do.
Most people don't do this one. most people definitely this one and I'll tell you the one that people miss the most this, Is that they don't have an acquisition process for getting new Talent.
So just like you run ads, generate leads, nurture leads, set appointments cell fulfill.
7:24
You should be able to run ads for new employees.
You should be generating leads.
You should be working.
Those leads.
You should be setting interviews, which are sales.
You make job offers.
Just like you make normal offers and then the Experience that you have for a customer is the onboarding experience that you have in parallel with an employee.
7:48
And then just like you continue to ascend and resell your customers, you ascend and continue to manage your employees.
These are parallel processes that happen in every business and most people don't know about it and you heard about it here.
8:05
First at the world's best YouTube channel in the world.
The handsomest and most sickly now Rona Britain, YouTuber out there.
And this is called the quad barking calendar, and it was because we were missing this framework.
My HR Director did not understand this framework that we lost out on 10 to 12 million dollars revenue and I don't want you to do that, all right?
8:25
And so, the reason I made this is so that you can recognize which of these four in the quad marketing calendar.
You are not using so that you can Shore up that part of your business and ultimately scale it and make all of your wildest dreams.
Come true.

Chick-fil-A makes more money than McDonald's, Starbucks, and Subway combined, and their first day in business they made $50.
And today they make over 50, I love Chick-fil-A.
I love their sandwiches, I love their desserts.
0:18
I love the milkshakes.
I love their waffle fries.
I love their sauces, all of their tenders, but what I love even more than that is their business because there are lessons that all of us can take in terms of how they do business, not what they talk about socially, but the actual business of running a business and how you go from $50 to 5 billion.
0:35
And I can promise you, it's not by doing what everyone else does.
And they did that without raising tons of death, they did it over 76 years, they did it after the founder died.
And I've continued to grow and they never had a down year, where they went down in sales, for seventy six straight years, they sell 1/4 the amount of items of any other franchise.
0:56
Subway has seven and a half percent net margins.
Their royalty alone is 15% of Top Line, meaning their stores are running 20, 30 plus percent margins in brick-and-mortar food and they do that being open only six days a week.
Having 52 days a week that they are closed unlike any other franchise.
1:14
No.
He can own more than one location, unlike any other store, they get 60,000 applications a year, and they only award less than 1% of those people.
A store and they do with arguably, a very controversial social setting that would never work in a publicly traded corporate company that has two massages PR.
1:33
So, here are the lessons that I take away from Chick-fil-A that I've tried to apply to as many different places in the portfolio companies that we own.
And even just add acquisition not calm at the holding company.
Number one, is that they sold chicken sandwiches 476, drinking.
And I think they're going to stop having singular focus on the core products and not getting cute, and not getting fancy and not having 49 menu items.
1:52
But just saying, what are the things that the most people want?
And how do I get better and better and better at doing those things because better gives you leverage.
It means the same input, gets you more output rather than having lots of different things they have to put in put in, you just put more and more and more because you only have so much Juju.
If you have two items you can only split set them half as much as you could want.
2:10
For example, if you think about this like an Olympic runner, the difference between first place in fourth place in the Is a tenth of a second but the difference between first and fourth for a person's life massively different.
We get these outsized returns by making these marginal improvements of being better rather than being new.
2:27
Despite our entrepreneurial desire to have not a chicken sandwich.
We're like, what about Taco what about Burgers, right?
Like how many times could they have done something like that?
But they did it because they knew that they wanted to stick to the essential few and they knew that focus is what was going to compound over the long term despite being publicly criticized for not taking on debt.
2:45
Debt and not trying to grow faster for talking five, six, seven, eight years, having somebody beat him.
Boston Market.
Remember Boston Market when they had their rotisserie chickens and the mac and cheese on stuff they took on a ton of debt grew super, super fast and then imploded Boston Market shot up and then shot down because he wasn't thinking on a five or a ten year time Horizon.
3:04
Vestry Kathy is literally sold chicken sandwiches the time.
He was 25 to the day he died.
He was a missionary not a mercenary wasn't doing it to brag about his ego.
He's doing it because he believed that this way of doing business was what he He wanted to represent.
I know that the likelihood that my competitors are going to be here in 70 years is almost zero.
3:21
So, if I build in a way that I'm going to be here in seven years, I will win by default and I think that's powerful because so many people want to see their number one.
The question is when you look at the richest man in the world, I want to be the richest man in the world.
You got up responded, somebody's answer with for how long.
3:38
Because eventually you die.
What are we aiming towards for him?
He wanted to build an amazing Chicken Franchise his legacy, outlasted his life and for me, that's my dream.
My Hope Is that whatever we build can continue and not only just stay alive, but grow Beyond us, and that you can only do through a mission, not through a mercenary, cause, because if you're just chasing the money, people get diluted out because there's always a shiny easy win that distracts from the core items.
4:03
The fact that they don't let anyone have more than one store, I think there's a lot of wisdom.
Come to this.
So there are lots of people, like, let me, let me open a hundred.
We're like, no, because you're not gonna be able to focus.
We want someone to put their heart and their soul into their location and treat it, like it's their own.
4:19
While he was alive.
You have to have worked at a Chick-fil-A.
I think they loosen that up because he wanted to create a way for people to come in mopping, floors, Flippin, Burgers, going all the way up and then eventually owned their own franchise.
He has profit check.
Now, mind you.
It doesn't share the whole profit, but after he takes his pieces off, they have an ability to make more money and having that kind of, I'll say uncapped earning potential for somebody.
4:38
He's very Very inspiring, but he keeps a constraint to a singular Focus because they know that somebody can give it their all at one location.
They've already tested that they've learned over the years and I think there's a lot of wisdom in that we can take for own business number for saying, no, on Sundays means you have to say no to things that are obviously going to make you money but will detract from your values.
4:57
And so there are lots of opportunities in entrepreneurship and you probably have some on your docket right now that you're like, I don't know.
This is a little left of center, but like, it's such an easy win.
Imagine the new CEO comes into Chick-fil-A tomorrow and says, you know what I found?
Way to make us 13 percent more sales and have most that dropped bottom line.
They're like, What's your amazing idea?
5:13
And he's like, we're going to be open, also on Sunday, it would be such an easy play in.
Imagine how hard it is to say no, because in the beginning, he had to say no to an extra 13 percent on a million dollars and makes another 130,000.
But when 13% is 650 million dollars, and you still say no, it means that you're appealing to a higher power, something above the money values matter more than just about anything in my opinion, if they Crew to the founder, to the business and they operate in that way.
5:42
And I would say, the Chick-fil-A is a great example of a type of company that believes in its values through and they practice what they preach pun intended.
Now, I also believe that appealing is something above the money.
Long long makes you more money but you have to say no in the short to get the long.
Yes.
One of the things that permeate any Chick-fil-A.
6:00
If you've ever been there is that they have a culture of service, you're one step away from an awesome lunch meal, will be a pleasure serving you at a drive-through window.
After two more things, you know, that is he's grumpy You guys are also wanting to paint.
All right.
Thank you.
And so what they did was they actually study the hospitality industry, even hired people from Ritz-Carlton to help them create an Exquisite experience at Chick-fil-A extra Kathy noted that when he wanted everybody in his team and his companies are saying my pleasure, it didn't change until he changed.
6:29
How he spoke.
He's trying to all of us, always respond to thank you by saying my pleasure.
So if somebody wants to refill my play, Sure people learn 10 times more from watching what you do than listening to what you say.
And so if you say hey we're all about being on time here but you the CEO or late, it will never work.
6:49
We have to pick the very few values that we know that we will never break that we will always stick with which is why values have to be true to you.
Not nice words on the wall because they have to be things that you would actually live.
Otherwise they are meaningless.
If you want to have a business that grows even longer and bigger, you want to have a compounding Well, built within the business Chick-fil-A has a compounding vehicle of capital within their business, whenever a store creates money, they have the cash and they can pick the next location.
7:17
They buy the land and they buy everything itself to.
So they get the highest return and they get some tax benefits.
And so if there's ever areas in the business that we can get some kind of compounding effect where money compounds on itself, that is something that I always try and build an, every business that I have is, how can I get this money that I'm getting today to make me even more tomorrow within the structure of the business?
7:38
Not The money out and putting it in stocks or putting it into just like, a random fund or whatever it is.
But actually saying, within my business wife, active control, where I get the highest returns based on my skill and my competitive advantages, I get higher returns.
And that's how these guys build Crazy.
7:53
Well, that beats the market, ruthless prioritization on the essential few items that they need to sell the fact that they haven't changed their menu in decades.
Should be a testament to the fact that we as entrepreneurs want to change it all the time.
There's a Henry Ford story that I think drives this home He was looking at a marketing campaign and he had been working on it with his Executives, Etc.
8:12
Three or four months in, he walked past his marketing cos office.
It was like, hey, when are we going to stop running that at?
He's like, I'm so tired of it and the markings have looked up to him, he was like, you haven't even read it yet.
And so the thing is, is that we have all these things that happened in our mind because we're always iterating, like we assume.
Everyone knows everything about our products.
8:28
We assume everyone's already bored of it because they're talking about chicken sandwiches, 24 hours a day.
But reality, is that most people might get Chick-fil-A once a month, right?
As a treat the customers perception.
When we change something, Lowly in our mind.
Every six months as a small business to a customer, it just feels like it's constantly changing, there's no consistency people value consistency.
8:46
People want to know that when they exchanged money they're going to get the thing that they liked last time and if you make the same thing, the same way over and over again, it also gives you the opportunity to improve it.
If you have to improve 100 things, that's a hell of a lot harder than improving to or improving one.
And so, you've heard me say one product when Avatar one channel for anybody who's trying to make their first million each one of these stores.
9:06
If you think about them as a single business like that's how there.
Thinking now do they have drinks?
Yes, etcetera.
The principle behind it, compared to everyone else in the marketplace, they have a quarter, the amount of things on their menu, compared to McDonald's, and they make twice the money.
They have such a refined menu because it makes the order process have fewer mistakes in.
9:23
It, it makes the drive-through process happen faster.
They're able to have less food go bad because they don't have to have all these extraneous options.
They follow produce principle of 80/20.
They know that 20% of their stuff, creates eighty percent of their sales.
They have all of these efficiencies in there because they're not trying to be cute.
9:38
Trying to be the best at a handful of things and by doing that, they've been able to sell way more than anyone else does with a way more constraint menu and do it so much more profitably.
There's wisdom there.
That's how I try to think about that.
It's like, okay, even though I could do those things should I, and most times the answer's, no, I should just get better at the thing that's in front of me and confront the problem that I have, which is how can I sell more chicken sandwiches, whatever your chicken sandwich is, and to drive even further on the focus, they have even at a micro level within their core.
10:08
Addict the chicken sandwich.
If you compare that to McDonald's, Big, Mac or Burger, King Whopper McDonald's.
Big nap has six ingredients, the Whopper has seven, not including the bun.
Now compare that to Chick-fil-A Sandwich, which just has butter pickles and check it.
10:25
That's it.
The even have half the ingredients on there one quarter sized menu because he even then they get more efficiencies at the ingredient level.
They make it faster and easier to prepare.
So it's more consistent and they're able to do that with greater economies of And they can make the process itself, leaner and faster and cleaner and faster.
10:42
And then you do that for 76 years, you become a beautiful.
So, one of the things that when they were asked, why are you so limited in there in your selection?
Besides all the reasons already gave their response?
Was that every time they added another item, they just saw their sales of their main thing decline.
So, they're just splitting some sales off the thing, their core products.
10:59
It's a, how many of us have open a new thing, God people to switch from the old thing that the new thing.
And now you're doing two different things.
For the same amount of money, sound familiar happens.
All the The time.
And so it takes the discipline to say, no.
And say, we're just going to get better.
The last piece that makes them exceptional.
11:15
I think was their VP of growth who was talking about this.
He said, 80% of what fast food restaurants do between each other is the same.
But I wasn't hired here to do the same thing for the other 80% are doing.
I'm hired to do with the 20% are not doing that.
Much more efficiency has been driven into how can we improve this business?
11:32
Because if we change nothing about this business, we saw the same 12 items, you just get better and better and better at this.
Same thing, they even do practice runs in an indoor arena for the drive-through to test in real world.
Scenarios to see how they can make the drive through more efficient, and increase the accuracy.
That's the level of detail that the kingpins can do because they've been doing it for 70-plus years.
11:53
The biggest takeaways I see from the big companies that I try to apply to my own businesses.
What is a business that I could be in for a hundred years?
I believe that if you only try and solve the same problem for 100 years, you can pretty darn good at solving it after Kathy lived at and then eat, I mean, technically even died that He took one concept, the chicken sandwich and thought, how can I just do this one thing that everyone understands better than anyone else and he built an Empire and they built a mission behind it.
12:19
That I think millions of people are happy and frequent every day.
He took one concept, the chicken sandwich and thought, how can I just do this one thing that everyone understands better than anyone else and he built an Empire and they built a mission behind it.
That I think millions of people are happy and frequent every day.








0:00
And so, I think it's, like, do I want to be the artist, or do I want to be the entrepreneur?
Both of them are fine.
It depends.
Which one you feel like you're more naturally inclined to, or have a higher likelihood of success doing.
I feel like I've been decent enough to not make one of them.
The constraint.
Welcome to the game where we talk about a get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:23
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
The previous guests on this podcast called make out at said.
We're in happy when our expectations of how we think life is supposed to be going, are unmet and in that there's something very sort of linked what you just said there.
0:39
Which is we have this external expectations set by Instagram or whenever by People Like Us who are in a position of Financial Freedom and have built an audience who you know, admire those people for what they've achieved.
0:57
And if someone wants to be admired they think.
Well I need to be like Right.
And that it I could be working in a shop actually objectively like subjectively having a great time in the shop but I look up at Alex and go my life sucks, right?
And in like so in that I'm like, it's very difficult because of Express the pressure folks.
1:15
Don't like, I was just thinking when you said it, then I was thinking this whole idea of like, passion and purpose is probably like, 60 years old.
Yeah.
People, it is our brand-new and it probably originated when we were like connected, you know, like radio TV, all of this.
Add meat advertising which made us change our expectations of our own lives when living in the village and like, helping out at the bakery, was probably delivered the same amount of Happiness call happiness than being on the private jet and whatever else those.
1:43
Now, I think most people are just as happy and just like your 50% happy. 50% sad for most of your life.
If you're in an extreme circumstance than change your life.
If you're not like conditions, like people get handicapped, they break their legs or, you know, they can never move again, and they have a dip in there.
2:00
Subjective well-being.
And they go back to the same Baseline.
And so like the Baseline is independent of conditions.
And so the world wants to tell us that we need to change our, you know, change our circumstances.
And then we will be whatever.
But like every modern religion, every Buddhist monk will tell you that all of that is from the inside, not the outside but these woods and why does that mean you?
2:21
Yeah, Ken's.
I don't follow.
Yeah, dude because I'm sure that you've experienced like the attainment of a goal and then I just need three times more.
Yeah I'm referencing a study there where they asked people how much money they would need to be happy and all the way up the income wealth Spectrum.
2:36
People said three times more than they have now.
So people would 10K said 30 people with three million said you know, 69 million 3 times 3.
Yeah.
And you imagine you still experience that now right?
Yeah, different reasons.
2:53
But yeah, for sure when is enough enough?
I don't think it's enough think.
I think it's more like who I want to be who you want to be or be the person capable of Doing that doing X, I will get to a billion and then after billion I'll make it ten.
3:08
I already know that.
You don't even be like I love playing the game.
What is the game game of business?
To what end or just just for the play to play.
Yeah, I'm sure you know, more about this than I do but like, just Game Theory like the finite and infinite games Simon sinek has a great piece on it.
3:27
But yeah, with infinite games, you have known and unknown players.
You have no greed upon rolls and the point of the game is to keep the game going.
And so a lot of people take a finite game, where you have known only known players agreed upon rules and asset outcome for winning.
3:44
NG and they will apply to an infinite game.
So people are like, I wanted to apply a finite contract to health.
Like I want to win how it?
So you don't win Health like okay, you're in shape.
Now, what you stay in shape, you keep staying in shape, I want to win at marriage, you don't win it marriage, you keep the marriage going, that's playing the game of marriage.
4:01
If you want to win it business, keep playing the game of business.
And so we want to take these finite contracts and put them on on infinite games.
And I think that's where people get it.
Get in trouble because they're, they're like, I have to keep moving the goal post, but if the go A post is to play then you win by playing and so forth, a tree like sure we set goals for the company but like I'm a thousand percent, super motivated and at the same time we never had it.
4:23
I'm just going to be happy that I was able to play.
I also know that in three generations.
Everyone will forget who I am.
I saw your post about the queen.
Yeah, it was a status.
No, no, it wasn't, it wasn't for me if I'm being honest but but it's an interesting comment.
4:40
What did the police say, was she amassed more wealth than 99.99% of the world?
She ruled for 70 years, was a female Monarch, which is insane.
Especially, seven years ago.
Just like all this had amazing family.
All this amazing, whatever.
I don't know the tabloids you do.
4:58
And when I posted it have been, I think five or six months since she had died.
Exactly.
And like you probably haven't thought about her today except for this post, she probably accomplish more in her life then we probably will.
So, if you are afraid of other people thinking about, you just remember the six months after you died, they're not going to be.
5:20
And so, it's like we have all these fears about other people, but like most don't even show up to your funeral because they're going to be busy.
And so, like I think about death all the time.
And that's that's what I think.
For me, has given me a lot of freedom to take big shots because, like, at the end of the day, I think that it's not going to matter.
5:39
No one's going to remember people in Thailand.
Don't know who I am today.
Let alone in 5-10 years, 100 years.
It's a trap that the mind can quite easily fall into.
They thinking, you are the center of the universe.
And with, that comes an immense amount of way in pressure and anxiety.
Totally, I have a trick.
5:56
I've never talked about this before, but whenever I feel myself slipping into the Trap of kind of overstating, my importance, what I mean by that is like thinking, my problems are big problems, I go on YouTube and I type in There's this one video that shows a camera on Earth that just zoom out and it keeps going and eventually Earth becomes this tiny Speck.
6:21
Then Earth becomes this tiny Speck which is the Galaxy than the Galaxy becomes this tiny Speck in a bunch of galaxies.
Then you can't see any of it anymore.
And then also this idea that like a hundred years ago, I didn't feel anything didn't think anything.
Nobody knew me a hundred years from out exactly what you said.
Absolutely.
6:36
I mean, if I can five minutes after I die, I think I'll sure but and that feels really liberating I like relieves of stress from my body.
Which is an interesting thing because a lot of people don't like thinking about the death, you know, another way of thinking about yeah all the time I know from doing this podcast that a lot of people won't click if we post something about death, they weren't because they don't even want to confront the concept of it.
6:59
People are afraid of it just because they don't understand it.
I like the Hate Thing.
How do you feel about that?
I'm good with it?
When you say I'm good with it, what do you mean?
If I die tomorrow?
I'm good with it.
Like, I want to leave it all on the field.
7:19
I'm going to try as hard as I can, and I know that.
No one remember me, on a long enough time Horizon.
And I'm good with that.
Like, I'm cool with it.
If I told you that I died tomorrow, would you be sad?
I probably here with Layla a little, I guess, a little more than I always do.
7:40
But like, I would say, I wouldn't be sad.
I'd be bummed.
Be like, man, there's all the shit I want to do, but I don't think I'd be like depressed.
I think I'd be, I mean, my due to be fair.
Maybe I'll find out and maybe I'll get hit by a bus tomorrow, but no, I think like, I've lived life the way I want to live life and I'm good with it.
8:03
If you were to go today, had you really like giving it everything, had you lived, the life you feel like you were really destined to live.
Me absolutely an interesting mine Trek around the same topic is so when when Betty White dies right at 99 or whatever like people are like she lived a good life but when Kobe dies before his time, right?
8:26
It's a big deal.
And I see that as a contrast between expectations and reality and I'm going to tell a story that hopefully people don't take the wrong way, but I had a cat and really like the cat and it died at 2 years old.
8:43
Really like that young guy, heart thing, or something, whatever.
Now we're being, like really bummed about it.
And I was like, huh?
How can I not think this?
And so is like, the only reason I'm bummed is because I think that he should have should being the big word that Everyone likes to you.
8:59
He should have lived longer.
I was like, what if cats only lived six months and I got to have him for two years.
I was like, I'd probably be pretty stoked about that.
And all of a sudden I was significantly less sad about it.
I was like, I got to have him for two years.
9:15
I was like awesome.
And so I think like for for me for us, whatever, if we were to change our expectations, like people think they should live until everyone thinks they're going to do 100, which is kind of interesting because like the average life expectancy, 74.
9:31
And if you're like 36-year middle-aged, if you actually do the math which no one wants to do being middle-aged 36, ya know, right?
I'm gonna go Yeah, but I think if we shift our expectations that like expectations thing, it's that it's the thing, right?
9:47
And so we can, if we expected, if I expected that I was supposed to have lived 20 years and I made it to 33, stoked, Jesus lived at the 33 did a lot more than I have, you know what I mean?
And so I'm good with it.
If I die tomorrow, like only reason I would be upset as if I demanded from the universe that I live longer but like 500 years ago, average life expectancy was like, 35, you know, it was just not like Dark Ages working hard.
10:17
We talked about repetitions earlier, working hard is quite a controversial Topic in 2023.
I'll just weird.
Do you see what I mean though?
Yeah.
I'm probably not in the circles where its controversial but they're like grab these controversial know, my God it's controversial in the sense that there's like toxic work, you know there's toxic hard work and there's I think Society prescribes a certain amount of work which is good.
10:48
Yeah.
By their definition of like I'm going to say some stuff that's going to bother some people.
I work all the time I have no Hobbies besides Working out.
If you can consider that a hobby, like four times a week, that's it.
I work all the time.
That's all I do.
And I work until I can't work.
11:05
Meaning like my output per unit of time, starts to drop precipitously, and I know that I just need to take a break of some sort.
And then, I usually binge some sort of Television because that's what for me.
Work.
Some people like I Garden.
That's not me.
Netflix, I'm good.
You know?
I mean, we're dark room in a movie theater Rockin. , And that's okay.
11:23
Like why do I need to take their expectation of what they want with?
Like they're like, that's not healthy.
I'm like Define healthy.
I do as much as I can of the thing that I want to do with every minute of my day.
Why is that not healthy?
Why do you want me to do something that I would prefer to do less?
Because I do what I do every item of the day because it's what I want to do. almost like how dare you cast your expectation of your life onto me and to be fair, the same degree They can now work at all.
11:51
Doesn't affect me.
Like I'm a, I'm a big big advocate for destroying should the word in general should is just like the expectation, motor of, like all of our psyches, you should go to school.
You should get a degree.
You should do this job, you should marry her.
12:08
You shouldn't stay up.
So late, you shouldn't work so hard.
You shouldn't you should be more balanced.
You shouldn't be working out so much.
You're not working out like it's there's all these shoulds that other people tell us, it's like and you zoom out.
And then you see The Galaxy with a little dot of dust it's like, should what there is no should do what you want to do, at least, that's how I see the world.
12:30
That pressure applies to both ends of the spectrum, doesn't it?
Because people that quote unquote, overworked.
They get hit come back into the middle and that people that under work, they get here, work harder and then the presumption there and within Society is that there's this sweet error in the Middle where it's optimal.
12:45
And like, the question book should become, they're like, what is the measurement?
Like what are we measuring?
Is it, are we measuring when we're defining this amount of work as good work or healthy whatever?
Is that is the real measurement?
My happiness and fulfillment.
In your view is that what you're like?
13:02
Is that your measurement?
Or is it just fucking how you feel?
I work because I enjoy working.
And I'm sure that if I stop enjoying working, I won't work as much like just being really, like not being perp.
I'm not being simplistic to be, you know, Annoying.
13:19
I work because I enjoy working and if I, and if for some reason I didn't get reinforcements from work, I'm sure that my amount of work would go down.
Is there?
Is there a, I think about the human needs?
Yeah.
But are there any human needs that Are being sacrificed by always working in your case.
13:40
I'm good.
Yeah, I mean which gets to the point in the measurement, which is like, how do I feel?
I'm good.
Yeah, I a lot of people really overanalyze lot of things and like I don't think what I do.
I do I just spent a lot of time thinking about death and things like that, but I usually use those frames to give myself permission to do the things that I want to do and just do them without hearing the Judgment.
14:02
That I know that other people would probably cast on my life.
Like, why don't you have kids because I haven't wanted to yet.
And that's okay.
And if I want to later, I will I'll okay.
I'll tell you an argument that I got into.
So I was at you got into an argument, I did, I got into an argument with my stepmother.
14:23
So Layla's, father's whatever.
It doesn't matter, okay?
It wasn't her different person.
It's fine.
Anyways, I was at the kitchen table and She said I would never want your life.
14:40
And I was like what she was like, it's so unbalanced.
I was like, okay how I was like do you feel like I'm not in shape physically?
I was like do you feel like Business-wise financially.
I'm I'm not fit.
14:58
Do you feel like romantically like my marriage is in some way like not good and so I like wood, where do you feel like I'm unbalanced or it's just that I do more than you or I do things differently than you do because the same degree I wouldn't want your life and that's why I don't have your life and that's why you don't have my life.
15:18
So it's good that we don't want to know each other's lives because that would be tough, wouldn't it?
and so that was the argument that we got into in in so many words and it just came down to the idea that like, I think, That person was casting judgment on themselves because maybe on some level, maybe they did want some aspect of the life that we had and that hope that doesn't sound like weird.
15:40
But it's just like, I think we all do this, we see something we're like and we look at our Delta and then we either say, man, I would like that or we cast stones at it so that we don't feel bad to our ego.
It's like, no, there's something wrong with it, they're not happy whatever.
And I just, I would say that if there's one thing that I will try and beat out of me until I die is caring, what other people think and I think everybody cares what other people think and I think over time we just care a little bit less.
16:06
And so I feel like I'm 30 percent better than I was 10 years ago and maybe in 10 years I'll be like 30 percent better than that.
But that 30% has been very meaningful for me because it's enabled me to do things.
I got married in eight days.
No, no.
My parents were there and I'm cool with it.
Because that's what I wanted to do.
16:24
And I work with my wife, every hour of every day and people like, is that healthy?
I'm like, I don't know.
We like it, why do you care?
Like, how does it affect you?
He's here.
He's a trap though.
I can relate in many.
Yeah, in many ways to what you're saying.
And I mean my team will know that instinctively one of the traps we can fall into one of the risks.
16:43
When we have that perspective is that we kind of cast that expectation on others.
People that work with us.
I think entrepreneurs often times when they have that drive, which is sometimes driven by a shame or an insecurity that comes from my childhood too often so often maybe not too often.
17:00
But so often that when they lead people who don't have that same insecurities, shame, whatever that predisposition to, you know, workaholism, whatever you want to call it.
They struggle to relate.
17:16
You know.
Yeah.
Have you have you heard that?
Sure.
I think that's okay.
Have you had to work on that?
Layla's better, I say that judgment.
But like I'm realistically, I think, we try to maintain a culture of high performance and we're like on the screening Parts, on the front end loader, like, these are the values.
17:34
We have, here are examples of those values at play, so it's like if your shift ends at 5:00.
And somebody asks, a question that's going to take 30 minutes to answer at 4:59.
What do you do?
This interview question.
We're like and we need you to be honest because if you say you would work, but you'd actually be dissatisfied, you're not going to do either of us Justice because you'll come in and you'll get fired quickly, and that'll be hard for you and hard for us.
17:58
So like we want you to win at whatever you do in life.
So Layla's very big on like human first in terms of how she does everything that we do in the company is like human first and everything else.
You can tell that's why I like we are Yin and Yang for the see this kind of thing.
But I think it's really just about expectation setting and being very truthful and us.
18:16
Transparent as humanly possible about like this is what we expect.
If you don't like that or if your worldview, is contrary to this, then you shouldn't work here because there's another company that totally shares your worldview and you would do great there and there's other people who feel like Misfits in the companies that they're in and then work all the time and they're frustrated that no one else does and they are all like telling them they should slow down.
18:37
Come hang with us because we'll work will respond slack at 5 a.m. on Saturday because we're on that's the like I just I just hardcore.
Back, there is a right way to do things.
In that example, you've touched on something I want to talk about which relates to your first book, I believe offers making offers to be there.
18:57
I read that you said if there's one skill you have it's making offers.
What do you mean by making offers?
So offers are the terms of exchange.
So I right before I started my first gym, I went to this weekend, Workshop to learn how to Market and get this this 2013.
19:19
It was on Facebook ads and so I got lucky.
So I learned how to run Facebook ads in 2013, two weeks before I started my gym.
This is when you're getting Penny clicks and you could put a girl with a bikini and say weight loss click here and it would run and so At this thing, I had an open by Jim yet and the guy was like a gym marketing, dude.
19:41
And he said, do you know the secret to sales?
Because you could see I was way over my head.
All the other guys there were gym owners except for me and I was like, yeah, because I'd never at that point had never sold anything.
Not even know the word sales was the thing that's how out of it when I was.
And so he pulled me over the side and he asked me that question.
I like pull my notebook out to like learn the secret to sales.
19:57
Is those one line and it kind of was he said, make people in offer they'd be they feel stupid saying, no to And I like wrote it down, highlighted it and that actually became like a core concept that we do.
And every business, every business that we have which is like how can you make this offer better?
20:15
How can we make it more valuable?
And that was why defining value is such a key thing, because people like provide more value make valuable content like Miss mean.
And so, we boiled down value into four variables and then there's things that enhance value.
20:31
But like core variables and then things that enhance it.
So, like one is like, what is the overall dream outcome of the, the customer.
And so a difference in juxtaposition is like, for it guys, if I say I can help you make more money versus I can help you lose weight.
Most guys would pay more for the thing that we give them more relative status.
20:46
And so in that way between two types, two categories of outcomes, this one will be more reliable.
Okay, cool.
Now within everything, and let's call it weight loss because it's an easy.
One of them can understand within weight loss.
Every other thing between a five dollar ebook and a 50,000 hour life o suction surgery, the difference in those prices are the other value variables.
21:06
And so the second variable is perceive like it of achievement which is if I buy this thing, How likely do?
I think I will get the outcome and so if I have a That's going to do this liposuction for example, and it's the first surgery they've done out of medical school and there's another surgeon that has done 10,000 and has 10,000 five stars, which one would I be more likely to go to the 10,000 five-star surgery?
21:28
Even if it takes, you takes that guy less time to do it, how unfair?
But my perceived - getting what I want significantly higher.
So it's actually the equal opposite of risk.
Those are the things that we try and enhance in the offers we try and have a very compelling dream.
I'll come try and make it very likely that they're going to succeed and give there's lots of elements that make someone feel like it's likely they'll succeed.
21:48
On the bottom, half the equation.
So it's a fraction.
There's two on the top to the bottom.
You have time delay between when they buy and when they get.
So if someone were able to click a button on a website and immediately look at the stomach and have a six-pack, that would be incredibly valuable right on the flip side, if it takes them two years in order to get that, it's significantly less valuable.
22:09
And so for that same reason, you have to arm wrestle, someone to get them to buy a personal training package, used to spend an hour and a half to get them to buy a 20 pack of trading trading sessions where As women walk into the doctor's office to do liposuction and drop 20 times that amount of money because the time delay is nothing, you get on the table, you wake up and you think right?
22:29
Then the last the last variable is effort and sacrifice which is two sides of the same coin.
So effort are the things that you have to start doing that.
You don't want to do as a result of this purchase waking up early getting sore like in the workout example.
Eating Foods, you hate on the flip side, the sacrifice of the things that you have to give up that.
22:48
You don't want to give up as a result of this purchase and so that might be sleeping in eating the foods, you enjoy margarita, Monday's, whatever, and so when we look at these variables, each of them has a has a evil twin, right?
So you've got proceed like of achievement to the positive and then, you've got risk, which is the - you've got a time delay, which is the negative version, you've got speed, which is the positive version.
23:07
You've got effort and sacrifice, you've got, he's right, and so when we're trying to make an offer, we try and think through Ooh, each of these elements of value and think, how can we maximize the upside?
Make it super, super likely, they're going to hit it paint the vision that they have it and then on the bottom side, minimize the time delay between when they bind when they get and how much they have to do because in a perfect world, The the moment someone says, I want that thing that beautiful dream outcome, they would be virtually guarantee.
23:31
They would get it, it would happen immediately and would be effortless.
And I think that is the perfect ideal that we look at in terms of value.
And as entrepreneurs, we innovate our way to just keep trying to Chisel towards that.
Perfect ideal outcome that will never actually get to the other.
Balls are like scarcity.
If I have one gatorade bottle left on planet Earth, it's significantly, more valuable.
23:48
I didn't change anything about the bottle itself, but it's significantly more valuable than if there's unlimited Gatorades right.
Urgency is if Gatorade no matter how many Gatorades there were on planet Earth, I'll give it an example.
If JK Rowling decides that she's no longer in a Cell Harry Potter digital copies ever.
24:04
Again, as of tomorrow there will be a lot of sales of the digital copy, even though there's unlimited units, Scarcity is a function of units, urgent to the function of time.
And so scarcity and urgency add to the value by enhancing those other four variables, there's more but like, those are the core things that we look at in terms of when we're trying to make an offer for a business.
24:25
And so that becomes very relevant.
When we're trying to increase price for a business that we take on.
So, I'll give you an example.
We had a PR Company that we invested in.
That was a generic PR Company for like small business owners.
And they had really high turn but they had a really good sales engine.
24:42
I was like okay, like there's something here but like I think we needed to I just really like the founder. 85 percent of customers, were small business owners and turned out in like three or four months, 15 percent of customers bought the most expensive package and stayed like forever.
24:58
And was like, hey, crazy idea, what if we only serve these customers and they were people who wanted to get fundraising very different than the traditional like dry cleaning, store polymer, or whatever. /.
And so we redid the entire business model around finding only that Niche we only cold called cold, email.
25:16
People who were in that very narrow window, we're able to 10x our prices because we and we got higher response rates that emails then we did before, because now, we were targeting and speaking very specifically to an avatar.
And now, we can provide so much more value to that specific person.
25:31
And so that's the maybe if Caleb or dancer, the from a business perspective, like solving that equation is The thing that I enjoy the most because it is how I feel like I've unlocked the most value in a business, which is like, what are all the, what are all the good things?
25:48
This business has, what are all the things it can do?
Okay, is there a way that we can rearrange it for a specific customer that will make significantly?
That will make what we do significantly more valuable to them and then that's what we try and repackage.
And when we do that, that's oftentimes when we get like with Jim watch for me, I had the knowledge of how to Help people, lose weight have the the nutrition plans.
26:11
I knew how to sell, I knew how to Market, but it was only when I like rearrange the variables that I went from making a few million dollars a year and top-line revenue and basically no profit to millions and millions of millions of dollars a year in Top Line and bottom line profit simply by rearranging the variables.
26:26
And that was just so ingrained in me that from that point going forward.
I was like, I just have to make things that are so good.
That people will feel stupid saying?
No, and if we can't get enough people to say, yes, we need to make the offer better and to me, It's been like the single thing that it affects all aspects of the business.
26:42
It's the highest leverage thing I think you can do in the business, which is why it was the first book.
Because answering the question, what do I sell is the first book, the second book leads is to whom.
Do I sell it?
I gotta get leads, right?
That's the second book but that affects pricing, it affects profit, effects marketing, it affects sales effects delivery like getting the offer affects everything and it's one of the hardest things to change because it affects everything, but it also has the most ability to unlock incredible wealth or value.
27:08
In a business.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
27:26
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
And the concept there is incredibly transferable when you could go into the equation founded in some part similar to equation.
27:47
We used to have Four competitions when we try to get people to sign up to competitions.
The idea when we start like a, it was an equation where on one end little investment.
So just click here and you're entered High perception that you have a chance of winning.
So if there's 10 prizes and you can see those 10 entrance, your brain goes, okay.
28:04
All I had to do is click.
And then in the competition aspect, we thought a lot about credibility because that's a big factor in competitions like do I think anyone's going to win and do a trust these people to even give out a prize and it's even the same thing and it's even the same thing in content when you're thinking about a title for your YouTube videos.
28:28
Five minutes six pack abs yeah is a fantastic equation.
It little investment high potential reward apparently and that's also a you know, there's even another thing which I've thought about which I'm not been able to necessarily explain which is why people are more likely to click on things.
28:46
I guess it's he's when it says things like five steps to finding love versus like how to find love mm5 steps.
I guess it's that he's Point.
Feels more accessible.
Five steps.
Yeah.
Proceed - achievement hmm like what's my risk of not achieving if there's five steps that feels easier than just how to maybe.
29:05
Hmm when you when you think about where you are in your journey as an entrepreneur, And you think about it.
Maybe it's like Steps.
How far are you at that staircase?
29:22
Would you not know?
I was like I felt like that was going to be the question that you're going to ask.
And I was thinking I was like I feel like every entrepreneur feels like they're just getting started.
Like you talk to guys in their 70s.
Like I'm just getting started, you know?
I mean I'm about to cross a decade of being I am, right?
29:38
Just at the decade point for me from the first business, I started to now.
So I feel like I've got a few seasons left.
You know.
If I can keep living which I'd be stoked about if I can let me ask a different question than Caleb.
In the corner who works for.
29:53
He's a great director of Caleb said to me, you know, Caleb said to you.
He said Alex, I want to be a millionaire though.
What would you say to him?
What advice would you give to me?
Says, listen.
I've heard you doing all these podcasts.
30:08
You running around and we've been filming the camera but I've been filming.
I've been listening.
Yeah.
And this millionaire stuff.
This sounds amazing.
Yeah.
So what advice how old are you?
Caleb 29.
What advice would you give to 29 year old Caleb if he said to you, Alex, how do I, how do you knowing me?
How do you think I become a millionaire?
30:25
There's a lot of ways to do.
It depends on which way you want to go.
So, so first off, you can stay at acquisition, not come.
That'll probably happen on a long enough time Horizon, just because we're going to get really big.
We're already pretty big and we're just getting started.
So like I genuinely believe that and that's 100% my goal.
30:42
Is that every single person that that we have becomes very, very wealthy because I'm going to die and it's not going to matter anyways and if anybody else can make some to great so that is a path.
Another bath is he peels off and goes on his own and starts a business of some sort and so it depends on whether he wants to make the business itself.
31:00
What is core skill is which would be like media and maybe services around Media or using the skill that he has a media in an opportunity to get two or three other people to maybe co-founded with who have other complementary skills.
And then he just runs that division or portion of the business within the larger context and that's like a classic question of like, I'm really good at making wallets like What do I do?
31:24
It's like well you can continue to make them and then when you can't make as many as you have demand because you're so good at it, you can either raise the price and just continue to keep raising the prices until eventually become Versace of of wallets.
And you make tons of profit but you don't have tons of units and that's okay.
31:40
And your luxury brand or you put on the put on the business owner hat.
And you say, okay, how do I mechanize the wallet building process and I become more business e and so I think it's like do I want to be the artist or do I want to be the entrepreneur?
Both of them are Fine.
It depends.
Which one you feel like you're more naturally inclined to, or have a higher likelihood of success doing.
32:00
I like the game of business.
I played lots of different games in terms of Industries, like I like the game overall.
I don't feel like I have a particular art.
Like, I don't think I'm really good at any aspect of business.
I feel like I've been decent enough to not make one of them.
The constraint like I'm not a great copy writer but I'm good enough.
32:15
That that's not going to be the limiter.
Like I'm good enough.
Like I'm good enough at hiring that I can make sure that that's not the limiting factor, right?
And so that's kind of how I think about in terms of business growth overall and should be the same thing with Caleb was like we have to identify with the constraint of the system is and then D constrain it.
32:32
When you say talents talking, if I do say that you times, what do you mean by that?
So this is one of my favorite topics.
Many skills.
Like one plus one equals five when you put them together.
So, let's say, you have someone who's really good at math in the beginning that of, as a skill.
32:50
Not super monetizable, right?
Okay.
Well, then you learn bookkeeping.
Okay, well now you had a proclivity for math but you learn something that has value in the business World, okay?
Then you learn to you, get your CPA and I become an account, okay.
More valuable.
Then you start studying around tax law and insurance and you're like, oh, significantly more valuable then Learn how to how Capital markets work, and how debt markets work, right?
33:14
And, and you understand how mergers and Acquisitions work, and all of a sudden you're a CFO and then you learn how to sell and promote a little bit, all of a sudden, now you're a Rainmaker and so you still need to be good at math but when you stack these other skills on top of it.
The original math skill becomes significantly more valuable when you have these skills on top but each one kind of requires the one before which is why one of Things I Hate About kind of the entrepreneur World a little bit is like Learn something new and then poopoo the thing before it's like, I'm not upset of the teacher taught me arithmetic.
33:45
As I learned algebra, one was necessary for the next and so as entrepreneurs, a lot of times it takes, I think the self-awareness to say, like, where am I at on my skill, stacking Adventure, right?
34:00
And each skill, every school, you add to your skill to about makes the rest of your skills more Bible, which is why I think it's so cool.
Which is why I'm such a big advocate for Education overall.
That's I mean Mission a Cuisine economic business accessible to everyone.
That's why I put all this free stuff out.
34:15
There is his like, if we can give people enough skills, they'll be able to stack them on their own and then just achieve whatever they want in a totally different way.
If you'll allow me to go, there is like you look at Jay-Z, right?
Maybe use some of you naturally have rhythm, right?
And so then all of a sudden he learned how to wrap, okay?
Took his rhythm put in the rap, okay?
34:31
And then he made his first GD, okay.
And then he learned how to promote who significantly more valuable and then he learned how to make a label and then you learn Recruit other artists.
And so he still needed to learn how to know how to promote the other artists.
34:47
If you did, how to promote it, all you wouldn't be able to do it.
But once you have the label, you got significantly more leverage on the skill of promotion and he could recognize people because of his skill in wrapping and Rhythm and so like each of these skill stacks on top and then eventually he pinnacled into Beyonce as his top scale.
35:04
I'm just kidding.
Where's he going?
But no but like that's the idea.
So like and that's why I'm just like Learn the skill, find the next skill.
And and the nice thing is that it doesn't even matter how desperate the skills are like if Jay-Z is really good at math and understands Capital markets and understands the label.
35:22
Those combined to another cool melange with little French work like mix of skills.
That's like unique to Jay-Z and the longer you play the game, the more skills you get in, the more unique you are.
Mix of skills is and that to me is like the coolest part about business and just like education in general.
35:39
I stumbled across a bit of a similar, but maybe adjacent idea in my career, where, when I learnt, when my company went public on a Stock Exchange in Europe, I then learned from an investment Bank, when we're having the meetings with the bank's you want on this road show met 20 different investment Banks were considering an IPO in another country.
36:02
They told me that our business would be worth four times more if it was just on a different stock.
If you move it to the NASDAQ, the exact same business would be worth four times more, which meant that, my net worth would be 4X just by taking the exact same business and moving it to a different Stock Exchange.
36:20
And I thought about that.
I'm a couple years later when I was thinking about the skill set that I had acquired over my career which was this skill set of marketing and social media and Entrepreneurship.
And I was thinking you have to do not just have the skill but know what Market to apply it to and what ended up happening.
36:38
I've never told this story before, but I looked I looked for an industry where my skill set was in least Supply but highest demand and return the greatest and it turned out that industry in terms of social media, marketing and storytelling.
36:54
I felt was most in demand and would return the greatest value for companies that were about to IPO.
Because essentially, when you're going to IPO, if you have a good story, it can swing your valuation by hundreds of millions or in the case of the first compare worked with When their IP listed at 3 billion billions.
37:15
Well and so my skill set of social media and marketing, I could do what with it.
I could go help a local gym and get paid a thousand bucks.
Or I could go help a company that was in the lead up to an IPO that was, you know, where I can potentially have hundreds of millions in value and take seven million.
Yeah, as part of an equity deal.
37:32
So upon leaving my first company, the equity Arrangement that I had was valued Somewhere between four, I'm going to say between depends because I share prices fluctuate.
It I think on the day of the IPO, the equity that I got for the, for the 9 to 12 months work that I'd done was worth in the region of 7 to 8 million dollars, right?
37:53
Nine months work.
Yeah, basically freelance.
Yeah.
You know, same skill stack, but applied to an industry that would pay me more for the same skills.
And so I thought a lot about that and that's ultimately why we start our company which is now called flight story.
We have Probably the time of the Airing this about 100 people.
38:10
We started to come in about a year and a half ago.
Oh great that's basically that supplying the skill set.
We have two industries where that need it and we started out in the IPO Market did a little bit of work in this biotech market and now we've kind of broadened out, but people don't think about that a lot.
38:25
You like my skillset, whereas, in host a morning can pay the most 100%, I thoroughly agree with everything you just said.
I also think that that's a skill.
I just wanted to set it to me unless it's like information to because the most like, you know, that the biggest debt, one of the things that I I love set saying this but like the biggest at all of his pay is ignorance.
38:50
And so I heard this close at this pitch years ago and this guy got on stage in the end he was like, Hey ma'am.
She was like, how much do you make?
She was like, fifty thousand dollars, your fifty thousand dollars on the Whiteboard and then you wrote a million dollars on top of the 50,000.
39:05
He subtracted.
It and said no. 250,000.
He said you pay life 950 thousand dollars every single year for not knowing how to make a million dollars a year and it was a crazy concept.
He was using it to close the audience but I like the most expensive thing that all of us are paying for is the information that we don't know.
39:23
And that's like both frightening and also incredibly exciting because like fish in the best ponds, right?
Like a good fisherman knows where to fish and everybody can put a hook and a thing and stick it over the water but like the best fishermen know.
Where and when etcetera, and that's exactly the story that you said was like, I had the hook and I had the real and all that stuff.
39:42
Like, I went to where the best for the best fishing was and like to meet at skill.
Same work?
Yeah, I'm out time.
Same wrought or zeros, When the things in the first book is like you want to like sell better customers so if you want to sell better customers.
39:58
Yeah.
Like this, it's the exact same thing.
You just said which is like if I were to do cro work.
So conversion rate optimization for a website that's e-commerce and I work for store that's doing a million dollars a year and I say cool I'm able to increase your conversion or site by 20%.
Okay cool.
So now that's doing 1.2 million dollars year.
40:15
I made two hundred thousand dollars in value and maybe I can get 10% of that.
I get 20 grand.
Okay, cool I do the same.
Work to a business doing a hundred million dollars a year.
I make them 20 million dollars for my 20 percent bump and I get 10% that and I make two million dollars.
Hmm, 20,000 two million 100x.
40:33
Same work to your point and to me that's skill like to know that symbol simple fact.
Like I had this tweet that was super viral which was solve rich, people problems, they pay better a lot of controversy around that but it's true and so find the people and a different way of saying it is find the people who value, what you have the most And I'm sure you've heard this of your, the story of the, the father, and the son with the car.
41:02
No.
Okay.
So maybe I have fun.
Okay, that's enough.
No, it's good.
It's good.
So there's there's a father who gives his son an old beat-up car and he says you know, hey I don't know if it drives or not but you can take it down to the dealership down the street, see if you can trade and get some money, he's like, okay.
41:20
So he goes down, the street goes to the dealership, they say, give you 1,000 bucks for it and he come, you know, here's a map because back home, he's like, Dad, they say, give me. 1,000 bucks.
He's like, okay.
He's like go to the impound yard, where they, you know, break the cars up, just for Metal.
He's like see what they'll give you goes there and the guys like this might be 500 bucks of metal kid like you know comes back home is like Daddy knows.
41:42
It was me $500.
He's like okay he's like hey go down to Street to that that antique dealership see if they've got anything that used car lot.
He's like, okay, she goes down there.
Talk to the guy comes back home.
Super-sized like Daddy won't believe it.
He was like.
41:58
This is a historic car.
There's only like 10 of them left is like it's worth a hundred thousand dollars and so the father smiles and he's like in a less than I want you to know is that it's not necessarily who you are but the people that value the most and so you can talk to different people and go to the people who value.
42:17
And I just, I love that story because from it's a cute, it's a huge business story in terms of like sell, sell the, where the fish are, where the big fish are.
Like if you're gonna go Hook Fish, go to go where the whales are.
It takes the same word, but a lot of its just believe people think it's possible.
And so, a lot of times you have to just keep leveling up and you sell your first $10, an hour thing, you saw your first 100,000 or thing.
42:36
So your first multi-million dollar package you realize that's the exact same thing.
It's just so baby from list.
If anybody's listening right now it is the same thing.
It's the exact same thing and sometimes it's easier.
It's nobody's like you know, you've seen that mean that says like, so what exactly am I going to be getting for this fifty dollar thing, right?
42:56
And that's like Our clients like why are sent yesterday?
Like what do you else?
Do you need?
Like it's and that's totally true but I think there's a skill in understanding where to fish Certainly a skill information.
Its information.
43:12
It's even knowing that there was another Lake over there and that's why I like listening to conversations like this is so valuable to four people because it lifts a curtain and you know what the fuck you guys were behind here the whole time partying that's what my business life isn't gonna like it's like a graduate like though.
I think I had Kevin Hart described on Joe Rogan one time where he said there's this other room.
43:31
Yeah.
Where these people playing this other set of money games and then when you get in that room you get your almost pissed off that Nobody told you this room existed but then there's another door.
Yeah.
And then you get through there at maybe a couple of years later, and you find these other people, these fucking billionaires now playing another set of games, and you going what?
43:48
And they're chilling.
Yeah, that is smoking cigars.
I'm not even doing any hard work.
Can you go tell me the games that you guys have been playing in here?
Yeah.
And then again the frustration is and that's kind of what I feel like in my business life it's been like we're at the jump, I'm charging.
I don't know, I remember my first, we found our first deck from 2014 charging Remove the package.
44:08
We have gold, silver and bronze.
It was like, you know, two hundred dollar package for like support and then five hundred dollars and then the gold package where we threw everything in for a thousand dollars.
And I remember my one of my first clients and accepting that and then I think today, like the only difference, the K, the skills that are increased but information is the big thing knowing how to do it.
44:28
You know, when you think about curtains that have lifted that have really shifted the games, you play from a value money, Perspective where someone's turn the lights on you?
Of course.
Yeah.
Is there anything else that comes to mind, like big macro games there?
44:48
I think a big, you know, when the big I will answer with the stair steps of how each order of magnitude change of my income.
So when I went from being an employee to self-employed, I went from making four figures a month to five figures a month and that was for me, just like I'm now in control the level above that was, I started having other people who worked for me.
45:10
I'd even know that was possible, sounds crazy.
But like also, you can hire people because my members of my gym were like, you know, other people can work here, I'm like cleaning the floor and doing the marketing and teaching clap there.
I was like, didn't think about that can call.
Mac, right and then went to six figures a month, right?
And then from there stayed there we did the turnaround business still had the same organizational structure had another degree of Leverage and so the next if you have leverage was that, I started licensing.
45:35
So it's digital, right?
So the cost per unit cost of goods is basically nothing.
And then that's when things started skyrocketing.
That got me to seven figures a month and then it figures month was using leverage through Capital which is where you know we're at now and I would imagine that nine figures a month will probably be some level of technology or Or more media on my side.
45:55
But all of these things are about leverage and so this is like one of my favorite topics in the whole world but if we Define leverage as the difference in what you put in, what you get out.
So if you have a lot of Leverage but a little bit in, you get a lot out.
If you have no leverage or low leverage, you put a lot in to get a little bit out.
And a lot of times people who are listening to this and are not making as much money as they want it, they're putting lots of input in and not getting a lot out.
46:13
They have low leverage opportunities, and so understanding how to get more for what you put in is the game overall.
And so the first level that I described was Labor, it's just work first.
I was working for someone else, then I work for myself, then I got other people to work for me first level.
46:30
Each of those levels was more leverage above that I had media, which is the thing that I was licensing out.
So another degree of Leverage, I made it once and I could license it out.
Infinity on top of that.
I've capital I can take out but I don't have to sacrifice time in order to get something for its high input output above.
46:47
That would be some sort of Technology.
You build the code once in theory.
Obviously, you continue to Improve the code.
But theoretically you build the thing once and then a million people can use it.
And so you want to Stack as many types of Leverage as you can and as much of them as you can because like Joe Rogan also has a show and somebody else has a podcast, they both technically are using media as their as their as their vehicle for leverage, but he has significantly more of it.
47:10
So it's not just like I'm going to use all these right?
Yes.
But it's also how much into what degree but like Facebook had other people's money.
He used media had other people's work Max leverage Amazon.
Same thing, right?
They used every element of Leverage and they matched all of them out and that's that's at least the the curtain that and of all talks about this view from layering of all ramakant.
47:32
He talks about these things as the as the the elements of Leverage or four types of Leverage.
And understanding that for me, has kind of been a blueprint for wealth overall and then you know, Capital there's degrees of capital, right?
Like you first, you can get friends and family to give you money, then you can get, you know, institutional money and then you can get public.
47:52
Of money, right?
Which, you know, you saw like the IPO money.
Like the fact that the NASDAQ was 4X, the Dusseldorf exchanges number was, right?
There's just significantly more capital in that market and so it, same work more zeros and so I love this topic because I think that's fundamentally like the people who move faster in life.
48:12
Don't actually move faster, they get more for every step.
Are you happy?
I'm stoked.
Max Tok.
You know, I'm not ask this question for a long time, but I thought I'd ask because it's kind of similar to what we've been talking about today, but if, if happiness was like a list of ingredients, it was a recipe.
48:35
Is there anything missing from your recipe?
That would make you even more happy And sometimes that recipe is about balancing.
The ingredients, you need two eggs, and a hundred eggs.
Yeah, one cup of flour.
Yeah, for me, it's always been about autonomy.
I should be able to, I want to, I want to be able to do what I find interesting.
48:54
And that's that's been the core of it.
And what I do will change, but the core of having the freedom to do, it has been the center of it.
And so for me, I don't think my freedom has, I mean, not in recent history.
My freedom hasn't fundamentally changed in any way.
And so, I would say that I am the same level of contentedness as I was last year, but I find engagement.
49:18
And what I do and that, that's, that's, I'll give you my definition of Happiness, which is doing what you like to do with people.
You like, And doing that as much as you possibly can.
And that's my simple definition.
Interesting.
49:36
I've tried to I've tried to figure that out that like professional, like I guess it's not even a professional thing, but I've tried to figure out and summarize, that's a wonderful summary.
The place of I got into is if you're surrounded by people, you love.
You're doing something that challenges you which I think is an interesting one, you've kind of encapsulated, it just by saying things you like, but the challenges you gives you a sense of forward motion and progress towards a meaningful goal and that's a subjective thing could be raising a kid or making a million dollars or whatever.
50:03
I think that's kind of what I call it, my occurred.
If I find out if I'm in that state and it's a state, I think I'm happy.
We have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest asks, a question for the next guest, without knowing who they're going to be asking it to terrified.
50:24
Several get so scared, and I do this, my question, scary like everyone was alike, right?
Stick the neck.
Like, okay, I'm going to think of it was gonna get, we have these some conversation cards.
Well, we've taken all the questions written in this book and we've made them into cards.
So people can play at home.
50:41
I'm actually going to slide them over to you and just ask you to pick one conversation card, okay.
Picked a couple there that I think a stitch UPS so we go from middle, okay?
And the question is, what are the failures?
You cherish the most?
I'm gonna give 2.
51:04
I am very grateful that I hated the job that I had because I think that I am the type of person because of how hard it was for me to quit that.
If I had liked it job enough, I don't think I would have left and I think I would have gone to the business school and done the next thing.
Like if I had had a job worked for whatever it was that I enjoyed enough, just enough, I might not be where I am now and I think that I cherish the fact that it was so miserable that I got me to change.
51:32
Like that, that that job changed my life from a like Soul perspective, going through what I did with Layla, I cherish those times because a lot of people live worst case scenario years into their marriage years into their relationship, and then they kind of like see what the other person is made of.
51:54
I got to do that before I married the person, and so there haven't been any surprises since then.
And it's something that's like shared misery.
To a certain degree but like, spiritual strength or spiritual, whatever you want to call it.
I know she's got my back and there's an element to that story that I didn't tell, but when we really needed money, at one point I flew Layla out to do this launch, I couldn't go with her and I actually don't know, she broke up with her but I was like I can't do this right now.
52:26
And so for 28 days, we were not together.
And most girls people would probably been like screw this guy but instead Layla set, the all-time record for a launch that still hasn't been broken.
52:43
And when she came back, I was like she stood tall when everything in my life was crumbling around me and she like made it happen and I knew that wherever I wanted to go, I needed someone like that with me.
And so I cherish the failures that of that.
52:59
Entire season.
Because there were many because I wouldn't know what I have today.
If I hadn't been through those tests with her, then that's beautiful.
We have a another question, which is the question that people leave in the book.
I thought I'd look in the old it and I know it is it.
53:15
I think this is the new tradition.
I'm talking about the old tradition one.
Last question, Alex, but you did nail that.
So I'll be honest you stuck that Landing.
When do you feel the most emotionally connected to yourself.
Literally my like heart be thought was when I'm working like the first Harpy thought and then like if I had to be really specific when I'm in the throes of writing, I had a writing scholarship coming out of high school.
53:43
I was the vice editor of the newspaper.
I was the editor-in-chief of the literary magazine.
When I was in high school, I've enjoyed writing.
It's one of those things that for me, like you said, like challenge, like, writing is a thing, is a monster that only gets stronger and stronger and you get better and better at Doing and you see the flaws in your writing, the better you get at writing and so it always feels like it matches, the difficulty, matches my ability at all times.
54:08
And so it is the thing that I experienced the greatest degree of flow.
And the most regularly makes a lot of sense answers, a lot of questions that we talked about earlier on as well.
Alex, thank you so much for your time and being here.
It's been an incredibly diverse and enlightening and honest and vulnerable.
54:28
And Earring and soul filling conversation in so many respects.
And I know for sure, you're just at the very start of your journey, ask you about the staircase.
I know that you've just got one foot on the first step.
I think it's going to be incredible to watch the next couple of seasons of your life because you're destined for incredible things.
54:46
There's absolutely no doubt in that.
So thank you, Alex.
Appreciate your time, I appreciate that.
Thank you.
It's code words.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
And I don't have to think about it at all.
And so I just try and smooth out these little in efficiencies on as many parts of my life as I can.
So that as much of my attention gets allocated to working and doing more work.
Work and doing better work.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:39
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos Muskan Buffett a document to their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
For December of 2016 until December of twenty Twenty-One.
I went from zero to a hundred million dollars net worth at age 31, and that kind of, quote, speed of wealth accumulation didn't come from this early, doing things faster, but getting more from the work I did.
1:05
And so I get lots of questions around productivity and this particular one came from an Instagram AMA and I thought it was worth making a video about and I have refrained from making productivity type stuff mostly because I think it's a little bit of mental masturbation for most This industry to give themselves an excuse to procrastinate or not actually get work done.
1:24
And so let's define some terms before we get in.
And so I'm going to hit the many small things that I do throughout the day in terms of how I dress, how I sleep, how I work with stimulants.
I take how I take supplements, etcetera, how organized by life to ultimately be, as frictionless as possible to getting more work done and getting more from the work I do now.
1:42
Let's Define productivity right off.
The bat productivity is output per unit of time.
All right, so if you're more productive, It means you get more for the out but now productivity is really just another fancy word for leverage because it means you get more for what you put in.
And so any output is any output comes from two things, volume of inputs times, leverage equals output.
2:05
So if I pump something a hundred times and I have a little lever, I get X output.
If I pump something 200 times, I would get twice the output with the same lever or I could increase the lever Sighs.
And I would get a higher output for the same hundred.
And so when we're thinking, About productivity.
2:20
Those are the two variables.
How much are we actually working?
And what are we getting from the work we do now?
Today, most of my TED Talk is going to be focused on.
How do I clear all of the distractions around my life to facilitate me working more?
And I think that that is a wildly underestimated approach to doing this.
2:38
I think a lot of people try and say like I need to do my three, our affirmation morning routine blah blah blah, so I can be like more effective but I would have a hard time with someone arguing that three hours of not working, is going to cover.
Over three hours of working and make up for it with the other six of their day or whatever.
2:54
So I'm going to start chronologically with time and how I sleep and wake up.
So I think it's really common for people to like, masturbate to the wake up early and sufferer mentality.
Now, when I was in the gym business, I woke up at 4:00 in the morning because it was the only time I could get uninterrupted work done.
3:11
And I think that's the key lesson is that we all have to have time where we can actually work deep without interruptions.
And so, for my entire deck, Now, as an entrepreneur in business that has remained constant.
So, when I really think about the things that have contributed to the outsized returns, we've gotten, I think this is probably one of the biggest ones which is why I want to kick this off with this.
3:32
Now some people need to do it from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. because one of my good buddies a billionaire and that's that's when he works.
He jokes with me that I wake up call Early when I wake up now at about 6:00 but the thing is that the first six hours of my day so in the beginning is from 4 a.m. to 10 a.m. and now it's about from 6 to 12 for me, I work without any meetings that is blocked time.
3:49
I'm on my calendar and I'll see if I can send a screenshot with my counter looks like, but the first six of my day are empty.
The next thing is how I can facilitate that simple schedule is by always having the same sleep and wake time, so weekends and weekdays, I treat the same way and that's because for me, once I get into this Rhythm, I don't want to break that just for like a night out with the boys.
4:12
Now, mind you that's not even part of my life, but like, if that were part of my life, that would be something that I would probably not want to break it for.
And as a point of Here like Jeff Bezos wakes up a at 8 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. and then he says he pushes around for an hour and then he gets to work at night and he like to have his real meetings at 10 a.m. right.
4:29
Warren Buffett doesn't brag about waking before I am.
Alright?
And so like you can be unbelievably successful and have lots of Leverage and lots of work done without having you know it has to be at this time.
I think it's just more important that you have the time in general set aside and in terms of like optimizing your sleep environment you guys already know this stuff, there's some videos on YouTube that cover it, but like dark room, dark room, Keep it cold, make sure that you have the right amount of blankets on if you need a fan on your face and do that, get some stuff for breathing.
4:55
If you snored I you know like put put mouth tape on.
If if that works for you whatever it is like for me I have a nasal strip.
I put mouth tape on and I sleep in a dark room and like that works great for me.
I had no problems falling asleep.
Do you all the basics?
If you're not doing that, then what are we talking about?
5:10
Like the best deal in the world, which I'll get to in a second is a good night's sleep.
Everything else is just masking or enhancing that.
So next piece I'll talk about is morning routine so I basically don't have one.
I wake up and I have coffee with Layla and then I work and that's that's literally it.
5:26
That's my entire day that's my planning.
And I know what I'm going to do because most of the projects that I work on are very big and so if I'm writing a book like it's the same thing as it was yesterday.
I was going to keep writing and chipping away at the big stuff that I need to do.
Now, if you're a different different season of your life than you, probably will have more tasks to do in. - and so, obviously prioritizing those in the most important ones, I'll make you the most money to do those first talk to a lot of entrepreneurs, not doing that.
5:54
Do the ones that make you the most money first.
The next piece is like, what am I wearing all day, right?
And so, for me, I have obviously become a fashion icon.
I'm kidding, Kim Kardashian.
And I are kind of like neck and neck here with most fashionable, but no, but I this may sound silly, but each article of clothing.
6:11
You have seen me wear, I have tried on and bought usually between 50 and 100 of that exact thing.
So, different brands different sizes within each brand different makes he might be surprised.
But, like, Haynes has multiple different tank.
Tops with multiple different materials, and I'll tried multiple sizes in each one of those things.
6:28
And I do that because I like having decisions made, like, if I'm going to make the same decision over and over again, I want to just make the one best decision, front load the work and then never think about it again.
And so, I optimize my outfit primarily on temperature regulation, because one of the biggest things I hate is getting hot.
6:45
Like the worst on the flip side, if you're shivering, you're not as productive either.
And so I just want to be the right temperature whenever I can and so if I have an outfit that accommodates that easily then that's a plus for me, the next is, can I have it accommodate that in, as many different conditions as possible?
Can I have that same outfit when I go to a restaurant?
7:01
That's really nice going to have that same outfit when I go to the gym, can I have the same outfit when I go to the pool or go to the beach?
Can I have the same outfit when I walk outside for an hour or so every day which I do each of those in your mind might have a very different outfit and so I I've tried to maximize the outfit that I have so that I can only have one outfit that I wear every day all the time.
7:20
And that's why I usually have some long sleeve, that's buttoned because I can go completely bud and all the way down, when it's coldest to rolled sleeves and button to open and rolled sleeves to completely off with the tank top.
And these shorts.
For example, I can wear it to the gym.
7:37
They stretch their tear-free, they have pocket from my cell phone, they've pocket for my for anything on the side of the velcro.
They're big enough. if that they can actually fit my legs, And they actually don't ride up my crotch which most elastic shorts do and these ones are just light elastic.
7:53
So it stays right above my quad, which for me, makes me look pretty.
And so I tried on 100 ish pairs of shorts to get these sort.
This also has belt loops, if I want to wear a belt, to make it dress up if I feel like it and it has a zipper because I prefer having zippers and even my Footwear, like this is, like finding Footwear was probably the hardest of all the things that I've done because I wanted it to the Footwear that I wear to be nice and ugly.
8:17
Be able to walk without making the shoe smell after, like weeks of use, I wanted to be able to walk without my foot sweating, I wanted them to also be waterproof.
I want to be able to go to a nice restaurant in them, but I also wanted a good ventilation, a heavy order and I want to be able to work out with them and train hard.
8:35
So I could have one pair of shoes that checks all the boxes and it took me it took me 15 months of like probably 10 pairs of shoes a month.
Now mind you, if you're like that's a waste.
We actually return them but I wear them, I try them and then like know and you're like, wow, what a waste time, I have a team and they can they can do that for me.
8:52
And for me, the big output here is that now when I put on what I wear every day, I feel great and I don't have to think about it at all.
And so I just try and smooth out these little in efficiencies on as many parts of my life as I can.
So that as much of my attention gets allocated to working, and More work and doing better work which leads me to one of my biggest kind of hacks overall has been watering holes and so I've had a like some people have a hard time starting habits other people hard time stopping habits.
9:26
I'm very good at stopping habits.
I'm very bad at starting them.
I mean, like really saying that I in the past have had a, I've been less successful with the times I've done, but I feel like I have cracked that and I've cracked that through watering holes and so it's much easier to change your conditions than it is.
9:41
To change yourself.
And so, rather than be like, I need to be more disciplined.
What I do is I try to give myself more visual cues that are effortless, so don't take me well power and so most people have a few places in their life that they spend more time at.
And so for me, I have three, I have my kitchen table, which is where you do all my meals.
10:01
I've my work desk, which is where I work all day.
And then I have my bedside table, which is where I spend in the morning and at night, right?
And so if I want to start taking things like supplements or, Don sunscreen or X y&z, I put the stuff there.
10:17
And so when I was actually a gym owner and I would teach people how to take supplements, I would focus the vast majority of my time with them not only with the supplements did but on how they would be able to take them consistently because probably anybody watching this is bought a supplement put in a cabinet and never take it, right?
And then you wait till it goes bad and you toss it and then you buy another one and you do it for a week and then you do it over and over and over again.
10:35
So I think it's far more prone to have the system of being able to insert new stuff into your life and know that you're going to do.
Do it.
Real quick guys.
You guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
10:58
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world or someone else.
So, for me, if I have morning things, I put it from my kitchen table, because that's where I go.
11:18
And I have my coffee with Layla.
So I put it right there, so I see it as soon as I sit down.
So I don't have to think about it, for my gym, clothes back in the day.
I would ask them what's the first thing you do every morning.
And so what, somebody was brush, their teeth for something is make their coffee.
It's not have them put it next to their coffee.
That way, they'd have to think about it.
When they would go to the gym to work out, I would say, okay, well, what do you always have with you?
11:36
They're like, well, this car or this bag, I'm like, okay, I want you to keep your pre-workout, you're into work on your post-workout in your car since your cars.
I can be with you and so that's what I do.
I have a gym bag and I have all my stuff in that bag, right?
And it's always with me and so I don't forget it and then the post workout stuff and this is a little hack, I'll give you is that I actually buy the cold ones that they have in the fridge that are overpriced.
11:58
You know, those ones at the gym.
I actually buy those couple reasons one is, I like to support gyms because obviously I made all my money that space and it's kind of like my way of giving back so I was want to support small gems.
The second reason is because I actually think psychologically you reinforce working out because you get this tree at the end of working out.
I don't want to wait.
Two minutes because I will associate the reward with the activity and so I always want to give myself a little, my brain, a little, like cookie at the end of the workout for me.
12:20
First workout Shake, fits the bill and I like it cold and I like it there and then I'll have to think about it.
The final thing is nighttime stuff, right?
And so for me, that's my bedside table and so at night for me, I put my no store-bought, I put maths a pain, so I don't snore, I put ChapStick all over my face, which sounds crazy, but that's how I actually try to keep my skin nice and pretty.
12:38
And if I have like vitamins or melatonin or anything like that, that want to take a night like I teach sleep now.
Supplier, which is from Prestige Labs, great product.
But whatever sleep thing you take, you might want to take one.
And if you do, I put it there.
And that way, I don't forget it.
And so the key is having the watering holes first and then you can slide in whatever supplements you want to take.
12:57
And that probably leads pretty naturally into a quick caveat here, which is stimulants.
Right?
And so again, we're talking, how do I do more work?
How to get more from my work?
All right.
Well, if I'm awake and I'm and I'm well, rested, and I'm wearing the shit I want to wear, and I don't think about the Food that I'm going to eat which I don't think I've covered yet.
13:15
Yeah.
So let's talk about food real quick.
I've eaten.
I eat the same meals more or less every day.
So breakfast and lunch, always the same.
The Only Exception is dinner, which I was a four nights a week is the same thing.
And then three-ish nights a week I have like, business dinners and, you know, colleagues and portfolio CEOs instead of that come in.
13:32
And so on those nights, I'll eat out but because I know what I'm going to dinner with every day because my breakfast, my lunch for the same, It makes dinner really easy to eat dessert every night and still be in shape because I know how many calories I'm going to dinner with so I can just adjust my dessert accordingly.
13:49
And by doing this I have no prep, no cooking, no cleaning for any of my meals.
And that's because for me that feels like a such a waste of time and I don't mind.
And so I've had the same lunch for as long as I can remember.
And I just get my lunches delivered and my mornings are prepackaged.
This is a shake that I get pre a prepackaged shake and a bar that's prepackaged.
14:07
Very easy for me and then Inner the other four nights of the week is usually the same type of thing prepackaged meal, or we go out to a place that's prepaid like precooked food makes my life easy and I do that because I hate smell of food in the house and the idea of like prepping food and having pots and pans, staying around the house and like, cooking and cleaning up after that, like that such a huge amount of time because I remember because we so Prestige labs, for a brief moment, we had done for you meals, which is a subsidiary.
14:36
And I did tons of research on how much time people spend.
And cooking and preparing food and was actually around this time that Layla.
And I had a conversation where I asked her to stop, making me food every day because, you know, she's my wife and she wanted to do like wifely duties, but I was like you, you're worth a lot more.
Not in the kitchen.
14:52
You're with a lot more like in the business with me.
And so it was a huge relief for her because she basically got two ish hours a day, back from where she would have to, like, cut stuff, clean stuff, wash it cook, it like serve it, and then clean up all the dishes that she had only potpan cetera.
All of that was gone and we got to our h plus productive back for her time, which was great.
15:13
And for me that ultimately made me more money because if she's in the business longer than we make more money together.
But that was a big, big hack in terms of like how a few things.
Can we do that?
We have to do every day.
I'm going to briefly touch on training.
Not going to go deep on.
I'm just going to be concept of it, so rather than following any kind of strict periodization for the training that I do.
15:30
I try and get cardio and weights together by minimizing my rest.
When I work out and I try and hit every muscle group every day.
And I do that because I don't train on a consistent schedule because my business career takes precedent for me over my Aesthetics.
And so, if I have a business meeting that's going to go during the workout, then I don't go to work out.
15:49
And then I do it the next day.
And some people have strong opinions on that.
I've been working after 20 years.
Being flexible is work for me.
And so, with our workout every other day, every day or twice in a week, I don't have to worry about the fact that I haven't done legs because I missed leg day is Thursday.
And if it's not Thursday, then I skip it and I do back again.
16:06
No, I had full body every day.
And that way, no matter what duration I have in between, I still stimulate every muscle and I do it in a fast way so that can still get some cardio into.
And for me, that is what has worked.
So I don't have to think about it.
When I go to the gym is the common theme of trying to decrease the number of decisions.
16:23
I have to make on an active basis, I can allocate as much of that time to working more and being better for the work.
I do the last piece is going to be stimulants.
So this is like, lots of people have talking to tropics and like, all this stuff.
Like, I'm a big fan of stimulus, overall, but the way I do them, as actually cycle them, and so to you, Kareem Nicotine and caffeine all the ins and then you've got prescription stems from will get into but no matter which ones you're choosing to take, I think the key is cycling them in and out because if you take one thing every day, eventually become dependent on it rather than getting a boost from it.
16:54
And I realized this with caffeine and other things that I've taken on a regular basis like the first time to take another call my God, if I did this every day, you would actually feel the same.
And so I try and only heavily stimulate two-ish days we can I cycle which ones I do.
So I get the most out of them again.
Most Work, most out of it, equals output equals productivity and so combining.
17:14
All these things together has, in my opinion surrounded, my all the effortless stupid, silly decisions that people spend a lot of time on, I want to eliminate all of those things throughout the day.
So I can spend all of my mental energy on the few things that matter.
So, I've got my, my cell phone pocket, which I can immediately Answer any of the, I don't know, never calls me, but I like having it right here because it's just easy and communities.
17:40
When I sit, I can sit with it and it doesn't bother me.
If I have it right here, which is where most Schwartz have it.
When you sit you're like, what is this and you have this thing digging into you?
I hate that, right?
And then these shorts.
I can also go to the pool and because they dry Superfast but they're also super stretchy.
So I've got a lot of stretch but you can hear their their tear resistant.
17:59
They're like they're hard like I could poke these things the knife and they're like, bulletproof, not bulletproof.
But maybe they are, you know.
And so like I've tried 100-plus pairs of shorts on.
I wear these dark because if I ever get like washing my hands and I get like water on these, a rolls right off the be even if it does State, like, you can't see it as much.
18:16
Whereas, if you've got like light gray, it's like you got these splotches everywhere, right?
And so that's why I do that.
On the flip side, I wear white up top because I'm usually in dry climates because I'm in the southwest.
And so if I had dandruff or something, if I have dark on, you can see all the standard looks nasty, right?
18:32
And so I wear white so that you don't see that.
And I always rock my Logos, which if you look at any of my old pictures of any seasons of my life, you can always know what business I was focused on by the, by the logos that I'm rocking.
Because the end of the day, like I'm gonna have walk, if somebody's going to be a free walking billboard, it might as well be met.
18:51
And I'm always proud of the companies that I have, like, I'm proud because I'm putting a lot of effort into into growing them.
And I want to support them at the very least, by always reppin my own stuff.
And all these are sponsored by our decision.
Not calm.
Because acquisition.com in the companies, we have the portfolio.
He's for the entire team.
That puts the stuff on for you guys and the world's sexiest shoes, I wanted to have and this will be a thing.
19:11
As like I actually don't do like the added layer of underwear and I don't wear socks.
And I also don't wear t-shirts and I don't wear any of those things that I realized that like I don't need any of them.
And so I wanted to find a pair of shoes that checked a zillion different boxes.
And this one does because I can work out in them, I can walk in them, I can go to the pool in them.
19:33
I can I can hike with them.
I can go to a fancy restaurant and then because they're closed toed and my feet don't sweat in them.
And even if they do, they have a foam bottom or foam insole, which actually keeps your feet dry, And that's after like 100 pairs of shoes, it took me 15 months to try all of those on to figure it out and took me probably for months to figure out the tank tops because I'd wear different tank, top different size every day and see how it felt see where sweat stains happened.
20:00
See if, like, one of these take things just like floats up with some of them do or they're like, too long or they're like baggy around the midsection, like, there's just lots of look like, do they do?
They shrink too much when we wash them does it.
This is the logo fate.
Like there's a lot of different things.
I was looking at the finally pick the right ones and the reason I'm not showing the Brands with them is because I think the it's more the perspective and approach which is find the thing that works best for you.
20:26
I have found that this is worked best for me.
Now, if you're one of those people who loves fashion that fucking rocket, because that's part of your life for me.
I truly only care about how I feel in the clothes and that's it.
And so, that's all I care about and mind you people will judge you based on how you dress, like, if I walk around in a suit, I get treated differently.
20:47
I get treated better.
Better.
But there's I think there's a little part of me that kind of likes like the little chip on my shoulder.
Like I like getting a little bit of people thinking that I'm poor, when I walk into a nice store with Layla that I think there's some element that I like sickly enjoy, but if that's important to you, then obviously change the way you dress.

So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
And it was like every, which way Up to practice everyone, you know, tried their hardest.
0:32
It was the effort and the consistency in the alignment of the team.
That accomplished the goal, the rules are the same everyone's trying to do the exact same thing.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to build an acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:50
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $209 and Beyond, I hope you share and enjoy.
So, when I was just starting out in my gym launch business, I had a gym owner who said, hey, let's partner on this.
1:06
Like, you keep filling these gyms up before capacity, why don't you just fill them?
And I'll come behind you and operate them.
And I had a gym that Doing 4.2 million dollars a year.
This is what he was telling me and I really know how to operate the business, you know, all the acquisition stuff.
So let's just partner up on this and I said, sure sounds fair enough.
It ended up being a horrible partnership but that's not the point of the video.
1:23
The point is what I learned, all right?
And so we had two locations and the newest location had a whole new staff and they were just lackadaisical, right?
They weren't they weren't, they weren't carrying.
They weren't really doing a good job and he said, you know, we need to, we need to have a meeting and I was like, okay?
1:41
And so he said well, A meeting at the first location call everyone.
There tell them show up at 4:00 in the first location, was probably like 45 minutes away from the second location, right?
And so at 4:00, so everyone's, everyone's everyone's coming in, everyone sitting down, its kind of awkward, it's silent.
1:57
There's clearly, like some tension, right?
And so at four o'clock, he looks at his assistant.
He says, hey, go down to the front lock the door right?
Of the gym.
And she was like, okay, so she goes and locks the door mind you.
Some people hadn't.
Up to the meeting, it, right, there are a couple minutes late, whatever.
2:14
And so, all of a sudden as they lock the door, like 30 seconds later, someone's, like, banging on the door and it's like, hey, open the door.
He's like, ignore him.
And and they were like, like, why aren't you letting me?
Because obviously, there's a meeting going on, right?
And then another person comes knocks on the door.
Another person comes knocks on the door.
And now there's like three or four people know, like, what the hell aren't you willing to do or whatever?
2:32
Right.
So he tells his assistants is go outside and tell him, they're all fired.
And he says this before he starts the meeting.
And so I'm sitting there, right?
And everyone in the room is like, oh, Oh shit, right?
He just set the tone.
All right, and he reset the bar and I remember witnessing this and being like, wow.
2:53
So what he did was he reset the bar of this is how we perform.
When we say, we're going to be somewhere, we're going to be somewhere at that time.
If we say, we're going to clean up after the session.
We're going to climb up after the session.
We say we're going to follow up with leads.
We follow up with leaves.
And what I have figured, and I'm gonna tell you one more story and then it's a, the moral both of them.
3:09
All right, so pause on that for a second.
Now, I had my first job, I was a actually thing is, my first is my first job, I was a blender tender at Smoothie King, all right?
And so I learned a lot about what to do, what not to do.
When I was this business, it was a small business owner.
I think you had to location, 2, 3 locations, at the time, his name was Dave really nice guy.
3:27
It's up to Dave and I went and I was trained personally by Dave, so Dave trained me and I was, you know, enterprising young man.
I wanted to do a good job.
And so I shut my first day at work at one of his new or locations.
And you know after you know between People walking in, you were supposed to like mop the floor clean the counters like just clean it, just make it look good.
3:46
Restock, the shelves.
And so I started doing that.
When someone walked out the door is my first shift, right?
And the manager was like, what are you doing?
It was like, I thought.
Like I was for weird, I was in trouble.
So I was like, I thought I was supposed to, I'm not supposed to restock the shelves, like I thought I was supposed to do that right now because like there's no one here and he was like, oh yeah, you know, worry about that.
4:04
He's like, we don't do any of that stuff.
It was like, oh, okay, boom, new cultural norm.
All right, so I was supposed to do it with the owner had trained me to do, and then was always complaining about how no one ever did was supposed to do.
The manager was telling me that I didn't need to do that stuff.
4:20
All right?
And what I learned from this, right?
And I'll just call that manager John.
Right.
I shall call the manager Vince, this is the name.
Oh, he's so I said, so do you in your business have events?
Are you the vents in your business?
4:35
Do you have someone in your business?
That's the Vince that secretly destroying your business.
All right, so let's rewind to the original story about the first demo.
I was talking about.
So think about the difference between both of those styles of management.
I'm not saying the first is Rider, the S right?
Whatever live.
The second was definitely wrong, right?
4:50
But when you look at that, what it was setting the tone and the reason that my views on business have dramatically shifted is that I have always had a tendency to lean towards strategy, acquisition monetization pricing structures and all of that stuff is important, but I think within a business, there are two components to it.
5:09
You've got the smarts, you've got the hearts, It's and you have to have both.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
5:29
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And I think that most people overestimate the importance of smarts, myself included, and I think that there's a lot to do with the hearts because business strategy, overarching Lee is not that complex like you really think about, right?
5:55
It's like you gotta find something that's good that people want and you sell it for a lot more than it cost you to do it and you do as much of that as possible.
Can't like that's kind of the idea, right?
And the thing is, it gets lost in the execution, it get lost in the doing, right?
As soon as you hire first employees like normal, employees can You boys can't do what I can do.
6:13
Like, well that's a horrible beliefs should probably change that before you try to move forward.
That's a limiting belief, right?
If you want have a big business.
And so when I think about this from a cultural standpoint and this is what has shifted for me is that it's become so much more about the soft skills.
It's so much more about coaching and developing the leaders of the company.
6:30
It's so much more about addressing behavioral dynamics of someone, that are limiting them more so than it is about tinkering and I can't help, but think that so many entrepreneurs, myself included.
I spent so much time.
Tinkering and tweaking things at.
What if we change this ourselves process?
What if we choose this on this page?
6:45
What if we change the offer, like this?
What do you change this on the price?
What if there's another payment?
Blah blah blah blah.
All these different things, right?
And think about this for a second for yourself.
How many things have you tinkered with in your business?
Over the last however many years?
How many months and your business hasn't changed at all, right?
Because the real problem is not the strategy.
7:02
The problem is not the smarts right, the problem is the heart, right?
The people are not doing what you want them to do because they don't understand why they need to do it and why it's important, right?
And that's the Soft Stuff.
Tough and you've got, you know, people who don't want to talk to each other because they don't like each other because one guy is really annoying and so it's like it would be it would better serve you to fix that problem then to try to come up with some new strategy, right?
7:23
And so realizing that has been one of the biggest breakthroughs that I've had in my career.
And those two stories should illustrate the difference between having a championship mentality and having a loser mentality and what might be going on in your business.
And I'll leave you with one more story real quickly.
So if any of you has ever been on a championship team, right?
7:41
If you've ever played in a sports arena or whatever and you've been on a winning team and a losing team, right?
And you've probably been on a losing the a lot of good players, but you guys were not connected.
You more concerted to run aligned, right?
And on the flip side, you had a winning team and it was like, everyone should have to practice everyone, you know, tried their hardest.
7:59
It was the effort and the consistency, and the alignment of the team that accomplished the goal, the rules are the same, everyone's trying to do the exact same thing.
And so, when you think about the entire business landscape, Right?
Your competitors have access more or less to the same talent pool that you do.
8:15
They can see what your strategy is over.
All.
And most people are not that dumb, right?
And so, as long as you have a relatively sound strategy, like you're not selling things at a loss, right?
Then the difference between the two is going to be your ability to execute and have people execute on your behalf.
And so that's going to become debt.
8:30
Like for us to CEOs, we do shift towards becoming championship team coaches which is why John Wooden if he had run a business, would have had a championship business because he focused on the fundamentals.
Yes.
And one of my favorite sayings of all time is Advanced.
People never don't do the basics.
Advanced people, never don't do the basics.
8:46
I would go to, I would go to these stages and I'll watch guys get on stage and they say, okay, we follow up with all of our leads, you know, within five minutes.
You know, when we get on sales calls, we always ask them whether they're we label them problem.
You know, we overview some of the past things they've done and then if they follow a clear framework, then as soon as someone buys we, you know, we have a good onboarding process and nothing they say is revolutionary.
9:06
It's just that they actually do it.
And the people actually only half there Not the Vince are don't have a manager like Vince who's telling them, they don't that they shouldn't have to do that work.
Right, who's sabotaging the businesses?
What they did is they set the tone and then they carry the bar and severe job is to be intolerant of anything but excellence and to reinforce that in the culture.
9:26
So it's consistently executed across the company because that between two companies with the same strategy will make the difference between somebody who yields disproportion returns.
An advertising crazy prophets, good growth, great retention on employees low.
Rover from a company that doesn't have that, right?
9:42
Even though they both have the same strategy or even if the smaller company has the better strategy, this guy will win.
And this has been one of the most profound shifts that I've had, is a co-owner of companies is what I'm looking for is, I'm looking for just as much soft, if not more soft skills, interpersonal, Dynamics self-awareness.
10:00
Then then I look for skill, in particular, you know, like this guy's really going to finance absurd, a really good product.
This person's really good Marketing sales, like I'm looking we more for Character traits now, and now that I think about it when you're thinking about yourself, right?
Then I would look in the mirror and say, like, am I really are?
10:16
We always doing the basics because if we always do the basics, we will be Advanced because that is what Advanced people do is they never don't do them and they have a culture that reinforced that standard.
So hope you enjoy the first story.
Hope you enjoyed the vid story.
Make sure you don't have any Vince's in your business.

42 recession-proof money, secrets.
And if you don't know, I have any socks for Rosie, I sold two of my company's last year for forty six.
Point two million in my current portfolio oxygen.com.
There's over 200 million dollars a year and I want to take 10 years of money secrets that worked in both boom-and-bust economies, so that you can save the decade and apply them today.
0:17
Number one, he who gives the money has the power.
So a lot of times poor people, they're always trying to get my are trying to get money.
The person who gives the money is the one who's in control.
Like, if you think that the biggest institutions in the world, where are these Banks?
What do they do all day?
It give money when you give someone money, you get to dictate the terms.
0:34
You actually now own them.
Number two, never trade reputation for money because you can get money back, but you can't get reputation back.
If you think about reputation is something that compounds over time the longer you have it, the more you build it, the more compounds unto itself.
It is your brand, which allows you to do more deals, do bigger deals, do them faster the moment, you lose the rep because you traded it for money in the short, you cut the compounding.
0:56
And that's where all of the gains in life.
Come from number three.
Love speed, wealth loves, time, poverty, loves indecision, micro money, loves speed.
If you want to move quickly on Fast, a customer is follow up with your leads Etc.
When you think about Building Wealth, it's not about transacting.
It's about letting that compounding happen and that takes time, and it takes not interrupting it.
1:16
Most people never achieve either of those things because they sit in decision for, we can always make more money than we need.
This is a belief that has served my wife and I really, really well.
We look back on our lives and we've never not been able to eat, not head shelter.
And we've continued to increase our skill set.
1:31
A lot of times we have this desire or your animal brain wants to make us make decisions out of scarcity, out of fear.
We don't need any of the money that's coming because we have always had enough.
Fortunes are made by taking a lot of risk with a little bit of money and fortunes are maintained by taking a little bit of risk with a lot of money, somebody who self-made had nothing and so they, risked everything in order to make it big.
1:55
But the thing is, is, when you have nothing, you're not risking a lot, you have nothing to lose, which makes you dangerous, which is one of the biggest advantages.
Inches of having nothing.
But if you continue to do that, when you do have something to lose, you can lose your fortune.
And so, you have to change the behavior.
Once you have the castle.
Once you have the Empire, six money flows where attention goes.
2:12
If you spend time thinking about fashion all day, your attention is going towards buying clothes, everything about cars all day.
It's going towards your car.
If you think about your business all day, it should be going towards your business.
Pick one thing, go all in because you only have so much Juju, think about it, like a magnifying glass, and you are the sun in this instance, and you've got to burn a hole to get through to the next level.
2:29
If you're A spread across too thin of an area, you never get enough concentrated heat.
Most people have the potential but they don't have the focus which is why they can never break through seven, your home life and your business life have to be aligned money-wise.
So you can't try to grow a business and like reinvest everything here.
2:46
While you're living a super lavish lifestyle, trying to flex, like it has to be aligned all of our business rules around money are also our home rules around money.
And so, if we don't live with any debt, within our personal lives, we do the same thing with in our business lives, 8, Ignore money advice from poor people.
This may sound ridiculous, but let me say it differently.
3:03
Ignore money advice from your Dad, or Mom who are poorer than you want to be from your good friends who are poor that you want to be from people who have smaller dreams for your life than you do.
The reason that rich people can lose everything and then recreate it is because they see reality more accurately.
3:20
The reason people can't make money is because they don't see reality.
The way it actually is, most of life, is trying to pull these rocks out of our vision, so that we can see more clearly 9.
It's always easier to To buy them to sell.
You want to get into a stock, you want to get into something, you can buy it instantly.
You want to get into a real estate deal.
You want to get into a business, you have to be extra careful.
3:37
You want to put all the slow on the by and you want to put all the lubricant on the cell 10 money is fickle when he's jealous, it sticks and goes to the person who pays it the most attention money comes into the system, but there are these grooves in the ground where it all eventually flows up to the few people who pay the most attention.
3:54
Someone gets paid.
They go buy their groceries.
The grocery person has to go by, for the supplier supplier bicep from whatever.
With the person who has the access is the one who pays it, the most attention to the one who had sticks to it.
The end 11 we stay poor until we've learned all the lessons that poverty has to teach people stay in poverty, but they're not trying to pay attention to like what lesson do I need to be learning that?
4:14
I'm not actually taking action learning how to save money at a basic level.
Personal finance, what's up you guys?
It's Graham here.
Usually the lessons that we have to learn in poverty to get out of poverty.
That's who you do that.
You don't beat the level 12, frugality drives Innovation, even when you have money, one of the best things to do in my opinion.
4:29
Pinion is constrain your resources, constrain time.
It'll force you to think, creatively to solve problems without using money as the solution.
And if you have constraints right now, on time, and or money, don't see it as a disadvantage because it's what people who do have money try to get into to solve problems.
4:46
And the only thing that's the disadvantage of thinking it is 13.
Think once before investing, think twice before spending investing is something that you're putting money into that is going to give you a return of some kind.
It's either going to give you a skill.
That's going to increase your earning capacity or it's gonna be some things going to quite literally give you a return in terms.
It's going to be you They're worth more in the future spending is something that's going to never be worth more in the future.
5:03
And it's going to be consumed 14, money flows to the person who needs it, the least the rich get richer, because they don't need it and because they don't need it, they have leverage.
You have to sell, not from your own wallet, from the person in front of you.
Come to the table with our other options, which the person who needs nothing, who's the person who has the most power.
5:18
And that's where the money will go 15.
We make money.
Our money does not make us.
You start tying your software through your net worth, then you're not worth itself becomes a liability to your own self esteem.
It is my ability to make money.
Which is what creates my value, not the money itself because the money itself can be taken, my family was in the Iranian Revolution, and everything they had was taken.
5:37
All it takes is one government saying, oh, all that land, all those cars, all those homes.
Those are ours.
Now, and that's it.
It's a lot of people have this idea of legacy and permanence, That's Just an Illusion, which is why we make our money.
Our money doesn't make us 16.
It may be an amazing opportunity but not our amazing opportunity.
5:53
One of the things that I needed early on was permission to not do things because in the beginning you don't know how to do anything your analysis paralysis and you just get Once you get over that the problem is that your yes muscle becomes 2 Flex time.
You start saying yes to everything.
We should do this thing and we should do this thing together.
You say dude I think it's amazing up here.
I just don't think it's my amazing opportunity and it's gotten me out of so many situations that I know.
6:11
Long-term wouldn't have been good permit 17, we control the money flow, wherever possible people who have a lot of control payment processors.
Everybody thinks they're amazing until the day you can't process money.
And so the idea is the further Upstream, you can go the more leverage and control you have over the money Banks, get the money and then they give it back later.
6:28
The person who's first, Upstream of the money, has the most power over it. 18 always have a no shit fund me knowing that I can take whatever risk I want.
And I am still protected and everything that I have for the rest of my life is taken care of, gives me a lot of Peace, which allows me to be more aggressive, be more offensive.
6:44
As soon as you can have your oh shit fun.
Whether it's three months, whether it's six months, start, putting that away that nut.
So that you can go more on the offensive. 19 the biggest over odor of wealth is ignorance not knowing how to make a million dollars.
It's costing you whatever you make every - a million dollars.
7:01
And so if you make 50 Grand a year it cost you nine hundred fifty thousand dollars a year to not know how to make a million dollars, which is why I put so much money into paying down.
This invisible hand.
That's been suppressing my income my whole life and yours to 20.
You get paid for the value.
You create times your ability to negotiate / how hard you are to replace.
7:18
If you provide something that's very valuable, you're very good at negotiating, but somebody else can provide the exact same thing as you for a tenth of the price.
You still don't have that.
Good of a negotiating position.
Making money is capturing a percentage of the value.
That create for other people, 21, mistakes, love a rushed decision.
I've trained myself down enough that like, when I feel fomo, I pause, fomo means slow, go mistakes, love a rushed decision.
7:40
And so it's just one of those easy beliefs that has slowed me down and has saved me so much money 22.
Leverage comes from not needing the other person and more specifically leverage comes from eating.
Nothing.
You can't control somebody who needs nothing.
Right, someone needs nothing.
7:56
You have no influence over them.
How do I become that person?
The monks do it by languishing everything and needing nothing and the rich man, does it by satisfying all his needs and not needing the other the deal on the other side of the table.
In both of those situations, you create leverage, 23 markets, take longer to adjust than you expect, and then they move faster than you can.
8:13
Imagine The Big Short.
If you saw that movie, the guy was shorting for like four years and he's like the math doesn't make sense.
The Bible kept going bubble, kept going bubble, kept going and then it happened faster than people imagine.
Have to be comfortable with the fact that we might have to sit in discomfort for an extended period of time.
8:29
Before, what we believe to be reality is reflected 24.
Money is a game treated as such you can't win the game.
If you don't know, you're planning on the wealthiest people in the world, see money as a game, they don't even use money to satisfy material needs because I already have it.
How can I adopt that perspective earlier on in my career thinking about things in terms of personal bests bank account PR's what gets measured gets improved.
8:51
You can get someone to lose weight just by simply getting them to weigh themselves.
Every day without giving them any advice at all.
Just if you pay attention to it, it will start sticking to you. 25, don't bet the empire for a pot of gold even though you might have this opportunity here, it's never worth risking the whole pie and I can't tell you the amount of times where I'm like man if I went all in on this thing money-wise so thing is that you go all in on your attention but I wouldn't go all in on your money. 26, always do a starter deal with new faces.
9:15
So this is a hard one.
One of your friends comes to you and says, dude, I want to do this Airbnb thing or, hey, I've got this new a started.
You'll first, you got to see how these people are.
Everything's just still look great on paper, everything just don't make sense.
They should still be amazing characters that are you still mitigate your risk by saying first deal?
I'm going to do with you is a small deal. 27 trust is worth more than a bigger return.
9:34
Trust lubricates deal, velocity, trust compounds.
You don't want to take all the meat on the bone because you want to have a long-term relationship.
When I talk to Partners, when I talk to business owners, how they talk about, the people that they do business with tells you a lot about them and how they do business when I talk to somebody and I'm like, hey, why don't you do this?
9:50
They're like, hey, these guys have been good to us for a very long time.
We've had a very good relationship for ten years that It is something I respect a lot and that is what people who have money act like poor people.
Always trying to one over everyone over and over again and they never get any trust from anybody, which means they have no compounding relationships. 28 money is not a zero-sum game but the older I've gotten the more.
10:09
I'm like, how can I get onto their side of the table and both make money together?
Why don't?
We both take a big piece of this upside rather than slice up a pie that's in front of us. 29, never take a standard deal, there's always a better one.
There's always a better deal and a lot of times you have to ask for it.
Okay, this term, and this term, and this term.
10:25
Things that are concerning to me.
Is there anything we can do about these?
Remember earlier, leverage comes from, not eating the deal.
You have to be willing to walk away and I can't tell you the amount of times that I walked away from a deal and the person comes back after saying, well, I can't do a deal on.
I'm like, cool, no worries.
And they come back three or four days later.
And they're like, all right man, I'll do the deal.
10:40
And then I might be like, hey, we'll the terms of changed, you know, I'm getting 30, expect, low risk, amazing Returns the, wealthiest friends that I have, who are billionaire, plus, they're just not interested in 10 20 % returns they're looking for 50% Plus, Annualized returns most people expect 10 percent because that's what the SP does.
10:58
It doesn't mean that that has to be your personal standard thinking through that way has changed how I saw investing.
In general 31, don't think in IR which means internal rate of return.
Instead thinking, how long will this take to double?
How long will this take to Triple?
It's hard to say.
This is going to grow by 25% a year.
11:14
What is easier to say?
Is this is going to double in three changing, how you ask the question changes, how you'll find the answer 32?
This is a Buffett is MM, but diversification is a hedge against ignorance and it's only Risk.
You if you don't know what you're doing, there's a million games at all of the make tons of money.
11:29
And so it's really about taking one game and taking it to its natural conclusion, which is learning every single aspect of that game.
Rather than saying, I want to be in stocks.
I mean, real estate want to be in crypto.
I would also have my side hustles.
I want to like, you can't get good at any even because you're competing against people who are all in play one game and play it.
11:45
Well, 34 I skip 33 because I covered it in that.
Last one returns are in the terms.
Everybody's watching this.
If you make money doing anything that the cytosol, I'll pay you billion dollars here.
A business but it's on my terms and I can make that deal every time and I lose one, understanding, the terms of the agreement and how many different ways you can make terms.
12:01
And the only way you do that is through having the conversations and trying to structure it from learning from other people, 35, whenever possible, use house money, if you have the opportunity to recoup your principal and still have money in the game, do that, then you can get super aggressive with the Investments and things like that that you're making for.
You're doing it on house money.
12:17
You're doing it with no chance of losing principal. 36 always know how to get your money back.
You have to know the exact way of doing it, not just like, oh yeah, I can get my It's like, no, but but how would I do it?
Walk me through each of the steps so that I have full understanding of how this would work if they actually don't mean it, then they won't have a way to do it.
12:33
You'll be able to sniff something out of media 37.
Cash flow is King.
All right, and that's both on a personal level and on a business level.
So for you, your cash flow is going to be dictated by your income, minus your expenses, it's really your savings slow.
If there's one thing that you get from Money Rules is that you be switching your metric towards.
12:49
What am I saving every month?
Rather than what am I making?
Every month 38 by for Forever?
This is a warrant Buffett and Charlie Munger is MM.
Charlie said, the money isn't made in the body or the Cell It's Made in the weight.
If you could never sell anything you buy when you are buying you could never get out of it then you buy differently and you buy super long and then ultimately that's what doesn't interrupt the compounding process and that's what unlocks huge wealth later. 39 you heard me say it earlier but fomo means go slow.
13:16
You feel fomo.
I mean slow down.
It means take a second, give a breather, put some space between you and the decision.
The only reason you feel fomo is because your time, residency, short, 40, if you can't afford to Lose the money then don't use the money if you're like this is my last dollar then it's probably not a good idea to risk it, right?
13:32
Which is why we always have the oh shit fund 41, peace of mind can be bought and it can be sold.
If there are situations where you're like, man this is going to keep me up at night, don't do it.
Peace of mind can very much be bought and sold and I can tell you make much better decisions when you've got it 42.
And final a lot of people think about diversification in terms of industry, but they don't think about it.
13:50
In terms of capital stack, a bank, for example, is at the top.
It's a preferred creditor the reason a lot of banks don't.
Is money.
And it's because they are the first creditors.
So you can think about diversification between like stocks crypto businesses, whatever, you can.
Also think about it vertically.








0:00
You wanted this thing, you expect it to be hard reality.
Now, matches conditions.
So our expectations now match conditions, this is what heart feels like and then all of a sudden it's like they got permission to feel shitty.
And by getting permission to feel shitty, they stopped feeling shitty because I like this is just my new world, welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures are lessons.
0:21
We have learned along the way, I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
One of my favorite things to do is to scrape through people's Twitter's that at off arrests and come up with a little pithy statements and then break them down.
So, I want to go through some of the things that I've learned from you over the last year or so, go into those and then there's some talking points that I don't think I've heard you speak about before as well.
0:44
I want to get onto helped beautiful.
So the first one is so many lives were transformed overnight.
If they realized my life sucks, I have nothing going for me, really means I have nothing to lose and that makes you a very dangerous person.
So, in any kind of game position.
1:03
So like in business, right?
Every position, has advantages and disadvantages and a lot of people, look at the really big guys, they're like, man, they they like, they're like, they look at me, like must be easy for Alex, right?
And I remember when we had Jim watch and we had a very big company, I would tell the guys who are coming out.
1:22
Was like, if you're trying to compete against me, I was like, you have advantages.
I was like if you're on a sales call, you're like listen, you're just a number to Alex.
You're never going to talk to Alex right here with me.
Me, you're going to get my attention.
I'm the one right.
I was like, that's how you're going to throw stones at me.
I was like, but on the flip side, if it's me marketing to the masses, I'm going to be like this kids in his mom's basement.
1:39
He has no idea what he's doing.
He's been in business for 12 months and of course he has no idea.
Like wouldn't you want somebody who's thousands of success stories behind it because we've made a system like both sides have advantages.
And so what happens is, people are in this small position where they're more Nimble, they can give more personalized attention to people etcetera and they see it as a pure disadvantage.
1:59
And so You can flip the fact that you have nothing going for you with, you have nothing to lose.
And that means that you can take lots of risks very quickly and end up in the exact same position you are, which is nothing.
And so, if you eliminate downside, it should decrease your action threshold.
2:17
Meaning you should be able to do more things faster rather than do fewer things.
Because you don't have a great life or things going for you.
And so, I think, if people flip that a lot more people would take action because they actually realize the advantage of their position.
Jack bunches says, you get rich by taking lots of risk with small amounts of money and you stay Rich by taking small amounts of risk with lots of money.
2:37
Yes, I wholeheartedly agree.
I didn't know that was his quote.
He may have repurposed it that there's something called churchillian Drift, you know?
That is no.
So, it's a phenomena and ritual at the core, it's not the opposite, it's the quotes that weren't said by Churchill often get like erroneously attributed to him.
2:55
Like all quotes lead back to Churchill even though they didn't and Socrates, yeah.
Like it's just one of those things.
That's like I said, I think the Churchill once said, get rich by making large amounts it's like know he fucking but there's another one as well.
That our good friend James Smith talked about which is if you're succeeding at a job that you hate, imagine how good you'd be at a job that you loved and that's kind of the same.
3:18
This person is starting from essentially zero.
How do you fucking worse?
Can it get right?
Is the downside.
If you can, eliminate almost downside for action.
It's like then the bias issued by a suit or Birds taking action.
Why is it that people in that case, if they do have nothing to lose, still feel like they have lots to lose because I think most of the times.
3:39
So this I think this is really important is that they have nothing objectively to lose and so everything that they feel like they have to lose is purely made up in their mind, it's stories.
They tell themselves about what other people are going to think about them when those people aren't even think about them to begin with, right?
3:54
But like that's where they live all of their lives or live out.
All of the potential downside is in Mirror reflection of what other people will think about them in the future.
Should they fail?
And I think that is the plug if we're trying to get real name.
Like talking to somebody.
Like, well, I mean, because I know that if I actually had somebody in front of me, they start squirming right.
4:12
If I said the first thing, right, like, you have nothing to lose and then because then they do have something to lose and I have to name it for them and be like, okay, who's the person in your mind?
Who's the voice?
It's like bubble of six questions.
Deep.
It's my uncle.
Okay.
Why like let me state it this way, will your belief that you're going to Be viewed as a failure by your uncle.
4:32
Be the sole reason that you live the rest of your life below your potential and regret everything that you don't do because of Uncle Tom that's the wrong one, Uncle Harry.
When you say it like that all of a sudden they're like I don't let Uncle Harry have that kind of power and then all of a sudden it breaks and then they like get free of it.
4:51
And so I think it's getting really specific and really narrow on the because people say it's Society.
It's other people.
It's like it's usually one or two voices and if you can get Really specific on whose voice it is, then you can name it.
And then like, I think I'm a big believer in, like, shame only exists in the shadows, which is like, once you put it in the light, you look at it.
5:08
And you're like, my mom, that was really it.
Like, when I really think about it, it's because it's not even just my mom.
It's my mom in this circumstance when I come back home for Thanksgiving, I just am so afraid of the combat that she's going to make.
It's like well what if we confront that?
Okay your mom you sit down at Thanksgiving dinner and you haven't made money yet and you quit your job.
5:27
Now what is that better than you?
Bending the next 60 years.
Hating her or resenting?
Her for the fact that she held you back and then like when you give the real scenario, they're like well shit.
And then like this weight comes off and they're like, fuck I guess I should do this.
You're like yeah, shame on me.
This is the Shadows is nice.
I like that and it definitely is cleansing to just be like, look here it is out in front of you and it real that you realize just how irrational it is because we don't want to look at it because it's in the shout and we put in the shadows because of how it makes us feel about ourselves in my opinion.
5:55
And so it's so scary.
We avoid it, we avoided.
We've already voted.
But it's like I think the faster you can kind of build that muscle of like, huh.
I've got this.
Hesitation, what is the real reason?
Because like logically I can do that whole that cool.
You have nothing to lose your poor great 0, right?
6:11
Okay but then what is it that I'm that I do have something to lose.
Its relational Capital.
Its status within my tiny micro community that doesn't matter but like my perceived status, okay, name the names and but by pulling it out from the Shadows.
It'll be like that confrontation from here to here is I think we're all the fears because it's embarrassing to be like, it's my mom, the other perfect thing, a great realization.
6:36
I think that anybody that starting out and is feeling self-conscious about what other people are going to think, is when you're starting out by Design, there are so few people looking at you.
The even if you do fail, no one fucking seeds, right?
So this is something we realized.
When we were running nightclubs, that we would try and launch a new event around freshers week in September and we would, we would have this great idea and it would be everything would be about flamingos or NG would be, it would be a smart night on a Tuesday.
6:59
So people could go out after they've been to Sports Club of whatever it was, and then, it would flop, right?
And we do 150 people, and all of the guys that work for us, would be stood outside looking destitute and upset and they go how it's going variables there.
So it looks like there's more room, I would dearly had so many tricks, we pump the pump, the room full of smoke, we would pad the back off so that everyone had to go to the front.
7:19
We get the DJ to play music, all sorts of shit.
But all of the boys would be like fuck.
This makes us look so bad.
Everyone's going to think that we're shit.
I was like, no, no, no. 150 people are going to think that we're shit like the advantage of running a shit business.
It doesn't reach many people.
Is that not many people saw your shit business and that's when you starting out people that are concerned about becoming a content creator, I am worried about starting a podcast as what if everyone sees how shit my podcast.
7:43
It's like dude.
No one's going to see your ship podcast.
It took me three years, three and a half years to get even an appreciable amount of people listening to this show and it was effort three times a week.
No one cares.
When you start So you can be liberated from that as well and it's just objection.
7:59
Handling objection handling objection handling all the way down.
I think a lot of I think a couple frames that are just different frames around content.
Making since we're on the topic that helped me was one is seeing it as practice rather than the game.
So like when we're doing a podcast, if you start just like Hey we're going to a podcast going to post its practice for me getting better for future may rather than like I'm like this is the main game.
8:21
It's like know the game is the whole thing and this is just like we're still in preseason.
Yeah like these these these Overseas touchdowns don't even matter yet right now, you can say yet, even though, like I can still feel like I'm a preseason, but I think from a mental framework, it actually decreases the stakes associated with doing it.
And I think that's been helpful for me, especially it was in the earlier days.
8:38
The other one was kind of the equal opposite of this problem, which is not wanting to start because no one's watching because it feels like you're doing all this work line.
What's the point?
And so I actually the little mental trick that I had was when I track lots of stuff and the more ways you track, the more ways you can win.
8:56
And so it's a Little thing that I found out.
So like if you track a hundred sets in the only need one of them to go up.
So you feel like you made some progress.
So that's like an easy one.
And the second thing around the tracking is that I would look at like the biggest possible number.
So a lot of times you can see like the impressions of, you know, a post that you make.
9:13
Even if you only got like 16 likes, I got like 100 Impressions and I thought to myself, I was like, well, if there was a room of 100 people, I'd be stoked like that would be awesome.
Especially the early days I was like, that would be, I would totally feel like that was worthwhile.
And so taking those little impression numbers and pretending that they were like micro events that I was making the work or the content for all of a sudden made it feel worth it for me.
9:36
And so, the combination of I can have a small room and I'm really impacting, like, when I get a view that has like 13 views on it.
You know, I never liked a video in the early days, I feel like we'll shoot.
I made this video and 13.
People saw is like a small room like that works.
But looking at both absolute growth and relative growth.
9:53
So it's like, okay, well, I went from ten followers this month to 15 followers, This month.
So will you can say that you only gain five followers as like or you can see that you gain by you went up by 50% and that was exciting.
And so then I because I'm a Excel projection guy.
I like okay, well if I do this every month and the team knows this because I reject everything out I'm like we do this because I'll predict where we're going to be in like 12 months and I usually hit Barry really.
10:17
Very, but how do you account for the unforeseen 5 million play video that comes in?
Well, that's my padding, right?
So what like a top.
Checked out with no white swan events.
Yeah.
Yeah, we're something good happens.
Yeah, but it just if we keep doing what we're currently doing at this trajectory, we compound at 13 percent a month.
10:36
Yep.
That's what it is right now.
So 13 percent monthly and that's just on one of the platform's Ron.
And so I can just see what we're going to be at six months and that's exciting.
So James Smith gamify zit in the same way, does he?
Yeah, absolutely exactly the same way and he always says that it's just like playing levels on a computer game and this month, wow.
10:53
Like I got another XP point or whatever and I think that's very important because Social media and the fact that it is associated with status.
Even though everybody says oh you know, it doesn't really matter and blah blah.
It does like it's very hard for us to remove the human hierarchy from what is evidently just Quantified?
11:09
Fucking status right on a screen and what he did was he removed himself a lot existentially from that by saying it's not comment on my worth as a person.
It's not a comment on whether I'm you know going to be loved or accepted by the world.
It's me putting some stuff out and wow, we won this month.
11:25
Yeah.
And this month, maybe we didn't win.
Didn't we win?
We're a go back.
The same way as if someone beats you at FIFA unless you like a pro FIFA Player or whatever.
But again with that, what's the difference between the the amateur FIFA Player in the Pro FIFA Player?
The pro has put his existential connection right to his content and the success of it.
11:40
Oh my God.
So many little things on this that I want to go into one of them.
Is that so dr.
Cash, he's my closest friend, he's like a behavioral, whatever love studying why humans do things.
And so people who are most successful a lot of times what their it's not that they necessarily have more willpower.
They find ways to they find other ways to reward themselves.
11:59
And so he's like the more skills you have, the more ways you have to reward yourself.
And so, somebody who so many can extend, how long their time Horizon is, because they do gamify it.
So, people who don't have the skills of figuring out ways to reward themselves.
In the meantime, can't make it the whole way, but that's like when you're doing cardio in your like, okay, it's 5:30, you know, it's five times five to get out of here, right?
12:19
You create micro games within the longer game to keep yourself going.
And the thing is, I've seen that across Goals.
So like if you look at us so Travis Mash is a limpet lifter Olympic lifting coach out of North Carolina.
And he has this really cool way of getting lifters to PR every workouts have a personal record every workout and what he does is he have them map every single set and rep range for every single lift at every weight.
12:45
And so, what happens is all you have to do is go through your book of 200 lifts and every single weight, and you can always find one that you did a year ago, and I got.
This is my 8 rep.
Max PB, on good mornings?
Yes.
You're like, well, I can hit 9 on this or I can add five pounds to it and so, every workout they win.
13:01
Yeah.
And so they get excited because they get rewarded every workout and so that's why it's like the more we see track the more ways you can win.
And then I think that's those little micro winds can keep you going over the long game that you have to just keep playing one of the other Associated tweets that you did was if you life sucks.
13:18
The easiest thing is to change your environment.
This is something that I saw moving from a very good life in the UK to now, as a Excellent of a life as I can imagine in Austin and I'd met about a million people throughout my time as a club promoter and had a handful of friends.
13:34
And I fuck like oh I feel like my people met to friend.
Conversion should be higher than this.
I feel like I'm the the funnel is very wide and like the conversions are very low to use your terminology.
Yeah.
And then moved out to Austin and it's like I have more friends than people I've met but she's just fucking insane.
13:52
So, Definitely changing your environment.
What other ways given that not, everybody could move to Austin.
What other ways?
Would you say if your life sucks?
The easiest thing is to change your environment.
What other ways could someone do that?
I mean the environment is, I mean like, you know, this is a I'm going to tangent a comeback.
14:10
So if you've heard somebody say like man, I hate Cincinnati Cincinnati sucks.
Right?
Or they go some City and like they go there for two days and they make a judgment across the entire city, right?
It's like okay, let's go really deep.
You ate at three restaurants and You saw seven total people in Cincinnati, the Cincinnati sock or do the two restaurants that you went to are the seven people that you were with not, are they not that cool.
14:32
Well, it's so easy to just move like two miles down.
The street is the same reason people do staycations.
It's like you don't even need to change cities, you can be in the same city and still change the environment like just moving out of your mom's basement.
You know what I mean?
In just going into another place with four guys can change the environment and so, like that's the thing that to me was so telling on this was so heroin addiction, super addictive.
14:55
And when a bunch of soldiers came back from Vietnam, they had been addicted on.
If you've heard of this, right?
25% of soldiers who went to Vietnam tried heroin, it was like an insane statistic and in the u.s. 90 percent of heroin addicts, who go to clinics relapse, save a 10% long-term success rate, tough.
15:14
The stats are completely reversed from people who got addicted are, did heroin in Vietnam and then came back to the US, which then you could make the, you could draw the line, which is Is it's better to change your environment than to even do anything else.
Because what happens is you eliminate all the triggers and cues that are associated with habit that you're trying to destroy.
15:33
Do you see that the American government was absolutely concerned that there was going to be an epidemic?
Yeah, they were.
They were adamant that all of these soldiers are going to come home and it was going to be these veterans that we're all addicted to heroin.
Yeah.
Wild and there are for sure, but proportion so much proportion, less than their quote should be.
15:49
Because the problem with the current system of a free one, is listening You can still extrapolate the principal or the concept people are in the environment that they are addicted.
They change environments and they go to a clinic they change the environment, they change their behavior and then they go back to the same environment and their behavior changes yet again to match the environment.
16:08
And so it's like if you want to change your actions the easiest thing you can do is just change the environment because if you can do that, a lot of times, a lot of the negative things you have, you just don't get triggered, you don't get the cue for the behavior, it just gets extinguished.
So the way that I've worked this into to my home working set up is I think I have six or seven different places that I can work out.
16:29
Yeah, I do different tasks.
Each one of them.
So I've got a place, I'm writing a book.
I've got a place that I write my book that's first thing in the morning.
I've got a place that I do my emails out, that's a recumbent desk bike, which is fucking unbelievable dude.
Zone to cut 180 minutes a week of zon to cardio 180 minutes a week of emails with Zone to cardio place outside.
16:48
I've got my studio record inside, we've got two living rooms at different houses that I can go into and I'm like different spots, right?
One and if I'm in this Vibe, I'm over here and everything's a bit.
Go for a walk, come back, move somewhere else.
And I now I'm in a different mode total and I'm actually so it works in the equal opposite to its if you want to start something, right?
17:06
So like what we're talking about is extinguishing bad habits by changing the environment by eliminating the queue.
But on the flip side, if you want to start a habit like for me, one of my quote famous ones is like I want to put sunscreen on.
It's like this time, it's like one habit that's like 80/20.
Why do you need to put sunscreen on so much because oh, not so much if I could just You do like it's like I'm like walking like if you just walk once a day and if like if everyone just did that like you add ten years to everyone.
17:30
So it's like the what are the few things?
It's like, baby, aspirin walk.
Like if you do that, crushing it from a like skin cancer, prevention, a and then be just like less wrinkled.
Alex future, suntan, lotion, or SPF stuff is like the, the 80/20 of that, right?
17:48
Instead of having a zillion other things.
So like, okay.
I don't like it.
I realized the reason I don't like it, I don't like Oil on my hands sounds so stupid, but like that's enough punishment for me doing it that I stopped doing it.
And so, I had to overcome two things.
One was that I hate the oil on my hands and the second is that I don't remember.
So, I put one thing of sunscreen at each of my watering holes, so I get queued because I see it as soon as I sit down.
18:10
So I eat lunch at the same table, I work at the same table and I'm on my nightstand.
There's a three places that I spend my time and so, I have one in each of the three places.
And then the type of sunscreen I have is that I have one that's dispensed through a thing.
So I don't actually have to touch it.
It so it's like do I know what it's like, if you can identify why you don't like doing something then you can isolate.
18:28
Why am I being punished for this behavior and think?
Okay.
Is there a way I can fix it and the other is how can I q-- myself on a more regular basis by changing my environment rather than setting an alarm on my phone where, if it goes off right now and a little podcast, I'm not going to pull out suntan lotion or I'd have to carry everything with me which I would never do, right?
18:44
That would punish me far more than just not putting it on to begin with.
And so, just thinking through both those things anyways, that has been really helpful for me in starting and queuing myself to do new behaviors that I I want to do and then also stopping behaviors that I don't want to do very nice, most distractions come dressed as easy opportunities.
19:02
This is interesting because as people begin to accumulate the success that they say that they want, this becomes an increasingly big problem.
Yeah, I think it was Andy Grove who said this probably Churchill.
We are chalk another.
19:19
One up for Winston might have been Packard.
I think I've actually been Hewlett-Packard.
It might be one of those guys.
He said that businesses die of indigestion, not starvation.
And so they overeat, they're not starving, its the entrepreneur that and this is you go back to human behavior which almost have all roads lead back to it but the entrepreneurs get reinforced for changing direction because nothing work, nothing works.
19:44
Nothing work.
You change direction Something clicks and so what happens is you learn a lesson from that.
You're like, oh so if I change direction good things happen.
But that's not the right lesson, which is one of my favorite things, but entrepreneurship is making sure that we learn the right lessons from the from the, from the instance or the circumstance, it's like I hired a sales guy.
20:00
He did a bad job all sales guys suck not the right lesson, right?
But that's actually something that is pervasive in even the internet community of like lessons, that people, they'll tell the story and then they'll say the lesson, but sometimes the less all we know is the facts of what happened.
Not necessarily, the thing you took from it.
20:17
Anyways, I was making a point Churchill starvation 80 up.
Maybe so.
The the the higher up in business, you get the more attractive, the opportunities that you have to learn to say no to.
And this has been really hard for me, because at every level, like I thought great, I have I can check the box on distractions.
20:38
I've learned to say no to 10,000 dollar opportunities, but then when you're, when you're making a hundred thousand dollars, then you have to be able to say no to a hundred thousand opportunities.
And the thing is, I called the woman in the red dress, but the woman in the red dress.
Have you heard this like this little analogy?
I have no.
Okay, this is like one of my favorite analogies. so, in The Matrix, Morpheus take some through a training program to teach them.
20:59
One thing about agents and so they're walking down the street and there's all these people going and going and he says where you listen to me or you look at the woman in the red dress and he says, look again, it looks back and the woman in the red dress, you walk by is an agent, pointing a gun at his head and I see distractions the same way, which is that, the better you become.
21:18
The more attractive, the woman in the red dress is and so you can say no to a 6.
But what about a seven by the 12 exactly what about hypothetical?
Thousand, right?
Like that's that's really what it becomes because there is no limit on the upside.
And so, That's why having like some of the soft F of like this is the vision.
21:35
This is what we're trying to do and there's a hundred other things I could do.
But each of the cost of those things is the one thing that matters most.
And I think that one of the things that Layla has been so good at helping me with.
And I think a lot of My Success earlier on, was propelled by the fact that like, when I met Layla, I had a chiropractor agency.
21:55
I had a dental agency, I had five Jim locations.
I had a gym launch business where we did turn.
It's I had all of those things going on and there was no Co besides me, Ico of all the things.
I didn't understand how this stuff worked and and I also made, no.
Actually, I mean, I made money from all of them but no income.
22:13
Like everything was just enough to break even and was nine spinning plates.
And is because like, I was so opportunistic and it's very classic new entrepreneur to just say, yes to everything and Warren Buffett said that the difference between really successful people and the most successful people.
22:30
This would be paraphrasing, is that the most successful people say no to almost everything.
And I've tried to take that because it's so hard.
And I think that a lot of the it's so simple and so hard, which a lot of success habits are, which is like, if you do the same thing, for a very long period of time, I think this is Neil shoot Shane.
22:49
I can remember the name, but I'll just say that.
Yes, Churchill, again he said success comes.
Down to doing the obvious thing for an extraordinary period of time without convincing yourself.
You're smarter than you are.
And I just love that quote, why do you not need to convince yourself that you smarter than you are?
23:05
Because in the same thing I think it's because you think you can handle both.
And so you're like oh I got.
Okay because if you did think to give a smile to the knee, while you would then start to take them on stuff.
So quote, from John Maxwell, which I absolutely adore.
That says, you cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything but she's just fucking perfect and it's the call.
23:24
It was that's a Greg mcewan's.
Essentialism is one of my top 5 books of all time and it's for this precise reason that it's an antidote.
To the Taipei fall out, right?
I can do it all, I will do it all, watch me suffer and bear, this burden and you're like look you can do the hard work thing, right?
23:42
You can you can do that.
But the working hard and being spread thin are two different Dynamics.
And one of the one of the like interesting idea of been playing around with a little bit recently as period izing work.
23:58
So in the same way, as your weightlifting coach, will have the guys do.
His sub Max for 90 days.
He is building up the 90 days.
He has compared a blah, blah blah blah blah, whatever it is mobility.
That's a much easier way to blend.
What we're talking about here as maybe a little bit earlier.
24:15
I think you need to specialize more as you get bigger and bigger because the distractions are going to be greater especially how so.
So if you are the CEO of your company and then someone comes in with you've got so much more Downstream from you that if you get distracted, the repercussions, the ramifications of it becoming disrupted.
24:31
Acted are magnified even more.
What do you think about that?
Do you agree?
I I think the The Specialist piece is the piece that threw me because I always feel like the the higher up you go.
The more generalist you become, in terms of skill set but not in terms of projects or in terms of projects specialize in project, general license skills, that we are.
24:49
Yeah.
Yes, I like that.
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
25:05
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, The first step to achieving a massive dream is Conquering tiny impulses.
I think it's exactly what we're talking about earlier.
25:20
It's like if you like II.
Gotta there's a tweet that I may actually you.
You were the one who made of go viral, right?
Which was when you quoted me.
Quoting use David goggin?
Yeah, just this endless, Human Centipede of fucking homos.
25:39
He quotes was really Churchill, said it for whatever baby, but it's like you don't, you don't, you don't feel confidence, my shouting affirmations, the mirror, but by stacking I'm busting an undeniable stack of proof that you are who you say, you think you that work yourself doubt.
25:56
Thank you there.
I'll quote you to you, which is in you and you will ho so that, right?
Yeah, a lot of people were like, no.
26:11
But what if you don't have any successes, like, how do you get started and I still think that the, the quote is 100% valid is that they don't realize the validity of the smaller.
Things that they have done up to that point and so it's being able to transfer your successes of like, okay, like did you get dressed this morning?
26:28
Like, did you did you get in front of the computer, like, you have evidence?
It's smaller evidence but you have enough evidence to make the claim that you can do this.
And then you do that enough times, that you have enough evidence to make a claim that you can do this and support it.
And I think that's where the big outcomes come from lots of constrained, tiny, impulses of saying like, you know what, I'm going to get this tiny Victory.
26:48
And I know how to say no to that.
I noticed a hair.
Say no to heroin today.
Or whatever that would be a hard one you know, God's larger investment, probably larger.
But that's the idea is just stacking as many of those pieces of evidence that give you proof that you are who you say you are that you can you have done what you say you can do.
27:04
Yeah.
It's a the challenge of action or belief first is something that I've been playing around with so much.
I my friend James he wrote a book The c-word I'd like confidence is a book about how to be confident, right?
And I do feel like a Bigfoot notes Uh, Marie could have been that quote from you roof and the problem is this is something that I've seen as well.
27:26
Good example coming from a world where I was successful in business, before I was successful, personally, I have a skill set now and my capacity within this particular skill set and the performance of what that does are intrinsically linked, right?
27:42
There's almost a linear relationship as I become better at networking with guests, with recording with doing all of you.
The things the show increases when I run a business, there was so many, Degrees of freedom between my inputs to the business and the success of the business that someone with like malignant impostor.
27:58
Syndrome, could always explain away how things had gone.
Well, so it's Gerardo, it's because we time the market, right?
Oh, it was because of like this member of staff that we brought in.
I mean, I trained him but really, he would have been great without me or whatever and self-doubt can sort of wheel its way in.
I'm very sort of Nefarious, ways, when you do that, then switching to something where you have a relatively undeniable.
28:21
Lack of proof even undeniable to the part of you that wants to deny proof, right?
Which is that impostor syndrome after a little while it's just a crushing weight that you can I call it impostor adaptation.
So you know if you continue to disprove your imposter syndrome in the real world and it persists, you have to admit to yourself that it's got nothing to do with your capabilities, and everything to do with your addiction, to feeling like an imposter.
28:45
This is just a trend of how you think about the world you're looking for competent.
You have competence without confidence.
Which is a lack of belief and confidence without competency self-delusion, right?
So you need to have this balance between the two, but people when they say, well, surely be self belief becomes before action, I'm like, well, not particularly not if that's not your nature, I don't think like you're asking for delusion there and it is significantly easier for you to think I am a fitness person.
29:12
If you just went to the gym and did ten push-ups then, I am a fitness person.
When I go to the gym tomorrow and do 10 push-ups, like, where's the show me certain sawdust?
Where's the fucking reality of this, you know, I agree.
Good opportunities.
29:29
Only look like opportunities in the rearview mirror today.
They look like Risk.
How does someone get around this this asymmetry between the fact that in retrospect, it seemed totally obvious.
And yet the thing that you're looking at right now looking forward, you go, that might not be obvious in retrospect.
29:47
Again, it's tough because a lot of the big winds you like, like uber Classic example, right?
Like, let's start a business.
Where strangers?
Pick up girls, who are 16?
You don't even drive them to their friend's house.
It's like, that sounds like a terrible idea, right?
30:03
Like it just it but in retrospect you're like no, it'll be totally fine because there's going to be a mutual rating system and blah blah blah, right?
Taking out the fact that there are people have been captured and whatever oh what?
We'll put that to the side, right?
And the thing is is like just because we're on the investing side, what we found is that there are always reasons to say no to a deal.
30:22
You can always find reasons to say, no, Because there's nothing that's risk-free.
Even treasuries have risk.
The US economy could collapse and treasures, could be worth nothing.
Like and you could create a really compelling argument lots of influence or spent a lot of time doing that right?
Is it likely maybe?
30:38
I don't know but it's probably less likely that then a bank failing because if the u.s. fails all the banks by default are also feeling so which one you know which of these is greater if so then it gets then you start comparing risks rather than trying to eliminate risks.
And so we're looking at opportunities.
That's why I like risk-adjusted.
Return is one of the things, Investors look at which is like, is there a way that I can appropriately?
30:56
Adjust this risk to normalize different opportunities and I think that that single skill set is One of if not the most important important skill sets as an entrepreneur because fundamentally it's betting.
Like that's what we're doing.
We're making bets.
Every day we met with our time.
31:11
We both are money with the limited constraints.
We have our limited resources, we have against unlimited opportunities because that's the hard part is that there is unlimited woman in the red dress.
Now, there's some fours and there's some sixes and there's some eights but you have to both rape the girl, right the opportunity and then also how crazy is she, right?
31:29
Are whatever.
You know, whatever risk factor you want to, you know, associate with this is you're gonna stab me in my sleep.
I don't know.
Right?
Just have a crazy ex-boyfriend.
I don't know about, I don't know, right?
And so that's what we do the donors process.
But like the way that week, I just just tied up this chapter in the book that's coming out is when we're organizing opportunities that we're going to pursue with a business.
31:48
We look at what are the ones that we have the absolute highest likely to success that we need no new skills and no new effort.
If we can do that or the least amount of new effort and no new skills, that would be the first thing we're going to do.
And then once we take off, all the ones that take basically no effort and no extra skills were like, okay?
32:04
We Take more effort and still no skills.
And then once we do that then we're like okay now we can start learning a new skill and of the different skills that we could learn.
Which of these is going to give us the highest leverage as in most output for the least amount of input.
And that's pretty much how we take down which of these opportunities we want to pursue because those have the lowest likelihood of not happening.
32:22
Does this work in the personal world as well?
This one isn't invested isn't in business, that's just thinking about life opportunities.
Do I want to learn to salsa dance o code?
I think that the investor frame Is a quote is simply people who have been scored and Quantified on their ability, to make decisions.
32:40
And so I think that we can learn a ton from how investors make decisions overall SEC.
Why Ray dahlias book principles became like a best-seller even though 99.9% of people reading, the book aren't even investors or definitely not investors at his level but the principles of good decision-making are just Quantified and we have a scoreboard for these guys being excellent decision.
33:00
Makers, whereas most other people you don't have a real school board so we can't tell.
Well, how valid is their advice, and I think that's what makes taking advice from, really world-class investors, who've been doing it for decades as a great source of information because we can validate that they have a stack of undeniable proof that they are who they say, they are very nice.
33:19
Okay.
So this was our actual not Churchill this time.
So this was, this is something that I've actually relied on a little bit myself.
Whenever I get to a low point, where I think, why do I even bother?
I just remind myself.
This is where most people.
Up.
And this is why they don't win and this relates to another one, which is a reminder for the Gladiators in the arena who feel beat up and scarred with no.
33:40
Hope in sight building a business is hard hard feels shitty.
This is what hard feels like and this is why most people can't do it but you can this is what hard feels like is so fucking nice to lean on.
33:56
It is so nice to lean on.
Take me through by low points.
There's actually a story we will just post on it so I was way back in my day, like, you a party party promoter, but I was in a fraternity.
So I was present the fraternity houses and this was my first semester being president.
34:14
And so you have a pledge class, you get to pledge classes as a pressing unit.
Fall on a spring and then that's your tenure.
And then, another president comes in and what we knew and this will be really interesting for the audience.
Were human behavior perspective.
Is that like clockwork?
Every time we start a new pledge class within 14 days, 10 to 14.
34:30
It was like clockwork.
They would all get together and they revolt.
It's a, we don't want to do it anymore.
This is what we signed up for.
This is way fucking harder than we thought it was going to be like.
We hope it's going to party with you guys.
Like, that's what we expected.
Which also shows you how long it takes people to adapt or acclimate to a very significant lead if more difficult situation, right?
34:49
I'll tell you what happens after and they'll tell you what happened in between.
After we have this kind of talk that we had and I'll tell you how I explain it.
When I was President, all of a sudden it all vanishes because their expectations of reality have completely reset.
We break reality like in the first 10 to 14 days.
35:06
It's so painful for them because it's such a contrast will be having is doing not the fun stuff.
What's not fun?
Oh my God.
I mean they can't drink can't talk to girls.
The only people that could talk to her brothers or each other and we're mean to them.
So they could really only talk to each other.
And the whole point is that we're trying to get them close together because it's a bunch of dudes who don't know each other from different parts of the campus, right?
35:26
And we have to get them in 8, to 12 weeks to leave his one unit of people who know everything about one another, that trust one another that know, everything about the other people in the house.
So it's like, how do you do that?
Well, there's only x amount a communication can have every day so let's cut out anybody who's not us, okay?
And then if we really want them to be close together, will also reinforce that were mean.
35:44
But part of what they had to do is they to learn everything about everyone else in the house.
And so, every pledge has to do something that would impress a brother and then they get a signature From the bothered me like I approve of you and you have to get every single brother signature by the time you're done, right?
And so that's where each of those side quests become as insane as you might imagine, right?
36:02
And there's lots of, you know, there was lots of hazing back in the day which is not fun.
And, you know, a lot of sleepless nights and things like that.
And you go from like parting with girls, feeling your top of the world, all these brothers feeding you drinks.
Be like me.
Like you're awesome dude to then, like, the next day and this is literally how it happens.
36:17
This is how like, the break and reality happens.
We do this huge party to, like launch the new class and the next First one and they all wake up.
They're all like they all sleep at the house because that's one of the requirements and they're all hungover a got, their ties, like, vomit in the corner.
Whatever.
And we're like, great clean it up.
36:33
And they're like, what?
Because up to this point, they haven't cleaned after a party because all they did is got to party.
See the girls and then leave.
But then all of a sudden, they're like, mopping bottom in the corner and they're a hungover, and they feel terrible, and they're like, what the fuck?
This is what I signed up for it, right?
So anyways, two weeks of this, they get together and they wanted Me to meet them.
36:53
And this always happens.
They want to be on their their Turf and I'm like, all right guys, what's up?
And so it's just me, all right?
And my vice president in like 25 guys.
So there's like a, you know, there's like a size comparison of like just animalistic Lee, there's way more of them than there is of me.
And so I just ask them a couple questions.
37:09
I was like, who here before pledging started was like I want to be a part of this house, guys.
Really, you know me okay.
Like okay, got it.
Who here thought it was going to be easy.
Who he thought it'd be hard.
They raised their hands.
37:26
I'm like, guys, this is what hard feels like.
And all of a sudden there's just like this big exhale in the room, they're like, expectations, get reset.
This is normal.
You wanted this thing you expected to be hard reality.
37:43
Now, matches conditions.
So our expectations now match conditions.
This is what heart feels like and then all of a sudden it's like they got permission to feel shitty.
And by getting permission to feel shitty, they stopped feeling shitty because I like this is just my new world.
And so then, you know you're like, listen, you give eight weeks.
38:00
You're going to get three and a half years.
Other people want to do are going to drive you around late at night.
Other people in a clean after you like it's a good investment right?
And that it was a good deal.
Like you give one semester and get the rest of them to just do whatever you want.
Want.
But that concept like that quote in both of those came from that experience of having someone tell me, this is what heart feels like, this is where most people stop.
38:22
And this is why they don't win.
It's also another beautiful bit of motivation and given that, I spent a little bit of time with Goggins and campaigns.
To guys, I was telling you about this before you said must be nice as we walked in.
So, Cameron Haynes, bow hunter, extraordinaire lives in Oregon, and he has behind And the power Rack in his garage where he left, he has must be nice written.
38:45
And as I, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, we got that put up on that and he was like, it's because everyone says must be nice to be.
You come must be like to be sponsored by height and all of these like top-level bow things and go on Rogan.
He was those a video that went super viral of Goggins losing his shit after Jon Jones, one last weekend and the guy that he's hoping his can.
39:04
So it's like, oh must be nice for you to be backstage at UFC must be nice for this and I've seen what that guy does.
And that guy.
Picks up a rock that weighs about 80 pounds and it's got the word poser written on the front of it.
Good people called the poser and he carries it up a hill that is maybe 1,000 feet of elevation mile and a half high with no Fanfare at the end.
39:25
No Finish Line.
Doesn't post on social media and lust, the team's.
They're filming it with someone else and then carries it back down.
Put her in the boot of is Raptor trout away.
And he just does that because he needs to remind himself that he's doing the stuff that is hard and this is where most People stop.
39:41
And this is why they don't win combined with this is what heart feels like, justifies things being hard now, I do worry and I find it in myself sometimes as well that you can be so good at dealing with suffering.
Do you can actually push yourself a little bit too far and you're starting to Bear more burden than I can basically take on and the Art of not burning out.
40:03
Is something that I think a lot of people if you if this resonates with you the art of not burning out is something that you really really need to be able to I feel and like realizing what happens when you just start to glance off the bottom side of it and go.
Okay.
I'm just going to ease off the gas so that I'd need to take this afternoon to go sauna and and get some sunshine and chill out and get some food.
40:22
And I can put my foot back on maybe a little bit tomorrow more time, right?
But it just it justifies the fact that I use this, not all the time, 90% of podcast, don't make it past episode 3, and of the 90% of the 10% that do 90%, don't make it past episode 20.
40:38
So by making 21 podcast, it's you are in the top percentile of all podcasters ever in history.
That's what hard feels like and that's not even hard.
It's just consistent.
Fuck me.
It's less than half a year.
Yeah, insane.
I hear stuff like that and I just think man, it is so easy to win.
40:57
Like that, I mean that like when I hear that, that's exactly what I think.
I'm just like, man.
Everyone was like, struggling to win.
It's like you like most of the pain that people experience is purely in their own minds and so, to your point, I think there's an interesting one between like burnout versus hard.
41:14
And so, like, for me, burnout is when my I would Define it as my output per unit of time decreases.
So I can see that that's measurable right now.
Like I can say like number A pages that I editor, the quality of the content that I quite like my output.
Protect like the team knows when I like when I'm like six hours.
41:31
Seven hours into recording something there.
Like I literally start like slumping.
You're like physically.
I just start like slumping and I like my, my Cadence isn't as like I'm just not as sharp, right?
There's that versus emotional burnout, which I think people, Miss label as burnout when really.
41:48
It's just like, they don't know how to reframe reality.
And so what it really is is they got a comment on a post that Bug them and like again, it's like pulling it from the Shadows.
It's like know this stuff doesn't work.
It's like, hold on.
What's the one voice that actually is coming through?
42:04
What is the real thing?
Well, there is this Comet, okay, great.
It's embarrassing to even have to say that, but when you say, then you admit it and all of a sudden, you put it in the light and the same kind of starts to evaporate because then you can name it and be like is this comment better than my bigger than my future is?
This Comet bigger than me?
42:20
And one of the things that I That has helped me was saying, like, what's true about this?
Be familiar with Byron.
Katie, do you know her?
I've heard her name.
Yeah, the work, she does the work and the the one of the first questions that she asked you is, is it true?
42:36
How do you know that?
It can be true.
Yeah, and so it's like the same thing.
Bring it from the Shadows right into the light.
Okay.
You have this sense?
There's no shits like a fucking smell.
So, yeah.
Maybe something's a bit.
Maybe something's, maybe I might be like a piece of shit.
Maybe I'm not competent.
Maybe I'm not whatever you.
42:52
Okay.
Let's In the next one is like what if we confront it and say like what if they're right?
Now, what?
Because a lot of, I think, a lot of effort gets, put into trying to deny deny reality, right?
Like there's this clip that I shared from Tom billion, he's talking about how he gets made fun of his ears being big, right?
43:10
And I think it's a really good clip because his point that he was making because it's such a visual easy example for people to understand.
He's like, is that it's true.
I do have big ears.
And and so that's that's like the if they're like you have no right to be making content, are they right?
43:31
Okay.
And yeah I'm still going to do it anyways because the thing is like one of the things that I had earlier on in my career was like, I didn't think I was a really good person.
Like I was like, I'm not a good person.
Yeah.
Make some people like yeah, I just had that right?
And I had a history, you know, whatever.
And one of the things that gave me a lot of respite or relief from that.
43:49
Kind of thought process was like That's okay because I can still do the things that create success and not deserve it and still get it.
And that actually felt very powerful for me because it was like, I don't have to deserve to success.
I can still just do the stuff that gets it.
44:06
It's like you don't have to, you have to deserve the girl.
You can still do the things that got her and do you deserve when you have her?
I don't know.
Who knows, I hate the word deserve to begin with, right?
Yes.
But like that concept because also I could segue into like gratitude around like if you think you deserve it, then you.
44:21
Don't, you don't enjoy it, but that has been super powerful for me, which is like, what if they're right?
And because a lot of people just try to, they spent so much effort trying to fight the fact that the comments might be, right?
This might have been a fucking terrible thumbnail.
You know what?
44:37
This might have been a boring video.
This this post might have been regurgitated content.
This post might have been inspired to closely by someone else's post, right?
What if they're right?
And yeah.
Does it make me a piece of shit?
what if it does, and Do you end up getting down to base?
44:55
Which is pretty much nothing.
Why all that there is is actions, or that there is is what you're going to do in response to this.
You know what, another brilliant, add addition to this.
That you kind of mentioned which is the fact that this is what heart.
Feels like it was people get to this stage and they decide to stop.
45:12
And now, the bar is set so low dog.
In said this, in the episode with me and it gave me chills when he said it, he was like, it's so easy to be successful nowadays because people are weak.
Yeah, everybody's week, Dana White says it as well.
I tell my kids it is so easy.
45:27
If you are even a like weekend Savage you will run these kids over and for every single person it's giving me chills again for every single person that likes to castigate the very padded victimhood mentality of the modern world.
45:45
Okay, cool.
Like you can you can rail against people that say that the world is against them even though it's not and etc.
Etc.
How do Is that informed the way that you should operate in the world, right?
Well, okay, what you're saying is everybody else?
It is fallible.
46:02
Weak fragile in some way or another.
How does that inform the way that you act the way that you should act is?
Holy shit.
If I have even a modicum of resilience, this makes the market environment for me so much easier.
Whether I want to get the Girl by the house become successful in whatever domain I choose to.
46:21
The bar is set so low, though.
This for going, if we're going tweets this, segues into one of my favorite ones, which is, you stay in poverty until you learn, the first lesson of poverty, which is two words my fault.
And so, when I was younger, I was really angry at my parents.
46:41
Like, many people are right Justified or not, doesn't really matter.
I was very angry and I blamed them for the woes of my life.
And I realized that when I was 19 that these people that I hated, I was giving all the power over the fact that I wasn't the person I wanted to be and I was like, well, it's their fault and the idea that I had actually given these people that I hated power over my success.
47:09
Was ultimately something that made me feel sick to my stomach and was what allowed me to point the finger of blame in words and say my fault.
And then at least take ownership over the fact that like and like sure, maybe your dad didn't hug you enough or maybe your mom was in prison or whatever it is, right?
47:25
It's like and and like I said this the other day and it'll probably piss off a lot of your audience.
So, you know, we can put our soft earphones on.
Like, if you were, if you, if you suffer from racial inequality, if you You suffer from gender inequality.
If you suffer from being born in Bangladesh, if you were raised as sexually abused your entire life, you would be completely justified in the fact that you are not achieving the things that other people who didn't have those disadvantages of achieved.
47:54
And I say, this is a white guy who was born in America to a doctor father, I understand that.
But at the same degree, you have the opportunity that Chris nor I have, which is that you can be an inspiration to people who just who went through the same thing and succeeded, despite those circumstances.
Because I can promise that there is somebody who has had it worse and has done it better.
48:14
And I think that that one single point of proof and like there's a global point of proof that you can look for for sure.
But like you can be that very local point of proof in your community or sub community and I think, as soon as we said that that's like I just, I'm a big fan of power follows the blame finger.
48:32
So like wherever you point, the blame fingers where the power follows.
It's like, if you point is, if you pointed to the government government has a powerful pointed at your, your spouse and say, Say like it's their fault that I'm not in shape, it's their fault, they never let me do anything.
It's like, well, you're giving them all the power.
And so it's like until you're like, it's my fault.
48:47
It's also because it's not John's ability.
What is what if it's not your fault, it doesn't matter and Hmm.
Like I can't run marathons because I lost my leg at Birth and either you can just never try or you put the metal thing on and you do it anyways.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do, that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur and building an exceptional product takes a level of work that most people are not Accustomed to doing.
And this is probably been a continuous learning experience of my entrepreneurial career is how much work it takes to be good, or rather, how much work it takes to be the best.
0:43
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and buffeted document to their Journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
So every year, I always like to look back and think about my lessons and failures from the year or any kind of big frame shift that's happened.
1:05
And this year, I had to and I'm just going to talk about one of them which was level of effort.
And the big reminder on this was I went to this little YouTube Meetup of guys who had, you know, from five million to several hundred million subscribers on YouTube.
1:25
So very, very big craters for whatever reason they thought.
That little old me would you know be cool to have in the room and what was amazing to me was how much work they were putting into every video.
And some give you some context here for everyone, who asks, because I get on podcasts and I get asked on stage and they're like, how do you make great YouTube videos and I want to be clear after having been to this thing.
1:47
I think we make horrible YouTube videos but the amount of effort that went in is that they would for every video.
They have a 20 to 30 page brief where they're talking about the scenes, the transition The cuts and the first five seconds, they're confirming, the thumbnail opening, another loop presupposing, multiple ideas.
2:06
So that people have open visual cues that they want to confirm later.
The introduction is completely mapping to the very click Beatty headline and image, but they don't its clickbait.
If you don't fulfill it, it's just accurate.
If you have an insane thing, and the video is also insane.
2:23
There are like making insane thumbnail that I'll get all the clicks and then make sure the video delivers on how crazy That thing was and the level of detail like one guy pulled up a video and had 10 million views on.
He's like, are so pissed because these guys copied my exact video and they have 40 million views and the guy who had the most subscribers in, in the, in the group said.
2:44
All right, let's play it.
And so, he sat down we press play.
And in the first two seconds he was like stop the video.
He's like you didn't confirm the thumb.
He's like, that's it.
He's like I don't need to see anymore.
He walked away.
And I was mind-blowing because of the level of detail that was being Ascribed to each of these videos in the concepts and multi-level multiple of them would have pre visits which is like they spend 20 or 30 thousand dollars just to have a full mock-up of the video, they're going to make before, they spent five hundred thousand dollars, fully producing the video.
3:14
And so if you're like, wow, that's a lot of work, that's what it takes to be.
The top point, zero, zero, zero, zero one percent.
And so, to me, it was a great reminder of lessons that I've had earlier my life and His, I'm going to go Quentin Tarantino on you, and the first time that I had this big reframe was was actually when I was pledging, a fraternity, big disclaimer here at the school.
3:39
I went to like 50% of people were Greece.
It was really like you were social or you weren't social, and the only parties were at Greek houses, so you kind of had to be so it's a little different everywhere.
But for where I went to school, that's what it was.
And I remember this, this, this this occurrence.
So, every year a pledge, cast pledge, right?
3:58
And like, clockwork, two weeks in, to the pledging process, there would always be a Revolt.
It happened, my year happened, every year after that people, what they'd all get together?
All the pledges feel lock arms are like this, isn't what we thought it was going to be.
We thought it was going to be fun.
This sucks, right?
We don't want to do this.
4:15
And so I got the opportunity on the other side of the table as president, my junior year.
And so they had, they asked me to come over the freshman's out of the campus because I didn't want to come to like home territory.
So I walked into some kids dorm room.
There's 20 guys in there and I you know, they're all like amped up because they're like, fuck you guy, whatever.
4:33
And so I just had to have, like, I understand you guys are upset.
It's like, okay, just a quick question Who here?
Thought that pledging was going to be easy and no one raised their hand.
I was like, who thought it was going to be hard.
Guys, raise their hand was, like, why don't you look around?
4:50
What do you think about your feeling right now?
I was like, this is what hard feels like.
And it's such a frame shift because a lot of times we are accustomed to what a certain level of heart is and we've defined this level of struggle as hard but every once in a while you get something that comes on top of that and then it feels very hard but how you reframe that reality after I had that conversation with those guys, they all accepted.
5:15
Okay.
This is what hard feels like and then the rest of the time they were fine and they finish the process like everyone else does.
And so it had it, we had a break reality for them in order for them to reframe what hard fall.
Like, and so, when I went to this YouTube Meetup, it did the same thing for me, yet again, in a sphere that I wasn't familiar with, but it reminded me of a lesson that I've known over and over and over again, that all great things, take great effort and the difference between a good thing in a great thing is often, 20 times, 100 times the work.
5:46
And so, when you see a video that has 50 million views on here, like, man, that guy is so lucky, right?
The amount of thought, and work, and prep, Andre recording and editing, and post.
Like, These guys are making like one video a month and they're spending every hour of every day with a 25-person team to make one video.
6:02
And so when you think about that versus like I made a video on how to get Facebook leads, right?
Like, of course, you're not going to get the same exits, a talking head in front of a camera and so it discounts the amount of work that is truly acquired to win the next time after this pledging occasion that I had, was, I actually went to a law firm in France.
6:19
You might not know this, but I went and spent a whole summer in France, as a legal intern, and so forth.
My first language, fun fact.
Well haven't spoken a long time but my idea was all good.
I was good enough to go there and so I remember I got I talked to one of the partners of the law firm and it was this older lady and I was like, yeah I have to do this whole I have to translate this person's agreement from.
6:44
They wanted me to translate from French to English in legal language, and I was like, Jesus.
And so I'm working on this thing and I was like, man, this is so much work.
And this lady laughed at me and she was like, She's like you're so young you don't even know what work is.
She's like, you've never even you haven't learned to work yet and she said it in like a very loving manner, but she was just like, you haven't learned what the word work means, and as somebody who now has more little bit more experience in the law world, or at least from what I witnessed, their people worked Around the Clock.
7:17
Well as friends.
So not as much.
But like here in the US like people work around the clock at law firms and just a level of work level of output is so much higher that she was right.
I had No idea.
I think my entire like, like one of the months I was supposed to current translate a contract, I think nowadays, I probably like three days work or two days work riding with AI, who knows?
7:34
But the point is, is that she reframed what level of effort was required to win.
And so, for example my book that's coming out hundred million dollar leads, I spent to this point two years and two thousand hours working on the book.
7:50
My editors been 15:00, work on the book.
So together to people spent thirty five hundred Hours working on one piece of content that we're basically going to give away for free tonight.
Basically are giving away free in multiple ways, digital formats hardbacks guy paid for but the main thing was the difference between my first draft and my ninth draft.
8:14
And my 19th draft, 19th draft of getting.
This book is what I think is the difference between a good book and a great book.
And for me, Me, the standard that I wanted to set for this book was that I wanted this book to become Cannon, meaning, when people talk about the great books of advertising and marketing and business, they bring up this book, like in every one of those listicles, they're like, oh, this is one of the 10 books, you have to read, like, I want it to be in that list, and I want it to be in that list, not now, but 20 years from now, and so leaving that, as the standard was a very high bar to meet, not just like, can I write 200 Pages worth of words and put a face and a cover on it?
8:54
Because I've had a lot of people who saw The success of hundred-mile offers and said, oh, I'm going to go write a book and they wrote it in like four weeks and they're, you know, they're surprised when like they do their launch and then it doesn't sell anymore after that.
And they have to spend the rest of their time, trying to promote the book because the book the quality of the book doesn't promote itself.
9:12
And so the thought process I had was, if I spend two years making an exceptional book, then I won't ever have to Market it again for the rest of my life because it will Market itself.
The same thing with the offers book, it continues to sell more More copies every month after month.
9:28
And that comes from the product.
It's a higher leverage activity to make something exceptional, even though you front load the work.
If you spend 10 hours on a video versus one hour, you might actually get a hundred times the views because of the incremental level of effort.
9:45
And if you go from spending 10 hours to 100 hours on the video, you might get another hundred times the views because the Level the.
So there's the law of diminishing returns meaning your incremental unit of effort, only gets you an incremental return, so less and less return every time.
10:04
But here's the counter load of that, which is that you get exponential Returns the better, you are.
And so what's the difference between the best Olympic runner in the world and the second-best tenth of a second and think about all of the diminishing returns they had to do for all the practices and all the things.
10:19
But what's the difference between being gold and silver in terms of life everything and so Even though they both had diminishing returns that little bit that extra bit of quality that might have taken the number one guy, another year of training to get this much out.
10:34
The real world difference is everything.
And so, One of the mindsets that I've had and continue to be reinforced, is how much work there really is.
And it's difficult when you're younger to appreciate, how much work can go into a single project, simply because you haven't had that many years to work yet.
10:53
So a fifteen-year-old cannot have worked on any project for five years.
It's impossible.
And so when you're 30, you can have spent a decade building one thing but you can't really have done that when you're 20 and so that is We're I think people who are older have a real advantage over the young.
11:13
I'm not saying forever because obviously younger people get older too, but they had that Advantage because they know what it looks like when it's hard, when you have to keep putting in more hours every day to make the 16th version, the 17th version, the 18th, you think, why didn't you just publish the 18th?
11:31
Because I didn't think it was as good as the 19th was, and the 19th version of it, as it currently stands.
I can't think of anything else that I can do to it.
It and I wanted to leave all of my heart on the field and say, like there's nothing else I can do.
Like this book is as good as I have the ability to make.
11:46
Now whether the market agrees is a separate question but in terms of where I feel like my output of, like what my best work is the work is done.
And I think in part of my fear is that as my quality standards continue to grow as I as my tolerance for mediocrity continues to go down, How much work I have to put in for what to for it to be my best for there to be nothing left to do or to work on continues to expand.
12:13
Which is why I think some of the biggest projects are the ones that take the longest.
The reason why some of the biggest business tycoons, talk about people under estimating, what you can do in a year and overestimating how, some of the biggest business tycoons talk about people overestimate, what they can do in a year, but they underestimate what they can do in a decade.
12:31
And so switching my perspective to the amount of work that I can do in a a key to accomplish something big, actually makes the big things more accomplished able because everybody tries to make a best-selling book in 90 days, What best-selling book was written in 90 days, not many, hey guys, real quick.
12:51
For those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money, you can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
13:12
Its fo free in exchange for your email.
So that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you cannot miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And so looking at the achievements and then reversing what was the price tag of that achievement in terms of hours of effort and work.
13:33
And repetition to me has made these very distant things achievable because it's like, oh, I can now count.
Because at least my, my mindset has shifted enough that I can count in five year increments.
I remember when I brought on my first YouTube editor, he was a vendor in the very beginning because I wanted to just get somebody to hold me accountable to making them.
13:56
As I said, you know, my goal is to make three videos a week and I hope that within a decade, I'll have a million subscribers and I was like, it won't really matter.
If I had a million, I was like, but I feel like if in a decade, I don't have a millionth in.
14:11
The marketplace, will told me that the videos aren't that valuable?
And six months later, we ended up bringing a lot of the team in house and and we I got on call with him and he said, I just want you to know that the perspective shift that you had on that first conversation with me.
He said, I have never once had a client In my entire life say that he's like they're always asking like how do I get 200,000 subscribers in 90 days.
14:31
Like, how do I get?
My videos will go viral and you were like, yeah.
I'm just going to keep making videos for decade and hope that that it works.
And the reason for that, that exact goal was because I heard a podcast of a guy who said he was getting 3,000 applications a month for his, his service business and I was like, man, 3,000 have accused him of those.
14:49
Like, that's a lot of applications all off organic content off of YouTube videos.
So I looked at his at his channel and you think Time.
You had like three hundred thousand subscribers and I was like, man.
That's pretty wild.
And then I clicked view first video, and it had been eight years earlier.
15:05
And so I was like, okay, well, if I do what this guy did and I do the same level of effort for eight years, then maybe I can get something that is 3,000 applications month because my thought was, if I have a business that service business that has 3,000 applications about inbound for free, ah, probably able to build a hundred million dollar.
15:21
You know, Revenue company might be value to half a billion to a billion.
That was kind of my reasoning.
But one of the things that's been the gift of working with people who are significantly wealthier than me now, who have the be next to their name.
Is that all of them talk about significantly longer time Horizons and they talk about it that way, not because they think that it has to take that long.
15:41
But because the amount of work required, to build something, amazing, and huge, just takes time.
And one of the, my favorite quotes from Warren Buffett is you can't sleep with nine women in a month and expect to have a baby.
Like it takes nine months to make a baby, no matter how many women you impregnate.
15:56
I love that because sometimes the work just needs doing and the level of effort reminder that I had from that Meetup, was a reminder of how much room we have to improve in everything that we do in the market in the media side.
And so that was very inspiring for me rather than it being something that made me feel insufficient.
16:14
I mean sure like it made me feel insufficient in that like I know we can do better but in a lot of ways I'm like I saw all the different ways we can improve and that gave me this huge time Horizon of how much better we can be and the work that I know.
No other people won't be willing to do to keep up.
And so, in a lot of ways, you can see the work that you're willing to do to make something great, as the competitive mode, that other people won't be willing to cross.
16:36
And so, I'm going to give you, I'm going to, I'm going to wrap this up with a real world example.
Good, friend of mine wanted to get into a sales recruiting company, right?
Just like everybody under the fucking sun and so he's like yeah I want to recruit sales guys for companies.
I was like, okay well how are you going to be different than everyone else?
And before he had time to answer I was like, let me tell you actually have exceptional.
16:56
Those people because if you think about what the fundamental truths are right?
If you had a sales recruiting business, in every sales person that you had was an exceptional salesperson.
Do you think that you'd have trouble finding business?
No, okay, well then if, if only one thing had to be true and then that if that one thing we're true, everything else worked, why would you not focus all of your effort on that?
17:20
I'll tell you why because people are in a rush.
So their first few sales, guys would probably be pretty good and they, Give them two companies and those companies would be happy and asked for more, but because they hadn't built the infrastructure yet, they then go find a few more people, don't do quite as good of a job and they give it to those people.
17:36
Now, those people might not be dissatisfied but they're like they want not look for more sales, people from them now use the testimony from that guy to get a couple more customers.
Now that demand comes up and the next people that you bring in you put a little bit less effort.
They're just not quite as good as the second round of people and you see where this is going eventually you sell too many people too quickly your quality.
17:56
Drops precipitously and then eventually you're the exact same as everyone else.
And so the amount of work that it took to train and recruit those first people, the ones that you absolutely wanted to make sure had to be good.
Is the level of effort that is the hard work that has to be confronted.
18:11
That is the problem to be solved.
That's the one that has the ten or hundred million dollar price tag on it.
Because I like to think of problems as puzzles with a price tag which is okay.
Like I'll talk to our portfolio company and say hey I think this is what we need to do to get our you know, As value from like 20 million to 100 million and they're like, dude, that's going to be tough.
18:30
And I'm like, well, good thing.
We're going to get paid 80 million dollars to solve the problem.
I was like, makes you feel a little better, right?
They're like.
Oh yeah, when you say it like that and so I encourage you to think like what's the price tag, what's the treasure at the end of this thing for doing it, right?
Because you know what the cost of doing a wrong is you're going to be like everyone else and you're going to struggle and you have a rat race, you're going to price compete and it's gonna be vicious and you have thin margins and it's going to blow and that's what most people's businesses are.
18:54
But if you were that first guy and you, Had that amazing sales guy and you give them and you know you sell the recruiting Services, right?
And let's say it takes you to another two months to get another three.
Good guys.
So what do you think you're going to have trouble selling those three guys?
No, of course not.
19:10
And what's going to happen is you will be able to constrain supply and demand will increase what happens then your price can go up because if you only have so much quality, people will always pay for quality and what happens.
There you have more profit per recruit than other people.
19:26
That is how you become a premium brand.
Everyone wants to position themselves as premium, but doesn't want to do the work of being premium because the end of that, you can position all you want.
The product is all to me.
Going to be the thing that creates the reputation forward like Elon Musk talk about this.
He's like, Ford can go talk about how they're the highest quality and they're reliable.
19:45
He's like, but ask the marketplace.
No one describes forward as high quality and reliable.
The marketplace.
Tells you what your brand is, based on the quality of the product and building an exceptional product takes a level of Work that most people are not accustomed to do it.
And this is probably been a continuous learning experience of my entrepreneurial career is how much work it takes to be good or rather how much work it takes to be the best and the difference in the guys who have 20 million subs and 1 million was an ocean me being at 1 million and some of the guys being a 20 or 50 or 100, the level of effort that they put in every video.
20:19
I honestly think is probably 100 times the effort that we put into these videos.
And to be fair, I think the effort we put into these videos It is a hundred times more than a lot of the guys who have 10,000 Subs on their channels, and here's the tough part.
Is that the work proceeds, the outcome?
20:35
And so, if we start, let's say tomorrow, we snap our fingers.
I triple my, my media team so that we can actually start making these Hollywood level production videos.
Well, we're gonna start putting those videos out and it still make take time for us to reap the fruit of what we've sowed during that period of work and all the recruiting, and all the training, and all the hiring, and all the on.
20:56
That we're going to do for each of these teammates, to get them up to speed.
And then, actually start increasing your output is going to take time and effort, but a lot of people are short cut that.
And I'm telling you, it is the character trait of being able to confront, and push through the work that will ultimately unlock the level of success that other people only wish they had in a final thought.
21:13
I'll leave with is, as you get better, you become more aware of how much work there is yet to be done.
It's only a beginner who asks, beginner type questions when I get questions?
Like, how do I get to a million?
In dollars in 90 days, I already know that the person's never going to get there because of the constraints that they put on the question itself.
21:33
And so the better you are the more areas of opportunity you see where you can improve and so the more deficiencies you realize you have and so this is the classic dunning-kruger effect which is the more expert, somebody is the more they realize they don't know.
And so the long leg of right now you're like this is all I have to do that.
21:48
It probably means you don't know enough because the more aware you become of the deficiencies, you have the the endless Of improvement that, you know, that you can squeeze out.
And in my experience, big products, amazing media, exceptional work, doesn't have silver bullets.
22:05
It has hundreds of golden BB's.
It has many tiny incremental, one percent, two percent returns that when added together become exceptional, there is a UK B coach who took over the team and they were dead last when he took the team over and just like John Wooden the, you know, arguably one of the best basketball coaches of all time started.
22:26
It every season by training.
All these new players on how to put their socks on, was that by getting one percent improvements on every aspect.
So that b coach, he got slightly lighter bikes.
You got slightly more aerodynamic helmets.
He had different types of pad it, so they didn't have bruising in their crotch from all the time that they're on the bike.
22:44
He likes had different types of shoes.
He made sure that they were hydrated certain amount and every one of these tiny things just prevented some people from getting injured.
Prevent it it added more people getting a little bit you know shaving seconds here saving s there.
To within a few years they were unbeatable and they won 6 World Championships after that forming the worst team and he did no silver bullets.
23:04
Just hundreds of golden bee bees and the work that needs to be done the level of effort to build the amazing YouTube video that amazing influencer brand, the amazing business that you want is rarely one thing because if it were one thing, everyone would do it.
But it's a lot of little things that it just takes time to check off the list and that's what takes a decade is building something that you've checked off.
23:26
And small babies on the list.
And then people look at you and say, hey how can I do that in 90 days?
And for me, I defined having done enough work, which is one of the hardest questions, they answer because you always think yourself like it could be better, right?
And you may not know this, but there are tolkien's The Hobbit he actually never submitted the draft for The Hobbit.
23:43
He worked on it for a decade and it was one of his colleagues who stole the manuscript and then submit it on his behalf in order to get it published because he said it wasn't done yet and then it ended up becoming the big success that it was.
And so for me I Define Fine, when the work is done in one.
23:58
When one of two things happen, one is that any additional effort makes it worse?
Like if I'm adding things that shouldn't be added or if I'm cutting things that shouldn't be cut, that's where I'm like there's it is down to its simplest and most pure form, whatever the work is.
24:15
And if you think about a software that way it's like how can I make this simple?
How can I make it easier to use, how can I make it faster now?
Things like software?
Because the world changes it has to constantly evolve but something like a book.
At a certain point like it has been packed in.
There's no more space in the crevices for more knowledge.
24:32
Based on my skill set in 10 years I'll probably read this book and be like oh my God I couldn't prove a million things.
When I read the office book I was blow my brains out cause I'm like oh my God I can prove all these things about it but we get better right?
And we get better through doing work because when I wrote offers I hadn't had another 2,000 hours of writing with continuous feedback in front of me.
24:51
So I'm 2,000 hours of work better now that I was that the second way that I know that Good enough is actually from a macro perspective, which is if my work, the amount of time I put in to get an incremental return, in this one thing you love me less than me, taking that same level of effort putting to something else that ultimately achieved this goal.
25:11
That's when I say the work.
Here is done enough for the ultimate goal and so that's when you go chunking up and chunking down go, so for example, if I was that biker, maybe my like off the track time, like right off the start is like something I was improving at a certain point.
How How much time I have to do and approving that I might have another aspect of my game.
25:30
That is weaker relatively.
So then I take the effort that goes there, put it in my Hills or whatever and that will overall improve my bike racing time.
And so whatever the goal is it's reversing the constraint and knowing that whatever my incremental level of effort is compared to somewhere else, I could put it will get me more output.
25:50
So whenever it no longer is the biggest bang for buck.
I shift to the next thing.
That'll be the biggest bang for buck, so, In writing the book, first, it was making sure that all the content was there.
Then it was making sure that we added it to its shortest possible form.
Then we edit it for punctuation, then we made sure that it was below a third grade reading level.
26:07
And so each of these, since I finished the punctuation thing, well now I could probably work more punctuation, but I think you'd be more valuable for me to go through the reading level and lower the vocabulary.
And that's how you kind of shift through even though the overarching goal is to ride the best book ever.
I might in a micro perspective, finished the work to be done in this narrow sliver.
26:25
I think all of this comes down to working on yourselfers is working on the project seeing yourself as the output of your work rather than the thing you're working on.
So it's like I worked on becoming a better writer of the output of that work was a book and I will continue to work on becoming a better writer because I'm not done.
The book is done but I'm not done and so on my journey, my first book was, you know, Jim wants secret such as a manual on how to make Jim's more profitable.
26:47
Is not as good as hundred offers.
Now mind you.
I think it's a very good book.
I spent a lot of time on it but it's not as good.
It's probably.
It's also just not as wide like not nearly as many people will learn about how to make their gym.
Business more profitable but I've been part of becoming a better writer is making things that you think will be palatable to more people.
27:02
Like, I think the next book I write will be palatable to even wider audience, because it'll be about sales and influence that.
You, whether you have kids, whether you have your Junior employees, are doing it for sales, the influence, in the persuasion component of it is going to affect everyone.
So it'll be a wider bigger book.
And so for me, I am the output of the work I do rather than the thing that I'm working.
27:20
So I can see progress every day rather than thinking like the book isn't published yet, and I spent two years on it.
Like, that is a very long.
Trough or must be like most people can do anything for 90 days.
So like we're going to book for two years is tough right on the 17th drafting like we need another draft.
27:36
That can be hard, you know?
But it's hard if you're measuring it based on the book it's gets easier.
If you're like, I'm better at writing now than I was on dropped one.
And so I'll be better draft 18.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect.
0:15
And let's rock and roll.
Hey, what's going on everybody?
Happy Sunday, I'm just doing a little house, walk.
Some of you come along with me, kind of trying to change the the background for you.
So it doesn't get too boring in my office.
But anyways, I was reading a book.
So this morning I do a lot of reading on Sundays and it was talking about how there are three types of people in the world from a basis of giving and interpersonal exchange.
0:41
Which I thought was interesting is that there are takers, there are matchers and there are givers and you know, unsurprisingly the people who were Matchers and takers were in the middle of the bell curve, right in terms of success in life in income and the people who aren't either side of the bell curve as in the lowest people in the bell curve and the highest people on the bell curve, we're givers.
1:09
And I thought that was really interesting and what delineating the people who are successful givers at the top and the bottom was the degree to which they trusted other people.
And so they asked people to of the ones that were self, you know, they identified as givers to rate on a scale from One that are 0 to 10 how much they trusted other people.
1:29
And the givers who ranked 8th were the ones who were the most financially successful.
If they did nine or ten, they trust people too much, they weren't using discernment.
They were most likely to be taking advantage of from takers and matchers Etc.
Right now I read that and I put the book down and I was thinking I was like man that's so interesting.
1:49
And so I wanted to give you a little example of what I seen even with our within our own group.
And kind of a couple examples that that that were that, that positively impacted me in my life.
And so for me, the first time I ever saw this happen in, in reality was, I was in eighth grade.
2:08
And this guy I was in math class.
I remember this.
And this guy who I didn't, I didn't really know, took out a pack of gum.
It was like in the beginning of school.
And he turned around and was like, does anyone want one?
2:25
And then everyone's like, yeah, well one right, like I mean like, you know, he like emptied out three quarter of his pack of gum and I got a piece of gum and I was like I'm like holding this piece of gum and I like put it in.
I was like man that guy is such a nice guy and I thought I was like he just gave away like almost an entire pack of gum and I remembered I myself it just like right after I thought the thought I was like All I gotta do is give away a pack of gum and I can get everybody to like me.
2:52
I was like holy cow because what happened is, even if you didn't get a piece of gum, you're like that guy's pretty generous.
That was a really nice move.
You know, I mean like so if you ever go to a conference or something like little things like that, like just just having stuff and just be like, hey does anyone want one?
Like just turning around behind you in church and being like you want a piece of gum One Church, everyone does a because they're like a mentor and I'm going to be a giver today but you get what?
3:13
You get my point, right?
So anyways, that was the first time I saw that and that's that lesson.
For some reason stuck with me.
And so later on, in life, when I was in college, you know, you know, the the way that people vote for like who's going to become a president of like a group is going to be the one that they feel like they got the most from and for me when we were going through like a pledging process that we had to go through and I'll bring this up but it was it was formative for me.
3:39
It was like who's going to work The Late Shift, right and you know people try to divide labor up but I was always someone who worked pretty fine without a lot of sleep.
And so I took I took Out of the brunt of the work during that kind of crappy time and people always remembered that.
3:54
And they were like, man, that was awesome.
So I'm not trying to Tasty this to pump myself up which is really not the point.
I'm just saying that it was something that I learned in 8th grade and then later by like saying like, hey I'll give of my time and obviously bless you go to study for your test.
4:10
People remember that?
And again, later when I was now more of an adult I was in the Inner Circle which is Russell Brunson is like, Mastermind for marketers.
And so I think everyone in there has to be in the to accomplish was like, you have to already done a million in sales.
4:28
What doesn't matter the point is, is there high level marketers?
And I was like, they introduced an award called.
This is a member of the year, right?
And so they vote for who out of the whole years, just been the best contributor.
And this award wasn't there.
4:44
When I joined it, he just said, hey, we're going to give it a worth of the person who's giving the most of the group.
Whoop and and I ended up winning most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
5:02
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And it was because I did the same thing that I learned in eighth grade and the same thing that I learned in the fraternity and it was because I'm probably maybe it's officially.
5:25
I was like I soon as I got into the group, I just like reached out to everyone.
Was like, how can I help you?
Is there anything that I can do?
These are the things that I tend to be better at and I would hop on our lawn cause of people and help them with whatever to the whatever degree that could right now to remind them of the meetings.
And I would like send them notes and really just serve and we're not.
5:44
Happens.
I got lots of deep relationships from a bit.
I got lots of connections.
I have lots of favors that I have that.
I like that can probably call in at a later time, but it's been a repeatable process and to bring this full scope for you. inside of the gym, Lord scroop, one of the things that sometimes guys will do You can say, it's whatever I don't really care.
6:10
Is that guys will trade reviews because the more reviews you have in your gym, the more likely people will come to your facility, right period?
The more five star reviews the better.
And so in Legacy, a lot of guys will try and, you know, like, give each other reviews, right?
And it's fascinating to watch when I said there's three types of people, right?
6:30
You've got takers, you got matchers and you've got givers and I implore anyone.
Who's in legacies, watching this video, Try And I say it in the training, but I'm going to repeat it.
There are guys who post up there and say, hey guys, I could really use some reviews, right?
6:47
That's one those guys probably don't get a ton of reviews right there.
Just taking its what it is.
Second is you've got guys who are like hey I'll throw a review for a review.
I got an afternoon free like throw me one.
I'll throw you one back right now.
If you're really trying to maximize this after just hearing those other stories, what do you think the best way to get shit loads of reviews has Give a ton of reviews, go through the entire fucking list.
7:11
Excuse me, the entire list of gyms and give everyone a review and guess what happens, even if they don't give you a review back, one, you'll have more than everyone else too.
If someone doesn't give your you back they are now indebted to you.
7:28
It's reciprocity right?
They owe you one and when they see you at the event, they're like oh man that guy.
Alex legit he left me a faster and even ask me for anything, right?
And then you gain influence, right?
You have leverage in a social relationship, you gained capital and influence.
7:43
So people are like how you can influence.
That's how that's how you do it.
You get first.
So anyways, um, I thought this was a really real of an example and I was reading the book and I thought You guys might find that interesting if you are a gym owner and the things seem stuff goes with business, right?
It's like the more you give, the more you get.
8:00
And if you give first and everyone's afraid of giving, first cousins afraid of being taken advantage of, but the reality is that if you give first, you're the one who always ends up winning, right.
So I thought it was a nice Sunday.
Thought Sunday was not a business super business.
8:16
He thing that's directly actionable, but it's definitely something that long-term in life will make you more than many, maybe anything else which is Is giving more than taking.
So anyway, guys, lots of love if you are a gem, Lord, maybe you can be inspired by this give instead of a scar match.
8:33
So, also do to have an amazing Sunday, and I'll see you guys tomorrow.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, that's fair.
This is equal both our ideals and yet somehow they're not the same thing and yet both are right and so because of that, we will always have this conflict.
It's the same thing between Justice and mercy, both of them are ideals.
0:32
Both of them are right.
And yet somehow they're conflicting.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt to documenting the lessons.
I've learned on my way to build an acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us, to get to undermine dollars and Beyond, I hope you share and enjoy.
0:55
When I was in the beginning of my entrepreneurial career, I would read a book on delegation, right?
And as soon as I read the book, I was like, okay, this is how you delegate and then I would come back to the team and be like, alright, delegate delegate, delegate, delegate delegate, right?
And I'm like, all right, y'all are good.
And then I would dip out.
1:11
And then you know we all kind of know how the story is probably going to go me being super excited about business and thinking that things are going to, you know, Otto, Otto things are going to run themselves right now that I've delegated everything.
I'm big boss, man.
And then, of course, I would check in a few weeks later and then things weren't on the Wanted to and then, of course, you know, I read super, you know, a bunch of books on management Etc.
1:31
And then I dive super far in and start micromanaging.
Everyone could trying to control everything and then yet again, the problem would arise where people were not doing what I wanted them to do.
But for different reasons because they felt completely stifled.
They wouldn't take initiative because they felt like they needed my sign-off and everything, and then I'm basically a huge bottleneck in the business yet again, but in a different way.
1:49
And so I say that to illustrate one of the thinking Frameworks that Has served me, well, and I'm actually really excited to talk about this because when I, when I talk to people I think a lot of people think that I'm told that sometimes I communicate some ideas.
Well, and so what I wanted to do was provide you the Frameworks for thinking through thoughts, and I know that sounds crazy, but I'm going to give you four different Frameworks that work really well for me.
2:12
I'll try to give you examples of each one of them.
So, the example, there's started with that little story, right?
Is an example of something where most people try and solve how much management versus you know, should I do?
It or should I manage, right?
And instead of thinking of it as a problem to be solved, it is instead a dichotomy to be managed as in micromanaging is not good on this extreme and you know complete delegation on this side is not good either way.
2:39
Right abdication.
And so there's a middle ground.
And so what's interesting about this is that there are a lot of different things that come up in the business world where I will see people conflate or mistake.
What thing they are solving right in, At times when I'm talking to a newer entrepreneur or even a more established entrepreneur and they reach out for help or guidance or whatever, right?
3:01
Or it's one of our portfolio companies.
Most times those start talking, right?
Really fast about all this stuff to try and provide context and I'll just usually pause.
Then maybe like what problem are we solving?
It usually gets them to stop, right?
And I would highly advise you if you're if you're dealing with if you have subordinates or you have direct reports who rolling to you and they have a whole bunch of decisions, a lot of times you can get caught and sometimes ourselves to we can get caught in the in the day-to-day.
3:25
Minutiae and just simply pause and say what problem are we solving.
There's so many pieces of this that I want to unpack.
That I think are going to be really interesting for you, but the first one is when you define what problems you are solving, you may even have to ask the question, is that a problem?
Once a were like well, hey, we're getting, you know, customer service complaints, it's like, okay understood.
3:44
Is this something that we believe that we can reasonably eliminate?
Is this something that is catastrophic to the business or is this something that we can kind of try and improve over time you know through systems and process right?
And so a lot of times people Miss prioritize problems because they perceive them as as threats to existence.
3:59
When in reality, they are a course of doing business and things that we can consume, we improve, right?
Especially if you're newer, you're starting out, of course, your products not going to be perfect at, right?
You're just getting going, but you improve these things rather than thinking I have to stop everything to fix this problem, right?
And so, the first frame shift is that most people think in terms of like, I have a problem to solve, rather than a dichotomy to be managed, as in these are two things that will always exist.
4:23
All right, I'll give you a different example of this.
Actually, this will be a fun one.
The reason we will probably never have people who are all happy about a tax code is because you cannot have both fairness and equality.
Equality means everyone pays 10% fairness means the rich people, pay more than the poor people.
4:41
That's fair.
This is equal both our ideals and yet, somehow they're not the same thing and yet both are right and so because of that, we will always have this conflict.
It's the same thing between Justice and mercy.
Both of them are Ideals.
Both of them are right and yet somehow they're conflicting.
4:59
And so we see these situations, and this is why I'm trying to hopefully give this to you.
Because the more I started to recognize these patterns, the more quickly I could recognize them and then identify them.
And then either dismiss them or say, oh, it's another one of those, right?
It's a pattern recognition, it's like, oh, you guys are spending all this effort trying to solve a problem that is unsolvable.
5:17
This is a dichotomy that must be managed and will never be eliminated.
And so, I think what my goal with this is if I can help you get out of these Mental hamster, wheels.
It's been incredibly valuable for me.
All right.
So that's the dichotomy.
That's like one of the.
One of the things that people will mistake the mistake a dichotomy for a problem that needs to be solved.
5:36
All right, a most efficient quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
5:53
And I will give you all the love.
In the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Another framework that I find immensely valuable is the concept of a Continuum versus a binary.
6:08
All right.
This is probably one of the biggest mental errors that people make when they're trying to identify things.
And this is what I mean by that.
So for example, I might say I'll use a weight loss example.
So people will say something like I am off my diet or I'm on my diet, right.
6:25
It's a very simple thing and that's because psychologically we like to be binary.
We Like to label things as yes or no but biology and reality exists on continuum's.
As in to what extent did you go off of your diet, right?
Did you go 200 calories over to go?
500 calories over?
6:41
And as even though it is, quote, more difficult to think, in this way, it is also more accurate and so are bringing uses binaries as placeholders for decision-making to store data.
Right?
When in reality, when you start storing all these binary decisions.
They start adding up and you start getting more and more run accurate, that's a word.
6:59
On your decision making process because you're actually basing your decisions not on facts, but based on binary shorthand that your brain saves.
And so that is one of the biggest mistakes that I see all the time in thinking in entrepreneurs and really in anything in general.
Because we like to have that shorthand, it is easier, right?
7:16
It's easier to say, I fell off my diet or I am diabetic.
When the reality is, it's not, whether you are a diabetic.
It's how diabetic are you, right?
Kind of interesting.
I stole that from dr.
Kashi, but I just love that who's Mike.
Listen, Fred!
He's a biochemist and we talked The stuff all the time point being.
If you can think about this within I'll give you I'll give you a business example.
7:34
So if we have a binary where people are saying yes or no which is let's say Facebook doesn't work marketing doesn't work.
I hear these statements all the time and you may laugh at this, right?
But I get DM's like this all the time.
Facebook doesn't work for me, Mark and you doesn't work for me.
Like you can't sell this way in my business, right?
7:52
And so people want to shorten a problem into yes, it works.
No, it doesn't work when so much of business and problem solving Thing is understanding the Nuance between where we're starting and where we're going, and it's to what extent has Facebook, not worked right?
Where is the fall off, right?
8:08
It is not that it doesn't work.
It is just, we only got it to work this percent right now.
We need to get all the way over the hump to get there, but it's to what extent and I think that when I when, if you can ask the right questions, if you can see the problems as they truly are, they become far more solvable.
And so this has been probably I just gave you two of my, my best frames that I think.
8:29
With all the time.
Alright.
So I'll say these again.
So the first mental lapse, I'll say that I see all the time is mistaking.
A dichotomy that needs to be managed for a problem that needs to be solved.
People do this in their marriages as well, right?
8:45
So you look at your wife, right?
You look at your wife and you're like, I need more variety, right?
But later you're like, I need more consistency.
And you're like, we have to figure this out.
We need variety, we need consistency.
It's like, yes, you need both, right.
And so it's not a problem.
He solves that Ike.
Automated managed.
9:01
That's framework.
Number one.
The second framework between two things that I see as a problem that most people make is that they use a psychological binary to make a judgment and say yes this works.
No, this doesn't work or yes.
This is this way?
Or?
No, this, not this way so that I can apply this arbitrary label.
9:16
That was made up when instead, it is to what extent, right?
It is a Continuum.
I did not go off my diet or stay on my diet.
It is, how far off did I go?
And a lot of times when we do that, we also Stop the mental Judgment of being terrible people because we can actually approach reality, which is I was 10% over yesterday so I can go 10% under today and be fine and be on track with my goal rather than oh I was off.
9:41
I might as well eat 19 pizzas because I'm off because that's the psychological shorthand, psychological binary of yes or no.
And so those two understandings have underpinned.
A lot of the breakthroughs in terms of how I think through things that have served me.
9:56
Well, and also when talking to entrepreneurs, Ours.
And they're trying to figure out what is wrong, quote wrong with their business, when in reality, even naming it.
As a problem, might actually not be the case when it is actually a dichotomy.
That needs to be managed or there are labeling a binary, when it really is, a Continuum.
10:14
All right?
And so, if you look at the problems that come up in your life, whether they're personal, whether they're physical were there with their business wise.
If you look at just with those two lenses first, and, and me sharing this, like, these are the things that like, Charlie Munger talks about having a latticework of mental models.
10:29
Like how are the, you know, any checks through decisions with mental models.
And so I want to share as many of those as I possibly can with you guys because I think if we can think, if we can be precise with our language, we can precise with our thinking, if we can ask the right questions, we will get the right answers.
If you ask stupid questions, you get stupid answers.
10:45
If you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes.
And so my goal for everyone here and Mosey nation is that we do not play stupid games and not wants to be prizes, but instead get exactly what we desire, so that we can then ask the big questions of life.

You have this big vision for your life that you want in.
On this side, your family gets kidnapped and if you don't do something they will kill them all which of those motivates, you more right now.
In this video, when I was 15, 16 17, I was a pretty angry kid.
I thought that I had all these issues.
0:16
I would tell people, I have anger issues, I'm not a nice person.
I would tell people those things because I believe those things to be true and I saw them as problems and then I went to college and in college it's all propaganda of People who are teaching, who've never actually done work in a real economy ever.
0:35
They're all tenured, they don't live in reality.
They tell everyone, they should pursue their purpose and their passion and the things that he loved and I ate it up.
And so I read all these books on pop psychology.
I wash all these TED talks and the problem was, I didn't make any progress and I felt like there was something even more wrong with me because I didn't feel any of that stuff.
0:53
I wish I could go back and tell myself dude.
All the stuff they're saying is just not true.
Like you don't need any of that.
You can embrace the fact that you are angry, you can embrace the fact that you feel like you are in pain and you can use that to make the life that you want.
1:11
You don't have to use the lovey-dovey purpose, passion to build the life that you want to build.
What it does is it tells people that having a negative emotional experience is a bad thing, but half of your life is below average by definition and so if you are not using the half of your life as energy, Motivation to create the life you want, then you're at a huge disadvantage.
1:31
They interviewed the top Olympic medalists and they found that they don't actually love winning.
They hate losing when they win, they experienced relief not Euphoria.
If you look at Steve Jobs, he wasn't some happy-go-lucky dude who was like, man, I just want to make the world a better place.
1:47
He was a tough dude to work for, but he created Something Beautiful from that pain MJ.
You look at Kobe.
They had imaginary situations that they created in their minds to To create more suffering in their own lives to motivate them and uses fuel.
Imagine you have this big vision for your life that you want in.
2:05
On this side, your family gets kidnapped and if you don't do something they will kill them all which of those motivates you more right now.
In this video probably the one with your family.
Getting kidnapped, it's not trying to harness a lovey-dovey feeling it's harnessing pain felt like I had experience more pain than I had good.
2:24
I saw it as a disadvantage.
I saw it as That I had to overcome.
I didn't have this big purpose.
I didn't have this thing that I loved I didn't have this thing.
I was passionate about and if I could have just skipped all of that and started the moment I accepted that it was okay to be angry.
2:42
What was it?
Okay was not doing anything about it while I procrastinate it by trying to find purpose, jumping from thing to thing to thing, trying to find thing that really lit, my fire and just accepted that it was totally okay to work.
My face off in disgust just from my current circumstance and who I was then I would have gotten to where I wanted to go much faster.
3:04
So many people are believing a lie.
They have to be happy.
They have to have purpose passion for what they're doing in order to get out of their situation.
They think that they are poor because they don't have passion, that is false.
You were poor because you're not doing the activities that make you rich and you can fuel those activities whatever way you damn.
3:23
Well please.
And so if you are somebody who is more motivated by the Side then Lean Into the Dark Side.
Unlike the saying, the road to hell is paved with good intentions to equal opposite of that is the road to Heaven is Haven with bad intentions.
You can do good shit with bad motivation.
3:39
When I say bad, I mean negative experiences pain, anger, Etc.
I still have tons of motivation from that side, you can use that - fuel hit it on speed, dial every time you're confronted with that thing that you don't want to do you push through it.
And what happens?
You do, that enough times.
You start to get good at the thing.
3:54
You start seeing the result of work that has compounded.
It and start to see a purpose or start to see a bigger Vision.
The big vision for Alex's life until maybe four years ago was don't be broke.
What was your mission with Jim?
What?
My mission was to stop being poor.
There are elements of shit that I do that.
4:09
I absolutely love but there are tons of shit that I do every day that I fucking hate.
I just don't hate it.
More than I hate the alternative and the richest people in the world.
They all say, it's not about the money is if it's about the money, you stopped the moment, you have enough.
The people were the wealthiest in the world, have the three things in common.
4:26
They have the big goal.
They have massive fears about never being enough and then they have impulse control to stay on goal and oftentimes that impulse control comes from right as you approach the guardrail, looking over the edge and imagining what it would be like to have your friends, tell you that you were a failure, I have them laugh behind your back or talk down about you, or have your parents when they're introducing you as their fun-loving kid.
4:47
You know, he's still figuring himself out that is what would crush me?
The boring shit that you have to do, is not fun.
Jeff.
Bezos talks about overhead in business, there's tons of things.
Things that you have to do and be willing to do that.
You do not enjoy.
The question is whether you do not enjoy them more than you, do not enjoy the pain that you were going away from it.
5:06
As long as the pain of moving forward is less than the pain of going back.
And the pain that you imagine from not taking the action that, you know, should be taking.
Then you can use that energy as the single fuel that you can stay on path for an extended period of time.
I'm writing my book right now.
I'm on the 11th fucking draft.
5:23
Like, there is no feeling that makes me more sick than the idea that I could have done.
The more the pain of the idea of that book not doing well or that book leading to people being like, I don't think he tried as hard, that is the thing that hurts so much more than going from the top.
5:39
Yet again to make another video to make another article to make another short, to make another fucking chapter revision yet again.
So that when I do launched it, I think to myself, I literally exhausted.
Every option on this one of the sayings that I live by is that I will not do my best.
5:54
I will do what is required and the difference between what your best.
Is and what is required is the difference between what you think you're real best is and what your actual best is and what your actual best is.
The thing that you would do to prevent everyone, you know from dying, what people care about is the outcome, what you put out in the world.
5:57
Is and what is required is the difference between what you think you're real best is and what your actual best is and what your actual best is.
The thing that you would do to prevent everyone, you know from dying, what people care about is the outcome, what you put out in the world.








0:00
If you're like, well, I don't like doing anything else.
Like well then that's impossible because your brain is wired to be rewarded for things and so you are doing things that reward you, that's why you do them.
Welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:19
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
One of the themes that I'm very interested in to do with your work in general, and it's one of the reasons why it Bridges the Gap from what we're going through, which had, you know, some really lovely philosophical insights and all of the rest of it.
0:36
The difference is, you seem to have a knack to be able to drag yourself out of the philosophy, and get yourself into action.
There's not too much mental masturbation that goes on.
So, let's say that there's someone who's listening to this podcast.
0:52
You know, thousands of people that are listening, who are that person, Millions thousands of people that are, that person will be, it'll be a lot of people that listen, don't worry that person that goes I've I love when I hear these aphorisms and things and maybe it goes on the white board.
1:09
That's on the front of my fridge for a couple of months.
How does that person get from mental masturbation?
Yeah.
Around it to action that this this impact my life in a tangible way, that actually makes a difference to me.
Of the things that we go through today.
All right, two things.
1:25
One is knowing the input output equation.
The second is know what your fuel is going to be.
So if you can't define the inputs and outputs that are going to get you, what you want, then there's no way to start because you don't know what you're supposed to do.
So you have to Define it down to like the most basic first action.
So it's like, if I want to start creating content, that means I have to post something.
1:42
If it means, I have to start doing cold.
I always think in terms of business, because that's what I'm in.
But like, I'm either doing cold, reach out, I'm doing a cold, cold, cold email, cold, DM, whatever that is, I have to make Make a piece of content, I have to post.
If you make a podcast, have to make a YouTube video to make a short, whatever that is make a blog post.
I have to run an ad, right?
2:00
I've to run the ad after press go.
I have to spend the money, whatever, it is, whatever that core initial actions of the gym left.
The white, put your shoes on, get in the car ever.
The input is you have to Define what the input is.
That's going to get you the output you want now, once you know what that input output is the next one is, why aren't you doing it, right?
And so I think a lot of people are looking for something.
2:19
That is very hard to find and so and then they attribute their lack of success or lack of action because they don't have passion or motivation.
Right.
And I was the same way.
And so the short story around this was that I I'll I watched all the TED talks in college like that was like what?
2:37
I don't know watching YouTube and watching TED talks and I was like and then I realized then I heard the term mental masturbation and I was like oh that's definitely what I've done.
I was like my life hasn't changed at all and then I got my job.
So out of college and I would read All the self-help books, I read like every night.
So, I did, I just read all these self-help books and I found one of them that said, there are people who are want your pruners and entrepreneurs.
2:59
And I remember hearing that word Watcher preneur and I was like, it made me feel sighs.
I don't be fucking watch brands.
Like I'm not some bitch like he didn't like but I was like but what if they're right, I am a watcher printer.
I'm not an entrepreneur.
I want to be one and I'm not and from that point it took me six months to quit my job to actually decide.
3:19
To do the entrepreneurial thing.
And the thing there are many things that contributed to me being able to leave.
And I think a lot of it's not like we're looking for one thing.
It might be a big bag of wise, a lot of them, right?
That add up together to be above your action threshold.
And I think in the early days, people are looking for the big carrot, they want the big Vision.
3:38
They want the big passion, but they don't have it but I want to I'll give you the first row of Entrepreneurship that I have learned which is use what you have and a lot more people have pain.
A lot more people have a Anger, a lot more people have shame and if you can use that as your gas in the beginning, you'll eventually get to a point where you can get out of that Loop.
3:57
And then find something that you are really passionate about.
But if you can't tie your shoes, you can't lift the weight.
You can't send the DM, then you have to start with whatever you have.
And so, for me, it was hatred of my current existence.
I hated being an entrepreneur.
I hated being a wannabe.
I had been one of those people who like talked about all the things they're going to do, didn't do anything.
4:16
I hated living the life that my dad wanted me to live I was I was his bitch it's what it was.
I was his bitch I was living his dreams out.
I might and that was you know led to that other tweet which was sometimes your parents dreams have to die in order for years to live.
4:32
And for me I realized that the idea that my father had of me as his son that image had to die in order for the image of myself that I wanted to be to live because I kept trying to quit my job and go be an entrepreneur.
4:49
And every time I'd have the conversation, be like, yeah, come over, we'll talk about it when I have dinner, you know what I need, always talked me off.
The ledge is always over and over again, good salesmen.
Yeah, and we're great authoritarian.
You, do you persuade when you have compliance?
And so everybody has that person or it might actually be somebody who's talking off the ledge, or my should be a voice in your head, doesn't really matter because that voice in person that only happened once or twice to probably keeps talking to you when you're at, At home.
5:17
But the big thing for me, when I when I decided to make the jump and mind you, I was such a bitch about it that I had to drive across the country for are called him to tell him that I'd laugh.
Yeah I remember that guy didn't want to.
Yeah I didn't want to confront him what you then like flew off the handle about, but I just knew and this is the Tony Robbins quote, but it's just that when the pain of staying the same is greater than pain of change.
5:38
And I think that I think pain moves people far far more effectively than pleasure does like the easy thing to way to prove it is like point a gun at someone's head and you have absolute compliance and they will do what they need to do.
Right automatically.
5:53
Just like that.
Like death is the great motivator and the gun just reminds you.
And so I think that if you can create the figurative gun to your head of the pain that you're experiencing, and Then I'm a big fan of future casting out - scenarios.
So people talk about like positive visualization I prefer - visualization which is what if I keep doing what I'm currently doing for the next 10 years.
6:14
Well my life look like then that usually takes my current pain and then just magnifies it.
And then that allows me to get my action threshold high enough that it goes over the edge so that I can take that first move.
And so, if you know what the inputs outputs are of what you need to do, the guy who has a little cooler on his wall and you figure out whatever fuel, you've got not the one you wish you had, but the one you've got Got and you use that to do the first input, you've crossed the line you're in the game.
6:39
I told a story on the episode that I did with Duggan's about bullying and school.
And this is something where I like opened up about a topic that and spoken about a ton because it made me feel weak and it made me feel vulnerable and so on and so forth.
But One of the things that only really recently happened, and it's actually been assisted by the guy that reached out and message me.
6:59
This dude messaged in and said that he was sorry for what had happened, his daughter was going to school and it reflect made him reflect on his time at school and how he treated me.
And he was like, dude, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
I don't even know if you're going to see this.
I'm happy that you seem to be happy but you know I just had to get it off my chest that really helped not that I was carrying much.
7:17
Yeah, but one of the questions, you know, spoken about your dad in this kind of like authoritarian relationship and living out that dream house.
How did you avoid or how have you got yourself to a stage now, where you're no longer driven by a chip on your shoulder toward him?
7:34
Because I think that there are a lot of people that go through challenges in that past the that find fuel in it and they go.
Wow, I am I can be fueled by hatred, they're phenomenal.
Tying, I can Alka mais, this toxic thing into something which is useful total, but I would imagine that that has a shelter man.
7:54
Right, that if you keep on using that for long enough, there are more optimal ways that you could start to move perpetually under your own motion transmuted into something else.
How did you get past?
Having this chip on your shoulder about the relationship that you had with your dad and where it had set you back or forward or whatever?
8:15
I'll have you.
Yeah, I think I have, I think my realization was, you know, first, the goal was make as much of my dad, then it was make more in my dad, that was make more than my dad ever made.
And I realized that the approval that I had that I saw it was always going to be moved, right?
8:35
I mean, I've told this story before but maybe not your audience.
But like when I when I might add and I didn't really speak a ton you know we texting or you know two-minute could phone call how you're alive.
Okay cool.
But for that was kind of like for like five ish years after I left home to go to the gym thing and only once Jim watch was like Printing money.
8:55
And so we were, I think I was taking home million and a half a month at like 27 or something like that, and he gave me a call out of the blue.
And like, my dad doesn't like cold call me.
And so I'm sitting at dinner and I step outside and he says, hey, you're going to sit down for this one?
9:12
Okay.
It's like I'm sorry.
I was like about what he was like, everything.
And I remember in the moment actually feeling nothing and thinking that was curious and then being like, huh?
9:28
Okay, and I probably should have just like accepted it for the Olive Ranch that he was probably trying to like lean out to me.
But here's what I said instead, I said, you know how people get up on stage when they win the awards and they're like, I just want to thank my mom and dad for always being there.
9:45
Always believed in me.
I was like I'm not going to say that I was like because you weren't and you didn't believe in me. and, Right after that.
He was like, well, we'll see how long it lasts and so It was after that phone, call that I realized that everything that I've done to that point was to try and beat him at his game because everything, my dad cared about and not everything, he's a good guy like, you know, we're fine now.
10:11
But like, when I was growing up and it's fairly common in most foreign families, to be very like, money driven.
And I always knew that kind of subconsciously.
He would never say this, but like, I felt it, because, whenever you introduce, somebody tell me how much they made immediately, he'd be like, this is John, John makes this like, this is Bob.
He makes this like, it was just, it was just like the worth.
10:27
And the name was like immediately tied together.
And so I realized that I was trying to win his game rather than playing my game and I think when that happened it was the same instance of kind of like the blame finger but just at a different level of saying like, Okay, well I don't blame my dad anymore but I'm still playing his game and so I'm winning not my game on winning someone else's and so I think when I was like, okay, well then I have to define the game and the meaning of the game that I want to play.
10:56
I have more responsibilities now because I have to define the rules of what matters most to me.
Etc.
But that was where I feel like I got and maybe there's more that all Impact later, but that was kind of the next level at least for my awareness of how I perceived what I was going after.
Do you remember you?
11:13
I think you spoke about people that break the law in an attempt to make money.
He said we sacrifice the thing we want for the thing that's supposed to get it.
So we sacrifice freedom for money in the hopes that the money will give us freedom.
Yeah, Downstream from that, this is, Of the best things that I learned for all of last year and you created the framework and then I felt it in.
11:35
So I talked about the tension between success and a desire to feel like we're enough, I think that this speaks to what you're on about here.
Success is a strange thing.
Presumably we want success because we think a more successful life will bring us more happiness, meaning and fulfillment is the problem.
We sacrifice the thing.
We want happiness for the thing, which is supposed to get it success, fairly can make you miserable, but I'm not sure.
11:55
That success will make you happy.
And if you end up with an equation, if you could imagine like Ike, we sacrifice happiness to achieve success in the pursuit of happiness.
Like if you just remove success from both sides of the equation, what you left with, it's just happiness, people.
However, Sarah, we can't deny the fact that were stateless will beings that we, you know, we require external validation.
12:16
We can't just, you know, go and live in a cave and in peacefull less than all the rest of it.
Like there are things that we need to do.
But I do feel like a lot of the time, we overclock our lives with regards to success and the Pursuits that we go through, in an attempt to, to do this and that we Replace the thing we want for the thing which is supposed to get it is like I see that all the time.
12:34
I always ask myself.
Am I over complicating this like am I am I doing more than I need to do?
Is there a simpler way to do this?
Hmm I think I mean I think this is a actually a game theory thing and you're from.
Okay.
So I can go on and I cannot everyone I'm gonna bring it up.
12:52
Yeah, so I mean Simon sinek popularize this but your finite and infinite games right?
Finite games, we have known.
Known players agreed upon rules and an outcome that that wins the game, right?
And then infinite game, you have known and unknown players, no rules.
13:09
And the point of the game is to keep the game going.
And what happens is that people apply finite rules to infinite games and then they wonder why it's not working as an example.
So a final game would be like baseball know the players at the end of the game.
The person, you tally up the ones with the most runs and you win and there's, you can't, you can't run, you can't hold the ball and run around the bases, like there's rules of play.
13:29
Guy with an infinite game.
The Vietnam War isn't a simple example that Simon sinek.
It's which is basically the u.s. lost the Vietnam War because they were, they were applying a finite structure which is we're going to win this war and the Vietnamese people were were playing an infinite game structure which is we're going to stay alive and keep fighting and as long as someone is staying alive and keeping fighting, they will beat the person who's trying to end something into the infinite frame.
13:53
Always conquers, the finite.
And the thing is that most of the games worth playing are infinite and so if you were trying to get in shape, you don't win getting in shape.
The point is to stay in shape for the rest of your life.
If you don't win at marriage, the point is, stay married.
You don't win at business.
The point is to stay in business and keep doing business.
14:10
In the point of the game, is to keep playing.
I think if, if the success and I would imagine success if you put all of those things together, it's an infinite game.
And so the point of success is to do the things that make you successful.
And so, if you're doing the things that are making you successful, then you are by definition winning.
14:27
And I think that, for me, redefining what is a perfect day and living is many of those days in a row as I possibly can And to me that's winning and I and I obviously have a relatively country and world view but which is that like when we die nothing happens and you know, we know what it was like to die because we've all been dead before which is when we were before you're alive, but I don't think that what I will do will ultimately matter in 500 million years and so that kind of eliminates a lot of the pressure for me around, like, the external outcome.
14:55
Sure, I'm human.
There are definitely motivators but if I can just over time chip away at how much that weighs on the scale and I can keep putting more and more coins on the other side, towards the infinite game of, like the point of the game is to keep playing.
And like there are some things that I remind myself over and over again.
15:12
It's like the point of the game is to keep client.
That's the point.
That is the point is to just keep playing point of the game is to keep playing.
I very much like that.
What was that?
You found out?
The three trait?
The three, most common traits of Highly Successful People remember those?
Yeah, it was, it's so funny, this periodic on Flex.
15:31
So the three, most common traits of Hyper successful people that they looked at.
And it was interesting because there's the influencer world wants to be like you have to wake up at 5:00 or you have to do cold plunges, whatever the fuck.
Right.
But the thing that but there's actually very few that they all had in common.
So number one was that they had a superiority complex.
15:48
They thought they were better than other people and that they deserved more.
The second is that they suffered from massive insecurity and feeling that they would never be enough.
And third they had impulse control And so you've got this combination of people who are, like, I want to do this big thing.
So there's big toward thing and they've got this big away pain.
16:04
That's like I'm never going to be enough.
I always have to do more and then they have impulse control that keeps them focused on the goal without seeing the woman.
In the red dress are getting pursued by her and that like so it's like shoot High.
Have a big thing that that motivate like have a big tiger behind you and stay on the path.
16:20
Have you ever heard Jordan Pederson?
Talk about that.
Study of starving rats in a tube with a spring attached.
There's no fucking brilliant.
This is this is what you Talking about so starving rat to placed into a tube here.
And they have a spring that is attached to the tail that can measure the force that they pull out.
16:37
And that's a proxy for desire, then they waft the smell of cheese in from the front of the tube, and the rat holes and they measure how hard yet they want to go.
And you think these rats are starving.
Do be pulling pretty hard.
Then they do another iteration of the study this time.
They waft the smell of cheese and from the front, but they were off the smell of a cat in from behind and the Rats pull harder.
16:55
Yeah.
And what's the lesson that you not only need to run towards something that you I want here but you need to run away from something that you fear the problem and this is I like to hear superiority complex, crippling insecurity impulse control.
I like that.
The problem is the people who admire the most due to the most success in the real world don't necessarily have the most admirable internal states that to me isn't necessarily the most peaceful Blissful way to live your life.
17:24
What does it say that?
Especially in the modern world?
We Revere the people who have external accolades of success.
Hmm.
And yet the three, most common traits of these super successful people lead from a place, which is Almost objectively miserable own admirable.
17:43
Yeah.
How do we how do we Square the circle?
I think it's just water we solving for so like I mean a lot of people I love watching Last Dance which is Michael Jordan's, you know, many docu-series nominal.
Yeah, unbelievable.
I think most people could see him there and be like I don't know if I really Envy this guy's life like he still seems like pretty upset despite being a billionaire, despite all these, you know, these these these other things.
18:06
And so I think that if like what are we solving, And for like my closest friend.
Dr. Kashi he is a statement cuz he coached Olympic Olympic teams and he was like Champions are broken.
I was like huh it's like they people look at Champions and try and find something that that champion has that they don't have.
18:22
He's like, but it's not that at all.
He's like they lack something, everyone else has, which is an off button.
They just don't stop and at the end of the day, like, If we're if we're optimizing for outcomes then the most broken person will win.
18:38
The person who has the absolute biggest at, you know, desire for achievement the absolute biggest, fear or pain that they're running away from and the hardest impulse control.
Now, almost control most people would agree, is a good thing, the other two, not as much.
And so, what are we optimizing for?
What problem are we solving is?
18:53
My favorite is probably the number one.
Most frequently Asked question that I asked to our portfolio companies, whenever we're about to do anything, which is what problem are we solving.
If the problem we're solving is that I want to be content, Well, there's a lot of ways to do that.
You don't need to do all these other things.
If the problem you're solving is that you want to be the richest man in the world.
Well, you're going to have to have a lot of spirit accomplished.
19:11
You have a lot of crippling and security and you have a lot of impulse control and you have to wait a long time.
There's a quote from Jason pogan that says except to all of your Heroes a full of shit.
Y'all Heroes aren't gods.
That just regular people who probably got good at One Thing by neglecting literally everything else Yeah, I just, I agree with the statement fucking money.
19:32
It's just so interesting to me.
I've been thinking about this to do with Billy McFarland.
Only, let me just get this in, hit it and that's okay because if they wanted that, then that's the problem that they're solving for.
Like, I get criticized all the time for work life balance people are like, well, you don't have any hobbies Alex and you don't whatever, right?
19:50
And I'm like, I don't fucking want any.
So why do I have to sacrifice things that I would prefer to do to do things?
I don't want to do to satisfy you.
Our objective measure of what you deem as work-life balance, why?
So that's what this is.
Why you were talking about was it optimized for the outcome or what's the metric of success?
20:09
Yeah, we were saying like what what is it that people are optimizing for, right?
It seems to me that you have stepped back and decided axiomatically.
This is the thing that I'm optimizing for that I enjoy most doing, yes, that's I enjoy playing the game and so everything I do is about the game.
20:28
Yes, my podcast is called the game.
I draw pictures all day about business.
I've read books about business.
I make content about business.
I spent the rest of my life.
I've never seen a picture of 200 offers zillion pictures in there.
Oh, they didn't buy, you 100 percent all of the pit drawings are mine and hundred leads is like 100 Doodles in it.
Any good?
20:44
They're nice.
I think so they got get a cute.
Yeah, got a little animals and yeah, they don't have animals in.
I'm not what I'm not gonna look at the others.
There's little bag of money big bag of money like that's how nice dead seriously bent over like and and I spend the rest of my day doing business.
And so it's like why don't you Garden?
21:00
Because I don't care, isn't it?
His the other thing, right?
I always talk about this Steffi Graf, they one of the greatest female tennis players of all time and she gets tested when she's 10 years, old 11 years old.
And she's in some tennis academy and they gauge the players on two criteria.
They gave them on desire to train and skill, set or, and she was 10 out of 10 on both.
21:22
So, okay, not only has she got the raw materials to make a phenomenal tennis player, but she'll outwork you and to hurry one.
Feel like work.
That's fucking terrifying and that's why I do think for the people that look at yourself and say Alex's on a road to burn out, it's because you are using your theory of mind about how you would feel if you had to work as much as you do.
21:44
But okay what is the thing that you can do longer than anybody else?
And to damn it looks like working to you.
It looks like play or feels like play.
What would that be?
Oh well to me it would be computer games on knitting or rock music or whatever it is.
They're okay.
So imagine Ajan, if you've just got to do that all day, but instead of it being rock music, it was fucking business.
22:03
Someone commented, the other day, was it, you're sprinting on a treadmill.
They were concerned that the pace that the show is going out at was, going to cause me to burn out and in retrospect, I'm, you know, in five years time, I wake up, fuck you.
I was moving too quick, but I don't think I don't think that like, I work at the pace that I like to work at and I also like to see where those limits are and that's exciting to me to go.
22:24
Okay?
Just how much harder can I go here?
And then, Then you've got a temper it with that's burn out like that's just the beginning of it and you only know that after you've burned out like 30 times.
But that's, it's try to say after atomic Habits by James clear, right.
22:40
But the intersection of like what you love to do, what you're good at and what you can be paid for is like slap-bang in the middle of it.
Slaves, worked all the hours.
They were awake for their entire lives.
In American history, in Egyptian history in the rest of the world that had slaves, which is most of the world at some given point.
23:03
I think like, if they can do it.
So can I now you're like, well, did they have a happy existence?
Well, they didn't get to pick the work they did, but it means that you can work.
That's if you have the cat behind you, you can work every hour of the day, I'm like, well, if you get to have the cheese and you get to eat the cheese, the whole way you're going then, I mean there's the famous quote, you know, the person, who the person who loves walking walks, Further than the person who loves the destination, right?
23:27
And so, like, I think it's the same thing, but the Everyone, so many people want to project their idea of what they think, your life should be like, on to you, and it's just completely irrelevant, it just doesn't matter.
23:44
Like if all I did, if I weren't married right?
Because we were like, okay, well, he is married and like, I am in shape, but I also just like, working out.
But if I didn't have either of those things, and all I did was work all day, more people would talk about the work-life balance thing for me than they currently do.
And who cares?
24:01
I just like I just find a mentally like you are gonna die and you're not going to matter and I'm gonna die and I'm not going to matter.
So why do I care about what you're going to say when you're not even show up to my funeral who gives a shit?
What is it?
That you love taking an enjoyment from then?
The one step deeper than this.
There is something that you're optimizing flow.
24:18
I love, I love the reward, what reward the micro rewards, I get every day, like of operating, a business of all things business related.
Yep.
So I love writing a book about business.
I love talking my editor about what we're changing.
Oh, that's a Ali way, better way to say it, right?
Or I like tweeting about the thoughts that we have.
24:35
I love doing discussions like this because I talk about my favorite topic, which is business for the most part, like, and I actually am pretty averse to punishment.
I've learned that about me, like, I do not like it and I say punishment in the formal sense, like things you don't like right.
24:52
And so, like, I avoid them like the plague, I don't do them.
And so I just do as many of the things I can that reward me as frequently as possible but from the outside to a lot of people that looks like punishment, Yes, interesting.
How can someone cut through societal expectations?
25:09
The ways they've dealt with past, trauma, expectations, from parents, all of the things that aren't there thing.
Yeah, how can somebody, because what you've done again, axiomatically, a priori dis is the thing I want to optimize for?
How do people find a think that they want to optimize for?
I don't have a thing, that's fucking great for you with your business, it just happens to be something else at the intersection of making a shit ton of money.
25:29
Yeah, how do I find it?
I was lucky with that.
Yes, that that just happened to be the intersection because I love knitting and I didn't like business.
Yeah, that's a whole step because like you can turn it into a business but like if I only like knitting, then there's a way to make a living for that.
But to get to the person who's like, how do I find my thing?
25:48
I'm a big fan of being directionally correct, rather than absolutely correct.
And so I think what happens is, most people are trying to find the perfect answer when they have no perspective from which to make a judgment, they're trying to find the perfect thing to do and they haven't done anything.
So, how would you have perspective to make a judgment?
Like, if you try a lot of things in the beginning, which you have to know what your inputs outputs are decrease, your actions are short enough with either cheese or cat, whatever you need.
26:11
Most people have more cash than they have cheese in the beginning.
So use the cat to start running towards something and the thing is the rat.
It's so simple.
It's like there's cheese here.
But you really just need to know is that there's she's out there and there's a cat behind me for sure.
Most Nation real quick.
26:28
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
26:47
And so if I just go anywhere away from the cat, I will have a higher likelihood of getting closer to the cheese, not that I will find it, but I will get closer to it and I think it's and I've lived my life through a series of Rapid iterations.
Not trying to pick the right thing because I just like, even when I was starting my first business, I was between frozen yogurt, test prep and a gym.
27:07
Those are the three businesses that I was choosing the next complete sense.
Yeah.
It's all a lot of things that I like, right.
It's so, so I'm choosing between those things and like, why were those The things I was like, well, I was pretty good at taking tests in college.
So I get that I like frozen yogurt and I mean, it sounds simple, but like I was like, everybody likes something, right?
27:27
And I actually didn't know that I was going to like, business.
That's the crazy thing because also a, when you and I were younger Instagram, wasn't there.
You took like none of the shit existed and Entrepreneurship wasn't cool yet.
And so I just hated my job a lot and I hated where I lived a lot.
27:43
And so I was like well I will just not be here.
So cat don't know.
Didn't go too.
But just not this city and went across the farthest place from Baltimore, just California.
And then I was like, okay, well, what do I hate doing?
Well, let me not do that, which is, you know, sitting on meetings all day and doing whatever, you know, doing grunt work for shit that I felt like was meaningless and instead I was like, I'll do Fitness because I like Fitness and I was like, at the very least, I'll do something.
28:06
I enjoy which I liked Fitness at the time if you're like, well, I don't like doing anything else.
Like well then that's impossible because your brain is wired to be rewarded for things.
And so you are doing The things that reward you, that's why you do them like everything we do is because we've been worded for doing things like that in the past and we project the same activities and we predict that the doing things like we did in the past it reward us.
28:28
We reward is again in the future that's where our Behavior comes from.
And so it's like okay well what is rewarded you in the past?
Where's the cat?
Go.
The opposite way.
Yeah.
So the reverse role model is something similar but you're almost taking this into a lifestyle perspective.
So there are a reverse World model is if you live in a town, are you grow up somewhere?
28:46
And there's no one around you like the sort of person that you want to be like, but there are tons of people.
Like the person you don't want to be like, you can say there's a way marker, I don't want his relationship with gambling.
I don't want the way that he man handles his finances.
I don't want the way that him and his wife communicate with each other.
It's okay.
There we go.
Warren Buffett mangas says like an Amount of success, has been achieved by not trying to be smart by avoiding being stupid.
29:09
So there's your way, Mark, is there.
But what you're saying is that this is almost like a abstracted lifestyle version of this.
These are all of the things that I hate to do.
What's the opposite of that?
Yeah.
And the challenge of, I don't know precisely what the exact thing is, therefore, I can't move toward.
29:28
It is one of mine which is perfectionism, is procrastination masquerading as quality control.
I was with those.
It's a Fallacy.
It's a decision-making fallacy.
It's a say it's this is why investor frames can be so useful.
Like if you're looking for the perfect investment won't find one.
There's always downsides, every every investment has risk, right?
29:46
And so using that frame, like well, there's all these paths, which one do I choose?
It's like, well, you have to the one thing is guaranteed is you keep the money, it will go down in value because it will inflate, right?
So not investing is the only way guaranteed to not get a return on investment.
Is that a the fact that inflation exists?
30:03
Do you think that's a useful know?
Dating Force for business people, you know, you could imagine a different form of world economics where you know like embedded growth obligations weren't there and like whatever.
You know, inflation didn't happen.
Do you think that that sort of motivates people to actually be like a fact?
Like I need to I need to do something with this money.
30:19
I can't just said certain leave it in the bank finger to motivate investors.
Yes more the, yeah, yeah.
But I mean the business people just like probably keep more coins in their in their vault and just keep transacting.
It was at Scrooge, McDuck.
Yeah, they'd be less likely to they'd be less likely to deploy Capital faster.
If you feel like there's a cost of capital that's higher for keeping it, like letting it sit there, then you have a higher urgency to do something with it.
30:40
If you have less urgency, then you only do it.
When, you know it's going to crash, you gain nothing from under estimating, your opponent.
Mmm.
How does this relate to your world?
So a lot of the tweets that I have actually come from conversations.
30:59
I have with our portfolio CEOs and so they'll say something right?
And they're like We're way better than those guys and I think somebody said like something like that on a meeting and I just thought about it.
And I was like, what a stupid thing to say.
Like you gain, nothing from that statement.
I was like, you literally gain by.
31:15
What do you gain from that?
You gain, complacency right?
You, you increase, you increase the likely to looking stupid in the case that they do Crush you, right?
I was like, because on the flip side, it like how many UPS like the only things that upset the guys who are on the top of the mount is humorous.
Like there's really no reason that the guy on the top of the mountain should ever lose.
31:34
He has the most resources, he has the most he is the highest perspective, use the most Vision like he's everything.
He's all the food at the top of Mount and yet, history shows us humans act like humans and so we lose because of our egos and because it hurts to say what if that person is better than me, And so, I think that if you, it actually is really parallel with it, a different tweet that the kind of took off, which was people underestimate how much smarter, you can see them if you have 20 minutes of preparation.
32:05
Yeah, that's that's so fucking true, right?
And so likable people get into businesses and like, well, what if you actually had to face this team, we were like why don't want to practice?
It's like, why not?
Like why wouldn't you prac like for a lot of Fighters show up not having prep for the fight, not really hard and like, what do you Gain from that because if you practice really hard, you get better period.
32:25
And like, all it is is purely an ego play.
The only, the only win you get from not prepping and showing up to the fight is that you appear to be more naturally gifted and I would rather be known for my work ethic than my natural gift as an aside, but you appear to be more naturally gifted and then you win by less than you would if you prepared you gain nothing and so it's purely an ego thing but you we do it all the time and so, So I wanted to like my Twitter stream is just thoughts to self.
32:55
I deleted him enough room at my profile to say but it was originally like notes to self and it's just like to remind me of things as they come up because I fall into that trap to I'm like table and we're going to outperform this guy or like this company is going to crush it like, but we don't gain anything from that.
It's like, so we just have to assume that we're always the underdog and then they've got a trick up their sleeve that we don't know about.
33:15
It's like, that's the hold, only the paranoid survive.
Hmm.
A reverse of that or something, that's interesting.
Testing to do with people at the top of the pyramid is there's only one way.
I know to beat people who copy you, get bigger.
It's not by direct conflict but by making them shrink into a relevance by comparison.
33:32
Hmm.
I agree.
Just yeah, I mean especially when it comes to content creation.
I imagine that this is something that yeah that you know.
You see one thing to becomes effective and then Downstream from that, a lot of stuff happened.
And you know, if you've done the hard work of forging ahead, trailblazing pathfinding split testing.
33:52
Wow, we finally came up with this thing and then within four weeks you let a brilliant this is all over the internet.
Now what I always see it is like a first mover thing which is like they need me.
I I don't need them.
They require me in order to iterate their content.
34:08
I don't because I don't look at Theirs to make mine.
Yeah.
And so and it's because like - Noah's mind as well.
Everybody knows every single person that's copying thumbnails.
There's copying subtitle subtitle Styles, that's, you know, going after the same talking point they know deep down that what they're doing is creating a rough-hewn pixelated equivalent of what they think they can try and be at best.
34:31
What you can hope for is being the second-best, Alex hormones in the world, right?
And I'll win that game.
But like they would beat me at being whoever they are, right?
I mean, it sounds so trite, but like, I want, I'm trying to say this in a different way so that it hits because like, people of her, like, there's only one version of you.
Like there's just so much actual meat to that concept because this is, this is, you know, Gary originally did the document, don't create thing.
34:56
And I think that the reason that the content that we have is quote, original is because like we document I document through Enter the things that come up in my actual life.
And so it's not like what's trending right now.
It's like, well, I had this meeting with a CEO and he fucking said that thing about the competitor and that's my tweet and there wasn't somebody else in the meeting also going.
35:16
Oh pretty.
And that's a lesson that I can take that I can use for my Twitter and so it's all from like original source.
And if everyone else, like, in this is on the flip side.
If you're the person who's doing this, like, you need to find what your original sources of content.
35:32
Because like, you will always be second.
Or SEC.
You'll never be first is really the Israeli, the statement and like at least for me if I'm playing a game I want to play for the Long Haul and the point of the game is keep it game going and if you want to keep the game going, then you could be depend on someone else.
There was another one that I thought was quite interesting especially given the kind of current world of men's advice and rich guy.
35:57
Existence online, more people stay poor because of their egos then get rich off them.
Yeah at the moment.
It seems like egos are being valorized on the internet especially among man's advice.
The how is it that more people stay poor because of their egos and get rich off them.
36:13
If there's a bunch of examples of people with seemingly big eagles that also have money?
I think that some, what's the fallacy, whatever?
That, whatever the cognitive fallacy for what's in front of your eyes, I think people was it availability by, there you go.
I think there are far more people who are successful and significantly more successful than the people who are are visible on content hoof.
36:37
And I would say, many of those people aren't actually that successful.
And so if we're looking at the objective measure of success as like, net worth, just for just, for the sake of this conversation, there are far more people who are rich in Anonymous than there are people who flaunt their labor games that they rent it for a day.
Now there, I mean, if you really think about the influencer world of business, there are not that many guys who actually like are really in the game.
36:58
Like most of those guys, sell something from their platform about building a platform.
Form.
Like that's that's 90 not even 95.
It's probably like, 98 99 percent.
And so there's only like a very small select.
And to be fair, those guys are all pretty humble.
37:16
Like, you look at the Gary's, you look at the the Andes, you look at the Tom Billy.
Like these at my like the, you know, like the guys who have become, you know, in the business space, like, They're not particularly egotistical guys and it's usually because they know what heart feels like and they know what it's like to be an adequate over and over and over again because you only can be an adequate.
37:34
If you go to another level, if you feel amazing is because you have moved up, does that mean that if somebody wants to be successful and they feel like they've still got an ego that they need to do some work on dissolving that I think they just need to do harder things.
Like you need to fight harder opponents like actually undulating in this little pool.
37:50
The only way you can maintain an ego is by believing that you're a big fish.
In a little Pond, right?
Everything fishing, whatever size pain, do you think it is?
And if you're a big fish are not in a big enough punt is totally delusion.
It's hard to comprehend like Bezos.
If you've heard any of his interviews, seems like a very humble guy but like you can have 100 billionaires in a room and he is worth the same amount as them.
38:11
And then, if you had each one of those billionaires is a thousand two millionaires, he still Well worth the same the same amount as 1100 whenever a hundred thousand Millionaires and that him.
So like there's just levels to it and I think the moment you get the ego is the moment you stop growing because you feel like you beat the level, but you just keep repeating a lever on the moving up because there is a harder boss and they just haven't faced it yet.
38:35
I suppose it's an easy way you know, if you were going to a karate class but you decided instead of going to the adult want to go to the one that's under 11s and you're going to kick the fuck out of all these yet only the video and you're like look at me and it just happens to be that they're the same size as you in.
38:52
Like just imagine they're like dumb on the inside but they're cute.
You know adult-sized you're kicking the shit out of them it's like yeah.
Do it to Jones right.
Like not gonna happen and so like I'm gonna take this.
Yeah, go ahead.
I'm going to try and This the way that I'd take this away, I mean it I get comments from people were like, love your humility Alex and like I don't think of that humble of a guy being real, at least internally in my own head, but I am reminded daily of my inadequacy on the business game because like right now we've moved up a level in terms of like now we're now we're doing deals now we're investing.
39:23
In companies, were taking a big risk or writing checks like the another level of the game than just only what not to say that only one business and growing.
It is not hard.
It absolutely is a different kind heart, but like, I'm getting into this game and I'm absolutely The small fish, like Warren Buffett.
A 90 billion dollars on the trading made an app on 20/20.
39:40
One move, right?
And so Mike, I am entering into a like, how could I say that?
I'm like, even if I was exceptional, it's still going to take 20 years to prove it.
So, like I can't say anything and by that point, I'll probably have other guys who are, you know who fucking Titans.
39:56
At that point to remind me of the fact that I'm not as good as them.
So in you'll estimation is the presence of an ego.
Something, which artificially limits the size of the vision of how high you want to climb.
Yeah.
Honor percent it because it's you cannot you can't both say that you are.
40:15
You cannot admit deficits and say you're awesome at the same time, in my opinion.
Like I can't say like I suck at all these things and then also be like, I'm the bet you can't do it.
You either like you're sucking all these things and it's I think it's the dunning-kruger effect which is like the more you the more you learn about something, the more you look, the more you realize you don't know.
40:32
And so I think that if you have a tiny, tiny subset of things that you were studying and a tiny subset of people, you're comparing yourself to then it's really easy to feel awesome about yourself.
But if you compare yourself to I mean I could bring myself everyday to warm up it and like he's my apt him and Munger like my heroes mostly because the way they lived life, If and what they like just everything about the way they lived is something that I just love and like I have net profits.
40:56
Net worth by age tracks and I have like mine tract and I'm like, all right Scott Stay Puft that line and he's got a bit of it at the moment I am right now but like I had a pedo like his world was different.
Yeah.
Like I got Warren, didn't have Warren to learn from Yes, very interesting.
41:14
It son.
I mean you took we spoke about this at the very, very start where you were saying you have the opportunity of using the blueprint that has been laid down by me.
Yeah.
So if you've got nothing to lose, do do the me thing.
Yeah.
You know, you have all of the mistakes.
All of the failures and all of the successes and there was another one where you said the rare, you are the rarer.
41:35
The people are who share your perspective in this way, the greater your success, the fewer people.
You can share it with Now, I was playing with this quote, from a Lander button, from the school of life for ages, which was loneliness, is a kind of tax.
You have to pay to atone for a certain complexity of mind and I'm really not sure because since I've been in Austin the complexity of Mind thing which is that hasn't stopped, but the loneliness changed and I figured that that was a big function of change of environment and maybe like whatever, embracing or acceptance of what was going on.
42:09
But again, is this Byproduct of success, that a lot of people don't necessarily realize, it's a price that's going to be need to be paid if you want to achieve a ton of success.
You end up at this rarefied strata out in the troposphere somewhere and you're like well I got like five people that I can talk to that.
42:29
Understand what I'm going through at the moment or another question is well is that combination of hubris and self-delusion like is that true?
There are other things that the bus driver or the lady that Serves you a whole foods can actually like relate to you on.
So, two questions.
42:46
One is, I would probably reject the notion that it's a price overall because like Being in like if you think about it as a mountain there's less there's less square footage to the top of Mount just is there's fewer people there and the air is thinner.
It's harder to get, they're harder to breathe Ryan.
43:03
You have to adjust it, you have to acclimate and the people that are around you like there are fewer of them but you could make the argument that they have even more context, anyone else possibly could.
And so, maybe the release of you have are potentially deeper, even if they're not humans.
Don't need that many relationships.
So, like, you just have a smaller pool to choose from, but like, most people only have two or three good relationships there life anyways.
43:22
And so like you, Have an error pull that you can make that selection from.
And I mean of the people that I have interacted with who are far above that above me on the mountain.
That's been there.
That's what they relate to me.
But it's only bad if you think it's a cost, If you're okay with it because there are plenty of people who are lonely right now don't have shit.
43:44
So and there's, you know, and you already know this, but like the there's something being lonely, and Solitude, you know, and one is seen as bad.
The other scene is finer.
Good in some circles that seen as self-care.
So, so to me, it just means that like, I think your tolerance or your standard for friends raises and I'll share this in.
44:11
Hopefully, comes off the right way.
I entered communities as I was coming up and was like, wow everyone here is bigger than me.
And then I was able to through achievement rice through that and then I lost context with that group.
And so I think there's just more free agency a friendship that happens on your climb up because you're just moving between strata more frequently than it is that if I settled at one of these levels, then I would eventually find all the people at that rung.
44:38
But if you're constantly on the move up the mountain, then more of that is in transitionary Period, on the A climb, and it's only a problem if you hate it.
I don't what don't you hate?
You don't hate the fact that sort of people come and go that some of these relationships are kind of transient.
44:55
Yeah, just doesn't bother me.
Sitting.
It's like a should statement which is like one of my big things.
It's like why should I why does it have to be?
Why must it doesn't cost anything, it just is that way?
And that's fine, talking about social media, we mentioned this earlier run, what are your predictions for the next six?
45:17
Months to a couple of years, in terms of what you think is going to be big, any focuses or any interesting trends that you're noticing in the moment.
I'll stay first off that.
I'm not a social media expert by any stretch but just you know I think AI is going to be the main driving force behind the future of social media and I don't know how we're going to deal with it.
45:39
I mean, there's already the Deep fakes of Rogan doing entire podcast with Steve Jobs that are going out there and the entire thing is both created and recorded with AI.
And so I think it'll be really interesting because right now it's still not as good as the best craters, but in a few machine Generations, it'll make the best content every time.
45:58
S and I'm not sure what's going to.
I think that I know the verification check mark is going to matter more it'll change in its meeting right now.
I mean status and the future will mean real person so that I'll make that prediction that the verification of bought versus human will become more important future.
46:15
I can make that prediction and that there will be more AI generated content in the future than there is today and how we respond to it.
I don't know.
It's scary to think that what we basically had for the last five years or so.
46:31
Since the algorithm started to get really tight is a three-way feedback mechanism from algorithms designing better delivered content to users.
It also nudges the users preferences, so that they are easier and more predictable, to predict that was that two-way street was something I learned from Stuart.
46:49
Russell is fucking amazing.
Everybody needs to understand that it's not just you programming the algorithm.
It's the I'm programming you.
And it's one of the reasons that it explains increasing Division and extremity, because if you are far right, or far left or super, whatever a super, the other thing, it makes you way easy to predict.
47:05
And that's a byproduct of any algorithmic optimizing function.
And then, the third element of that is audience captured by the creators, because they are the third element of the creation of the content, right?
That they go.
How are you, how well did that perform?
Well, we will red meat that a little bit more and a little bit more and a little bit more and then you end up on your knees like cooking.
47:24
The audience, right?
The fourth element of this is going to be then you are able to algorithmically.
Create content that understands the back.
End of the algorithm that can nudge preferences and can get feedback.
47:39
And all of that, I mean that to me is fuck me.
If we think that, you know, like the degree of over bearing - that social has on our lives at the moment like that, a very, very big deal.
What, cut out the middleman, the After being the middleman and then just becomes a vertically integrated platform that creates content on its own using Ai and just feed the directly to the audience.
48:02
That's what I said.
As soon as those the AI images of hot girls came out and then chat gbt ego look like only fans, you're no longer an agency.
You're now a tech company that should be the move that you make.
Every single person should have their own curated, wifey girlfriend online.
48:19
And that's that's what you that's your thing there and it would be infinitely scalable, you know. like the perfect Dirty Talk, completely curated and twiddle, to your specific, whatever it is, but That doesn't bode particularly well for how much limbic hijack and freedom people have from social media because it is only going to become more and more compelling, which isn't necessarily a good thing.
48:42
I mean I good bad.
No idea.
I think they'll probably be a little bit of a counter movement of people who want to do more things in person make social media human again.
All right.
Well, you know an interesting thought experiment that I had.
I was like because we've taken some things and I do think is going to happen, but like as in it will continue But I was like, we accept all technology as inevitable and I was thinking about this and I was like, has there ever been a technology that humans have created that?
49:11
We were like, nah, we shouldn't do this.
I thought about I was like, there is one nuclear bombs we all were like, I think it's better if we don't we should just not do this and everyone is like agreed.
We're like we're not going to do this and I think the rate of a I had disaggregated it is like will prevent that from happening, but I just thought about that as like it just there hasn't been any other technological thing that I've seen besides nuclear bombs that we all together were like, this isn't good for us.
49:39
Have you seen hoja tabletop genetic sequencing machines work?
No, this is a really good example of what you're talking about so the way that pretty much all of them.
Our cloud-based and in order to sequence, whatever it is that you're looking to sequence, it sends the request up to the cloud.
49:56
And there's three gradings is green, Amber and red and if it's green, you can just do it.
No one checks.
If there's a, you have to submit a proposal for what it is where it's going BSL level at such a security security.
If it's red, you just can't do it.
And then presumably someone comes around and goes excuse me.
What the fuck you doing?
50:12
Trying to make smallpox?
Yeah, but that there's been I think it's either Two or three times in the history of Gene sequencing.
There has been a moratorium placed globally on this.
50:27
Everyone's gone every fucking machine goes off everything stop until we work out what's going on.
So there are situations as a great example like cloning he has you just said as soon as you start to atomize that and disaggregate it and distribute it between enough different actors.
50:43
How are you going to be able to control?
You know?
And the other thing is with genetic I think that the kind of machines that you need the hardware is complex and expensive and rare.
Yeah, the hardware is not complex for anybody can code and the reward is everything, it's the world, if the world its domination its money, its success, it all of those things.
51:05
This is why I don't know, man.
Like the fucking the Techno Optimist thing ever.
Since I read, superintelligence by Nick Bostrom five or six years ago, I just don't see an AGI future worth stuff.
Doesn't get fucked.
I don't know.
What would Whether we get the general bit of AGI, super AGI, is like, still up for a big butt part of debate.
51:24
But if you end up creating this very strange World in, which everyone's limbic lie hijacked, with their own personal news feed of like, perfectly remember Cambridge analytical and the those scandals around the Hillary Clinton ads, it's like I know your preferences and we're gonna create these perfectly done.
Add so, okay, I mean the adverse all created by human and it was still you were bucketed into a content with other man of this age.
51:45
With these interest in this area with these voting habits.
Imagine if every single news feed not just post news feed was perfectly curated to maximize time on Soto Chris Davis.
The first line of every ad.
Yeah, crazy.
Well but it might just be the same as email the first time there was personalized, email of sudden you start becoming responsive your own name.
52:05
So like I think that I think they'll be pushed pool on that stuff but I'm with you on the AGI long term you know as a weird thought experiment if you think about what God looks like in terms of most Most definitions there like an omniscient omnipotent being and I think we're just creating that.
52:23
Like what is a?
I know.
It was everything right, what can it do?
Everything immediately like weird.
Usually, God would be benevolent.
Yes.
Rolling the benevolence in there.
Yeah, might be good if we had its lot of God's long-term benevolent, but short term sometimes mean.
52:43
Yeah.
You are through definitely wrath.
Yeah, it almost all things.
What are you working on now?
What can people expect from you?
Next 100 leads 100 million dollar leads, which is the second book in the hundred million dollar series is going to come out this year, so that's exciting.
53:01
We will be done the the edited Draft within seven days.
So I'm like, it's been, we put in 3500 hours together my editor and I combined or last two years doing it.
So it is the first four to six hours of my day every day.
53:16
Like, before I came here, I was editing the book, and that's what I did yesterday.
And that's why I did it before.
So they could be really, really good.
And so that's that's the, that's the big creative side of me is the is the book will be 99 Cents.
There you go.
I get 33 of that, by the way.
53:34
We're having a rich and then the rest of my life is all about deals.
It's just, we've got some really interesting companies are investing in very, very pumped on that side.
So, yeah, if you've got a one, do 10 million dollar ibadah business, and you would like a growth partner, go to acquisition, not come.
53:51
Let us know.
I really appreciate you.
I really, really enjoyed this today.
It's been cool to come.
And see the thank you for having me.








0:00
This is a video of making for a Vontae.
The young man who was working two jobs with a one-year-old ruse struggling and said he was sick and tired of being poor and didn't know how to get out.
I didn't have time to answer you when I was walking, but I wanted to take this minute to give you a longer answer.
I'll read you the Tweet, maybe we'll put it up on the screen to Avante.
0:17
The young man who stopped me at the grocery store, working two jobs, one year old who asked advice on how to get ahead.
I gave you a short answer because I was in a rush and it ate at me.
So if you follow me here, maybe you'll read this.
What you're going through is tough being so young and already having to support, a child is not easy.
You'll have the opportunity to become an amazing inspiration.
In a way I never could.
0:33
Your success story will become your sermon.
That being said, on to the advice, you're going to need to assume that luck isn't real or that it applies to everyone else.
But you, because the only way you're going to get out of your surroundings, is by having something of value that other people want.
And right now, the only thing you have is your time with low skills to trade, which is a hard game to play, you have to train a lot of it, only to get a little.
0:50
So your main objective is to have the time to learn a skill while providing for your family.
That means in the short-term, your family may have to suffer scratch that your family will suffer.
But better now when they're Young to remember then when they're too old to forget again not forever.
But for now so these are the things you're going to have to do.
And this isn't double stuff.
1:06
This is wake the fuck up because if you don't you're going to Blink and be 30 and in the same spot.
But worse number one cut all costs.
And I mean all costs you don't eat out anymore for anything and if you're hungry, you deal with it.
If it's not from a discount grocery store, you don't buy a clothing.
Ha what you've got is everything you need for the next two years, the period.
1:23
No exceptions, reuse trade or go to Goodwill.
You go to work, you go home and home is ideal.
Be with your family when I say bhimli your folks.
And if you don't have folks, who have got got room or a couch, or a basement that you can say, at the worst case is with another family, also trying to make it and save.
1:39
So it's six of you mean of you, 10 of you in one spot, all splitting it all of you contributing and it's going to be as cheap as you possibly can number to increase your income.
You're working two jobs your free time.
Want you to spend applying to other jobs closer to what you want to do.
He said he didn't like, either of the things that he was doing at that time.
1:54
So any at home phone, sales job has starter roles, that requires zero experience.
You pay forty thousand a year or more Do that and work.
Your other job in between if you can't drive Uber, if you don't have a car save up until you do number three, the easiest thing to sell is someone else's stuff, so start there then learn how to buy stuff for cheap and then flip it.
2:12
The bigger, the thing, the more you make you go from flipping cards to Furniture to home and the limit never really stops from there on Final note, I can hear the stress in your voice when you were talking to me about your situation, it sounded like you didn't know what to do.
Sadness comes from a lack of options, it's a feeling of hopelessness.
But whenever you feel that I want you to think this is, Ignorance not sadness, it means.
2:31
I don't know enough and that I can control.
You asked me to come work for free but I have no need for low-skilled labor but I do have a need for high-skilled beasts.
It's why I make the books in the courses in the content everywhere for free.
So use those then get yourself a high paying job and everyday apply for higher paying ones.
2:47
I recommend sales to start, then once you get in there for the love of God, work until your fingers bleed because you have no other option, you have no luck.
Nothing is going to work out for you.
You're not going to catch a break, you're going to have to make it happen.
You're going to have to Person, you've got to become undeniable and the best news is that you can do that in less than a year.
3:04
So that's my advice number one, cut all your costs, everything number to work, more to make more and apply to better jobs and then learn to sell the Marie start selling more expensive stuff and then eventually sell your own.
The game is Just treating up over and over and over again.
You're just a few trades away from a very different financial situation.
3:22
So, if I want to, I want to add on top of that, you're in a tough spot.
And I think some of the words, I probably just said to, you might it, hopefully hit home.
Where but one of the hard things that you got going on right now is like when I saw you, you were wearing relatively nice clothes and I was going to like bash you want it when I saw you, but I want to take the opportunity to say, like, you know better, you know what I mean?
3:40
Like, you know that like if you're struggling with money that this, the last thing that you should spend money on, right?
And I think one of the difficulties special when you're younger, is you've got your friends, you got your family, and especially if they're all poor, then they have terrible views around money.
They might not approve of all the stuff you're learning on the internet and trying to try these new things out and the real real is like, you're going to fail a lot.
3:59
We're going to see, say see told yourself and the tough part is is there going to be right most of the time except it's one of those things where it's 99% right?
But 100% wrong, is that anybody who bets against you for this thing being the thing is usually going to be right?
It's just like a parent who says you're going to break up with this purse, you're gonna become this person.
4:15
You're going to go with this person, but they're right with every single person you ever date.
Except for the person you married and then there are a hundred percent wrong and if you have the perspective of listing that it can be incredibly disheartening.
And so number one is, I want you to go on a, on a different information diet.
So you need to be able to To ignore all the stuff that they're giving you because like the best way to stay poor, as to listen to for people, but how to get rich, you're already taken great stuff.
4:36
I like watching Khan and doing stuff, just keep doing more of that.
And I'm sure you're growing up, you know, you have your baby with, that's your world like anybody who does is not trying to build a Vontae 2.0 with you doesn't deserve your time because like right now you have a wallet of money and you got a wallet a minutes and like every single person you're choosing to pay minutes to or pay dollars to has to earn their keep and earning their keep in this season of your life is them, helping you get.
4:59
Where you want to go.
Now I don't know what you're making your job.
I'm just going to assume the extreme scenario if you're making minimum wage at both jobs and you're working 80 hours doing the I get it and I respect the hostel which is why I'm making this video.
You need to get more for your time and right now the extra time on top of that 80 is you sleeping and probably spending time with your kid and what I'm going to say people in your surroundings we say like that guy's extreme where that guy is he's not balanced.
5:20
And the answer is yes I am extreme and I am unbalanced for the season that you're in.
I think you should be too because the thing is just like if you don't take action on this five years is going to go by and nothing is going to change.
Change because you're not going to get ahead, but you need to get your head firmly above water, because you probably barely feel like you can keep your head above surface, right?
5:36
That's where all that stress is coming from and you don't know what to do.
So to get the water lower, you've got to lower your time budget and your money budget, and I want to go really extreme with you and I'm not telling you to do anything, I didn't do.
All right, I owned my car in cash, which I think was a five or six thousand dollar car.
And I slept in a room with another dude in a house that had six other people in it and we all split it.
5:55
So I was in a terrible neighborhood.
I just paid four hundred dollars a month in a nice.
Because I didn't have my own place and so I had to split my kitchen and I had to do with the fact that three of them had dogs and was shit and piss everywhere all the time it sucks.
But you know what?
A sucked more not being able to have the money to buy the courses and the seminars and workshops that I was able to attend with the extra that I save.
6:15
So, I could learn my next skills.
And so right now, food and shelter is the only thing you spend money on, and you're going to drop everything else and you're going to drop those expenses to the greatest degree possible and either your girl is working.
If she's working, then you can have child care if she's not working.
Going to take care of the kid.
6:31
And you say, listen, sweetie, like I got to do this for us right now and so like you're putting your sacrifice in which is you're sacrificing your career.
So we can, you can do with the kit, I need a sacrifice the kid right now.
So I can have the career so that together as a family were balance, rather than the individual.
So there's two levels of balance I want you to think about one is the macro which is like you can be balanced over your lifespan.
6:49
When you're retired will have more time, you can go to Europe, you can do whatever the other stuff is, right?
And also, you can be balanced in a family unit.
Your wife might spend more time with the kids than she does in her career, but you're gonna spend more time, you're quitting.
The kit for now, cut out the people who are taking your time.
Easy way to see this is like, if the people in your life don't have bigger dreams for you than you do, ignore all of their advice.
7:09
This is ignore them entirely and I know that that's simple to say and hard to do, but you're in a hard situation.
And I think the question is whether you can be farther than your circumstances right now and you have to do to get out of this lock is already dug you a shit hand.
Let's assume he's never going to give you the right hand.
You're never gonna get lucky but you still need to win it.
7:25
So now, it's like, how do I do that?
If you have a car, you can have more flexible hours if you drive through either, that's something that I recommend for a lot of people, if you don't have a car, you need to save up as fast as you can to get one by one in cash and go.
She ate try and get your saw five to ten thousand dollar car in cash.
You don't have payments, you just have the insurance which because it's a two-part will be less the remainder your time and you got to tell your lady.
7:43
This is like I'm going to be spending four hours a day, every day watching these videos and this isn't me Doom scrolling on YouTube.
I need you to pick one skill that you want to have and only consume stuff about that.
This is my one thing I'll let you buy.
It's a time where you can buy for five bucks now, your phone and you set the timer.
7:59
Set for those four hours a day and every time you look away, you stop the timely, you do four hours of real work of studying the skill.
After you've done enough of that work and you're like what's enough 10 hours like you're like oh I could do that soon.
Yeah, I know.
So I'm telling you can get out of this fast.
You can switch those four hours of you learning the basics of that skill to spending the rest of your time.
8:17
Being the most amazing, applicant to new jobs that exist in the world.
I didn't say go apply to jobs.
I said, be the best candidate that has ever applied and you're like, I don't have experience and you can address that.
Like what I don't have an I will make up for in muscle and you proved that by messaging multiple people.
8:34
At every company with a snippet, horse lies to each of them.
You know what other people do?
Like they take a half step, they copy and paste.
The same thing to all four people and you know what the poor people do.
Yeah, yeah, he copy/pasted, the same message to make.
Don't do that be personal.
Look at the HR recruiters, look at the head of talent.
8:49
Look at director of whatever and message.
Each of them on LinkedIn.
If you don't have a LinkedIn, go get one.
That's free and when you submit your resume, put a personalized cover letter on it, after reading from the website, what that business?
About, when you read the job description.
Good job, description.
Say what they want the person to do and say, like, I will be able to help do this thing because of these things, right?
9:07
And especially a lower-level roll, your resume is not going to matter as much.
Don't let anybody around you say that or fool you into that.
What will matter, especially for low level roles as hustle to every employer.
Wants to see if somebody's going to go out of their way, to go above and beyond.
And so you demonstrate that your to go above and beyond and guess what's gonna happen.
You're going to do this for five different places, you're going to write a custom thing, it's going to take you four hours to do the research, right?
9:27
The custom thing message 20 people, because it's going to be For people at all five places.
You know it's gonna happen.
That's them because you're not lucky.
So what are you going to have to do, got to be undeniable?
Do you think of you applied to a thousand places like that over the next six months?
You wouldn't get a job.
I think you would you think you'd like after you got off your shift, you drove over and you said, hey, I just wanna let you know not in a creepy way.
9:44
You say.
Hey, so once you know, I applied for my resume iMessage, couple you guys, I just want to let you know.
I'm really excited about the opportunity.
Don't want to be overbearing, but if you guys would give me a shot, I promise I'll work harder than any other candidate here.
And I'd like to show you that I'm demonstrating that by these things.
Do you like I have proof that I'm saying I'm not just making this up.
I If that I will work harder and, you know, what'll happen, one of them.
10:02
Say I'll give you a shot.
And then when they give you that shot, shove it in everyone's face how hard you work, not by what you say, but by what you do he silent and just kill.
Look at what the top guy does and do twice as much as that guy does be Kobe for whatever the job is.
10:17
If you don't know the whole story about going to be eat it, three practices a day while everyone else doing one or two because you wanted to get ahead and in the beginning he was worse than them and then he got as good as them and then he became better than them and he kept doing three practices a day until eventually, no one.
We could catch up because if they were doing three practice today, they would just keep up with his rate of progress, but he got ahead.
10:34
And so the guy who's number one, at whatever that business is probably works better than you and he works longer than you.
And so, we can't just match it to get ahead because he'll always be had, you gotta match his current effort and then do your, I'm going to get ahead of you effort.
Like when he clocks out is when your work clocks in, that's when Avante 2.0 Toxin.
10:50
And the thing is, is like, if you can adopt this, like if you can really internalize this, you're going to crush your going to win.
You can make lock not a factor when I had Jacob.
My 19 year old by Tarek when I was talking to him he's I think he's 16 actually 6 15 or 16 when I start talking about this imagine he's even less reason to get a job than you.
11:07
All right less experience, I gave him three words and he said he still remembers in this day.
I said, volume and the gates lock, if you need to put it put on the back of your phone as a reminder to yourself.
Because in the beginning the volume you're going to do is the timer of you watching the videos and taking the notes and watching the videos.
Take learning the lingo learning the language so that when you get into an interview, you know what to say and then reps is going to be watching mock interviews on YouTube watching People who are hiring experts.
11:31
Talk about the best ways to present.
Watch them.
A Layla's videos about how to interview correctly.
You do that stuff.
You'll put yourself ahead of other people volume.
Ok, cool.
Now you're like okay but I'm not getting interviews volume to get sucked Frank.
The timer start doing the Reps one a day, two day, three day four day, five and a six a day ten a day every single day.
11:46
You're like wait that's 40 messages.
That are personalized and 10 cover letters.
Yeah, that'll probably take about four hours and then when you do tomorrow set the timer, you do it again next day, set the timer.
You do it again.
We do the next thing, set the timer and you do the fucking end and you keep doing it.
It and on the ones that you really, really like you drive over there, after you get off your shift, you stop by and just say, hey, I'm Avante.
12:05
I'm really excited about the opportunity.
I think I can help, I applied to got a couple message from me, I promise I'm not a weirdo.
I just did it because I wanted to stick off the rest of the pie because I know you guys I'm sure for an opportunity is going to set.
You probably a lot of people are interested.
I do promise you that I just want to shot.
You say that they will give you the interview and if they don't someone will and once you do get that job and you work harder than everyone else, we turn the dial and you don't do it for a week, you don't work harder than everyone else for a week don't work harder than for a month.
12:32
You don't work harder than for six months.
You were part of than the top guy for a year for two years.
You're like well shit.
I'm already like two or three years from now.
Yeah, I said it was a season but on the other side of this season, is everything else that you want.
And so, if I say Devonte, 36 months, are you willing to give me 36 months to get yourself out of the feeling that you have right now?
12:50
We're like I'm sick and tired of being formed, sick enough people to buy stuff for my girl that I want to say cannot be able to provide for my kid.
I wanted to be in a good zip code.
I want to be able to have good.
School.
I wanted to be able to have these things.
There's a price tag on them.
The question is just whether or not you're willing to pay it.
If you're willing to pay crank the dial and volume will negate lock but you can't rely on lat.
13:07
You can rely on volume is that I promise you, independent of race color, socio-economic background really great.
Some races socioeconomic backgrounds, or how someone appears, gives them an advantage short.
But if you do it a million times, this gives an advantage is you only need one?
Yes.
If there's like a lesson I can like, how do you like that you into your brain?
13:22
Is that there's a significant amount of money and opportunity that sits on the other side?
Being willing to be rejected by strangers.
If you get rejected a thousand times you are no worse off than you are right now.
In fact, you're better, why?
Because you have a thousand times experience.
And so you either learn for you win, which means in both cases by doing you win by default, I'll give you a little analogy.
13:42
So let's say you and your buddy or thing about asking a girl to prom it'll make sense in a second and your body's like a man.
I want to ask Nicole.
You're like alright man.
Why don't you go ask her?
It's like what she says?
No he's like well then you're in the exact same position you are now which is you have no prom date.
You will also So have no prom date, but you'll have experience of asking one grand.
13:59
What happens when you talk in the next row?
We're probably be a little nervous and you probably realize that you'll survive you will live if you hear a no, if you ask 100 girls, do you think one of them will say yes to your prom date, probably.
And in that situation, where are you now better off than you were before?
You asked the moral of the story, there is that you lose nothing from.
14:14
No, you only stand something to gain from yeses and one.
Yes, can change your entire life.
And so, if you're willing to be rejected and see the rejections as you learning, meaning you win and see the yeses.
As you also winning, then you can't move.
And everybody else around you who's poor is going to convince you.
14:30
Otherwise they're gonna be like, why are you still doing this and stop?
Bothering those people.
Then you're never going to get the job and you need to readjust your expectation set your goals lower.
Hey, that stuff's not for us, right?
They're going to tell you those things because the thing is, is that you have something that I do not have and that many people won't have, is that you have a hard fucking beginning, you have a harder and bigger monster to slay, but the bigger the monster, the more epic, the hero.
14:52
And so these are the stories that are going to some days how these you make the sermons that you're gonna be able to give to other Avanti's in.
A future.
If you can't even muster the willingness to fail for yourself, you willing to feel for your kid for the story that you're going to tell, then and be willing to fail for the hundred other thousand other volunteers that you'll be able to someday, tell your story to so they can get out of their situation.
15:11
So I didn't have time to say that but hopefully I'll give you a couple more minutes that give you a little more context.
I think I can speak confidently for almost you Nation.
We're all rooting for you.
A future.
If you can't even muster the willingness to fail for yourself, you willing to feel for your kid for the story that you're going to tell, then and be willing to fail for the hundred other thousand other volunteers that you'll be able to someday, tell your story to so they can get out of their situation.
So I didn't have time to say that but hopefully I'll give you a couple more minutes that give you a little more context.
I think I can speak confidently for almost you Nation.
We're all rooting for you.

I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What you don't know can kill you, and ultimately will, because at the end of the day, all of us are going to die.
And after having built. 2 multi 8 figure companies, another eight figure company, another eight figure company.
And then now we have a portfolio of companies that do just about a million a week.
0:56
I've I've learned some things about financial education and things like that, and I realized that was wildly deficient in other areas.
And so in this search for meaning and figuring out, you know, what I want to do when I grow up, I've kind of bucketed the different disciplines that I think all of us have to learn as entrepreneurs to fill the hole that we have in our souls.
1:17
And I think a lot of us, we pursue business because we feel like it is going to fill this hole even on some level we know it won't, but we do it anyways cuz we just don't have another best bet and so after having.
Enough money to question the the meaning of life.
1:35
I've kind of look at it, looked at these, at these buckets as seven things.
And so that's what I'm going to talk about.
And I think it's useful because a lot of times we just don't know what we lack.
And simply having an understanding of the breadth of topics and disciplines that we should have and understand will show us where our deficiencies are.
1:51
And I believe that you need all seven in order to feel more complete and as I've made more progress in these things.
I feel like I've been able to unearth my singular meaning.
It's not necessarily yours, but for me, it's to learn.
I love learning.
And so for me, one of the best ways of learning is teaching.
2:07
And so I get questions all the time about why I make these.
Like what?
Like why would I care about doing this stuff for free?
I do it for me because I love learning, and I learned best through teaching.
You know what I'm going through right now?
And so these are the seven different disciplines I think every human being has to learn.
2:24
All right, so the first is foundational education.
All right.
Now the good thing is, the system is pretty decent at decent at teaching this one.
All right, So this is like reading, writing and math.
Like, that's how I see it.
It's like if you can read, write and math and do math.
You'll learn that from school.
2:41
And specifically, just like reading, writing.
Yeah, reading, writing and math are kind of what I would consider foundational principles because from there you can use reading and writing and math to learn the rest of the principles, right?
And so this one's foundational, and this is pretty much the only one that we get taught at school, which is why everyone, or at least for me, I felt wildly deficient to do with the real world because there's so many other things, right?
3:02
Which is crazy to me that, like, what we cover are not.
I think we should just get foundations.
If I were to redesign our education system, I would just teach reading, writing and math.
And then the rest of it would be around these disciplines.
All right.
So the next thing is physical.
All right.
3:18
And The thing is, is if you're living in this world, you live in the physical plane.
And so you have to understand what you need to eat and how do you need to move in order to, you know, increase your energy longevity, etcetera.
And so all the things underneath this is bucket energy, sorry would be like sleep.
You know, like your own sleep routines if you have them, but not to be religious about them or superstitious about them because those end up becoming handicaps more than they actually end up helping you.
3:43
But how to actually train to look the way you want to look?
How to eat the way you want to look.
How to eat and train the way so you can know how you want to feel.
All of this stuff.
Because you exist in this plane and we have these bodies for our whole lives.
And so it would behoove us to learn how to do these things, because all the rest of these disciplines are no longer a priority if your physical health is is.
4:02
Is waning, right?
It's like, was it the there's there's a saying about that.
Everybody can have every wish in the world except for when you're sick, you only have one, which is to not be sick, right.
And so learning.
This is what I would consider the second level of education.
The third level of education that I've outlined for myself is professional, right?
4:21
And this is 1 where depending on what you are what you are.
Skill set is right or what Sorry, what what career path you want to go down.
Some schools are you know if you want to be an accountant there's pretty decent there's decent career path there for you to learn that skill.
Now most accountants would say, yeah when I had my, you know once I've graduated with my Mac or my Master's in accounting that's when really my real education began, right.
4:43
And so many of these are like that especially from the the formal education standpoint.
But hopefully as I'm going through these you can think to yourself like OK, where am I lacking.
And as I get higher and higher up, I will tell you I think the fulfillment and the and the and the meaning that you can drive for them.
These kind of work like a pyramid, right?
Like this is the base.
4:59
And then you build up, all right.
The next level of this, what I would consider is emotional, all right.
And this one, you have to continue to grow over time because this is just like understanding your own, your own feelings and thoughts.
5:15
And as you grow as an entrepreneur, you have to know these things because you'll you'll figure out where your deficiencies are.
All of us have them.
And if you can't, think to yourself.
What your deficiencies are and name them and be okay with yourself while still having them.
I think that you get stuck there because you just don't know how to fix yourself, right?
5:31
Not that you need to be fixed, but how to grow right?
And so this is the kind of the 4th the 4th level of education.
Now note this one we don't get taught anything about at all, anywhere.
Right.
And you have to learn all the stuff on your own.
And most of us that have no education on this.
So think about how much time you've devoted to like, this one now, because now we're really departing from formal education.
5:49
Obviously, there's not much formal education around.
Physical recess doesn't really count, right?
The next level that that I have here is relational.
All right.
So this is how to communicate, influence and deal with others.
And this is wildly important, because first you have to master yourself, right?
6:08
And then the next step there is being able to relate to others in a way that is, that is meaningful.
And so by doing that, you're able to influence others.
You're able to build groups, build tribes, build companies.
All of this is going to be predicated on your ability to deal with other humans.
Again, this isn't taught anywhere, right?
6:23
That's why you know some of the books that were most transformational for me in my life.
Were books that that talked about how to deal with other people, how to communicate, right, how to how to how to have people like you, right, How to have people trust you.
And really the flip side of that is how to be like a bull and how to be trustworthy rather than some, like hacks or tricks.
6:43
It's so much more about the character traits, which is the ugly answer, but it's also probably the truth.
So these are the these are the five loves.
And if you're looking at yourself right now, hopefully you should be like, well, how much time am I spending learning this discipline for my own emotions?
How much, how much time am I spending learning this discipline in learning how to relate to others?
7:01
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can out more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that?
7:17
Is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to.
Do is you can just leave review but take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb would mean the absolute world to me and more importantly it may change the world with someone else.
The next one that I that I have here is financial.
7:36
All right.
Financial literacy, and I would say this first in the beginning is personal finance, which is basically learning how to spend less than you make and then ideally significantly less than you make.
If you listen to any of my stuff, because wealth is a ratio, it is not a number, it is a, it is a ratio between how much you earn versus how much you spend.
7:54
So if you want to increase your wealth, you can decrease your expenses and in so doing become more wealthy.
Think about that for a second.
And while you process that, I will, I will tell you.
The second iteration of financial which is then how to multiply, So the beginning it's about the getting getting of the money and then the next level is about how to multiply the money that you have right and have the money work for you.
8:14
And that's that's I would say currently this is where I'm focusing a lot of my time and attention because I want to learn that game.
That being said.
A lot of these things combined together, right?
Like if you want to have a business, you need to know how to manage your own emotions, you need to know how to relate to others, you need to know how to manage finances.
You need to have some skills that you have professionally.
8:31
You can provide value to the marketplace in and remember with like this professional school that I was saying earlier, only if you have like a formal career path or you're going to learn this in the in the in the formal education system which is you know, failing everybody even more every every day.
But most most professions right, you learn.
8:48
You learn by doing.
You learn by getting into that industry, right?
And so that's why there's no school for entrepreneurship.
Not really.
There's entrepreneurship schools.
But like, let's be honest, like, they're not legit.
The real school for entrepreneurship is just getting into the game and starting to apply.
And so right now as we're thinking you're going through this right, I've named 6 and I'll tell you the last one in a second.
9:09
But think about where you rate on these.
Like how much time am I spending learning about financial education?
How much time I spend?
Can I read a balance sheet?
Right.
Can I read a cash flow statement?
Relational right.
Like how much time am I spending learning how to relate to others?
Do you say things like and this is important for everyone who has an identity, which is everyone, right?
9:26
Do you face things like like I don't play well with others?
I don't even like saying that.
Me personally, as I'm telling you this, I don't like saying that because I don't like speaking that over myself.
But I can tell you the more you can become aware of how people say I am, I do.
I have.
Right.
I must, I should, etc.
People tell you their own limiting beliefs and the things that you say and the things that you speak over yourself become your reality.
9:47
And like, this is very true.
Like, I'm, I don't even want to say this.
Like people will say I'm not good with money, right?
I don't even like saying it right.
Because you speak this belief into yourself and that becomes your reality.
And so the first thing you have to do is start correcting your language so that you know, it's like, I have a, I have, I have a weakness here, I have a deficiency in terms of my learning.
10:05
Right.
Because then it becomes an opportunity that you can fix rather than I am this way, it is certain I speak this way and therefore will never grow, right.
And so as you're looking through these pillars of disciplines that that that come inevitably on the on the entrepreneurial journey, you have to, you have to see what your deficiencies are and learn them right.
10:22
And that's and if you're like look at this and this seems overwhelming, well you have your whole life to learn them, which is what I think is inspiring.
And I I honestly think for me, looking at these disciplines has given me a lot of meaning in my own life.
Because I just see this as so much stuff that I want to do.
I want to learn all this stuff and then it makes it makes living more interesting for me.
10:41
And then finally, the last one is philosophical, all right?
And this is, this is the values that you choose to live by.
These are the things that you believe to be true, that are eternal.
And so for me, this has been incredibly, incredibly useful.
10:59
And I can tell you guys, for anybody who's watching this like.
When you have enough money to spend millions of dollars a year, every single year for the rest of your life just on the money that you have, assuming it doesn't even grow like you ask different and weirder like life gets weird, right.
You have weirder questions that you ask and then you realize there's really.
11:16
So hopefully I can jump to the the end of that for for anybody who's who's curious.
You won't get more fulfillment from all of these things or any one of these things, but it's really feeling how you can balance all these things.
But I think that philosophical, despite the fact that I said it's the 7th bucket.
I actually think that it's the most important bucket and all of the changes in my own subjective well-being and how much I enjoy living have come from fundamental shifts in my philosophy about what I what I believe it means to be human and the time that we spent here on earth.
11:47
And so anyways, if you're looking at yourself and you're looking at your own deficits, A and that's OK is one of my favorite settings that I tell myself my own self talk, right.
I'm not good at this and that's OK.
Right.
I'm not good at this yet, and that's okay.
12:03
I'm not good at the relational side with other people yet.
And that's Okay, right?
Because I'm going to learn, right.
I'm not as good at the finances as I would like to be yet.
And that's Okay, right.
And so it becomes, it gets you out of this defeatist talk, this absolutism of being deficient.
12:20
And making it as something that's an opportunity for you to grow it.
And I know this sounds minor, but I'm telling you when I look at the employees that I have, I look at the people that are in our company, I look at the, the businesses that we work with, I can tell immediately by someone's language patterns how likely they are to grow, right.
And so the first thing you can do is correct your own language patterns for each of these, each of these buckets.
12:39
But getting back to philosophical, right as the as the 7th bucket, this bucket I believe is.
I mean, it's the meaning of life, right?
And.
What will happen is if you are doing all of these things, you're doing your financial education.
You're making more money.
You're increasing your influence through your relational discipline, your your your set, your sense of self, and your emotional management.
13:00
Your impulse control is improving, right?
Your your professional skills are enhancing your physical well-being, your energy, your sleep.
The habits that you have around that are things that are increasing your longevity, increasing your energy, increasing your sense of well-being from a physical standpoint.
And hopefully you have the foundational education of learning of reading and writing, which if you don't, you should do that first, because it's the gateway to learning all these other things.
13:21
But The thing is, is all of these other ones, if you don't know why you're doing them, I think that ultimately you don't feel better.
So you may improve all of these things, but you don't feel better.
And I think that most of us just want to feel better.
And so for me, making strides in understanding why I do what I do and where I derive meaning in life has been one of the most.
13:41
Fulfilling for me and ultimately why I've been increasing my content stuff on the channels and I'm writing books right now that I'll be releasing for free for everyone, just to help other entrepreneurs and people make positive contribution with the potential that we all have inside of us.

When I was a wee lad a young man, I lived on $1500 a month and believe it or not during that period of time while splitting room sleeping on the floor.
With another dude, I was taking about fifteen twenty thousand dollars a month.
And the reason that I live like that is because I am incredibly risk-averse, but be, because I wanted to have money to go on the offensive later.
0:18
If you don't know who I am, my name is accion.
Actors not calm for bowl of companies.
There's over $200, you make these videos because I want you to make shitloads of money and make a big company so that someday we can partner together and take it to a hundred dollars and beyond for me, make it when Grand a month was never an amount of money that I wanted to brag about or feel like I had made it.
0:34
I wanted to shoot really, really big.
This was only stuff that was going to be stepping stones for me to achieve what I wanted to later.
What I want to do in this video, I'm going to break down how he's able to live for so cheap.
This is for all the single guys, all the single ladies.
And if you can live with your parents, even better for me, somebody would have died.
It was for the best that I didn't have to live at home.
0:49
This is what I actually did in order to live a fifteen hundred dollars, a month or less.
And I did that eating out every day.
There's three big cost centers.
You got Transportation, you got living, and you got food.
So, Food-wise, some guys have seen Mosey meals meal hacks.
The things that I do at these chain restaurants and I did it that way because I don't like cooking and I wanted to have more time to make money, but made more financial sense for me to not take eight hours on a Sunday to go grocery shopping and prep.
1:15
All my food versus me getting Chipotle twice a day, which is what I did at the time.
Then $15 a day today, 20 bucks a day, 30 days in a row six, hundred dollars a month.
You can also go to Panda Express which has a phenomenal 110 g of protein.
And hack that extra chicken.
1:31
So you can have 200 grams of protein every day recommend, it third best option is Chick-fil-A is one of my favorites.
They are on the pricier side, just go with a to 20 packs of chicken nuggets and getting close to 12 bucks, a shitload of meat or two sandwiches.
Either way you'll end up in that ten to twelve dollar range and you'll be at that 600 $700 a month rage.
1:50
And if you're like huh, did he really do that?
I sure did.
That's all I did.
I pick between Chick-fil-A Panda Express and chipotle.
That's what I lived on.
So much to this point that Let didn't know that we were going on dates, but for me, these were the fine establishments that I was frequently on a regular basis.
They knew me by name and they knew that I knew how to work the menu.
2:08
So first step was Mosey meals and that for me time to money-wise was worth it when I would go to the grocery store and I would get all the fixings on stuff.
I spend a hundred dollars in a week and I ended up spending almost $100 a month as a single guy when I went grocery shopping and did all the prep and all the clean versus me running out next door, grabbing the food, eating it and heading back, and was a nice mental break.
2:26
For me, I ate cheap.
And as crazy as this may seem It is easier to figure out how to get all of your calories in eating out.
Stuff ahead of time, the absolute cheapest route, which I'll tell you right now, loaves of bread.
Peanut butter cheapest thing in the world and if you really want to make sure that you're covering your bases, get a multi-item.
2:43
You can live on it if you want to add a third Staple in there, you can add Lactaid milk.
If your Dairy sensitive, you'll get your protein, your carbs, you get your fat in.
You want to be extreme on it, you can be extreme for me.
I didn't want to live on peanut butter sandwiches.
I did eat them when I was trying to bulk up, but I did those in addition to my normal calorie intake and That degree you might want to do one of those mozi meals, and then do peanut butter and milk is the other one which is a nice cheap in between reason.
3:06
This is so important for everybody who's watching this, you got to know how to live cheap.
So you can save up to build a business you want.
So you can invest in the skills and the experience that are going to make you money.
Number two is transportation.
This is where mozi mobiles came in, there's lots of ends when it comes to mobiles meals and mansions from the mobile standpoint.
3:24
The most efficient way to own a vehicle is to purchase it in cash.
A used vehicle Oil.
That is ideally between five and ten years old.
Any place in America.
Right now today, you can find a used four door vehicle that is between five and ten years old for ten thousand dollars.
3:40
You don't have car payments.
The only thing you really have to manage his car insurance which is not too expensive.
And here's the cool part, the cheaper your car, let's see Insurance.
You are young and you are living on $600 a month for Mosey meals and you live on a hundred dollars a month.
After you've made your one-time Capital expensive actually, getting the car which I recommend doing a, not taking loan for it.
3:59
All you have Is your Mansion, your Chateau where you going to rest your head at night.
I lived in Southern California.
One of, if not the most expensive markets in the United States.
I was in Costa Mesa was where I lived and after I slept on the floor of my gym, which is the first place which technically was Zero, but at the same time it was 5,000 a month because it was my actual rent for my business.
4:18
I then really splurged.
I ended up having a member at my gym say, are you really sleeping here instead?
I sure am another member was having me sleep at their place for free.
Obviously able to move from the free place to my phone.
On Blaze, which is really in quotes.
Here, we split a single bedroom in a seven-bedroom house.
4:35
He and I were roommates, not housemates roommates.
And I had one mattress that I got off Craigslist and put on the floor fan next to my face because it's really loud by the way.
So you can not have to hear what someone else is doing the three other bedroom.
Had a couple, there were three dogs in the house.
4:52
My roommate had a dog.
Another couple had a dog.
And another couple had a dog, and one of the cups of two dogs, and then they were both big.
So there was marking.
Territory.
There was shit, and piss in the house every day, fucking horrible.
My half was 400 bucks a month.
If you're in like North Carolina or you're in Boise Idaho, you can probably get a room for four hundred dollars a month without having to split it big picture here.
5:14
I would recommend you go to the place where shit's happening four hundred dollars a month that you'd spend to be in an area where things are going on, and people are doing things with their lives to get out of your area of the world where nothing's happening and your friends are still in the same place and your parents don't encourage you.
And think this internet shit is weird.
5:29
Weird tell you to stop watching videos on YouTube and trying to better yourself and just try to get a job, whatever it is.
If you want to get out of that environment, it is worth the 200 or $400 a month.
The easiest thing to do is to connect with people online join communities, join disk or groups joined Facebook groups, whatever it is.
5:45
Try and figure out where there are pockets of them because people congregate you can find pockets of people that have similar goals to you and get around them.
Every move for the first few years of, my career was only to be around people.
As long as you're a person who is going to hustle and See if people will open doors for you.
6:01
Move from SoCal to Puerto Rico, briefly from there.
We move to Irvine and then Albuquerque New Mexico because I had people there that I wanted to learn from.
And I didn't know anyone else besides this one.
Couple, if you just say, hey, do you know anybody else who lives in this area?
And this is where, like, now the world's even more connected than it was a decade ago.
6:19
See, a lot in SoCal, you see a lot in Miami, you see a lot of New York, lot of Chicago.
And a big thing here.
If you see Cleveland rich is not the same as SoCal rich.
Not the same as New York happens, is your standard of Excellence raises in some ways you feel worse about yourself, but to the same degree, it shows you what's possible.
6:40
My recommendation is to use that as inspiration is possible.
They're made of the same flesh and bone as I am.
Therefore, I can too.
And when you get around people like that, they start talking a different time, increments, and different money increments you're hanging out with her talking in terms of weeks, talking terms of paychecks.
Talking, in terms of $500 thousand dollar Investments, you got to be talking to people who are talking about, 100,000 or best.
6:59
Talking about years, talk about decades, you can judge how wealthy people will be by how they talk about how they allocate resources, time and money and the increments that they measure those.
I've moved a lot faster in life, through handshakes instead of hacks who who introduced me and open way more doors than any, whatever did getting around the who a lot of times it's hard to measure.
7:21
But when I look at all the big deals that I've done in my life all been one or two degrees connected from people that I met one recommendation that I have for you don't turn Down the first inbox connect with somebody at a thing that's like, hey, let's grab dinner.
If you make that first one happened, the likely that you end up staying friends and connecting is significantly.
7:36
Are if you turn down the first invite, it shows that you're not as interested.
They also turned out your counter invite and it becomes this whole thing.
And I'm just saying like, one big move is just make it work on the first invite.
When you go to that meeting, do some prep work.
Do 30 minutes of research on the person you're going to meet with and try to bring something valuable to the table.
7:55
Now, it might be your skill and you just apply to them.
And this is the thing, this is a fucking hack.
Life.
No one wants a free patio.
Like hey, you got a buddy who builds patios?
You don't have a patio.
You have a couple people bid for it, your buddy's like, hey, I'll build it for you, right.
He says he'll do it for free and you say, sure, cool.
8:12
I'll save some money.
The other guy said they can do it in four weeks.
He starts taking four weeks and it's you know a third of the way down.
He's AA.
Sorry I'm working.
Some other jobs will be around to work on it later this weekend and now it's eight weeks and it still you know, halfway done.
And at 12 weeks, they start to fucking hate.
The guy.
The thing is is that if you want to do somebody a favor, if you really Want them to take it as a favor, blow them away.
8:33
Make them feel awkward for the amount of work that you did.
And if you've never had this experience, I can promise you.
I've been on the receiving end and it is uncomfortable.
Fuck, I owe this guy.
Something.
And the nice thing about this, you just provide value, you go in and you don't just try a little bit of value.
You actually do with a full scope project, would be for whatever it is that you're good at and you just set it up for the dude or you've spent a whole day walking them through how you do this stuff.
8:55
You're like, well, how do you find the time for that?
You work all the time.
That's how you do it.
This is work.
It's investing in the long-term relationship therapy dividends later.
Does that mean that I'm going to give to somebody and I might not get anything back?
Yes.
Didn't you say you want to be an entrepreneur and make the world a better place?
That's what it looks like at a micro level.
The ultimate leverage that you can have in a relationship is not needing anything back.
9:15
If you do that, you can be the guy that stacks iou's.
And then when you do need to make your move because you are going to do the next thing.
Then you've got all these blank checks ready to cash in and then that is how you can Propel yourself away faster and you just load the deck early When you don't need anything, the time to dig the, well is not when you're thirsty, but when you have enough water so that when you are thirsty, it's there.
9:36
Now we can go on the offensive.
My plan B was always strip at night drive, Uber during the day and I'm dead serious.
If you're making less than sixty seventy thousand a year.
I don't understand why you wouldn't take that car that you saved up for, that's got four doors.
It's 15 years or younger.
9:52
There's no visible damage on it.
You got those three check marks, you can drive.
Uber, it is the most flexible job you can make money immediately.
There's No risk.
Besides the actual vehicle itself, you can work, whatever hours you want.
You can do it on separate apps.
And when I say whatever hours, I said there's flexibility.
But also how many hours you want you work?
10:08
12 hours a day.
If you feel like living on 1500 bucks a month or less spend 20, make another 200 have saved up after taxes so I could go on the offensive again if you know it doesn't cost.
You much to live.
Your risk tolerance goes up because you don't have other shit to worry about real cost of the shit that you can't afford or shouldn't be affording right now, you're paying paying for the car, but you're sacrificing your dreams.
10:32
You're paying for going out with the boys at the club, buying a table.
Get in bottle service, buying girls, drinks all of a sudden, boom hundred bucks, boom, 200 bucks on a night.
Like what just happened, I was half my rent, can become less dangerous because it's very hard to fight.
Someone who has nothing to lose and it's very hard to fight someone who can live on nothing.
10:51
We had to pick between living on ten thousand dollars a month and making ten thousand dollars a month or living on $1500 a month.
And then spending the spread, if you spend Five thousand dollars a month, three thousand dollars a month, two thousand dollars a month on your education so that you can increase your earning capacity.
11:07
It's hard to be stopped side note.
If you can get competitive with yourself at how little you can spend, recommend one of the other hacks that Dave Ramsey has that, I'm a huge fan of is taking out the amount of money that you're gonna spend for the entire month, putting in your wallet and leaving it there.
Don't spend more than that period.
That's it.
11:22
That's all you got.
You are one of these people who wants to credit card hack it to percent here and I get 1% here and I get 3 percent here.
You're focusing on the wrong.
Ang fucking percentage side.
If you're trying to be financially disciplined, just fucking be disciplined.
So I get asked a lot about the income to spending ratio.
I never had one that's because I just try to maximize both sides.
11:41
How can I hack the game to spend as little as humanly possible period?
Then how can I hack the other side of the game make as much money as I possibly can?
I deceived every dollar that was at Food, Transportation living the other way of doing this is getting competitive with your bank account.
One of the habits that I highly encourage you to do, is that every morning?
11:58
What's the first thing you check is it?
Graham is a YouTube, is your text.
I will tell you the first thing that I checked the mornings.
When I was in this period of my life was my bank account.
Every day, I wake up and I'll check my bank account.
And what happens when you do that, if you develop this muscle of kind of this understanding of the money flow, it might be uneventful to check your bank account every day, but if I can give you a habit, that will make you a lot of money, it's just like weight loss.
12:21
If you get on a scale every day and you're trying to lose weight and you don't do jack shit.
But you literally just get on the scale every day, people lose weight drawing and putting Awareness to the problem or the thing that you're trying to change improves it.
If you're in a business and you want sales to go up, start tracking everything, if you just start reporting publicly on clothes rates and put a leaderboard up sales, go up, think about this from a human behavior.
12:43
Simply punish, bad behavior with yourself as quickly as possible.
And you want to reward good behavior as fast as possible, so you do more of it.
That's why you check the bank account every day.
Start seeing it go up and you get this little ticker, it goes up and if you really want to be a g about it, this is how I did it.
Check your bank account and you have a Google sheet on your phone.
12:59
Every day, I put my balance it.
And if you can start getting addicted to getting personal records in your bank account.
Like if I can give you the one gift of this is to gamify it.
The people who make the most money, they think about money as a game.
And the best way to do that is early on track two things.
13:15
Check your bank account and you put it in.
And what's nice there is that you can start seeing long-term trends.
When I would look at that Trend, I got a tremendous amount of Good Feeling, I would look at it be like I fucking did that and every month, get a little bit bigger, a little bit bigger, a little bit bigger than you start feeling.
Progress for the sacrifices that you make every day because you look at where you're at this month versus last month and you see progress.
13:35
So, if you want to improve your money situation, you got to check it.
Got to look at it every day.
And the first thing in the day priority, it means it is happening prior, it's more important.
So you wake up, you make money a priority, you check your bank at every day.
You start get a pulse on what's going in, and what's going out?
13:51
What's going in with going out?
You look at all of the pluses that go in.
You look at all the minuses and next month, you try to make that column, go up and that column go down, you keep Running that cycle.
And I promise you, if you actually look at your bank account, every single day, even for 90 days, 90 days, you will be amazed at what goes in there.
14:08
Like trop it, even though I still had that app, most people get anxiety the avoid the things that they don't like got to confront it.
I'm fucking poor.
Don't want to be poor when you look at this money until eventually it starts paying attention back to me.








0:00
When I was a wee lad a young man, I lived on $1500 a month and believe it or not during that period of time while splitting room sleeping on the floor.
With another dude, I was taking about fifteen twenty thousand dollars a month.
And the reason that I live like that is because I am incredibly risk-averse, but be, because I wanted to have money to go on the offensive later.
0:18
If you don't know who I am, my name is accion.
Actors not calm for bowl of companies.
There's over $200, you make these videos because I want you to make shitloads of money and make a big company so that someday we can partner together and take it to a hundred dollars and beyond for me, make it when Grand a month was never an amount of money that I wanted to brag about or feel like I had made it.

He says he'll do it for free and you say, sure, cool.
8:12
I'll save some money.
The other guy said they can do it in four weeks.
He starts taking four weeks and it's you know a third of the way down.
He's AA.
Sorry I'm working.
Some other jobs will be around to work on it later this weekend and now it's eight weeks and it still you know, halfway done.
And at 12 weeks, they start to fucking hate.
The guy.
The thing is is that if you want to do somebody a favor, if you really Want them to take it as a favor, blow them away.
8:33
Make them feel awkward for the amount of work that you did.
And if you've never had this experience, I can promise you.
I've been on the receiving end and it is uncomfortable.
Fuck, I owe this guy.
Something.
And the nice thing about this, you just provide value, you go in and you don't just try a little bit of value.
You actually do with a full scope project, would be for whatever it is that you're good at and you just set it up for the dude or you've spent a whole day walking them through how you do this stuff.
8:55
You're like, well, how do you find the time for that?
You work all the time.
That's how you do it.
This is work.
It's investing in the long-term relationship therapy dividends later.
Does that mean that I'm going to give to somebody and I might not get anything back?
Yes.
Didn't you say you want to be an entrepreneur and make the world a better place?
That's what it looks like at a micro level.
The ultimate leverage that you can have in a relationship is not needing anything back.
9:15
If you do that, you can be the guy that stacks iou's.
And then when you do need to make your move because you are going to do the next thing.
Then you've got all these blank checks ready to cash in and then that is how you can Propel yourself away faster and you just load the deck early When you don't need anything, the time to dig the, well is not when you're thirsty, but when you have enough water so that when you are thirsty, it's there.
9:36
Now we can go on the offensive.
My plan B was always strip at night drive, Uber during the day and I'm dead serious.
If you're making less than sixty seventy thousand a year.
I don't understand why you wouldn't take that car that you saved up for, that's got four doors.
It's 15 years or younger.
9:52
There's no visible damage on it.
You got those three check marks, you can drive.
Uber, it is the most flexible job you can make money immediately.
There's No risk.
Besides the actual vehicle itself, you can work, whatever hours you want.
You can do it on separate apps.
And when I say whatever hours, I said there's flexibility.
But also how many hours you want you work?
10:08
12 hours a day.
If you feel like living on 1500 bucks a month or less spend 20, make another 200 have saved up after taxes so I could go on the offensive again if you know it doesn't cost.
You much to live.
Your risk tolerance goes up because you don't have other shit to worry about real cost of the shit that you can't afford or shouldn't be affording right now, you're paying paying for the car, but you're sacrificing your dreams.
10:32
You're paying for going out with the boys at the club, buying a table.
Get in bottle service, buying girls, drinks all of a sudden, boom hundred bucks, boom, 200 bucks on a night.
Like what just happened, I was half my rent, can become less dangerous because it's very hard to fight.
Someone who has nothing to lose and it's very hard to fight someone who can live on nothing.
10:51
We had to pick between living on ten thousand dollars a month and making ten thousand dollars a month or living on $1500 a month.
And then spending the spread, if you spend Five thousand dollars a month, three thousand dollars a month, two thousand dollars a month on your education so that you can increase your earning capacity.
11:07
It's hard to be stopped side note.
If you can get competitive with yourself at how little you can spend, recommend one of the other hacks that Dave Ramsey has that, I'm a huge fan of is taking out the amount of money that you're gonna spend for the entire month, putting in your wallet and leaving it there.
Don't spend more than that period.
That's it.
11:22
That's all you got.
You are one of these people who wants to credit card hack it to percent here and I get 1% here and I get 3 percent here.
You're focusing on the wrong.
Ang fucking percentage side.
If you're trying to be financially disciplined, just fucking be disciplined.
So I get asked a lot about the income to spending ratio.
I never had one that's because I just try to maximize both sides.
11:41
How can I hack the game to spend as little as humanly possible period?
Then how can I hack the other side of the game make as much money as I possibly can?
I deceived every dollar that was at Food, Transportation living the other way of doing this is getting competitive with your bank account.
One of the habits that I highly encourage you to do, is that every morning?
11:58
What's the first thing you check is it?
Graham is a YouTube, is your text.
I will tell you the first thing that I checked the mornings.
When I was in this period of my life was my bank account.
Every day, I wake up and I'll check my bank account.
And what happens when you do that, if you develop this muscle of kind of this understanding of the money flow, it might be uneventful to check your bank account every day, but if I can give you a habit, that will make you a lot of money, it's just like weight loss.
12:21
If you get on a scale every day and you're trying to lose weight and you don't do jack shit.
But you literally just get on the scale every day, people lose weight drawing and putting Awareness to the problem or the thing that you're trying to change improves it.
If you're in a business and you want sales to go up, start tracking everything, if you just start reporting publicly on clothes rates and put a leaderboard up sales, go up, think about this from a human behavior.
12:43
Simply punish, bad behavior with yourself as quickly as possible.
And you want to reward good behavior as fast as possible, so you do more of it.
That's why you check the bank account every day.
Start seeing it go up and you get this little ticker, it goes up and if you really want to be a g about it, this is how I did it.
Check your bank account and you have a Google sheet on your phone.
12:59
Every day, I put my balance it.
And if you can start getting addicted to getting personal records in your bank account.
Like if I can give you the one gift of this is to gamify it.
The people who make the most money, they think about money as a game.
And the best way to do that is early on track two things.
13:15
Check your bank account and you put it in.
And what's nice there is that you can start seeing long-term trends.
When I would look at that Trend, I got a tremendous amount of Good Feeling, I would look at it be like I fucking did that and every month, get a little bit bigger, a little bit bigger, a little bit bigger than you start feeling.
Progress for the sacrifices that you make every day because you look at where you're at this month versus last month and you see progress.
13:35
So, if you want to improve your money situation, you got to check it.
Got to look at it every day.
And the first thing in the day priority, it means it is happening prior, it's more important.
So you wake up, you make money a priority, you check your bank at every day.
You start get a pulse on what's going in, and what's going out?
13:51
What's going in with going out?
You look at all of the pluses that go in.
You look at all the minuses and next month, you try to make that column, go up and that column go down, you keep Running that cycle.
And I promise you, if you actually look at your bank account, every single day, even for 90 days, 90 days, you will be amazed at what goes in there.
14:08
Like trop it, even though I still had that app, most people get anxiety the avoid the things that they don't like got to confront it.
I'm fucking poor.
Don't want to be poor when you look at this money until eventually it starts paying attention back to me.








0:00
Most people who are like in the beginning of the game like you don't have a passion yet.
Most of you like most people aren't like man I just love this one thing but everybody has shitloads of pain like that, whatever it is.
The first rule of Entrepreneurship is used what you got and so like if that's what you got, then burn that Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:27
I hope you enjoy and subscribe with out further delay.
I've been telling you guys, we had a big guest coming on the show and this is one of my favorite guests that we've had on the show.
We haven't done the show yet but this is a guy that I'd become friendly with and we become friends over.
0:45
I don't know what the last year.
So very, very, very brilliant man.
Somebody has been very Successful in business and life and somebody that I'm excited to have a conversation with please.
Welcome to the show, mr.
Alex, her Mosey.
Thank you so much, whatever.
It's great to see you, dude.
1:01
I'm pumped to be here.
Yeah, hopefully can live up to the intro.
That's always like, dude.
All you got to do is be you, that's it.
You know out of all the people and this is real shit like all the people that I have watched on the internet over the last decade or so there's only a few of them that I'm really like, okay, this guy really, really does understand how Build a business, you know, there's a lot of coaches, there's a lot of pseudo, you know, knowledge out there.
1:27
There's a lot of hucksters, there's a lot of people who, you know, are great coaches, not great operators.
But do you know when I watch your content?
There's a few other guys out there and some of them really don't have big followings.
It's very apparent that, you know, you're very, very, very intelligent when it comes to business and dude, I'm just excited to have a conversation about it, so I'm stoked.
1:48
Yeah.
So We're going to talk about, dude.
Let's start with your story, dude.
Like how did you like?
How?
Because I you and I, we've talked about all kinds of different things via tax.
You know, we talked about Chad GTP.
We talked about GPT we talk about, you know, different things going on in business.
2:05
But you know, I've never really got to sit down and talk to you about your story.
So, this is perfect time to talk about it.
It was wild.
Yeah.
It's been, it's been well, I'll give the quick the tldr.
I was a gym owner.
2:22
In Southern California.
So I had a consulting job.
I did defense Contracting space, cyber intelligence, Bureau 700, Booz Allen hated that job.
Actually hated it.
So much that I ended up quitting and driving across the country.
Not telling anyone until I was halfway there because my dad was going to talk me out of it and be like, hey, you don't need to know like, let's just follow the path that.
2:40
Yeah.
And he was doing it because you just want to look out for my best but I didn't want to do that.
And so I showed up in California with no plan, shut up at a gym owners gym and was like, hey man, can you teach me is like I don't know like Like why are you here?
I got shit to say.
Yeah.
But that his place at this time I was 22.
2:58
Okay.
Yes, II graduate a year early from a School in Tennessee and then that that way I kind of got a jumpstart my career save my extra, you know, money and then I had about 50,000 dollars saved up when I was 22 to start a business and I want to start a gym and so those because I was into fitness and I hated everything else and so that was like, I guess I'll just do this.
3:18
From there.
I spent 12 weeks with that guy.
He started work at 4 a.m. and work until 4 p.m. for 24 was his shift.
And so I did that and then I also stay at the gym.
After that learned a little bit of the ropes started gym in Huntington Beach, didn't have enough money for both.
Slept on the floor, there is you know, could only pay one right, I get it.
3:36
Yeah, very similar.
How I got started, dude.
Very show and it was by chance.
I went to a weekend workshop, two weeks before I started the gym and it was this guy who's teaching something called Facebook, It's 2013.
So I was like, I mean, we're like Stroke of Luck crazy, you know, coincidence and I was able to run Facebook ads to get like my first 25 members in the gym and we were able to grow by 5,000 a month, every month for the first seven or eight months.
4:05
And at that point, I started bringing people in and get the manager and all that stuff.
And then it pretty much started working out, open a new location, every six months after that, until I had five locations at that point.
I'm at Layla.
And I say, I got asked to speak at this event, and like, I was not in that world, you don't know me.
4:24
And I was like, yeah, I'm a gym owner.
He's like, no, I want you to talk about how your marketing for, like, brick and mortar.
And I was like, all right man, so I went up there and I was like, this is what I do, this is how.
So I was able to open all my gyms at full capacity on the first day, that was kind of like the unique thing.
So I'll what I would do is I would sign the lease, put the deposit down and then I'd start running ads immediately and it would take me 30 days to open the gym.
4:48
And so like I would spend 300 bucks a day ish and we were getting like 30 to 1 back on our ads bats.
We're making 100 Grand in our first month and so like, you know, as the cash is coming in, I'm like fine flooring and then I'm like, painting the walls and like getting the equipment.
And it like, I had this whole order because I knew that, like, by the time, the equipment got there, like the head of the paint that like, you know, like kind of stuff.
5:08
And so we'd open at full capacity, only using the cash that I got.
Hold on, that's those stories or the fucking ones that people love like you, we got plenty of time.
You got plenty of time.
Just because I talk fast in the intro like, dude, I love that.
So you so you pre-sold the memberships and then use the money to actually build the gym out.
5:28
So what I would do is we would do these challenges, we do these 6 week weight loss challenges and the whole stick was that it was free if they lost the weight.
And so people would like basically bet on themselves, they met 500, 600 bucks that they would hit.
I think I had, I think was 10% body, I changed the challenge, but it's like 10% of your body weight.
5:46
So if you were 200, you lose 20 pounds, Cetera and they had six weeks to do and we, you know, they work out as many times they wanted, we give meal plans grocery list for Preparation instructions, eating out guides all that kind of stuff.
And so every week at sign up, you know, 25, 30, 40 people, and this is all one-on-one consultation.
6:04
So like, I would do 20 to 25 consults a day everyday.
And I did that for years, eve, when I had my own Jim's, like still sold better because I've said more reps in the other guys.
Yeah.
So my guys would like set appointments for me.
At.
So I'd like every day I'd go, they had set like three days worth of appointment so it's just like Stacks exercise and so you just get, you know, just yeah the Reps in and that was I was referred as like my Rocky cutscene like, you know, knew where I was and I was hitting the me in the basement and just just getting those repetitions in and soon he was I'd put that just have five thousand dollars.
6:35
But down for the lease and just enough money to start the ads and for us we'd get ads, we get leads for like five bucks and we'd sell one out of four leads into A 600 dollar thing.
So, it's like, oh, cost me 20, 25 bucks to get a customer and I'd make six hundred dollars up front.
6:52
Yeah.
And then two days later, I had some supplements, you know, 200, 300 or the supplements to go with the program that they just bought.
And, and then the stick was 33 weeks in of their six weeks, I'd be like, hey Dorothy, you know, let's be honest, you have more than 20 pounds to lose.
7:10
What's your plan after this, you know, things over?
She's like, well, you know, what's the ultimate goal?
She's like, I just went to my high school.
We was like, okay, so you just so we're clear, you know, that in the next 21 days.
We're not going to do that, right?
And she's like, no, I understand that.
I was like, okay, so but long terms, the goal she'd say, yes, and I was like, all right, then you won the challenge and she was like, what do you mean was like because you realize it's not about six weeks and so I was like, so this is what I want to do for you.
7:33
You have the 600 bucks, I was like, I want to credit towards the goal that you really have which is the high school weight.
I was like, I'm just gonna put towards the year and that way like you win today you're in, you're one of us.
Here's the T-shirt, you know, like you're part of the family now.
And so I just set my membership at 50 bucks higher than it was supposed.
7:49
Then I usually ended up selling it for so it's like, 250 a month.
Got dropped down to 200 months.
I take the 600 divided by 12, and so that credit and fifty bucks a month off and just like that, we were able to go 600, you know, 250 and subs.
And then I'd be able to get the membership on the first month.
8:05
Compare that to the business model where someone's going like free month up front and then converts one out of three and two, a $99, a month membership.
Yeah, my ability to convert cash.
So much faster was front-loaded.
So I could outspend everybody in my market, which is also, I could launch a mall for no money out of pocket, because every day, I'd spend a hundred I get 2000 back.
8:25
And so that cash is what allowed me to open so quickly without having Capital, my own as a young guy and that's how I was able to scale.
That's awesome dude.
How how the hell did you think of that?
Like I like what?
It's a long.
So I'll tell you a story so that gym owner that I that I went out to.
8:42
Right?
So I Googled like successful.
I mean, you know, it is I was 10 11, 12 years ago, we were like successful gym or in this guy had this like crappy HTML site and it said, seven figures Sam.
All right.
And I was like, cool seven-figure.
Say I'm going to go talk to this guy.
8:57
And so I get to California and he's got, like, a little group of gym owners that like all just share their, you know, share their stuff.
It's just gym, owners and I didn't have a gym at the time.
And I was like, is it easy, okay, for me to be here is like, yeah, sure.
And so that we actually got to learn all the stuff that they had done.
9:15
Long before I started my first gemstones, like, oh, don't go too small because this I don't go too big because the brand like hey keep it under this per square foot like all these things that like I would have no idea.
Like I would have known that.
And so one guy was there and was like hey I got this this promotion that's he was in Wilmington.
9:31
So like South La.
It was like, I've got this promotion that's like doing really well.
And so he was doing this like eight weeks saying, and what happened is some rich guy, some rich entrepreneur apparently was like I won't pay for it because like, but if I hit my goal, you give me my money back and you can use Testimonial and I like promote the shit out of you and he's like, and thing is, is like he did that and like all these other people like yeah, I want that thing.
9:52
And so he was doing an eight-week thing.
And so, Sam started doing it at his place for his personal training side.
And I was like a princess thing under Sam.
And the thing is like I just saw like the ratio of how many we could sell versus, how many trainers videos like this isn't like makes sense and also, what if we put it in the boot camp, because I'm we just put as many people as you want in there to get people going thing.
10:12
People pay 500 by was like, they care about the weight, they don't care about like but the experience was and so I ran an ad with that.
First was technically for Sam spot.
I ran the ad before we even knew that Facebook ads even work.
So the first at Iran for Sam and I think I can remember we spent but we made money on it and was like, holy shit, this works.
10:35
And so I sold the first 10 or 12 people, whatever at his gym and then that's what I when I went to go play at my Huntington Beach spot.
That's awesome.
But it was like an iterative like he did.
The first guy did eight weeks.
And it was like, use all about the testimonial thing Sam.
10:50
Cut it to six weeks, and it was all about personal training and then I added in like a nutrition template things.
I template is there's like faster to move through people and made it one too many rather than 101 and that was kind of like the and added Facebook ads to it.
So like that's what when those when those came together is when it just like blew up.
11:07
That's awesome man.
Dude, you said something in there that really caught my attention is something that we talked about on the show a lot, especially on the Q&A the qaf.
Episodes a lot of these young dudes young girls to, they want to learn how to get good at selling and they want to learn how to sell.
And you said the answer in their reps reps and I just wanted to point that out like, you know, you guys asked that all the time.
11:31
Like how do I learn to become an effective sales person?
Which by the way, is the most effective skill that you could ever have.
You could ever possess ever ever, ever.
If you can, if you can learn how to sell, and you can learn how to manage people, there's always going to be a demand for your skill set.
And what Alex said in there with his reps, I'm assuming that's this is where you really want, like you said, hitting we, you know, pan in the meat.
11:54
Yeah.
You're on saying I've got girthy meet pounding going on.
Yeah, I checked the CRM like because I still had access to it right when I sold my gyms three or four years later, I had 4,000 like confirmed kills.
So like closes not consults and like that.
12:11
Just.
That's a lot of sales.
Yeah.
Got a conversation face-to-face.
Sing one of them one-on-one.
Just like I tell the people I'm like, dude, get get yourself in a good retail job, get yourself into retail job where you like people I don't want to work.
Retail will fuck your an idiot them dude because like you can learn you what you're learning in a retail, operation is so much more valuable than what you're actually getting paid.
12:32
Most of the time they're working for you.
Like the your employer like, special of your newer, your employers, working for you and also happens to be paying it because like most people come in with basically no scales.
And so then like on the job, A person gives you an education and pays you to learn, which is why like nowadays it makes almost so much more sense to just skip straight to just the on-the-job education, whatever interest you want to be in, because you'll learn about the industry at a broad spectrum.
12:57
But then you also learn more tactical sales.
But to your point about like, selling being the most valuable skill.
If you just like bullet down to First principles of, okay, if I want to do something you can either learn how to do everything or you can convince somebody else to do that thing for you.
Who's awesome.
And if you can convince somebody else to do, every other thing that is required to do in the business, then like, you can have An amazing business and only know how to do one thing, which is get other people to do stuff.
13:18
That's right.
Leadership and sales, if you like okay, well what's leadership, well it's being able to influence other people to do the things you want them to do.
Sales is pretty much the same thing.
Yeah, once more transactional, like, depending on the type, you know, type of sale but yes, 100% agree in every way I do, what I found to man is it like if you truly want to be an effective leader and salesperson, the best thing that you can do to get these people to do.
13:39
What it is that you need to do.
As the manager of the CEO of the operator is to make them understand how its Our best interest to do those things.
And a lot of people don't operate their business.
That way, I found that out after coaching an art a group for so long with Ed, you know, I found and, you know, the point of the group is that people need to learn things, right?
13:58
I'm not knocking anybody, but a lot of people don't understand that.
Like, your mission, your purpose, your values of your company really come from.
You showing the people that work for you, how their lives are going to benefit by actually listening to what it Is that you asked them to do.
14:17
And a lot of people bail out on that, dude, they come in, they want to run a business, they want to put the feet up on the, on the one of the lake on Thursday and come back on Tuesday.
And they want, they think that they're running a company.
You guys ain't running shit.
You run yourself out of business and I don't know, man.
14:32
It's just interesting.
The whole dynamic of small business is super interesting to me, dude, it's where I really.
It's what I really like like running bigger companies is and like it's fun.
I love coming here, I love being around everybody here.
I love, I love what we do.
14:48
I love what we do for the people that that our customers are companies.
I love all that but man, there's something about that like that, the beginning like where you're really hustling and you're really learning and like I do miss that, a lot of times.
That is exactly that mean that what you just Express is the reason that we decided to go with acquisition not calm, which we can get to later.
15:08
Yeah.
Because we can pick companies up right at that like, you know, 1 to 10 million in profit size and like, they're still figuring out some of that stuff.
And so like there's a, you know, there's a chain of teeth whitening Studios that were looking at and like, in the diligence process, like, man, I was like, your physical product sales were low and they're like, yeah, we're still struggling with those.
15:25
Like I fucking promise that I know like I just figure out how to get everybody to leave with.
Eartha Kitt like I promised.
And like when I was figure out, so we have a chain of thirty eight, I think photography studios and is our first personal investment, Leyland, I made outside of like the normal real estate in stocks and stuff.
15:42
And now when we spent like six months, trying to figure out a way to just like re-engineer the sales process and ended up just massively increasing the ticket size and the take rates at the same time.
But anyways, all of that comes from like a thousand tiny conversations that you notice.
Someone paws are.
15:58
Like I said that they didn't hear it the right way and how can I Fraser's way, if I put this first, is that influence, how they see the rest of the conversation, but like that, do that without the Reps know and do to has to be like this, it cannot be through a text or through.
I mean, now, it probably candy, but when you're learning, you know, for you guys who are trying to learn these skill sets, dude, the Acuity that you have to have to read.
16:24
Someone that can only come from that scenario.
There's no, there's no coach that can teach you that.
Door knocking, cold calling and and or retail where you?
Yeah.
You have 20 30 people a day walking at least.
Yeah.
And when you do that it's like that's the it's the tiny little pauses where someone says something and you have to be like if you have to if you have to be reminded you don't know it well enough.
16:49
So like it's a sales guy.
Like if you have to think about what you're going to say next, it's kind of like wrestlers when they're on the mat.
Like you.
Sure do.
You know what, you're going to be shooting to counter or something?
Yeah.
It's someone else is like, you're not like, oh, okay.
They just pulled my wrist so now and it's like you're fucked already know, you're dying.
Yeah, I did.
17:05
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not that great rustling.
Rustling.
Has been an awesome.
Awesome life teacher for me.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Talk about reps.
Yeah.
Like oh shit.
Yeah, do Single Leg Takedown and do it a hundred times every day.
Walk out, just just walk out to a match where everybody's watching you and it's just you and one other person.
17:26
And there's no hiding whatsoever of any sort.
Like, it's at Really different kind of thing, but that's a whole other conversation.
But dude, so when we're talking about so you got the gyms open because I do want to talk about where you are now and what you do because secretly, that's what I want to do.
17:43
So I am to the point now where I'm just like, dude, I love the creative process.
I love the lay of the land.
I love showing people, you know, like, like your dental, the teeth whitening think?
Yeah, but I love like, I'm like, you guys are missing it here.
17:59
Yeah, I love being able.
To show those kind of things and that's but I don't want to do them.
Yeah, I don't do them anymore.
I was doing 24 years.
Yeah, I might do it for 25.
Just say 25.
It's it's cool what you're doing.
18:14
So so, where'd you go?
Actually got the gyms going.
Yeah.
Now, what happens.
So got the gyms going.
I spoke at that conference, right?
And I talked about this a, this is what I'm doing.
I should everything.
Like I didn't.
I was just like, that's my ad.
That's my landing page was like, here's my phone script.
Here's like I just said, I didn't know how.
18:30
Presentations were distinctly like it sounds ridiculous.
I got off the stage and to this day even with all the media and press.
I've never been more bombarded my life.
Like there was like a three rows deep circle around me and like, for the next two days at the like guys were like Dean of the urinal next to me.
18:45
Like, hey, man, like the whole thing for context.
I got 150 business cards, just from like this stage to the bathroom.
Like, it was insane and I got back and I was like, man.
And they were like, what can I buy for?
Um, it was like nothing.
19:01
I was like, I own five Jim's.
I was like, they like, how do I do it as like that thing?
That's how I do it.
And so what happened is hurts, our God, no.
I'm just saying like I'm sitting here and I'm just like, reflecting on all of the shit you're telling me and how parallel it is to my story.
19:17
Dude.
It's like so parallel, like it's so parallel.
That's how I got into speaking to.
That was the exact same thing that happened to me.
I got asked to talk about our retail success as we had supplement superstores which we still have and I got To come talk about it and show how we work, how we were able to grow it and it's the fucking exact same story supplements Fitness.
19:37
I lived in the back of that first store bro.
Like it's this crazy hearing it, I don't know.
It's cool.
It's probably always see the world in a similar way.
Yeah definitely definitely.
Well that's funny because you guys don't know.
So Alex and I we know each other but like we've never actually met in person we tax.
19:54
And we talk about things that are important that are going on.
Like hey what do you think of this or that?
Like when something is truly big?
It's happening.
Like when chat GPT came out, we were him.
And I were talking because I wanted to get your take on it because, like, it was so, so huge to think about.
So, when these big huge things, I like to get, Alex's brain on it because Alex has a nice brain, but it's girthy.
20:14
Yeah, that's right.
So, you know, smart people do that with people that are smart, you know?
And so but we haven't got to sit down and talk about the actual story.
But what was funny was this is probably just like what in November or whatever when it started.
20:30
December and he started talking about like dude you sold supplements didn't you?
And he's like yeah, not that.
I could tell because it was so like the thinking like we were talking we were talking about this before the show, actually aired, like how you have to think about product that you're going to sell to someone that they don't actually want.
20:49
But need is a completely different in mind process than selling it something that they want.
Like bro, if I was selling shit that people want like I would be worth a hundred billion packing now, H like but I so people all the shit I sell is shit that people.
They need not one.
21:05
Yeah and it's just a totally different game.
Anyway, I didn't want to rub your store and I'm sitting here thinking a lot of parallels.
This is the same story.
How old are you 33?
Okay, dude, we're take I'm 10 years older than you, that's awesome.
Yeah, maybe I'll be here in 10 years now.
No, you're fucking doing it anyway, sorry.
21:23
So so this guy reaches his arm through, and he's like, here's my credit card, he said, run it for five thousand dollars.
Tell me.
Get later and I was like, what?
Like what?
I didn't like, I don't even I don't do anything with a motor.
Yeah, mind you, I'm not that rich.
21:38
And so like, you know, every all the money I had would open new locations, etc, etc.
And so I get back home, I put all the business cards into an Excel sheet and I start hitting people back up because that's, you know, I was like hey thanks again, you know whatever.
And so this guy had the guys credit card I was like I called him up was like do you really want me to run this for five grand?
21:54
It was like because I will and he was like, yeah, run it.
I was like, okay, so I swiped it and I'm still on the phone.
Of them, it goes through.
He's like, all right.
What do I get?
I was like, I don't know yet.
I was like, but I promise I'll make you more than 5 grand.
Yeah, that was what I said.
Yeah.
And so he was like, well, you know what?
22:09
I've got a gym opening up in.
D.c., why don't you fly out and just do your launch thing?
And I was like, okay, I'll do that.
I was like, how about this?
I'll spend all the money on the launch and I'll get to keep all the upfront sales but then you get all the customers I sell for free.
So like, after the six weeks is over you converted, I'll show you how to convert them and I'll give you all my plans and all the stuff you can put your logo on it.
22:30
Right?
It's free customers for.
Yeah.
And so as soon as I knew I was fine out there.
I was like okay, well if I'm going to be there, let me see what else is going on.
And so this is like unfortunate but my mom got really sick at the same time and she was in Baltimore.
So like they're Next to each other and so I was like shit.
22:47
So I actually had to go there early and while I was there, I only have a couple hours a day of visiting hours and so I was like, losing my mind, just like trying to stay busy.
I was like, I'm nothing to do and so I reached out to a friend, come from Baltimore and he was like hey my buddy, it's got a gym and he sucking wind, think he would help them out.
23:03
So I give the guy the same pitch, I was like, hey man, I got nothing to do all day.
Besides my visiting hours was like, can I just work your front desk and like sell shit and he was like sure.
And so in like 14 days or something, I think I made like 60 Grand and I was like, man, and I have to do any of the employees.
23:19
I was like, this is like, I'm all about this.
And then I did the lunch and DC and then he referred me his like, father-in-law, who had a gym or something like that.
So I went to that gym and I did the same thing and I flew back and had this big stack of contracts.
And this is just when I met Layla, like weed mat like, within 30 days of this period.
23:36
And this is like how I convinced her to quit her job.
So I stack because I first date, I proposed to Layla but I propose that she quit her job and join.
Not like proposal because hope I didn't pose on a first date.
My damn, man.
You move it.
It hot.
And so, every single time we see it, I was like, you quite yet and she was like, no.
23:54
I just fucking met, you know, I'm not quitting my job.
So, finally, she picks me up from the airport and, and she was like, you're taking me on a date.
It's been like, we've hung out like 30 times, and you've not taken as I was like, yes, I did promise that and we will go on a date.
But can you do me one thing first?
24:09
It's like, that's like I got these contracts.
I haven't processed any of them because I'm a sales guy and like I don't do details.
But like I have all the credit cards and I'll show you how to do and she was like fine so zillion that, you know, two phone books of contracts later.
She like when she was like, I was like a hundred twenty five thousand dollars.
24:25
I was like dope right?
And she's like is that legal first question?
She asked, I'm still some dude from the internet you met at a frozen yogurt, you know, like whatever.
And I was like, yeah.
It's legal.
And she was like artemon and now is it?
So that's like Wolf of Wall Street.
24:41
Yeah.
Yes, Cuisine.
And now it's from like a month of sales sounds like and now it's just like riding my paws.
Like this is I like this.
This is way better.
So I told her I was like I want to do this like and all started was that guy?
24:59
Who's like, run, five grand.
Tell me what I get is like it was like, dude, this make way more money.
They forced you into it, you did.
And so anyways, I was like, alright, crazy, it was nuts.
And so I was like, all right, well, I'm gonna go see if I can other Gypsy.
I still had all those numbers from the business, the business So, I start calling these people up or whatever, and so, I start booking out, like launches, and she's like, all right, so she flies with me.
25:21
So my new now.
We're living together.
It's like 30 days.
She's living with me in a motel room and I'm teaching how to, like close this stuff.
But she wasn't to be fair.
Layla was number one salesman and in Triangle Square which is the most popular 24 Hour Fitness in California.
So she was the number-one salesman at the most that the most trafficked Jim like she could close.
25:39
She got skills.
Oh yeah.
And that's why I picture on the first date.
When she told me that I was like, if you can sell I was like, we can make a shitload of money.
Yeah, that's the first day.
And so, anyways, we start flying out and doing these launches, right?
And so she gets off her friends to quit her.
25:54
Quit their job and this is where the story goes wrong.
So I was like, okay, I don't want to put my attention, I've got these five gyms.
And so I sold those gyms and that first guy did the five thousand dollar thing was like, hey man, I think you leave a lot of money on the table because Like literally launching these gyms in you have no equity in these businesses is like I'm a really good operator.
26:15
He's like I'll come behind you and I'll just like staff them up.
So you just, you feel them, I'll staff them and you just do the next music.
We can open like to Jim's a month and my do because we didn't have to put any like real Capital down because we could, we could front it or whatever.
I was like, all right cool let's do it and lay those like I thought we were doing I was like oh yeah change of plans even though quit your job.
26:35
All good, right?
Leila stop.
Yeah it's so so I do this.
We go to the This, I sign this lease he's like, hey, I've got bad financial.
So like you're gonna have to personally guarantee it was like sure, no problem.
He's like, yeah.
In the build-out.
You know, you'll feel that wasn't a red flag to you there.
26:50
Yeah, yeah.
I'll tell you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so I heard, you know, where is god?
Well, I've had a couple of this.
Put all of it into the now, the new account.
Because I, that's what I thought you did.
I sold them and it's like, oh, yeah.
Well, he's my partner in this.
27:06
Yeah, makes sense, right.
I already know.
Yep.
And so I sell Ass off at this next launch because I'm like stoked I got rid of the 5 Jim's that I felt like free.
Like I had backpack you know like me and me and my voice and just like go collecting credit cards.
So 376 people in six weeks which is a lot like 600 pop, right?
27:28
And so there's cash from my sale and the cash from this to like watch this gym.
We couple morning all the cash is going and I was like, I was like what?
What happened here and he was like, I took my I half and I was like, what?
27:44
He's like, I know you've been skimming.
I was like I put them up skin for myself like what?
And so I was like, soap, I've never been accused of stealing ever - yeah, life's.
I was like, I don't even know how to handle this.
So I just called a mentor.
He's like, print out the bank statements and just go line by line with it was like.
28:00
That sounds reasonable.
I'll do that.
Yeah, so print out the bank statements and I like literally did the whole thing went and I drove over to where he was and as soon as I sat down to the thing, he just took he's like I don't need to see any push it off the table and I was like oh you don't actually think I stole it like as soon as he didn't want to look at the numbers.
28:17
It's like my yeah I'm taking I'm taking a shit and it's taken.
Yeah.
And so he he had wired the money to his girlfriend.
Who live in Sweden?
It was it was gone into Oblivion and he had been indicted for fraud, two years before that shocking.
28:35
Here's where the here's where the bacilli Alex part comes in.
I already knew that when I started my own business and he was like I was just a big misunderstanding.
I was like I believe you bro that's what a good heart does dude.
I've been Burn like that.
Same shit.
I would want a second.
I was like, you're not going to ruin for life.
28:50
You made it, you know?
Like it was a misunderstanding like you was a technicality but you know, whatever how much older was this guy than you?
The reasons for these?
Yeah, I was 26, right?
Yeah, dude.
I've been burned so many fucking times by that.
Same mentality.
That's same thing.
29:06
It's a good heart syndrome.
Well, no, dude, it's a second chance thing because it's like, dude, what it is is like, you know, like at least for me like I know that I'm not a perfect person.
I know that I've done a lot of things in my life where had just a certain thing gone in different way.
29:23
I would have ended up completely fucking different.
So when I see these people who have like made a mistake or they've, you know, serve jail time or whatever it is, and they're out and they're doing their thing, I don't really hold it against those people because I say, okay, well, they probably learned a lesson because I would have learned my lesson.
29:41
Yeah.
And then what ends up happening?
Is they learned their lesson?
Yeah, the Scorpion and the Frog.
Yeah.
Now you got to learn a lesson.
Yeah.
And that's like that I never.
I never liked it, never really dawned on me that whole saying like when money meets experience experience get the money in the money, gets the experience and but like, that's a good one.
29:58
Yeah, yeah, I heard that and I was like, that's what that was.
That's exactly what that was.
And so now I've got this gym that has payroll trainers lease and there's no cash and I had just sold my gyms, I was like, wait, I don't want to operate these gyms.
And he's like well you gotta manage that one now.
30:14
I was like I didn't go from five plus one, whatever you want to call.
This one said to go back to work in the front.
Like, I felt like I had like stuff.
I want to do these launches, whatever.
And so That's crazy because dude had that guy knockout ingredient.
How much fucking money could have made?
30:31
You don't say I'm like, dude.
And so what ended up happening is I basically whatever savings I didn't put into every like the vast majority of what I had I put into there but I couldn't sell any more which is the only thing that I'd ever known how to do really, really well.
And so I was like, I felt like neutered, like I had like handcuffs like I can't fight back because if I sell more, I have to keep this gym open and I don't want to keep this gym and so I drained my savings every week with payroll and rent, and over X.
30:58
I couldn't bring new cash in and all the things were prepayment.
So there was no new cash flow at all because that's how the, you know, the title watercycle work, right?
And so, It went down and in six weeks and I had to, you know, tell everybody like Hey we're actually closed until like you just launched this.
31:14
Tim, what do you like?
It was horrible and like Edge, like Leila.
I just gave her my checkbook.
And I was like, you have to write the checks?
Like, I can't like it.
Just yeah, just crushed me.
You know what I mean?
And so basically drained me down to think I'd 20. 20 ish thousand dollars left, so many, like, I had 56 Jim's.
31:35
I could I could crank cash by need to like all the way down to 20 something.
I was like and nothing coming in know and I just gave it up for years of my life building the gyms and I had nothing to show for it.
Yeah.
Like I had nothing for it.
After all that.
You know, effort sleeping on the floor.
I was like for another, right?
Yeah.
And so she was like for nothing except all the skills.
31:53
That's right.
And so we're now this is this is what's going on.
There's this launch that I got a guy in San Diego to do and a guy who had seen me speak at that conference or whatever.
Hit me up.
He's like, dude, do you have any sales work?
And I knew his pretty good sales guy was Like I got this gym in San Diego.
32:10
He's like that's right down the street from me and this is like a national like either.
They got, you know what, this might actually help me out because I can like, build all the shit I need to be building.
You go do that thing.
So this was going to be my get-out-of-jail-free card.
We launched the gym guy crushes.
It does 170,000 in sales.
32:27
I was like fuck.
Yeah.
And now I'm sleeping at laila's parents house, which is, yeah, this is when she, her parents are like, we're g - dude from the internet.
He's the guy quit.
Thinking move and live in motels with Dad winner.
This is my first.
32:43
Yeah.
So it's December now, right?
And some were 16 and so, he crushes this launch but I'm like, looking at my bank accounts like where's the fucking deposit?
Like a Tuesdays are my day Tuesday is always the big one because I got all the weekend and then it would all do it all settle.
33:01
I was like, where is this damn deposits, like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
So I called for, I was like hey what's going on?
They're like, oh we're doing a standard review of your account Out and I was like, I've been with you guys five years.
Like, I've never had a standard view.
Anyways, they're like just call it should be fine.
Next week is now going into Christmas Eve.
33:18
All right, so it's Christmas Eve now and I'd call it a couple of times.
They just gave me the runaround and I got on and I was like, I am not getting off the phone until you give me the money.
Like I need the money to pay the sales guy to run my business.
And this is the point where Layla had told, all of her friends, quit their job.
33:34
So, I have 23,000 dollars left.
I owe the sales guys twenty-two thousand dollars in commission.
He need it because he had a sob story new baby, blah, blah, blah, whatever.
And I hadn't gotten the money from the sales yet.
And so, I didn't want to give myself a chance to think about it until I wired him 22.
33:49
So I thousand dollars left.
This is the 24th Christmas Eve.
Her dad's like he seems a little stressed supposed to be a joyous event.
Oh yeah.
So, two days later, the 26th of December is which, basically, when Jim's kick The New Year sales done like the day after you just start because it's this dead week where everyone's got time and they feel fat.
34:10
It's like you crush sales, it doesn't are genius cause everybody's gonna do it.
Yeah.
So they're willing to pay for it now.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll pay today, I'll start entire what.
Exactly.
So and so the campaign's we're going to kick off with her six friends being the six sales guys because like big ambition, Alex was like, oh we're going to go from doing 12, doing six, make sense.
34:29
Let's do that as the first real thing we do, It was 3,300 a day in hotels are fair.
Car rental adspend Etc before commissions.
I had a thousand dollars left.
And that was starting 48 hours later because I was expecting to get the money that I never got.
34:47
I also, by the way, never got that money.
Still to this day.
Never got the body, but Klaus is policy.
Something they said they're gonna hold on to it for six months because it was a regular exercise.
Basically running my national launch thing through my local gym.
So like I'm processing stuff in Canada for a gyp out of likes.
35:04
They were right to do it.
I didn't know anything.
I just thought was like, yeah, you process money through the POS.
So, like, I'm running memberships at my gym that has more memberships than like any other gym, but no one's actually they're who anyways and so We do these that we start these launches and we start getting like 60, 80 contracts a day, I have no way to process money so I'm spending thirty three hundred a day and I can't make money.
35:27
I'm just getting all these credit cards, all these contracts, and I have nothing that I can do, so, all the way.
So, let's just like the 26th of December all the way to January 29th.
I don't have a processor because at this point if you get kicked off a processor it's like it's like a going to jail.
I remember that.
It's like, oh yeah it was a big deal.
35:43
You got a big black mark on hard to get another one.
Yeah those are used to only Be a few, a few processors.
Yeah this is if you frozen 1514.
Yeah.
And so and they had all the power.
There wasn't any?
Yeah.
And they were they didn't care either.
Oh yeah.
And I was like, they're like fuck you, what?
Yeah.
36:00
And so when you get big, it's different fucking tune.
Now they come in here and suck dicks to get our fucking business Canada.
That's fine.
And so it's it's one of these Crazy things that has a business.
36:18
You forget about but like if you cannot process money, you fought.
Like there's nothing you can do.
And so, anyways, I talked to everybody, I knew and got a porn Casino high risk, whatever guide to take my, take my money, right?
So they were gonna get like eight percent processing fee and then at they had a 10 percent reserve on top of that.
36:38
So like 18% of my sales went straight ten was held in escrow and then gets deposited six months later on a rolling basis and then eight percentage goes to them for the risk thinker.
I was like, whatever I need the money.
So 29th, I process these.
Oh, by the way, you only have a 50 thousand dollar limit.
I'm like, dude, I need so much more than that.
36:55
He was a tough.
I run. 50 is like, oh, but by the way, it's per month.
So like February 1st, he's like, you can run another 50.
So I ran 50 on January, 29th, 50 on February 1st and that was the hundred for the thirty three hundred dollars a day that I owed.
And I like my credit card was at zero, still was broke, but I was at zero and then got two or three more processors.
37:16
Got them going.
Then all of a sudden we're at like we did like 17 or 180 that next month and I made like 30,000 dollars in profit like looked a lot like thick.
We got out of hand, bring that out.
Yeah.
Next month comes Taps me on the shoulder one morning and I was like what's up?
She is like there's a problem was like what do you mean?
37:32
There's a problem she turns her laptop towards me and there's this like waterfall of - transaction.
She just keeps stroke scrolling as she's talking to me.
I was like holy shit in each.
One of these is like as big as my rent is 500. 600 bucks was like yeah my rent.
Yeah, and there's just hundreds of them and I was like I just felt like my stomach.
37:47
Mike drop.
And she was like, what is this?
He was, she was like, oh, one of the gym owners told all their members that we filled up at that gym to refund and sign up through him for half what we charged, because we held the processing risk, which is part of the issue with the first thing and so for charging you back.
38:05
Yeah, at this point.
Hmm.
And so this is how my new high risk projects.
Yeah.
They're just starting this rapport with the fucking yeah, right.
And so another guy, He that guy tells another guy or something happen, so, to Jim's, do this.
Hmm. 150,000 in refunds that I didn't have because I just now because, you know, the one guy fucking calls other guys and say, hey, this is what we're doing.
38:29
And so, because we would sell and we leave, and we go to the next gym.
They had all the customers and they built the relationship, which is a flaw in the model, you know?
I mean, like, I didn't get it yet.
Mind you, there are other gyms that were totally cool.
Really appreciative.
Awesome hard-working people like absolutely.
We did 30 something.
Launches, only two of them had that happen but like, their big deal.
38:46
We were big.
Yeah, they were all My profit.
And so I'm like, how the fuck am I going?
But kind of come up with 150 Grand in profit, not Revenue in the next 30 days.
And so Layla being a smart woman that she is took all for personal training.
Clients brought him online.
When she came with me to do this flying around the country thing and she's making like three or four thousand a month, I was like wait tell me more about that thing you do and she was like, it's all margin.
39:10
Yeah, I don't work that hard on it.
I was like, okay.
You're the business.
Now, I'm going to Market and sell it.
I'll bring the sales guys in, and we're going to push your thing.
So in, like, two days, I write a sale, a whole sales letter, we white label, everything to Queen transformation, and we start running ads, and she starts closing in 1000 bucks a day.
39:26
All profit was like, okay if we get a tin we can do eight thousand a day - adspend.
That's you know, like I'll be at 150 ish in profit like we could do this and so we start doing that.
So I'm going to call all the guys that all the gyms that were supposed to watch the next month.
So we had, I think eight gyms are supposed to launch the next, the next, you know, the next month, And I get on the phone with the first guy was like, hey, I'm getting out of business themselves straight to, you know, straight to Consumer, like, new chapter, sorry, and they didn't really pay me anything, because I made my money on the sales, right?
39:53
And he was like, dude, I just refinance my house like you did this from a buddy of mine.
I know you can do it.
Like, I need your help whole thing and finally, I was like, dude, I'm not find out there.
He's like fine.
Okay, can you just show me what you did at his place so I can do it here.
40:11
I was like All right.
Fine.
He's like, well, how much?
And I remember, just knowing you was broke.
And so I just picked a really high number.
Hi, sir.
I could think of just, so he just say no.
And I can just like move on with my life because the other thing was working.
So I was like, six thousand dollars which I know that sounds ridiculous now, but that was like, yeah, it would pay six thousand dollars from, right?
40:30
Yeah.
And he was like, 6K.
I was like, yeah, six thousand dollars US and he was like, oh done.
I just remember, like, looking at the code. you just do you because I was like and he was like, I was like Next call, same thing, 10 grand done next thing next call.
41:14
Same things just to teach them how to do was show.
Yeah, I was gonna license in my whole thing.
So I was like, no use my ad.
So like we have to test shit.
Like, it's a video of my Works doing.
Yeah.
Like every like the whole thing and I already built 80% of it.
This is my internal training, like how I train my sales.
Like all the sales training was done all the nutritious, all the stuff was done.
41:32
The only thing that wasn't to them was how I ran the ads in the landing pages.
That was the only thing that was like missing that I had to build so many ways in one day at 60.
Thousand dollars like cash collected, selling air, and Leila have been on the phone all day.
Closing because she still closing the weight loss and then like she's trying to like give us food.
41:49
Yeah, and she comes in, I was like, hey, babe, Was that a sale?
It seems like that was like, I think we might have had a change in Direction.
She's like, what are you taught?
Like and mind.
You think about how what she's been through?
This is you already know we're here here here.
42:06
It's like, she's like I was like I think we're still in the gym business.
Like I think I was just doing it wrong and she was like, what do you mean?
And I like told her and she was like well is this what we're going to do now?
And I was like I guess so I was like it made a lot more money than the other thing and it's like I think we could cover all the refunds with this and she's like why are going to get Jim's also?
42:23
Clive 30-something did we're too, did the So, call those guys out there, you know, it works.
And so that's what I did.
So, I called all those guys up and sold, almost all of them into the thing.
We did like, 300,000 like, in profit.
There's, I think, is 215.
Remember those 215 that next month and I covered all the, all the chargebacks, all the refunds, everything, and what happened now is that, all those gyms that I did, the turnaround thing with, they ran the play, and the average amount of cash.
42:49
They collected new cash in the first 30 days of using the system was thirty thousand dollars.
So, Constant average, that is the average.
Yeah.
So for context or one's listening, the average micro gym owner likes it, that CrossFit guy down the street, he's probably broke that.
You know, where that boot camp owner, like I'm telling you Rashad.
43:05
He's yeah, the average owner takes home, thirty six thousand dollars a year, net income and they work 80 hours a week plus, I mean, like, it's less than minimum like it's yeah.
Anyhow.
So for them, this was life changing one, right?
43:21
And that was the next month they could do the play again.
You could relaunch your gym, the problem that they started.
Jews are like, dude, my gyms for, I want to sell more people, my jumps when I was like, that's why I started a launching go models.
I had, I was, I had more ability.
I had more Firepower to sell and Market than I had square footage to sell into mmm.
And so from there because it's too tight, knit Community for microderm owners and then the word of mouth just took off like wildfire.
43:44
We did 300 for 8780.
A million 12, 15 18 to 23 25 that was that was per month.
The next like, Each month, I can still remember it.
And we finished that year that like, which is really just a half of the year because it was like, January, I'm still doing the launch of thing that got all fucked up.
44:05
So like, June issue is when that we'd switch the licensing.
So we finished that year at 6.8 with three million in profit and the next full calendar year.
We did after that was 26 million, Top Line 17 million ibadah.
Yeah, and it was just like, I know, it's crazy knots.
You know what, you know what I hear when I hear this because obviously, I'm thinking like as you speak.
44:26
I'm think, like, dude, you talking about like, the credit card processing, like we've had those issues of same, all of that shit.
But dude, the main theme.
I think that people need to pull, from what you just said for, you guys that are out there and and you tell me what you think.
44:42
But I know this My best shit comes.
When that's my back is against the fucking wall, bro.
Like, like the ability to somehow my brain, I'm sure yours must work the same way.
When shit is really fucking bad as where the Brilliance comes out.
44:59
And, you know, sometimes it takes that pressure man.
Sometimes it takes that real pressure to really think and also push us into the positions that were meant to be in, you know, I that's an incredible Story.
I mean, one thing that I got A lot of.
You just you just kept showing up like you just don't fucking stop.
45:18
Just don't know bro.
Yeah when you got to pay back 150 fucking Grand like what do you do?
You gotta show the fuck I figured out otherwise like at that level that ruin your life, that'll ruin your whole.
Even thinking of it from the standpoint I have to keep reminding myself while you're talking like he's fine, he was fucking 26.
45:34
Yeah 26 he's 26 like and thinking like you know the day and age.
There were in right now in society.
I can't think of another twenty six-year-old that would fucking be able to To do it.
I can't think of a 36-year old that what you know I'm saying?
Like I'm like, listen, what separates that mentality from?
45:51
Just not fucking quitting.
What is the separator?
I've two cents on it.
Yeah, just for the record.
I do think that there are some Savages out there.
Yeah, I agree, whoever it but you just don't you don't really recognize look dude, nobody knew who Alex Hermos.
46:07
He was when he was doing Alex her Mosey building Alex from Rosie.
Nobody fucking knew.
Nobody knew Andy for seller was when he was learning the shit like nobody fucking knew.
There's plenty of people out there right now that are fucking especially with the technology that we have.
That are 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 years old, that are fucking say, Savage motherfuckers and do.
46:27
This is why I go so hard on the technology.
I'm like dude do not get yourself funnel into a one-trick pony where, you know?
Because what you've done well and this is this is a very this year.
The example of the of what I try to tell these young Young Bucks is like look dude you yes you do Facebook ads yes you know e-comm yes you know that's a tool that's not the brand and if you can like what Alex has done is leveraged his one tool and too many.
46:55
SATs in The Branding that now he's doing.
We're going to get to that now, doing amazing shit with but, dude, I love hearing that school.
I fucking love it because it's very, very parallel, dude.
Very parallel, man.
I think a lot of times the cuz it depends who you talk to, but sometimes people talk about how, like, the hard times build you, but I'm not sure if I totally agree.
47:17
I think a lot of times the hard times reveal you like I think a lot of people had that Savage that's inside and they just haven't had the Moment to to pull it out to pull it out.
Yeah.
And then give themselves evidence that it's there.
Yeah.
But like to your point we were saying earlier like I knew just on like whatever whatever the level that is it like I didn't know when I would be successful, but I did know that I wasn't going to stop.
47:44
Like I feel like that I don't have that that comes off the way takes away.
I'm just so, you know, I understand what you mean.
Yeah, I just knew I'd like, I was like, I, I just know.
I won't stop doing that.
I can commit to.
I was like I just won't stop when I was growing up.
47:59
Dude.
Like when you were growing up like as a kid, were you ambitious around like making money and stuff like entrepreneurial minded?
No really really.
But what I did want to do is make my dad proud.
Yeah.
And so that was my, you know, driving force and then you know I won't I won't get into the the nitty-gritty but basically like I think either have to have a really big carrot, which everyone talks about, like finding your passion.
48:24
And whatever.
And like I actually am pretty against it and I'll make my point a second, but like I think that most people who are like in the beginning of the game like you don't have a passion yet most of you like most people are like man I just love this one thing but everybody has shitloads of pain like that.
48:43
Like I probably can't find passions.
I can you find pain.
No like yep I got lots of that.
I got angry, I got champagne, whatever it is my cool.
Well the first rule of Entrepreneurship is use what you got.
And so like if that's what you got, then burn that, yeah, like you don't need to necessarily find this passion like this beautiful carrot because that to me that's not what got me going.
49:01
That's not me.
Going was the mission of Jim won't?
Don't be broke Alex.
That was the mission of just like you're like what was the big vicious?
Like I had no vision.
It was like don't fucking lose all my money like that was the whole Vision.
Yeah and so all that all that to say like For me, I think it was like, a away from Fear, which is like, I, I was, I knew like in my bones that I would rather die than go back home like failed.
49:26
And then have to like, basically do whatever and your option mentality, give more options.
My dad died.
I knew that like it was the hardest thing for me to leave home because like, my dad a lot of influence and I say this in on a bad way like he just wanted what was best for me.
It's strong relation father.
I had no siblings basically no Mom.
So it's just me and him and so like, imagine all of the authority power that you have in your life and all All the love that you have for your siblings are just with one person.
49:48
So like his opinion mattered, a lot to me and he did not want me to do this.
And so like I defied him to go do this, Jim thing and I was afraid, which is why I left and didn't tell him till I was already physically gone, which obviously he wasn't happy about and like that.
Kind of put a little bit of a rift our relationship for a long time.
50:06
But like, I just was, like, I won't.
I just like, I don't want to prove him, right?
I was like, I'm not going to let him be right about this, like, I will just keep fucking going and I almost was happy if we Talk because I was like, it just gives me more time to keep doing.
I don't want to update him because I was fucking sucking.
Yeah, yeah, losing money.
50:22
I agree with you.
Like I think there's a lot of heat about this for a long time till people figured out who I was but like you know, when I started making content, like they got recognized back in like 2015, Everybody thought I was fucking insane because I would talk about like the dark side, right?
50:41
Like dude like listen I'm going to shove it down your fucking throat.
Like that's what the fuck I'm going to do.
I'm going to fucking do that forever.
Like and I still I'm still that way.
Like I just don't talk about it that way anymore.
Like now when I see someone sale you're not you're crazy like you're not going to build the next Nike your motherfucker just sit there and watch like you've been watching for the last 20 fucking years.
51:02
Give me another 20 and we'll see where the fuck I am.
You know I'm saying, like I have no problem with that.
That and I feel like the use what you got is what's got me here?
You know, now I do feel like when you get to a point of where you have to, you have to manage many humans, hundreds of humans, thousands of humans.
51:23
There has to be a, there has to be a mission, and a purpose to motivate and, and Propel people in that direction.
Like if I walked into my meeting and I said, well fuck, we're fucking Crush every like that was it like Everybody's like, yeah.
But like, who like so, you know, and I do feel like there's a feel like, you know, there's a point to where that transitions right honey.
51:50
But but dude, I totally agree.
And I agree with the with your perspective on the revealing to I think there's a little about their I think the hard times definitely like dude that whole time, right?
That did build you right bro?
Because look at all the Reps and all the skills you learn.
52:05
Right respect.
They used Carried through.
Yeah.
And I bet, you know, you probably learned more during that time than probably any other time.
I know for me, that was true, you know, I learned more the first 12 or 13 years, I was in business where I really got my ass beat.
Then I've learned in the last, you know, 12 or 13.
52:25
But I do think that's true.
Dude, I do think a lot of people don't put themselves in a position to ever truly know what?
They're actually capable of.
Love it.
Quit to are very well are or they're just too too.
Afraid of the discomfort, you know.
52:42
Like like I think people tend to look at risk the wrong way like a lot of people say well what's going to happen if I do this?
And I think the question really is what's going to happen if I don't do this.
I've always thought that way.
That's how I always think like, yeah, if I get a big idea in my head that I think needs to happen and it scares me.
53:00
My question is never like, what am I going to lose if I go after it?
It's what's going to happen to me.
If I don't do it, it's always been that way.
But I think there's wait.
I think you look at it both ways.
Yeah, you know, that entire Story is so it's just so relatable to what I've been through to be where we are.
53:19
It's just it's fucking cool to sit here and listen to it.
I want to do the guy.
So the first the older gentleman that fucks you did he like whatever happened to him nothing.
Now he's just easy jobs continues to do what he did then.
Yeah bro sometimes you gotta chalk those things up to dude.
53:35
Like because like you got to just chalk because I've been burned like that too.
Yeah.
And you know real talk like okay.
I'm not going to say what I was going to say because like those people don't get away from me, so, but Wait you can't let it eat you up man.
53:55
Can't let a fucking eat you up.
You got to look at it as what I learned.
Yeah.
And when you when that when you fucking when you said, I forgot what you said, exactly, but you said something about him, not are doing this in the past or something like I'm like, oh, here we go.
54:17
You do it?
Yeah, it's brutal.
People are brutal, dude.
Yeah, I don't give a fuck, especially when it's large sums of money involved or perceive large sum of money, you know?
And you can tell a lot about people to what they, how they judge Larson's of money, like, that guy's a fucking idiot, because had he fucking hat.
54:34
He stuck with Alex this.
Guy would be worth a hundred fucking million dollars right now or more.
No you know I'm saying are way more.
So anyway, so what happened after this it's to the point you know, I had a mentor that I was just kind of like talking my life threw at this point which was like in shambles and he was like all you do is do right by everyone.
54:57
He's like and then he's like the only way you can walk out of this is by knowing that you don't have any strings in the back, your mind of like something's going to come back.
He's like you have to write every one of those refund check.
If you'd handle every charge back, he's like pay every dead or whatever.
You know, I like everybody you, oh, he's like, he's like, he's in your walk out clean as I guess, the only way you can get, you can get out of it.
55:16
And so, that's, that's what we did during that.
That's when I, you know, gave Layla checkbook and all that kind of stuff.
And then I had a different mentors.
Actually, my high school was 15 years old, but it was always this like less than he is.
I was like, I, I'm sure like many of us like when you're younger little angrier, right?
Let's get really pain of about some guys who I thought were like douchebags to me and I was like, man, I can't Wait to come back for our 10-year Highschool reunions.
55:38
I was like, I'm going to show them like, blah, blah, blah.
And he's like, no, you're not.
Yeah, he's like, if you go up to somebody at a 10-year, Highschool reunions, you say, like, look what I've done motherfucker.
He's like, they're gonna be like, you've been thinking about me this whole time.
Yeah, he's like you.
So just remember this use, like success is the only Revenge, that's right.
55:55
And like, he's like and all you do is like, is you just become bigger than them?
He's like, so that who they are in reference to you shrinks into a relevance.
Yeah, he's like so you don't he's like, you don't crush them.
He's like, you shrink them in comparison to you.
He's right?
And that was like that.
Like whenever I had like these cards hard situations, like with that, you know, with that gentleman, like, the goal was like, I'll just be so big that he will become irrelevant.
56:16
Yeah.
And so I that's at least how how I handled it.
56:33
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
56:52
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.








0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, strategies a big.
Fluffy amorphous word that gets tossed around a lot and no nose of the fucking means, but it's probably important.
And in my opinion is the most important.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:46
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and Buffett a document to their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
Okay, what is up everyone pumped?
Okay, so like my new swag, I'm wrapping a little bit.
1:04
Okay, so I'm going to do something different than I normally do for any kind of talks because I was thinking about this and I was like, all right like how can I get everyone there to make the most possible money leaving the event, right?
And so I kind of structured this a little bit like many Tick-Tock videos back to back to back and so if you Like or not interested in something that I'm talking about for a moment.
1:30
Wait, five minutes, that's how I'm going to structure this today, and rather than do slides, which is normally what I do actually want to draw the stuff live with you.
And I think it's more engaging that way because if you've ever seen like a math problem on a board and it's just like all done versus like someone walking through the math, it like sinks or hits different.
1:53
That's at least the theory.
And if it sucks, you can tell me at the end.
All right.
Cool great.
Okay so I was originally asked to talk about branding on social media, I will talk about brand for about five minutes and the main reason for that is because I don't think it's going to make you more money.
2:11
So I'm going to be G hijacking.
The other 55 minutes of my talk to more shit that I think will make you money.
Then talking about social media branding and that may sound conflicting with how I am doing things, but it's more about context.
So everyone here, who here owns a brick-and-mortar Jim.
2:30
Can I just get like a show of hands?
Wonderful.
Okay.
Here's my quick thing on brand and then I'll get to all the stuff I'm gonna draw so big picture.
Brand isn't actually a thing.
It's an association.
2:45
We make between things that we know and things that people don't know, which is usually our company.
And so, if you think about a brand like a bouquet of flowers, right?
At the little flowers, these are my flowers, a bouquet of flowers.
Thank you.
You're going to love the rest of the presentation.
3:03
A bouquet of flowers isn't actually a thing.
It's many things put together and then we put it in our heads as an idea as one But it doesn't, it's not actually anything because you spilled on the floor, it's not a bouquet anymore, right?
And so when we brand think of a brand as a bouquet of flowers but it's your bouquet of flowers and what you're putting inside of that bouquet are the individual intangible ideas that you want to associate together with the thing that people don't know about, which is usually our company, right?
3:31
And so, if I were to say some things about my brand, you probably know that I have the best calves ever, right?
So that would be something that's like associated with my brand, they're probably be some things like dessert, that's something that's associate with my brand.
3:46
Now those are like fun little doodads but hopefully some of the things that you really associate with my brand are giving first providing value, being patient doing the boring work, but ever doing BlahBlah, right dot dot dot.
And so there are these intangible things that we associate.
4:04
And the thing is is that like if I were standing on stage next to let's say, Who owns a brothel and a drug dealer?
You would associate my brand with that.
And so you think differently, like the bouquet would look different and the reason brand and reputation is so hard to maintain is because so many people want to rub their shit on yours because if as soon as yours gets better they want to associate there's with yours which is the right move for them to make but it gets harder and harder for you to make to get them to not do that because they continue to dilute and not really do.
4:38
Because you don't actually dilute anything.
You just make more associations that are with what you want to do.
All right, so let me give you an idea here.
So let's say, here's my bouquet and I've got this sad flower.
So this is a sad face flower.
There's my sad flower.
4:54
If I handed my wife, this bouquet all of the Roses are perfect.
And there's this one.
This just wilted and dead.
It looks a lot different, right?
The bouquet, the brand, the perception of it massively.
If Steven with one fucked-up flour.
5:10
And so thats why creating a brand is much more about cultivating deliberately, the association's you want to make with the thing.
You have that, people don't know with the things that your ideal audience likes that you want them to like to does that make sense, seeing some head nods.
5:27
And so if you have a clean gym, people start to associate your gym, with the intent will idea of being claimed, right?
If you have really friendly people, they'll start associating smiley faces.
Has recognized in their name when they walk in the door with the brand which in the beginning, they don't know what it is.
5:44
The name is meaningless to them but we create the meaning by associating with the things that we know that they like.
And that is the process of branding done at scale and you do it over and over and over and over right now we put out 250 pieces of content a week and in six months, we'll probably get a thousand a week.
6:02
In terms of, we're going to be putting out, and it's just an absolutely brutal.
Violent process to get as many people as possible to remember one or two things about you, does that make sense?
Now let me tell you, it doesn't probably make sense for you.
6:19
You probably can't do that.
Which is why I talked to kill before I got up here the brand that you're going to build in a local community is going to be based on the quality of your product, and your service your reputation is going.
6:38
To be based on that.
And so if you feel like you want to strengthen your brand strengthen the product, you don't need to make a video on Instagram every day talking about fat and carbs because real talk, you're not going to be better.
Most likely then the hottest chick on planet Earth, talking about the same thing in terms of reach and the thing is and here's the double-edged sword, let's say you are amazing at it.
7:01
If you do that, what's going to happen is that you're going to get more Demand on your personal brand and online.
Instead of people who Live close to you that your that will be of Greater business opportunity for you than a single local location.
And so, then you're going to have a choice and many of you probably have done this.
7:17
Well, I've got someone like clients.
I've got something person clients and it's totally spread thin.
I do what the fuck I'm doing right?
Real Talk, anyone just resonate, right?
Okay.
And so that's why it's really about focusing on the one opportunity that's going to give you the highest Roi which is going to be the remainder of the time that I'm gonna be talking today, all right?
7:36
And so I was asked to talk about social media.
And branding, I think that for most local businesses, the brand is going to be about the reputation.
The reputation is going to be built on consistently meeting expectations.
Now, the thing is we always talk about over-delivering and I've even talked about over delivering, but I think a lot of times I think about this and the real real is that most people just can't even meet expectations because we sell so hot.
7:58
And so if you could just meet the perception that this person has the excitation, they have of the, the service that they're going to get you already want.
Make promises, keep promises.
Make promises keep promises.
And if they will like the first promise you made them and you keep it, they'll be with you forever, okay?
That was Brandt.
8:16
So if you were like, I don't care about brand, welcome to the next Tick.
Tock.
All right.
So these are the topics that I want to hit on today.
So we start with a little exercise, I'm going to call it the magic wand, all right?
So right now if I have a magic wand or you have magic wand and you wave it and you get to make as much money as you want, alright?
8:37
So, write down or put at least think about it in your head.
What number that would be per month, okay?
How much money are you making per month?
Okay, hopefully doesn't take too long to think of a number.
Now, who here currently is making that amount of money.
8:52
Please raise your hand, wonderful.
We have just done is stablished the gap between where you are and where you'd like to go fantastic.
So here's you, here's goal that we all just established Now, in scenario 1, you have these goals, right?
9:15
And there's all of these different ways of getting there, right?
And the problem is you're like, which one do I do before?
I explain more on that scenario?
Two is I don't know what to do to get to there.
Let me tell you how these feel.
9:32
This one feels like anxiety. so, if you feel stressed or you are overwhelmed about which thing you should do, That's this.
If you don't know what to do, you're at a loss, you feel hopeless?
9:48
Because you're like I don't know what the fuck to do.
Like I don't know, I don't know what to do and it's not about picking.
It's like you don't even know where to start.
And this has been really important for me to identify if I feel anxiety.
It's because, I don't know which thing to pick, if I'm feeling sad, it's because I feel hopeless.
10:04
I'm like, okay, Help Us in this means, I have a lack of choices.
Have a lack of choices.
Means I am ignorance around this topic.
Okay, this It's it's solvable.
So then I can start solving for, I need a path, so that I know what to do.
So only think I know me personally, that's what makes me sad is.
If I don't know what to do, I get sad.
10:21
Is this resonating with anyone here?
Okay.
So that's take talk to this.
One was about figuring out which thing to do, this is about figuring out what to do.
So when you're deciding, which thing to do, this is a clear case of lack of strategy.
10:43
All right, now strategy is a big fluffy amorphous, word that gets tossed around a lot and no nose of the fucking means.
But it's probably important in my opinion is the most important but I'm going to Give you a different definition for this to make it a little bit more useful.
10:59
Okay, strategy is just prioritizing.
It's all this.
They like whenever you hear someone say we have to figure out our strategy just means we have to figure out our priorities soul mates.
And in layman's terms it's what's going to get us the most bang for the buck.
11:16
If you want the fancy definition that I have.
It's how you choose to allocate resources.
That are limited against unlimited options, that is strategy. and the tough part about this about strategy in general is that when you're looking Here you have all these options strategy is figuring out.
11:37
Actually there's one.
That's right here.
That takes us off the page because the most costly thing in business isn't just the unknowns, but it's the unknown unknowns.
As in the things that you didn't even know you could pick from.
Let me give you three examples example.
Number one we had a company.
11:53
So the first investment we made, I was still, I still owned 100 percentage amount of this point.
It was a photography company.
And so this photography company at a single location and the owner had an agency to help photography owners and he was like, I want to do what you did with Jim's with photography was like, okay. and so the more I got to know him, the more I learned about the business I was like, nah, I don't think we should do that because I'll tell you the stats around it.
12:18
So he's like, well, it caught, you know, I charge five grand and it's like, okay, well what is the average photography studio add in Revenue after using your thing said 400,000 year?
I was like so they add four hundred thousand a year and he's like yeah I was like in your charging say it again, he's like five thousand dollars.
12:33
So it's like okay let's not do that anymore.
And I was like does it cost less than four hundred thousand dollars to make?
And mighty that was added Revenue, not total, his was doing.
Millions and I was like, okay, how much does it cost to start one of these things?
Like not a ton.
I was like, haha.
12:50
Crazy idea here is like what if we do them all?
And so that's what we did two and a half years ago.
Now we have 77 individual Studio locations, in terms of rooms where you take pictures and that business went from a million and a half, a year to two and a half million a month in that time, period point.
13:11
The reason I bring this up is that it wasn't a move that was on the board because like, how do I grow this agency?
How do I turn this into a coaching thing?
I was like, no, Like you have a business model that has amazing Returns on Capital.
Let's just do a ton of them right now is operationally, simple.
13:27
We can centralize a lot of the stuff, which is different than like a Jim.
Jim is lot harder, decentralized.
Thanks more decentralized.
So I show this to say that right now.
If my goal here is to make you guys as much money as humanly possible the time, I'm done my 46 minutes, then if I can just get you to make the one chess move that will make you the most money, then it will Roi everything you do this year, or maybe the next five years because fundamentally people People don't actually move faster than other people like you see me walk.
13:53
I sound like I'm hyperactive.
It's that you get more for each step when you are more strategic, when you have better priorities and you allocate your resources, time money, energy into the fewest moves that gets you the most bang for the buck, you make the most money.
14:11
Hey, guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand.
Five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents and Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
14:26
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
So back to this you guys when you're different example.
14:43
So we had a we have a PR Company that we bought that was selling 100 units a month of PR services and they did decent decent business.
Really good marketer.
So so delivery but I really like the founder and so we drove into the data and it looked like 85% of the business has turned out within two or three months, which is horrendous fifteen percent of the customers paid the most and stayed the longest and they Were different.
15:11
I was like, wow.
That is what if we stop selling these 85% and only sell these 15 and cater our stuff.
To only them use like that would kill my business.
Mind, you recurring theme of the first one?
When I told him to shut his agency down, he had to go to zero and then built the next thing.
15:29
And for nine months he was basically 80ish, hard, like tough, very simple to say very hard to do good.
If you guys imagine give two locations as like, hey, I can help you get there for a year again.
Have to make no To go, but you do play long game, right?
And he was willing to do that, and that was me, talking to him off a cliff every week.
15:47
They like, hey, man, we're gonna get there.
And so, with this individual, with the pr, we he cut 85%, we catered the messaging, and we made it way more Niche down to this specific Avatar and we 10x the price, and now we sell more units than we did before we 10x the company strategy, rather than thinking, okay, what am I going to do to just get more now?
16:10
Now, there's always a time for more.
Believe me.
Violence is the answer, big fan.
Alright, of brutal Relentless effort, but we want to make sure that we're capturing the most per unit of effort.
And so the equation for this is volume times leverage equals output which means the more times you do something and the more the more you get for each time you do it, the more you get, ultimately.
16:33
Now if you're a lazy motherfucker, guess what?
You better have a shitload of Leverage.
Now, you can be lazy and still make tons of money.
You just have to have lots of Leverage.
You got to be really strategic in the moves.
You make the more activity you have.
The more you can let a little bit of that violence humble work for you, but it ends up becoming a cap soon enough.
16:54
Because at the end of the day, we only have X amount of hours.
And if you want to do big shit, you need a lot of other people's hours to work for you, which is a form of Leverage.
Okay?
So, One moment, different style Tick-Tock versions.
All right, a little, stop and go.
17:09
Okay, got that we got that.
I'll give you a third one.
So we need a company that is an association of trying to keep it vague.
Let's call it dentists.
Association of dentists, they had Data Business that like the glob, all the savings together of all the dentist and that they would charge less than all of them saved with the Vomit of buying power, right?
17:35
So if you save 30,000 Algiers a dentist, they would charge 10 super sticky model great business and so he's like, hey I think I could sell this thing for 20 or 30 million and Like how many dentists do you have there?
It's like, I don't know. 500 like and they all run the same systems.
17:52
It's like, yeah, it's like what's the average dentist make like per unit second 500,000 as like wild idea?
What if we take 10 every year, bundle them up and sell them from 100 million every year?
18:09
Get 20%, give 80% of them.
I mean, she'll write like, then you get your exit every single year.
And then If you want to sell it, we exit the machine that does Roll-Ups because in that you've roll-up machine does 20 or 30 million a year in profit and we get 10x on that.
18:24
Now, you have a 300 million dollar exit rather than a 25 million-dollar year.
There's like that sounds better.
I'm with you.
I agree, strategy prioritizing.
What?
Move will get me the most for the effort I put in all right now this is a perfect transition to you're like, okay, that sounds very pie-in-the-sky.
18:43
So Next Tick, Tock theory of constraint.
So everything that we do at acquisition.com and the approach that we have with growing, any business is spending a lot of effort to try and identify the constraint of the business because every single business is constrained, there's one thing that is limiting its growth.
18:59
So right now, and here's the fucked-up part, many of who here works, all the hours of the day, like most of ours are awake, okay?
Half of you, if your business is not growing as fast as you want it to, you are working on the wrong stuff.
If it has stayed the same and you're spending all your time, working on it, you're not going to get more hours so you're doing the wrong shit.
19:23
So it means that you have not properly identified, the constraint of the business.
So I'll give you an example of this.
We had a media company that came to us, big YouTubers, 40 million plus subscribers and they were like, hey like, what's the goal?
They're like, we want to make money.
I like cool, love it.
19:39
Great goal.
So they're like, we think that we need to create a better.
Media machine it's like OK.
They're like we need to really systematized this and do it better.
It's like okay, how are you monetizing AdSense?
By the way, very inefficient.
19:55
Way to monetize.
Okay?
And so they're like, I think we're I think this is, these are all the things we need to do to eliminate our constraint for our production.
Cool.
It's like have you thought of?
Well idea, maybe we just like the constraint of the business is that you don't have something to sell.
20:12
I was like, you're like a 97 out of 100 on media and your 0 out of 100 on shit to sell.
And you're trying to talk about how to get to a 99, rather than like, if we just went from zero to 20, we would probably make you ten times more money than you currently making.
And so that is an idea of the theory of the constraint, right?
20:29
Like the constraint of that business was not media and many of you, the constrain your business not making better, fucking work outs.
Right?
It's not the constraint.
It's not the train, right?
That's not the constraint.
And so right now, if you spend all your day working on shit that doesn't move the ball working on the wrong shit.
20:47
So let me tell you how we do it so that hopefully you can too.
So, one of the questions I like to ask is why can't we 10x this business?
Like why can't we?
And sometimes asking that question and then it becomes really apparent, what the problem is.
21:03
And the answer is sometimes, what we were just To hire all these people.
It's like, well then let's fucking do that, right?
And so here is how we transition into the tactics around this.
So this is the actual first part of my planning process prioritizing process strategy, process, whatever shoe fits you for figuring out what we're going to do with a company that we're going to grow.
21:27
So when we're thinking about all the objectives, all the things we could potentially do, it has to map to one of these three objectives.
Which is 1.
How is this thing that we're going to spend time money effort on going to get us more customers to?
How is this thing going that we're going to spend time money and effort on get us increased.
21:47
LT GP make them worth more or three.
How is the time energy Etc.
Going to decrease the risk that this does not continue to happen in the future which is another way of translating.
How do we increase the Enterprise Value overall?
So for example if you do all of this stuff that's great Still really risky because if you die, the business dies.
22:09
Now, if we have to hire someone to do the same thing as you is it going to get more of either of these probably not.
Will it make the thing more valuable?
Absolutely.
That makes sense.
So I'm going to segue briefly.
We're going to side quest.
Imagine two people.
22:26
Five million Top Line, five million, Top Line, 2 million, and bottom line, 2 million, bottom line.
This guy is single owner runs, every all the day-to-day has lots of minions known with real brains and they just do what he says.
Okay?
22:42
If this person dies, the business dies, this guy has a team that runs the whole thing, and he makes two million dollars in income from the business, but it doesn't require him.
Who's richer?
This guy question is, how much richer a lot this guy because he doesn't have to do.
23:00
Anything means that somebody else could also not have to do anything and also collect the two million dollars a year, which means his thing is probably worth, depending on what type of industry is in 10 15 sometimes 20 million dollars.
And so, when this guy, here's where the leverage comes in, they go, if you go from 2 million a year to three million a year in income, he just added 10 million dollars to his net worth.
23:21
This guy is concerned about all of the tax evasion strategies because he's trying to maximize Zinc home and forgetting.
The fact that the asset is the thing that's going to build us net worth.
This took me a really long time to learn an absurdly long time.
Everything I did was all about like how do I take the income?
I have be more efficient With It.
23:36
Bubba, Bubba, blah.
When it's really like, you become wealthy from the shit you own.
Not the shit you do.
So, everybody here has a business.
And right now, many of the businesses in this room are not valuable.
No one would buy them because it's really just you with some helpers.
And so the idea is that we have to transition and this is a skill that is worth getting because no matter You do for the rest of your entire career, you're going to need people.
23:57
You need to have the skill of hiring recruiting, training, onboarding, managing Talent.
Who here has one amazing Superstar person who works for you.
Cool.
Imagine if you had four of them at your one location, how easy would life be right?
You make a ton of money.
24:14
Here's it's fucking crazy.
The difference is small businesses and big businesses is how many players they have and so what happens is most small business owners hire a lot of people get lucky One sticks actually works their ass off at a fair rate and you're like, man if I had six more Sandra's, right, I'd be good to go.
24:33
The thing is that big business owners maintain a higher level or a lower tolerance for mediocrity.
And so they actually do keep looking until they find six Andres and then it does become too easy for them to kill it because I got 600.
How could I lose?
That's the idea.
24:49
Make sense.
Oh God this took me a long time to learn like I would just put up with people who are Mediocre.
And right now many of you have a think of somebody who's mediocre on your team.
Actually I make it easier.
Think about that person that you thought about today, who you shouldn't have thought about.
Because if they're not making you money, you're not sleeping with them.
25:05
Don't think about them first thing in the morning.
All right, so Anybody have somebody in mind?
So if you have that person in mind that person is taking up 25% of your bandwidth, what a cost, right?
And probably many of you the biggest lever of growth is on the other side of a few hard conversations.
25:27
I now talk to portfolio CEOs all the time and it is incredibly clear, the people who will win and the people who will not is simply based on their ability to confront discomfort.
And it's interesting because as they mostly, uh, that's a kind of 50/50 actually audience.
25:43
Between male and female, but a lot of guys beat their chests.
I can cold plunge.
I can run a long time without stopping.
Whoo, that's lots of weight.
But you can't just say, hey man, I think you suck a little bit rail, can't do it.
25:59
And for that reason, they suffer for fucking decades because they can't fire Sarah, not Sandra Sandra stud, right?
Can't fire, Sarah.
It's like, yeah, I know she slept with another clients but like, I mean, I think our hearts in the right place, it's like whenever you're one of your qualifying that someone's hearts in the right place and deep down, they're good person because it's obvious, they suck.
26:20
Bright.
Hit a nerve on that one.
So right now do me a favor, write down the name of the person that you know you need to get back to and start what we call a performance Improvement plan just you got 14 days to fix your shit or get out.
26:37
And many of you can't even have the conversation because you're too much of a fucking pansy.
Real talk and this will keep you poor seriously.
Like yeah, like you gotta grow up, gotta be able to have hard conversations.
26:53
You're like, hey my biggest my biggest piece of advice for this is, you know, the shit you say about Sarah while you're here behind Sarah's back.
God.
She's just like, she's been slipping lately.
You know what I mean?
Like, she's not showing up on time.
She's not cleaning up after the classes.
27:08
She's short with the clients I to people complain about her, right?
Say that to her that's it.
Just think about what you'd should talk and just say it to them.
It's just the truth.
Just say to him, see what happens.
One of two things either they're like, fuck, I've had my head up my ass.
27:26
That's why it's been so dark.
All right.
You're totally right.
Thank you.
Pull it out, right?
And all of a sudden, they've a total 180 that happens.
Like, one out of five times.
Four out of five times.
You say these are the things that you have to do, they either say I won't do that or they say sure I'll try and we both know, they're not going to and then you elegantly exit them from the business.
27:50
The problem is that right now, Sarah teaches, like six classes.
Now, what got to find somebody else.
She's killing your business.
So get rid of Sarah.
Alright, so that was a side quest but hopefully we found some treasure there and write the name of the person need to have that hard conversation with.
28:07
If you like, there's this fucking speech and this guy was talking shit about you and I should have talked to your face and so this is me talking shit to your face, so that I feel better about it.
You kind of suck.
Okay, really took that Tick Tock, think hard.
Okay, so I'm going back to this.
28:24
That was a side quest, main quest.








0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
And what's Wild is that a lot of you guys think you have that skill?
You only do when it comes to cookies but not when it comes to money and so you like give your clients all these lectures about self-discipline and being hard and believing your better self.
But like you will take actions that are in Direct contradiction.
The wealthiest people in the world.
0:34
See business is a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
So right now, there's a lot of shit that you guys probably learned so far, they're going to learn tomorrow and rest the day etcetera, if it doesn't do one of these three things toss it, number one, number two, you might only be able to do one of them or two of them.
1:06
And so then you got to pick, okay, of all of these things which of these has the highest likelihood of working with.
The least amount of effort, you do that one first.
And as silly as this sounds, Many of you won't do this.
1:21
The reason I say this is because I talk to people were making a million, a month, a million a week and they sometimes forget to.
So like when you have the same conversation over and over again, you start to develop Frameworks around it, all right?
And the first framework that I wanted to give you a round strategy is, how does this get us more customers?
1:39
How does this make them worth more?
And how does this increase the likelihood that those two first things don't stop happening.
If it doesn't map to that, forget about it just cut it because there are other things that we'll do that.
That that we should be doing instead cool.
Now.
The second framework is going to go one level down what hou hou.
2:00
So, usually when you do this whole thing, you get a big list of what's, right?
These are all the things I got to do.
What about blah?
Blah, blah, you're like fuck.
There's a lot of Watts who's gonna do it most time.
You're like me, right?
The difference in the guys who become bigger business owners and the ones who don't is, they have to think how can I get my team to do this for me now?
2:24
Not a team team talk but I am telling you that the reason the gym launch went from 3 million a year, never was 237 and still cranks was because of Layla because I was like we're going to make it the Alex show.
She's like, that's a terrible idea.
2:41
And so she built a team, it start empowering the team.
She's like you can't do that.
Start taking things off my counter was like hey I like that.
She's like no not for you, that's for Sandra.
Look I got six Sandra's.
They all want to work.
And so, what ended up happening is, has anyone given a task to someone on your team and they actually just did a great job with it and you're like, oh thank God, that was awesome.
3:04
Anyone had that happen?
Okay, so big businesses, do that all the time and used to it, lots of Sandra's and if you can't give shit to any Sandra's, then you're the problem because you have really low standards and you're a pussy.
3:21
You can't have hard combos.
So what did it like?
Literally it comes down to That big Macho.
Guys.
Can't tell the female trainer that she sucks.
Can't do it.
I can't do it.
And so what happens is we have this big list of w and then we put Santana on the first two.
3:39
We're like the man, it'd be cool if we could do some, these other ones.
Who should we give it to?
And we started signing the who's.
But here's a fun trick.
If you've given the same who the same thing, 12 weeks in a row like each quarter and the what's not done, the who's the problem.
3:57
Winners win.
And I'm sure that the best people that you have on your team, hit the ground running started.
Taking shit off your plate immediately start executing, everybody loved them.
Remember what that felt like that blueprint is what talent looks like.
And you have to do more of that, get more of those people, which then opens up the next thing.
4:16
Which is I'm not the type of leader who will track that type of talent.
I don't have time to get into fixing you right now but that is what the next thing that happens is okay, fantastic. oh, Tick Tock over for this strategy session.
Go to the next one.
4:32
All right.
Oh, get him.
Great impression on time.
Next frame work for you more better new.
So as soon as we figure out that we have the highest strategic leverage activity that we can in a business we then are ask ourselves.
4:49
Can we just do more?
What can we do more?
I want to do more more money.
Let's do that more more more, right?
Or we say, can we do it better?
We don't have to invest in any resources, just do it better.
Better.
We're going to go from calling leaves in 30 minutes to Connolly's and under five deal.
5:06
Fantastic.
Once we do all the Moors and all the Bettors then and only then do we do new now.
Here's how most small business owners, decide what they're going to do new and the thing is is a lot of you guys are going to come back from here with lots of new.
5:23
You're gonna be like, hey team.
I'm going to vomit all over you and make no plan.
It's gonna be awesome and they're just be like, let's give it a week.
He'll forget about all the things he said, I will go back to normal.
A real talk, it's going to happen.
Jim launched, since we sold it to whatever issue years ago, whatever the time was 20 21.
5:43
I'm so proud of kale and the team because they consistently asked, thank you.
How can we do more?
What we're doing, how can do it better?
Jim was just going 40% since Alex and Layla exited the majority share.
We still own 30 plus percent of it.
5:58
But And I think in a lot of ways, kills a better CEO than I am, because I also like new shiny things tip.
But kills, super disciplined.
He's an exceptional CEO.
There's lots of learned from him, how can I do more, how can I do it better?
So it's like, hey dude, I think we should be getting on take doggies, like, you know, we could also do you fucking double our cold call team?
6:16
Do that, what we do that?
What's the likelihood that if we double our whole team, will make more sales.
Hi.
We are to have a trodden path there.
Let's just do more of that but what about Tick-Tock?
It's like yeah, likely that we're gonna get sales, I don't know, we've never done it before, I don't know, but what about this kid I saw on the internet, he's making millions, let's just double our cold call T and then let's look at our better and say like do you think we can clean the numbers more?
6:43
Do you think we can improve the script?
Do you think we can follow up faster?
You think we can personalize the reach out to more probably?
and so right now, This is real real, the thing that is killing most of you guys.
7:00
Is the desire to 10x in 90 days and then not doing it and trying something new and hoping for a silver bullet, That Never Comes.
It's just, it's 100 golden babies, like the big businesses, it's just golden BB's, it's just improving.
Lots of little things over and over again, the 40% Improvement that Jim watches had since we sold our majority share has there's been no one thing and man, wouldn't I love to make that short video.
7:23
There isn't one thing we just improved a lot of little things and that creates the big outcome.
And so right now, you probably have this big list.
Of should dues like I should do that.
I should probably email my list sometime right at some point.
7:40
I should do that, right?
I should probably do more cold DMS or do more reach outs, I should probably make more ads to run.
I should probably do that.
I should probably figure out our pricing and optimize it, I should probably create that sales training program or get my team to go through that sales training program.
7:57
I should probably set up a role-playing Cadence for my team so they sell better but you know, it's I knew that sounds cool.
The should dues if you actually just wrote all the things that you need to do down and then you take them off and you realize that it takes two years to build an exceptional business and you did nothing but just actually do all the shit, you know, you should be doing usually build a pretty exceptional business.
8:22
It's the rush that kills everyone.
It's the hope that this new thing is somehow going to shortcut the work that needs to be done and like this is just been truer and truer.
Because the thing is, is that that list A ten million dollar company is longer and bigger that list for 100 million dollar company is longer and bigger and it's just shit that needs to get done.
8:41
And so the faster you can confront, the work that has to get done the faster you start getting the getting getting to the getting.
There you go.
This is making sense.
All right, now you're going to have a lot of different things.
You have a lot of different things that that you could do, right?
8:59
And you've noticed this is the central theme is like, you've got a lot of decisions to make Jake and I just want you to make the right one.
I want you to make the one that makes the most bang for the buck and an easy way to order.
This is impact.
He's there you go.
So when you have your big list of shit, just put it as 1 2 3 4.
9:22
Just put a number next to it, really easy, lots of impact really easy.
Do these first then once you've done all of those, Hey, don't consume any more information once you've done.
Wait, Ivan fit, once you do all of these, then start working on these then start working on these then fuck these, I really want to Rebrand the logo.
9:52
Why?
No knows that you exist to begin with.
What are we talking about?
You like I want to Rebrand its like, what?
Like, you have a nameless, assert that no one has any association with your first thing, like Xerox is just made up letters, right?
They created a brand because branding is the consistent action of associating.
10:10
The unknown with the node, right?
And I know I'm supposed to talk about social media branding.
I didn't think it was going to be super important for you guys because you don't need to for now in my opinion.
Not because it wouldn't benefit you but because there are other things that I think would benefit, you more just to be clear?
10:27
Okay, now I'm going to give you this little This little tirade and then, I may, I may have time, I may not have time at the end for Q&A.
We'll see.
So often times the things that is limiting, the business is the big obvious thing.
10:44
So we have really big egos about our business.
We assume that it's exceptionally assume that it's excellent, right?
But in your heart of hearts, you probably know that if you were actually fucking exceptional, you would not be asking questions about how to get more leads, because you would have people referring their friends.
11:03
And referrals, by the way, are nonlinear in that they are exponential in nature to bring 44, bring 8 etcetera.
So the book, The 100 offers book was probably my first big experience with that because I spent like a very long time writing it and then I gave away for 99 cents and I made one post and I think this one I'd like 20,000 Instagram followers in total and I didn't have really any of the platforms and that book to this day sells more copies every month than it did the month before and like last month is sold 25,000 Copies.
11:33
It's like almost a thousand books, a day, 1,000 customers every day.
No marketing, spend just word of mouth, right?
And fourteen thousand, five stars.
And so like, it's the big obvious thing and from being in the room with Millionaires and sorry billionaires and deca billionaires.
11:52
The thing that has become so clear to me is that the people who are obsessed with their product, are the ones that get the compounding.
And so every Business needs to have some sort of compounding vehicle within it.
Otherwise, you're going to spend the rest of your life trying to promote it.
So then right, this way, if I spend two years trying to write a book and at the other two years, it's exceptional, I'm going to give you alternative example.
12:14
First.
If I spend two months, writing a book and I polish it, and I have to spend the rest of my life, trying to promote it to get people to buy it.
It's a tough life, low, leverage on the flip side.
If I spent two years trying to build something fucking incredible.
And then let my customers Market it for me for the rest of my life, more work upfront, less work long-term.
12:35
It's just that being willing to delay satisfaction and gratification is in my opinion, the single greatest skill that you can develop and what's Wild is that a lot of you guys think you have that skill you only do when it comes to cookies.
But not when it comes to money.
And so you like give your clients all these lectures about self-discipline and being hard and like you know believing your better self but like you will take actions that are in direct contradiction.
13:01
That same thing.
It's just we're switching calories for dollars.
Same thing.
And so, when I see a lot of the best, like, the gym owners that struggle, it's just the big obvious thing.
The sandwich sucks.
Dude, what's the new marketing thing for like, Jim's?
I'm like, have you tried your sandwiches?
13:18
They are terrible.
Why would you want more people to know?
Right?
Like it's real though, right?
Like imagine item mediocre book which is what most people would have and I spent tons of money trying to Market it.
Why would I do that?
13:33
It sounds ridiculous.
When you think about it, you're like I'm just going to let everyone know.
I'm mediocre that would suck but that's what a lot of people in this room do every day.
And so The thing is that, in my opinion, if I were to start a gym over today, I would consistently work on the actual product, the experience, the way people get greeted, the trainings for all of the teams into the world's simplest model and until people were not leaving, I would not be worried about bringing more customers in once you get that right.
14:04
Then when you're pouring all this gas in, you can catch it.
Because if you got a hole out the other side, your constraint is the fact that people don't stay.
And so the biggest thing that you have to solve for because now we buy into a lot of brick and mortar chains.
That's one of my favorites.
Unsurprisingly is L TV or lifetime gross profit over everything.
14:26
The guys who can spend the most money on marketing are the ones who make the most money from ads.
So, when you see these massive marketing companies with these massive campaigns that are out there, it's not because they're better at marketing.
It's because their LTV enables them to spend as much as humanly possible in the marketing.
14:45
If you print cash on the back end, you can get silly on the front end.
This has to sink in like this has to sink in.
And I keep being repetitive about this because I continue to get the same.
And whenever I go and it's like, what's the new marketing trick?
What's the new hack?
It's like you have to solve the root issue and it's kind of like the it's like, it's like the gal who's like, hey, is it Quito?
15:05
Is it intermittent fasting?
Is it, you know, like, I'm trying to give the parallel here.
Like that's what you sound like, you don't get it.
You got to understand how to conquer macros.
It is what it is done.
And so like in the business it's like you have to figure out how to get The Mousetrap to work even at its simplest level.
15:22
So that people actually like the thing you have and I just feel like so many Any of the gyms that I see and I go to it's obvious like takes five seconds to see why they're not successful and the gym owner because they're in, it can't see it.
Because their ego, their identity is attached to it because you think that if you're Jim sucks, it means you suck.
15:41
And that's not true.
You have to break that.
You should be like, oh yeah, we suck in that onboarding.
Not existent churn through the roof.
You should see my trainers slave, who each other?
It's terrible.
Place absolute pigsty, right?
15:59
So what's your plan?
I'm going to mark it.
I'm going to mark it.
You could cause you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
16:19
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
So to give a quick, a quick recap, and if I have time for Q&A, will one brand is making associations between things that are intangible with things that are tangible and unknown.
16:49
So things that people like if I hold a bunch of bricks of gold on stage or I hold a bunch of stacks of cash, you will make associations of money with me.
If you didn't know who I was, you would assume that I have something to do with money.
That would be your sumption.
That would be the association if I stand.
To a porn star.
17:05
You'd assume other things right associations.
And so if you want to build a brand associate, the service that you have with the intangible ideas, you want the prospect to believe about you.
So if you want them to think that you are clean and you are friendly and then you care and start their magic want.
17:24
If you feel sad, immediately, translate that into I do not know what to do next.
It massively simplifies, this very like hard painful experience.
It's been really helpful for me.
Me.
So if you feel hopeless, you don't know what to do.
It means you just don't have options.
17:40
Like, you don't perceive that you have options, it's a lack of options, so you just have to become informed.
All right, so whenever I think sadness, I think, ignorance, it's like, oh, that solvable.
And then, I can start attacking it on the flip side.
If you have lots of options and you feel anxiety.
17:56
It's because you don't know how to pick, which means you have to prioritize means of a lack of strategy.
Strategy is getting the most bang for the buck.
It is allocating, finite, resources against infinite options.
And some of the biggest strategic moves are outside the board.
18:14
And that's where sometimes having Jim launch other people Etc is helpful because you have outside eyes.
So your mouth inch below your nose.
We still need somebody else to tell you a bad breath.
I heard that the other day, I really liked it right now.
There's a constraint in your business.
18:29
If you do not know what the container, your business is, you will not solve it.
You'll continue to do this shit.
You have been Doing and that has not been getting you what you want.
So right now, unless you change the activities, you do, you will not change the getting that you are getting.
So if you go back, so I'll give you different one.
So, Intelligence and learning, this will be fun.
18:50
So, the definition of intelligence is I Define.
It is rate of learning.
It's a speed, someone learns fast, they're smart some will learn slow a little slow.
Right rate of learning.
Okay, what is learning mean?
19:06
This is how you can remember it.
Same condition, new Behavior.
Which means?
Phone rings and I trained you.
And you answer it one way before I trained you.
And then I have the same condition, the phone rings again and then after I trained you you behave differently, you have learned.
19:28
If you come to this event and you do things and then you leave this event and you do the same things, you have learned nothing, which means that change in behavior is the way that you can measure intelligence the speed at which you change Behavior.
19:45
With within the same conditions is your rate of learning the fast.
You do that the smarter you are.
It's a some of y'all are.
Hold on.
I got to figure out the political work, one dumb.
But again when I Define words or operationalize them it becomes a lot more under my control.
20:02
So I'm like, man, I don't want to be stupid.
It's like they got to do this thing.
I went to this marriage seminar and they say that when my wife walks in the door, I should say something nice to her.
Damn, right.
Walks in the door.
You went to the seminar and you're like, nice blouse.
20:20
She's like, is that the top one or the bottom?
One thing, I don't know.
One of them, right?
And so same condition new Behavior.
It's also a great way to teach your team, which is like, I'm going to present this condition.
We're going to train, and when I present this condition, again, I need you to change your behavior.
20:37
That's what learning is.
And so everybody here, if you don't know what to do, they're not gonna be able to change your behavior which means you're not going to different outcome.
So, so, Most of the success that I've had is my effort to try and boil everything down into an input to Output equation.
20:55
I remember when I was studying for the GMAT back in the day, I found this research study that showed that the number of problems that you solved was in direct correlation with the score you got on the test and I was like oh yeah okay this is a clear input output like life isn't always this clean but I was like fantastic.
21:15
So I did about a stack Of phone books, this high at it for hours a day for 16 weeks of problems.
And then I scored above Harvard's Min score I didn't start there but I had the grass.
I was like, but more problems I do the higher, my score is.
And by the time, I got to the actual test was like, I've literally seen every one of these problems when I've done all of them a hundred times, right?
21:32
So being really easy and so if you don't have the inputs outputs equation, which will be the last thing I do, because Cal asked me to talk about leads.
Then you're not going to get there.
All right, so I'm gonna give you guys a sneak peek.
You can write it down.
You can't take pictures or talk about it.
21:50
There's only eight ways to get customers.
You got warm Outreach, you've got cold Outreach, get paid ads, got content.
These are the only four things that you can do.
So, if you claim that your constraint, because everything's amazing about your gym and your trainers aren't sleeping with each other.
22:06
And the gym is really clean and people don't churn and your priced appropriately.
Really and you have really good onboarding experience and people get reached out on a regular basis to check in on them to show that you actually give a shit.
You do all that stuff.
Right.
And you think that your constraint is more marketing which by the way everyone thinks that's what it is and if you keep thinking that nothing changes may be wrong.
22:25
Anyways, let's talk about leads.
So these are the only four things you can do.
You can either post content.
Do warm readouts, do cold, reach out or run paid ads, simple.
I like to quantify this by the rules. 100, which means either spend 100 bucks it down ads.
22:42
You do 100 kodai, reaches.
You do 100, warm outreaches?
Or do 100 minutes of content.
You do it every day.
And if you want get there faster, do more because what you'll also get better as you did more just like the problems on the GMAT test.
If you're not doing this stuff, what are you doing?
23:00
Might be thinking about marketing or advertising might be strategizing planning.
We're not doing any of it.
And the amount that you get will be directly proportional to how much of this stuff you do.
This is how you let other people know about stuff.
That's it.
That's all there is now.
23:18
Oop is other people.
You've got your customers who can refer you people.
You've got Affiliates, you can send you people, you've got employees who work for you and then you've got agencies Those are the other four types of people who can get you the stuff.
23:37
If you think about it, any of these four Do these on your behalf, this, by the way, is leverage.
If I can go get my customers to tell everybody about my book, then I won't have to if I can get Affiliates.
All the chiropractor places in a 5-mile radius from my gym and all the massage Studios.
23:56
And if I'm already raised from a gym to just give a free month with any new customer they have because they know that I will treat them, right.
Then I can just have 200 different businesses that come to me.
Now, do those 200 businesses come out of the sky?
Nope, what would you do?
Warm reach out cold, reach out to run as or make content targeting those people?
24:16
Then they'd come and then they do those things on your behalf agency will do those things.
Or if you have, or if you do all that stuff, then you cold Outreach cold Outreach warm.
Average paid ads, make content to get employees and then the employees will do those things on our behalf is this simplifying some shit right now?
24:35
Business can feel confusing and usually it's because we have not defined terms.
If you define the terms, then you can know you're actually talking about rather than like making noise with your face.
Okay, if you don't make noise with your face and just know what you're talking about, it becomes a lot easier because the variables become defined.
24:52
And so if you want to get more leads you have to do these things.
If you want to get even more leads, you get other people to do these things for you which starts with you doing these things to get those people.
That's it.
I have three minutes so I'm going to see if I missed anything by the way, giving away really good free stuff.
25:11
Great way to get more people to opt-in, to your thing, just in case.
Anybody needed to be convinced about doing free stuff.
Already covered branding covered, all this stuff.
All right, let's talk about this last.
Three minutes last tick, tock of the day, who here wants to know what it looks like when it's all the way, right?
25:30
Yeah.
Talk about scaling it, okay?
This give you a little bit of vision for the future, so we love Brands, they're great.
They're wonderful Capital compounding Vehicles.
What you need to know is, how much does it cost to open a facility?
All right, cost to open, then you got to know your top line revenue or more specifically, your bottom line profit per facility.
25:50
The ratio between these things.
Let's say it's cost me 100k to open a facility and let's make 100 K per year.
Then I have a 100% cash-on-cash return, who here remembers of the stock market is less than that, right?
Which is why I like it now.
This would not be that interesting to me, why?
26:08
Because I know there's a lot of operational drag associated with opening a facility to make a hundred grand.
Yeah.
Right.
And so the idea is how can I is there a way that I can get a more leverage model so I can make maybe like 250 to 500 thousand per facility and then maybe even if it costs me 500 to make 500 then I only have to open one fifth as many facilities in order to compound my cash.
26:31
Now, the way to do this and this is one of the things that I've observed With some of the most successful franchises in the space is you have your facility now.
It has been your special child.
You have lots of doodads and lots of whiz bangs that you've attached to it.
Specialized sessions blah, blah blah, the franchise franchises that are the most successful.
26:51
Simplify it even if their corporate or headquarters has like all this stuff when they want to scale a massively.
Simplify they think how little square footage can I possibly use?
Because I'm not using this to fulfill my ego.
I'm using it to fill my bank account big difference.
How How can I make this?
So that I'm really efficient with capital and then how can I make it as little operational drag as possible, I can do it with six people, but can I do with three?
27:15
How would I incentivize those people?
I know went from like super dirt, sorry clouds to dirtier but that's that is how you unlock going from five locations, 250 locations, and then you start building the machine that builds a location.
So then you have launch teams, that fill it up before it opens, you turn it over to management.
27:34
They keep running it and The big key of making, all of these work is that it can't just be based off some unique acquisition Channel because those all eventually go away.
All advertising platforms will eventually become too expensive and they will eventually die because attention always moves, right?
27:51
And so, the only way to become enduring with your business, like if you really want to not like you want to sleep well at night, you have to fix the back end.
If you know that if you don't sell any new customers, you're still going to be fine next month and you do that for three or four more months, and you'll still be Fine.
That's the perfect business to then go market but like that's the boring work that no one wants to do.
28:11
I'm going to end with this one thing.
A franchisor of a really popular not really popular.
They had like 20 locations franchise came to me and he's like, my franchise isn't working, right?
28:27
And they had I think six corporate stores, 14 franchised and the average store cost about a million bucks to open and they made About 150,000 dollars in profit per year, the right?
So you might as well just like invest in a stock and just not bother, right?
28:42
Like, that's that's what you have to think with.
And when I saw that they were doing, I think the average was like, 1.3 in Top Line and 150 and bottom line and I think they were running like a very small margin.
I thought to myself, I think is actually less than 150 point is shitty margins.
29:03
He was trying to figure out how to Market Franchise better, how ridiculous is that, right?
The thing is is that like many people who are in this room are thinking the exact same way.
And so instead what I said was, hey man, I actually think your margins blow and I think you have a lot of interest because that's why I took the call, I knew the brand and I was like I think you have really good products.
29:21
I think you just you just have to get the Ops right to get your margins in, check, right?
You've got this menu that has 500 items on it, boil it down to the top 15.
That everyone usually does, look at all the ingredients by type.
See if we can negotiate better deals with vendors because we're going to consolidate all over demand, will get more volume, etc, etc.
29:39
And so what I did was I said, hey, we've got 12 months.
I want you to spend one month, 12 months in a row to get one percent profit back month 1.
You get 1 percent back.
All you have to do is my only thing that's 1% back.
And next month, you can find another 1% next month.
29:56
Your find another 1%, it's all you have to do it.
Hey, if you find three three months ahead, next month, another 1% and 12 months from now, you would have a business That would be sellable, would be investable, and would have already tripled, or whatever, was the prophet of that and made it a scalable Enterprise, but he had spent 10 years 10 trying to scale the franchise.
30:17
When he was the big obvious thing.
The Stance just wasn't that good?
The sandwich in the literal sense was okay, for the customer, but is terrible for the investor she had to fix the model.
And so I think right now a lot of everyone here as much as everybody loves to come for leads and that's great.
A lot of you guys are just serving mediocre sandwiches And I think if you spend a year eating your own sandwich, you would immediately see all the things that are wrong with it, you'd fix that and then the rest of your life, you'd be able to scale this thing.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hey, what's going on everyone?
I wanted to make you guys a quick video this morning.
I've been MIA, so I apologize.
I've just been busy growing back, my facial hair, I'm just kidding.
We have our gym or Summit in a week and so I've just been prepping all of our presentations and all that kind of stuff.
0:42
But the topic of today that I wanted to kind of dive into with you was how to grow your gym without marketing.
And what I want to kind of talk about was kind of like the two schools of thought that kind of exists out there.
There's like one school of thought that's like all about marketing.
Like you need to know how to run Facebook ads need had a you know, learn how to sell.
1:00
All that kind of stuff, right?
The other school of thought is the don't buy ads, you know what I mean?
Like, don't mark it at all.
Don't spend any money.
You should be good enough to grow on your own.
And so, you know, we're do you lie, right?
And so, in the beginning, a lot of times, at least for me when I started my gym, I didn't know how to mark it.
1:18
And so my Jim grew organically.
So I was like, okay, that's what I need to be doing, but once it happening in, this happens to most people is that their Jim stops growing organically at a certain point.
And usually, it's because your ability to give sir.
Service to every single person that comes into your facility, goes down as it grows, right?
1:35
It grows organically, you get word of mouth, you're asking what?
Hey, we're starting gym.
I please bring your friends.
You don't like, you have that kind of vibe.
It's exciting.
Its new people come in, right, and the issue is that.
As you get to 50, 60, 70, 80 members, all of a sudden, like you can't be there all the time for everyone and so your ability to scale service delivering service goes down, right?
1:54
And so that's usually the place where most Jim start stumbling because they grew up to that point organically.
And then they stopped because the level of service that they're providing versus what they're charging is equal or less, right?
So if it's not good enough that people are going to tell their friends about it, right?
And so then the question is well, then which is right in my opinion, you should be able to grow your business without marketing, right.
2:16
The problem is what happens when it's not growing without marketing, right?
And you need to still pay bills and you still have cash flow issues.
And so we're my kind of where I fall with this is that you do need to learn how to Market.
Unless your name is good enough to grow organically, right?
But if it's not, there's no way for you to be able to fix that issue without cash flow.
2:35
And so with marketing, you can get cash flow and then cash, we can give you the ability to breathe pay.
Payroll hire more people, etcetera.
And then actually scale delivery solve the problem that you originally had to begin with, which was that like, you couldn't skill you, and you didn't have the money to get other people to help you out.
2:53
And that's kind of where marketing comes in.
That being said, the kind of ultimate scenario is where and this is kind of what we Only two.
So I would say that I started from a marketing camp in terms of like how I approach to business and then we really fell into understanding that having an unbelievable service, just makes your marketing dollars multiply so much further than anything else.
3:17
And it was because I was already good at marketing and sales and then what I'd end up selling was marketing and sales.
And so, the actual product that we made with Jim Lunch is really good.
And so I learned that having a Amazing Services.
Amazing brought up.
Totally compounds how much money you make.
3:34
And so now, like, it's totally made me rethink all of the things that I originally thought about with regards to the gyms, which is like, if I knew what I know.
Now, when I was running my gyms, I probably would have run them a lot better, you know what I mean?
Like, I would have really really, really looked at every single person.
Like, how can I get this person to bring more customers?
3:50
How can I get, how can I totally blow them away, like what they come in for and pay you for, for fitness, and services is what they come for.
But Steve for is everything else that you're able to give them that they didn't ask for, right?
Hey, guys, real quick.
4:08
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
4:37
It's everything that you can possibly think of to make their life easier like giving them like, impromptu must like, literally like, insanity, like impromptu, massages, daycares events social, Gatherings Community.
Like, all these other things that you can give them to satisfy all their other needs, but you don't need to say that.
4:53
Everything that you do that you didn't promise is over.
Delivering because the worst part is, is if you offe like you over promise and under deliver, it's better to under promise and over deliver, right?
And so, like I said, if I went back in time, I probably would be running things.
Just basically the way we run Jim watch now exceptional customer service Etc but the thing is is that unless you've turned that corner, there's really no way for the business to grow unless you have the ability to generate cash flow will and that's where the marketing and sales comes in.
5:25
And so what that allows you to do is it gives you the cash flow to learn.
It gives you the cash flow to buy information.
From other people gives you the cash flow to invest in yourself to invest in the business more because unless you were lucky enough, Enough to have started with an unbelievably clear idea of how to scale delivery, how to scale service, how to train the teams, Etc.
5:44
The likely the gym won't grow past a certain point because the delivery is just not good enough straight up.
It's just not good enough.
That's why it's not groans pulley, doesn't advertise that much because the food's amazing, right?
Does it need to advertise and that's how the gym should be, but the reality is that most gyms aren't, right?
5:59
And so, in the meantime, that's why you need to Market and sell so that you learn like you get the cash.
So, That you can have the time and the resources to go learn how to make that, Jim the way it should have been originally, right?
It'd be great to have a perfect amount of right when you started, but most of us weren't so lucky.
6:16
And so that's where Marketing sales comes in.
The good news is that you can learn it real fast.
So anyways, I just wanted to make things on my mind.
This morning's, that's awesome.
One comment about like, should I like, shouldn't I not shouldn't my gym?
Grow organically, or should I be a bit like, learning how to Market and sell the answer is.
6:31
Yes, it should grow organically, but if it's not Then you need to learn how to Market and sell.
Anyways, guys, lots of love tag, a friend.
And if you're a gym owner and you're in here, You're not even lunch, should be because it's really good.
Alright guys, have an awesome day and I'll talk to you soon in gym or is I'll see you at the summit next week.
6:50
All right.

Bernard arnault became the richest man in the world.
And what's crazy is he only sells the 1% of the population.
You may not have heard of Bernard arnault but I guarantee you've heard of his company's Louboutin.
Christian Dior saline Sephora DKNY.
Bulgari Givenchy Tiffany Hennessy Marc Jacob while the tech billionaires and everyone's net worth have plummeted, Elon Musk lost two hundred billion dollars, besos lost 70.
0:23
He only lost seven.
His business model is recession-proof the man who selling 10,000 dollar purses.
There are some Lessons that we can learn from the richest man in the world.
To the first thing we have to understand is the psychology of the rich, versus the psychology of the pork.
The first encounter I had with like, super well, I remember I was working at Smoothie King.
0:41
I was a blender tender one of my buddies, he's in the back, with his feet up, he's flipping through magazines.
Like do check this out, this guy bought a 50,000 dollar Burgers, man, that's crazy.
Who it's been 50 thousand dollars on a burger.
I thought about it more and more.
If I go and get lunch, it cost me 12 bucks to the Burger, the fries, and the coke.
0:57
Whatever he had said, he was some Finance guy who had made like a hundred.
Million dollars a year if he made a hundred million dollars and he worked two thousand hours, he made a fifty thousand dollars an hour.
I was making seven dollars an hour and my burger cost.
Me 12 bucks his fifty thousand dollar burger was cheaper for him for his amount of money that he was making, then my twelve dollar lunch was for me that was a huge shift for me where I realize I'm playing this game rod and I'm not empathizing with the rich because he's got to be thinking differently than I am to be able to afford a 50,000 dollar burger.
1:29
It also It makes sense for him.
The second is how we create products, that specifically serve rich people.
They think differently than want different things.
The best thing to do is study luxury Brands, when you shop at a high-end store, they'll offer you champagne.
While you shop, you going to have somebody who's assigned to you moment, you walk in the door.
1:47
What can I get for you?
They can have and deliver that better experience because of the premium and luxury prices.
They charge if you've ever been to a luxury model and you see a purse for 10,000 hours, you see a jacket for fifty thousand dollars and I would urge you to not say those People are ridiculous.
I can't believe someone would spend money on that.
2:04
What I want you to do is actually empathize with the buyer.
What kind of person would spend fifty thousand dollars on a jacket if I can pick from all jackets and I have so much money that the difference between a hundred dollar jacket and a fifty thousand dollar jacket in relative terms is a ten dollar difference to me in my wealth then I just want the best jacket Bernard arnault capitalized on this so there's four distinct positions you can have in any Marketplace, you can have bargain which is the absolute cheapest.
2:29
One pork Quality, poor experience.
The next is best value.
This is the difference between the Walmart in the Target, Target is better value.
It's got brighter lights, it's cleaner.
It's the best value for the buck.
The third position in the marketplace is premium, the high-end Lexus, the BMW, and then the fourth position, the marketplace is luxury where the price has no cap.
2:50
Part of the value of the product itself is the cost that people know you paid to get it.
Bernard arnault lives in this luxury bubble.
It's where people Associate their status with the purchase they made.
Typically when you raise prices, you decrease volume, but in luxury goods, when you raise prices, you increase how many you sell and that creates this, unbelievable amount of profit, which is what has now propelled him to be the single richest man in the world.
3:15
Rich people have the same problems that poor people do they just want them solved differently.
The big thing we want is we want to deliver a big dream outcome number two, we want them to believe with very high confidence.
That if they work with us, they're going to get what we promised on the bottom side.
Said they want it to be incredibly fast as soon as they pay, they want to get.
3:33
And then they want to have as little effort and sacrifice as humanly possible.
And with the rich speed and convenience are Paramount.
The money is never an issue.
It's how much you going to ask of my time and how painful you're going to make this for me, A buddy of mine, only Services Fortune 100 companies and he manages right now, 1.2 billion dollars a year in advertising budget.
3:55
And here's what's crazy.
His advertising agency actually has two front the ad spend, if they say For this month.
In December, I need to drop 300 million on Facebook ads.
He has to front the 300 million but the thing is, is that he has to do it that way because he needs to be as easy as humanly possible.
4:11
So he actually has to have a revolving credit line in the billions with a bank.
He charges six percent of all advertising dollars, it's when they drop 300 million, he gets six percent now that he gets 18 million bucks just for fronting the cash rich, people will always pay for Speed.
4:28
The easiest way to appeal to the rich is, just do the same thing in half the time, whatever the service is, if it's dry, cleaning return it by end of day.
If you only have a phone number, be the person that can accept anything.
If they email you shoot, you a text, if they WhatsApp you, if they phone call, you can accept anything because you've made it convenient.
4:45
They just want it to be effortless.
The third is, if we know a products and services, they want how to price those things appropriately.
When you solve rich, people problems, you get to charge rich people prices.
When you deal with rich people, you have unlimited upside, which is why they are.
Our customers, there's five things I want to talk about from the customers perspective.
5:03
Because if you increase the quality of your customers, you increase the quality of your business, number one, when you charge more money for your products or Services, you get an increased emotional investment.
If you have a very low-cost item, people won't even give it the time of day.
And so when you raise the price, you raise their emotional investment.
5:21
And in a real way, you actually increase the likely to get results.
The second way that it'll help your customers is that they will increase their perceived value.
There was a search study where they had three bottles of wine.
They had a cheap wine, a mid-price, wine and expensive one they had people try them out and they had them rank them based on what they thought.
5:39
Oh people said I think the most expensive wines the best, the middle price is the middle and the cheapest wine was the worst and that's not that surprising.
Except when the researchers explained that all three wines with the same.
When you raise your prices any more expensive thing is perceived in real terms as more valuable.
5:57
Even if the actual core products the same the Results for your customers.
If you increase their emotional investment, you increase their perceived value, what ends up happening.
They actually do get better results when they sign up for the gym for personal training versus a 10 dollar.
A month thing, they get better results, the fourth thing that happens when you raise your prices, you actually attract less demanding customers.
6:18
Have you ever seen this meme?
The customer says, what exactly am I going to be getting for $50?
Then it has the rich customers like wire set.
Let me know what next steps are anybody who's ever been in client services can attest.
Is this the higher the price tag?
The more expensive, the contract, the fewer payment plans, you have to set up the easier.
6:37
The customers to deal with part of the reason that a fifty dollar person is said, well, what exactly might be getting if somebody's got a hundred dollars in their bank account, you're asking for 50 percent of their net worth just because someone's willing to pay, you doesn't mean that you should take it.
The fifth benefit that your customers will get as a result of raising your prices, is that you actually have more money, you can deliver on your promises for.
6:57
So imagine you've got a hard cost thing that Five bucks and you charge eight bucks.
We only have three dollars left to run the rest of your business.
Provide service.
You don't have a lot of room there.
Now, imagine your charge, $50 for that same five dollar thing.
You have $45 at you can now use to deliver, two, three, four times, the value of the customer gets a better experience, you can reinvest in your product, you can attract higher level talent to your business.
7:25
If you have no margin, the best people are going to work for you.
They're going to go to the real business owner who And how margin needs to work, whereas you're sitting here dealing with fires all day because the people haggling over $50 for.
The best way to sell, is having the full conviction that your product is the best, the best quality.
7:42
And the most elitist product in every line that we are selling throughout the world.
And you can't say your products, the best if you're trying to do it on margin and you don't have the money to reinvest in good people, you can't do it.
When you have all of these higher paying lower demanding Happier customers your perception of the real impact.
8:03
You're actually making goes up.
It becomes this snowball that starts rolling and you have these testimonials and these reviews that start rolling in the momentum, Builds on the flip side.
If you don't have that and it becomes this vicious cycle and the other direction where you're not getting these testimonies are you getting is chargebacks and refunds from these demanding customers that had unrealistic expectations because it was such a high percentage of their net worth.
8:23
There's nothing that was going to save them from themselves.








0:00
The guys who are players at their age in 20s, and they're in there, maybe 30s, whatever.
Like right at that stage, like they're hungry.
They're Savages, and they're in the grind and they're doing the work of giving first to, as many people as they can over, delivering knowing that, that Goodwill will compound.
0:19
Welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Dude, I feel like it's funny that you bring this up.
I just had a couple buddies over at my house couple nights ago in DJ.
0:37
I was there and we got to talking about this.
These are two dudes that are pretty successful guys and we started talking about, I have a theory about this and this is my theory, it goes along with like what your Mentor said to you about doing the right.
Thing.
I feel like that.
Yes, when you do the right thing, I feel like you continue to win and you continue to grow.
1:02
But that doesn't mean that all the things that happened during that don't hurt and don't fucking like fuck with you and but what I in my case in my in my life and my experience is that even when it because dude, like usually what's weird for in my experience is that it's been the people that I've done the most for or the Four things, four and have come back to fuck me.
1:25
And That really hurts.
Like I really fucks you up, dude, because like, when you're trying to do extra shit and you're trying to help people or you're trying to like, you know, give people a hand or break or if you know put people on a faster path, nearly 100% of the time in my life, it's come back in some sort of way to hurt me.
1:47
Whether it be, you know, they'd try to drag my name through the mud or some bullshit, right?
It's never them, it's fucking always, you know, everybody else which is the reason.
Are in the situation.
The need for help in the first place.
This is why I've started to recognize that saving people from themselves as not, actually, the ethical move that ethical move is to let them fucking learn their lesson.
2:10
So they don't repeat the lesson over and over and over.
And, but I do.
I do believe that when you treat people, right?
And you do the right things that eventually you not eventually.
I believe you consistently continue to win and those people do a shrimp.
2:27
Can they go away?
And you'll talk about them, you know, three or four years, or five years or 10 years, or whatever it is, once in a while because they'll remind you of all the good shit that they actually taught you.
You know, and that's something that a lot of you guys should really think about because a lot of people that are in business, you know, getting your getting taken advantage of when you have financial means is a real thing.
2:52
It's a real thing that happens and people Target people like that.
And When you have a big heart like you do and I do, it's easier to be taken advantage of because the the pain that we have to feel to help them in a massive way is not very much my relative right?
3:11
Like someone needs five grand, five grand doesn't hurt me.
Dude and changes their life but those people quickly forget what the fuck you did for them and then they expect it and that seems to be the in scenario in society these days.
And we were just talking about Telemarketer.
3:28
Now we're just talking about this at the house the other night about like I'm like dude you know, like for me where I'm at and this is real shit.
Like this is I mean this I'm not really interested anymore and going through that process of like, developing a like more of a circle.
3:47
Like I think you and I were the ones talking like the six-month probation period.
All right?
You know that, you know, and what Alex, I were talking about, you tell him your How you do it?
We'll just like you you're like we'll see how things go.
4:03
Yeah, I mean that's basically long six months.
We were talking it's like dude as long as no one like violates the trust or like ask you for shit then they can like you could start to build a friendship because dude a lot of people come along and you know they get I guess hot and heavy with friendship very quickly and then you find out that there's a reason for it it's not because they want to be your friend and unfortunately this is A reality of becoming a successful person, but one of the things that that I think you should understand, because a lot of you guys, you know, you get that first person that takes advantage of you or that first person that does you wrong.
4:41
What I think you should realize is a, you know, you just heard Alex talked about how he got fucked over by multiple different people but those things forced him to learn all of these skills.
And in the process of going down this with good faith, he was able to develop a sales skills.
4:57
He was able to develop personal skills.
He was able to develop his creative thinking skills and become much more successful because of it.
So, whoever, whatever it is, you're dealing with out there.
Remember, there's a lesson in it, and also remember that.
If you continue to do good and you continue to do do right, I believe that those people win, like all the people.
5:18
I know that I'm friends with that are big, Winners financially.
They are people who go above and beyond for people all the time and usually end up getting fucked over a lot, but they continue to do it.
And I believe, I don't know if it's like Karma or the universe or what it is, but somehow you keep being rewarded, when you live like that, even though it's painful, yeah, it's a painful way to live because it would be Here to say fuck everybody.
5:42
Yeah, I'm not giving you shit, you know.
But dude, I still even though I've been fucked over so many times, I still give when I see opportunities to fucking help, I've so many thoughts on this.
Yeah, it's like if you think about like people understand video games so it's like, if you were to make, you're playing a video game and the way to win the game was to be make the most successful character, right.
6:03
You would have probably a really character-driven human being in terms of like they be patient.
You know they'd be hard-working it like you think about all these Rates that they would have right and they probably be tough.
Emotionally like Etc.
Alright, cool.
That's the character and that's the person who's going to be really successful.
We can all come, probably agree on that.
Okay, how do you create someone who's patient?
6:22
How do you create someone who's tough?
How do you create?
Someone who?
Right?
So all of a sudden, if we had to, then in engineer the game in order to boost those points, we'd have to get them beat up a lot so that they could get tough as you have to make him wait a long time so they could become patients.
And so the point that you made about like these people who become really successful have these traits and also share the fact that they've been through all this It's like, well, they got the trait from the shit and then the trait was the ultimate output of the experience and that trait then made them super successful that they didn't have earlier.
6:52
Because like you know, it's crazy if you really think about that and break that down every time you do get fucked over you actually end up being the person that one.
Yeah.
On a long enough time runs you and like the person with the highest character wins in the longer on the longer time Horizon.
But on Game Theory, they've studied this in terms of givers givers mattress takers and if you're familiar, With that, but basically matchers somebody who's like, Tit for Tat.
7:13
You do something for me.
I do something for you.
You've got takers who just always want to take from everybody then you've got givers, right?
And so, they like, basically, like adjust it how much giving versus taking like a bot hat and exchange, and just played it out.
And the perfect amount of give to take, is an 8 out of 10 giving to take ratio.
7:32
So like if 10/10 giving is like, you're a social worker, you get walked all over like you never, you never draw the line, the one at the one takers, they would just take for They win really quickly and then they move very long because the because they scrub, whenever they can't create any long-term, they don't get the compounding effect of doing business over and over.
7:49
And over again with people the and the mattress and takers together.
Never get the opportunities that the givers get because the givers give first.
And so there's so many more doors that get open from an opportunity perspective by giving first.
And so, like a lot of like in the tech World, they talk about surface area of luck.
8:07
So like we were like, like that guy.
Got lucky.
You can Actively increase the surface area of the likelihood that you become Lucky by giving two more people and then all of a sudden, more doors are open because you knocked first.
Yeah, it's practical right?
It's really practical.
Yeah.
It's so like yeah well it's an incredibly painful way to go through life.
8:28
Do because I'd be real like At this point, where I'm at like I was where I was getting at is like I'm not interested in going through the I'm like the new network of and then trying to figure out like, who the fuck is who like who's the giver?
8:47
Who's the take, or who's the piece of shit?
Like I don't want to do that anymore.
Like I'm not interested in a lot of people get upset with me because I don't really let people around me.
They but dude you got to understand.
I've been doing this for 24 years.
This exact thing I've been getting my ass Be my mother fuckers that pretend to be my friend over and over and over again and I'm just over it.
9:07
Like now I just don't let people in it's just what the fuck it is.
Like if you're my friend, now you're my fucking friend.
These dudes here is my fucking friends, you know I'm saying?
Like a couple dudes from the internet that, you know, you and I know who they are.
Those are my friends outside of that.
It's my brother.
My dad.
It's my wife.
That's fucking it.
9:23
That's fucking it, man.
Logic has a famous clip where he was talking about how he stays out of trouble and he's like, here's is real simple.
I don't fuck with Anybody I don't fuck with anybody and I mean it I don't fuck with anybody like throw that shit in the show.
It's a great clip.
9:38
I actually have it I'll send it to you Joe because I remember I watch it a lot and he's like, I'm not playing, I fucking stay at home.
I play with my dog.
I have my girl over and that's fucking it.
I don't fuck with anybody.
And I'm like, do you feel like it's getting honestly harder but you have to work harder to stay quote, unquote, normal as your head with no, no, because I don't fuck with nobody.
9:58
Yeah, I don't fuck with nobody like at all.
Nobody, so, Is very simple, I stay at my house and it's just me and my homeys, my fiance, my, my little puppy.
I just got, and I don't fuck with nobody.
I don't go anywhere, I don't go to parties, I barely go outside.
Like, literally I really don't go outside that much just because I don't I don't fuck with nobody that's smart dude right there.
10:18
Yeah, it's a smart dude.
And anyway, I love that whole, that whole take you have on it because that really helps me that helps me to see that.
It is practical.
It's not just this emotional beating.
I take over and over people, give those Do you win the most?
Yeah, it's just that they have to go through and like that's why there's those two theories kind of like coincide words, like, you've got the character traits that create the success, but the math behind it is like, you just increase the surface area of your luck by giving them more people.
10:43
Yeah.
And in.
So doing let's say, if you give the 10 and you get screwed by 2, you get, let's say the matter was going to get five of those opportunities.
It's just that those extra three opportunities where you didn't get fucked that over years and years and years.
That's the thing that compounds and then just makes You Wanna Stop.
Yeah, absolutely.
10:59
But we're afraid of getting people are.
Rate of getting taken advantage of, for the first time they do it.
They just quit.
Yeah, for sure.
The first time it happens.
It's a price.
It's, it's the cost of admission.
Yeah, they get, that's right.
Dude, it really is.
And also word of advice is that if you are one of these people, that helps a lot of people.
11:19
And then you happen to get your name drug through the mud for any reason, don't expect them to stand up for you because they won't.
And I've I've yet the only theory that I've been able to come up with on this because It happens to me once in a while, by once a year fucking once every two years, somebody fucking drags my name for the fucking mud and all the fucking cockroach has come out.
11:40
But yeah, none of the fucking people that I've actually done good shit.
Say a mother fucking word about it and I figured out why the reason why is because they're embarrassed, they needed the help in the first place and they don't want to expose themselves for having needed.
The help that you actually offered them, which I think is fucked up.
11:56
I think that's fucked up, I think if people do good shit for you and you see people fucking dragon that person's name, You should fucking tell people what the fuck they did.
We have, you know, you think whatever the fuck you want.
But this is what actually happened and that's just my two cents on that because it's fucking annoying but whatever.
Dude.
Anyway, what's next?
12:13
I'm just saying, oh, you people are good to you.
Tell people that they're good, people know, people aren't good to you.
You know, fucking it is, what it is.
Don't do shit with them anymore.
But like the common decency and I think a lot of it has to do with the internet, like everybody's protective of their brand now, Like most fun.
12:32
Most y'all don't have a brand, like, you really don't.
You got to fuck a couple thousand followers.
You think you got a personal brand, nobody knows who the fuck you are and nobody cares who you are.
So like do do the right thing and actually stick up for people or tell people the truth or this or that.
And the reality is those people continue to look out for you.
12:48
Like it's very simple and most people also forget like let's say somebody got came out of the woodwork and was like no man and he helped me out when I really needed it.
Yeah.
Andy will remember everyone else will forget about the instance.
Anyways.
Yeah, but you get like it's like that evening.
13:04
The score like I don't like 20 people shit.
Yeah, I don't either.
Right.
Yeah.
I don't know motherfucker anything, there's that motherfucker.
Listen to this fucking show.
There's not a motherfucker on this planet that can me right now and say I owe them a shit, fucking anything.
Do you have the one guy said you said you heal or he gave you a love like 60 Grand or something.
13:25
Here's a Lobby over that guy.
Oh fuck, yeah, let's do it.
Had a guy show up here.
Who?
And by the way, before I did I felt bad for him too.
I hate dumbasses realize that I'm not soliciting you for fucking Bitcoin.
13:44
I don't even do.
This shit was real companies were real employees and we do real shit and real life, like, I will never solisten investment from you.
You will never get a DM for me asking to you to fucking go in on this deal.
I don't, that's not what I do.
We had this got this poor guy, dude.
14:01
And he, dude, it made me feel terrible.
Yeah, he shows up.
Here one day dude he's like yeah man.
Like somebody pretended.
He knew that at this point like somebody scammed them and he's like somebody pretending to be you and took 80 grand for me, bro.
It's all I fucking hat and like, I like it was the most, it was the saddest most awkward shit that I've ever been a part of because I'm like, dude.
14:25
Like do you really think like I'm and we're staying in this building and I'm like dude do you really think like look around here?
Like do you think I'm asking people for fucking money, dude?
Like I'm not.
Listening money dude and he's like well it makes sense now but I just wanted to believe it.
14:42
So I Pharrell any of you guys get those messages bro, know that those people are full of shit because I don't even do that.
I don't even communicate with GM's outside of like five people.
So it was sad dude and that goes double for anyone who's listening for my heart?
Yeah.
Because work is.
Were we invest?
Yeah.
So it's like, even.
14:58
So we have hundreds of accounts that are like, I've got a deal or like, hey, I'm doing this crypto trade or this 4X thing and I'm like, guys, yeah, like So we get, we get it all the time so I'm not damning.
You just FYI?
Yeah.
Me neither.
I'm not if you get 64 moseys or six and he's that automatically follow you.
15:13
When you follow us, like it's not us.
Yes, it's not an it's set.
Dude, it makes me.
It made me sad as fuck because I could this do was like really fucked up over it.
Like you could tell it was like his whole.
Yeah, it may I still feel bad.
It just makes me feel dude, this is like this is my whole bias against Instagram and Facebook and the internet as much as I love the tools that we have both used and utilized.
15:36
Aged the fucking dark side of it is just so shitty, dude.
Yeah, I just so fucking predatory and and disgusting.
But that's a whole nother story.
We could talk about that for fucking hey, but Yeah, man.
I like that.
15:51
So, so how did you get?
How did you get into where you're at now?
Yeah, so so after, you know, Jim want to the, you know, started scaling up, then we start us up on company Prestige labs and the exchange that I had with you, which I really do want to hit on even though your audience is probably heard it.
16:07
I want to tell how to effectively.
Yeah, Prestige Labs was our Subway company that we sold through that distribution basic gym.
So at that point, I think we think I think at that point I think he had just like just under 2,000 gyms that had licensed, the stuff Now it's like 5,000 plus but at that point we launched it in 2019 and then in 2020 we launched our software that basically just work Jim's for Brick and Mortar businesses.
16:29
And originally, it was for Jim's, but we realized that actually worked for any, any kind of service business like hair salon, without any kind of foot traffic business.
Yeah.
And so that that's kind of the the to kind of spin off businesses that we had from Jim launched in 2021.
16:45
We sold all three of those businesses.
So prestigious Jim watch, we sold together to American Pacific groups, private Equity, Firm out of San Francisco.
And then, so that for forty six point two million, still have to 33 percent of the company.
17:03
And then the software we did an all-stock deal with a much bigger strategic partner.
We had a better monetization system and then but they had a way bigger distribution base and so they're fixing a solid like, you know, three or four.
Five years.
Yeah.
So you're still 33 on that.
No, I have 33.
That's why I say two-thirds.
Yeah, that's good.
17:18
Yeah, no.
I mean yeah your second payout would be born at verse 1.
Yeah.
I guess they're putting a big Tech put their building a CRM out and then they're going to own the payment processing for all the gyms asking to like, yeah order it.
I fucking love it.
And that's their playbook.
I was like, you know what?
I'm not that guy.
17:35
Maybe I am now but I wasn't then and so it was like cool run that run that play.
I want to do this thing and that's when in 2020 we started, we did our first kind of like personal investment, which was that photography studio?
I was a single location guy.
Have somehow made his way up.
Elder, don't do this.
17:53
Yeah, and like I could like, you know, you like you can read a person really.
Like, I could tell how he was talking, the way he was carrying self, like, all the stuff I was like, this is a nice guy.
Yeah, it's like so sorry I did this.
I did like, is like, yeah, blah blah.
Like, but I read your book, I did everything that was in the book.
18:09
I took my photography studio from like four hundred grand to 1.6 million a year.
Like, see.
And I see you're willing to give a little bit for guys like that, right?
When you sounds like, like I knew that he wasn't he wasn't pulling out of his ass, like I knew he'd he'd D.
I'd recognize his name.
Yeah, me a couple times of like, yeah, so much better.
And so, anyways, turns out he is this photography studio is enchanted, fairies.
18:29
And I'll tell you this, because I think's really enchanted fairies.
Yeah, all right, it's an implied.
An affair is what's up.
He had a daughter who got told at school to shut up and she stopped talking for like months.
Holy shit.
Yeah.
18:44
And so what ended up happening was like they try to, you know, all this different stuff trying.
Get her talk and do it.
And so what they did was they set up these sets because their photographer right of how like of a storyline where she is the hero of Their Own Story and she finds her voice.
19:01
That's like kind of like a so they made it to a picture book.
Read it to everything started talking again.
And so I was like, wow, that's really cool.
Because like kids like everybody act stories or what influence the way we see the world and so they had a visual but it was like, not just any story, it was a story with her pictures of her being the hero.
19:18
Yeah.
And they don't have third of their profits to charity every year towards kids, like, they're like, good people.
Yeah.
And so, anyway, she told me the whole thing and I was like, yeah.
Like yeah, I'm in like what?
You know, how can I help write?
And so, we invest in the company and now we have 38 locations as fucking house, 30 months later.
19:36
And so you started so one location?
Yeah.
And how many months thirty eight months?
30 locations, think it's been 30 months is June of twenty twenty so whatever that is until now, that's amazing.
Yeah.
And so like that's what we always fucking hat.
What I said he's holding on to his hat.
19:54
I mean, it's been, it's like seeing building that with them, has been so cool and awesome.
And they were like, man, let's do another one of those.
So we did, we did two more deals that year and both those went really, really well.
The same degree of growth as kind of that one dead.
And so that's why this is the topic.
20:12
I thought would be, there's two different ways.
One, I want to talk about the prestige Labs things.
I learned a ton from you about all the things I did wrong.
I think it'd be useful for the audience, but in terms of recently ended up selling was because I enjoyed that so much and I you probably maybe you probably have more patience than I do.
20:30
Because I felt like I'd been in the gym industry for a decade and it's like, I'm just, I don't wanna be the gym guy.
The gym.
You know what keeps me here dude.
It's the it was the perspective switch.
It was when I went from.
So like dude I'd it's happened for me in 2014 when I went from someone who was trying to become wealthy which at this point, I was at that time to someone who was trying to help our own team and our own people like it.
20:55
Became Mission Focus.
That's where my dude I love coming here, bro.
Yeah, like I'll like do we have we have, you know, 10 12 people a week that walk through here that have lost 100 Pounds changed our whole fucking life.
I don't know anywhere else where you can do that.
21:10
Yeah.
You know, and you get to talk to these people and dude, I'm here with all these people who care about that.
Yeah.
You know, it's just a cool environment to be here and I fucking love it.
And that's what keeps me in it.
But I do.
I do also thoroughly enjoy the small business phase of growth like going from one.
21:29
Yeah, too many.
I fucking love that.
Yes, the Rocket Ride miss that shit.
Yeah.
Because that's what I mean.
Yeah.
This is a different game than 38.
Eight is now like I mean yeah over they did a terrible.
Yeah, right yeah, yeah, this is that we went, we went through the small business, we went through the medium business.
21:44
Now we're learning the large businesses, which is cool because I'm learning new, I'm learning new things, right.
I never ran a fucking company.
This big but dude, I'm telling you, man, like my sweet spot is right.
We're talking about, I fucking love that shit.
I love I love the helping people go from like I got a buddy of mine.
22:06
Alex panozzo, who you may recognize him from the internet, he's all over the Internet, he's got a good personal brand to.
He started with us in art a, you know, two thousand eighteen or nineteen, where we started.
If we go to, if we go to my house later on, I'll show you what he sent me.
22:24
His millionth dollar that he made.
So like, you know, how most people will say, oh oh, that's of course dollar.
Yeah, he sent me his Valor and the he made.
Yeah.
And a note and I framed it.
I got it in my, in my lounge or my garage was where I spent a lot of my time and then he sent me a, he sent me a video message.
22:43
Just the other day is just so fucking cool.
Dude, like this, he sent me a dollar a while ago.
This is a couple years ago, send me a message the other day.
Now this guy at this point, I'm like he's very conservative, he's not like a guy who makes million bucks goes and spends it right?
But he you know, he's a car guy is like I am and I know you're not but But but I am, and he sent me this video of this car that he built before that he built himself, and he was talking about it and then he's like in dude.
23:11
And then today, I bought this and he bought a fucking brand new McLaren and like, bro, I was just like, this is the fucking shit.
Like this is, this is the shit.
This is what I love doing.
And whether it's with, you know, changing their life, with Fitness or weight loss, or whether it's economically with entrepreneurship, that's the shit I love.
23:28
I love that shit.
So I'm a little bit jealous.
It's about what you guys are doing.
Yeah, see, I mean, watching someone's perspective, shift around the world, I think whether it's like you said, you know, weight loss, even some people were like, you know, religious and they get people into their, or economically.
Like when you see, like I think at the end of the day, like the reason that I fell in love with Leo, was that she saw the world the same way as me and I felt like that was really rare.
23:50
Like I was like so you see that to write like this guy's a total and she's like yeah, little beast.
Yeah, okay, cool.
You see that too?
Okay.
Oh yeah.
They're only doing that now because they like it they're trying to get this up sound.
Yeah, it's like I just like I felt like this huge weight where I'm like I thought you only work.
Yeah exactly you're not the only one that thinks like that that's a big that's a big thing.
24:08
I'm thankful for for the people that listen to my show because I know like like I know I'm not everybody's cup of tea, I'm very aware like I'm very fucking aware if you guys don't have to remind me, I know I live my life this way the whole time I've been alive, but the people who consistently listen to the show and don't like Like they don't think I'm crazy.
24:28
You know I'm saying I fucking love that.
It's one of the things I'm most thankful for that's why I continue to do the show honestly because like some of the things aren't fun to talk about.
Yeah you know coming on here every day and talking about what the fuck is going on with these crazy motherfuckers in the world?
Yeah, it wears you out.
Yeah, but finding people with that consistent.
We're over you, bro.
24:43
And that perspective is fucking massive, dude.
And to the audience, I mean, just to give you some confirmation like, if you, if you think differently than your immediate family, or your friends, or whatever your hometown is, like Like one, you probably don't want to be normal because if you take what normal means and put it across all aspects of life, it means that you're going to died, 74, you're probably be overweight.
25:06
You're going to, you know, be divorced, you're going to not really achieve anything that you want like that's normal.
And so it makes sense that you would be the odd man out because most people live that life.
And so like, that was something that gave me a lot of permission to, like be me, which was not normal in a lot of.
25:25
And that's Okay.
Because I mean, like ordinary versus extraordinary means that you are not.
And so like if any sharing stuff on here that are different beliefs about the world than it would make sense.
Because like if he's in the point zero zero one percent of earning potential, that it means that he sees reality differently than you and I think it's the same reason that people who are billionaires, can lose it all and then get it right back.
25:45
And the reason that you can't, because you don't see reality, clearly, hence, the name of the show, you know, that even like even connect the like, yes, that's it's about being a realist.
It's Distortion.
Yeah, it's moving.
The emotion outside of the facts and making decisions based on the facts.
26:01
Oh, and and I feel like that's a tool that has become less and less, and less common with more and more and more internet and more, and more more, you know, propaganda in terms of making people believe that their feelings are what actually matter and how you should make decisions in reality.
26:21
That's not especially in business, that's not going to get you very far.
It's going to get you broke.
Yeah.
So I appreciate that, but I think is that it's just like, is that feeling of loneliness makes you normal in the right room?
See ya.
26:36
Rather than the room that yeah, that's exactly right.
Like, dude, you get around people, you know, you know, God isn't like and that's, that's something for a lot of you guys listening to like, you may never have been in those rooms like ever, but I'm telling you, like, when I go in a room, none of them motherfuckers.
26:53
Think I'm crazy.
Yeah, it real talk.
They might think I'm I talk too much but they don't think I'm crazy.
Also, the many losses that you're probably going through right now if you're in your Rocky cutscene.
Like if you remember that video game thing, it's like well then you're just, you're tinkering away, your chiseling away at the character, traits that are going to make you successful, and in those rooms that and he's referencing.
27:12
Like, I don't try to say this the right way, but like, game recognize game, and I don't mean that an egotistical way, but more.
So, like, how the other people in that room, see the world.
The things that we're talking about giving earlier, like all the guys who I know.
For the wealthiest in the world will do will bend over background where you tell you turn it mean.
27:30
Yeah, it's completely opposite of what the perception is.
Yeah.
The perception is everybody?
That's rich is a piece of shit.
My perception of it.
It now that might be true if people inherently totally different could be done.
Yeah, but my perception is people who have actually built their own wealth are.
27:48
Usually these are the fucking nicest best people and that's the reason they became wealthy.
Yeah.
They had to develop those ways of getting along with people over and over and over again because if you don't have leverage in the beginning which you don't you have to overcompensate by being a great person.
28:07
Opening more doors by giving first and getting screwed.
Yeah.
And if you think about it that way where it's like, okay, I have to give to lots of people for an extended period of time and I have to stomach the fact that I'm going to get screwed, like you're going to get screwed, you have to stomach it but if you realize that that's the necessary cost in order to develop the tray, Eight and open the doors that you don't get screwed.
28:28
Then you just have to see that as the as the ticket, right?
And I think that for me that was like a very big unlock for realizing that.
Like when I got into those rooms, I was like, oh yeah.
Yeah.
That's the ticket.
Yeah, getting your ass kicked and getting screwed over over and over and over again, continuing to show up continuing to push through continuing to get creative and figure out the solution.
28:47
That is the price of admission to that higher level that you're trying to build.
It's not the abnormality, it is the norm.
I'm for that level that you're going for and while it may feel like it's abnormal it because it is right and the normal human being kind of keeps themselves, they're not overly generous, they're not overly greedy, they might give some to the church, they might give five bucks to the homeless guy or whatever.
29:11
That's not what we're talking about.
We're talking about when you have the means to make a difference and you continue to use your means to make a difference.
There's going to be Eighty percent of those people that don't appreciate it along the way and that fucking sucks.
It really does suck.
29:27
And I'm not looking for a ticker-tape parade or anything, but just like, I don't know, don't pile on, you know, like don't make it fucking harder, I mean, and and unfortunately but fortunately, unfortunately, and fortunately it fucking hurts but fortunately it teaches you a whole lot and I truly am bought into that mindset, you know, because DJ asked me, you know, we're together all the time and he, you know, he sees He's this a lot like he sees me do things.
29:55
He he he knows all the secrets that he knows the things that I've done and then sees those people do those things that aren't good music.
Why do fuck?
Do you do that, bro?
And I'm like well look at my life, dude.
Yeah.
Like I'm doing something right.
So like I really don't want to fuck with the recipe like it's going well I want to give a tactical tip.
30:13
Yeah.
So when I you know, join these networking groups and stuff early on like that gym owner group, things like that, this is how you can employ that In the real world, what I did was I reached out to every single person that was in the network and what I did was I pretended they were a client of mine and I had certain skills, like, for me at the time when I was starting out, the only thing I know how to do is write sales scripts, pill sales processes.
30:37
So I offered every single person to go review all of their shell scripts review, their sales processes and I did it, like it was an actual project that I got paid for and so I'd hop on the phone and I would have pages of notes.
How I'd rewrite everything and they were like, whoa.
Whoa, dude.
30:52
Like I thought you're just going to give me a couple to like dude what you want them to say is this is too much.
This is too much.
Hey Mose addition quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
31:07
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Because what happens is you stack, something you get an IOU, which is incredibly valuable, and it's one-sided.
31:27
Like you now gave them something and that can come in handy later down the road.
And for me, those are the things that I cashed in when I didn't know how to run.
Facebook ads are, like I learned something from that guy.
But later on, I needed a way deeper understanding the one we can Workshop ahead and I hopped on with a person.
31:43
And I have done with plenty of others who have never given me anything back, and that's okay.
Because when I did need something, I You'd have somebody in my phone will girls like, oh, I did that thing.
I wonder if I could hit.
I wonder if they'd help me out with this thing.
And so what happens is, you basically plug into everyone else's Network and skills by giving first.
32:01
Now some of them are going to return the favor but your net positive on everything because if they don't return the favor one that's fine too.
They're not going to being bad to say about you.
Now obviously there's piece of shit for sure and it is okay, it is okay.
If they never give back like because dude, keep going, I don't ride in a row.
32:19
I know what?
Yeah because like Like most entrepreneurs, we say, we want to make an impact and help people.
It's like, well, that's what that looks like.
If you give something to someone and they don't give anything back, then it means you just gave to someone.
That's it.
Great.
Yeah but congratulations and if you talk about personal brand, wouldn't that be the brand that you'd want to build?
32:35
Anyways?
Yes and so I got into this other networking group and they invented it award for me which was a member of the year they never did it but they were like dude we just want everyone to do what you did, which is like I hopped onto every single person and I took every single call and I treat it and this is the big Point here as I like Don't go on and show up at the call and then start thinking about their problem.
32:56
You do homework before the call.
Like it's amazing chemistry to this.
Yeah, you just tweeted this yesterday.
It was, it was, you could become incredibly your become infinitely, more smart by just 20 minutes, preparation before the call or something.
33:11
Like this is truth, you'd be amazed how much, huh?
Yeah.
It's exactly.
It's exactly that like, how much more intelligent you can seem with 20 minutes of prep?
Yeah, dude.
That was good.
That's it yeah.
Is you bit because you've done it right?
I had a call with somebody and like a lot of you guys probably ask any and I get this question all the time.
33:28
They're like how do I network with people who are above me?
Yes, right it's a hard question.
So number one is you don't ask them, what value can I provide you?
Because now you're asking me to do homework to figure out what you can do for me, that's me doing work which I can just keep living my life.
What you do is you do the hard work of figuring out, what can you provide to me that you have?
33:47
And then instead of offering it, you do it and then give it to me.
Not telling you to do that for me.
I'm telling you, this is how I did it, this is how it works.
Yeah.
And so if you have some ways ahead of you, do whatever your Niche skill, if you're fucking Carpenter, then build the most amazing table of all time and send it to somebody.
34:05
And you know what they're going to do.
They're going to get it and be like, this is too much.
I can't believe somebody did this and then what happens?
Hey, sound familiar, doesn't it?
That's how he's here.
You're explaining how he got here?
That's the game.
Yeah, I like half the editors I have.
34:20
They're like, hey, I went through all of your old clips that are on YouTube.
I clip 20 of these short reels.
This is what I did.
And they sent them all to my, you know, my creative director.
And he was like all this kids good.
Now, mind you, if you're not good, that's also good feedback.
And I will tell you this that guy and most people would give you at least the time, tell you what, you could do better, because anyone will help someone who starts helping themselves.
34:42
Anyone will help someone who takes initiative.
And if you over-deliver, and I'll tell you this because we're talking about that little room that private room.
The players, recognize one another.
And so like, when I see the young guys coming up the guys with the blue check mark and the Rolex and the like this isn't I'm not posing in front of the land but they rented for the day, right?
35:02
Yeah.
For whatever I'm doing that a few years ago.
Those people only impress people who don't know what players look like, yeah.
Like we all know that that guy is not a player because the guys who were players at their age in 20s, and they're in there, maybe 30 or whatever, like, right at that stage, like, they're hungry.
35:27
They're, they're Savages and they're in the grind and they're doing the work of giving first to, as many people as they can over, delivering knowing that, that Goodwill will compound.
And like, it's just like that, that single skill has served me so well, because that's how I've been able to Get into rooms that I didn't deserve to be in was by just saying like okay what am I good at that?
35:47
I can help this guy out with.
Well there's you've broken it down masterfully by the way to make it practical, but I also do believe that there is an energy aspect to this, dude.
I believe because like I live like that real talk.
I live that way.
I know you live that way to some of the things.
36:05
I can't explain though.
Like some of the good shit that's come back to me.
I'm just like this has to be for me.
Consistently just doing this.
Mrs. The word of mouth thing that I think is like wild.
Like I continue to be inspired by how much word-of-mouth actually matters.
36:21
Like it just every year I feel like it's a new record in my mind for how important is because people right now like I see this all the time people like it's all about influencers and whatever like ensure like the tactics of ads and all this stuff, like that's great but The only thing that is still viral is Word of Mouth.
36:38
Like everything else is linear in terms of the relationship.
Like, if you spend a dollar and Edge, you get ex back, if you do a cold reach out, you get ex back video, 100 you triple it, you 1,000 it.
It's 1,000 two 1,000, like, whatever, that relationship is that ratio.
It's fixed word of mouth, is the only one that is exponential in nature.
36:53
One tells 2 2 to 4, 4, to 8.
And so if you want to have an enduring business, you have to have the monster of word-of-mouth working for you rather than against you who's building a reputation rather than eating it from underneath your feet.
And I think, Like that.
Like that stuff that you were talking about earlier where you're like, you're doing this good woman, it's coming back to me.
I just see that as like the Invisible Hand of the word of mouth.
37:11
That just like, I mean, you've had to happen a hundred times, I'm sure which is like, you go and you meet somebody like dude my buddy saw you at an airport and you like stopped and answered his questions and whatever.
Yeah.
And and my duty to be fair if I'm like somewhere and I can't it's the thing that bothers me.
37:26
The absolute move.
Sometimes I have to be Playmates here.
Brad, I hate it.
I hate it.
I feel like I'm just a my I do too.
I feel like like do died one time and Actually, I became really good friends with this guy because of that exact scenario, dude, I had a guy.
His name is Roman.
I'm still friends with them.
Good fucking, dude.
Came up to me a speaking event, and I was like, he's like, hey man, you got time and I didn't and I'm like, no I can't, I can't.
37:49
And and dude, he was like he had been going through all this crazy like really bad stuff.
Yeah.
And then I do, it was bothering me a fucking bad dude.
Like I thought the whole time I was speaking the whole time afterwards I'm like fuck are you not find that do because I got time now.
38:06
Yeah, weirdly enough I was at another event and I fucking random.
To the guy.
And I was able to apologize and say, hey, dude, I'm like he was like, you know what?
Dude, I actually that really, really made me mad.
I like, I'm like, bro, I get it.
38:23
I would feel bad about it, you know?
But that shit bothers me to brother.
And I think that for the audience, I think the bigger ticket, like, sure the tactics that were showing right now or like useful.
But I think the biggest thing is, like the perspective of there is that person that bothered Andy enough, that it kept kept him up at night.
And I think that, if you, if you can develop whatever that is, where It's a splinter because it's those thousand splinters to become the bundle.
38:45
That becomes very, very strong sick that you can wheel towards wield against you.
And like for me like I think about the products we built right in the same way.
We're the only way to build an enduring companies either to have to sell stuff that people never stop, buying from you or to build a company where people never stop selling for you.
39:05
Those are the only two ways to build an enduring business that just continues to thrive over and over again.
And if you're one of these guys who is in, like I get that gig.
Actually came from the direct response, world of, like understanding how the Arbitrage of like ads and try starting to, bro, that's where I started was 18, right?
Cuz you think right foot?
Right is right.
And fucking classified ads.
39:21
For a credit booklet that I wrote credit repair.
Booklet.
Yeah, I was right classified ads.
Putting fucking newspaper.
Yeah, we had the internet older, but the what happens is, as you scale your, because I'm going to get a little bit higher level business, but hopefully, you guys will ride with me.
39:41
Yeah.
Get it.
So as you scale advertising, spend you go to colder and colder audiences.
Meaning this people who have less trust and they're honestly less of a fit than the warmest.
Like, if I was like, I'm going to only Market a vegan powerlifting.
Women wear mom's over whatever.
And I depart product that was just for them, I'm probably gonna do okay, but if I'm a marketer the nation there's just a less of a fit with my product and so what happens is your cost to acquire a customer goes up because add cost will only go one way for the rest of time.
40:07
They will go up and your conversion on future audiences that are colder will only go One way, which is down.
So how do you combat two things that are inevitably going against?
You you have to have one thing that is nonlinear in nature that fights that fight which is word of mouth because that when that one customer comes in and tells five people, it allows you to continue to scale because you have decreased cost of acquisition.
40:29
We get a little bit like, no, no.
You guys this stuff.
Yeah, here.
But like it's the only way that it gets big.
If what you want if you want to grow something big, then having the strong word of mouth bass which is why I like you can get into Actual sales stuff.
Sure.
If you know how to Market, you notice that you can become a millionaire, like, you can absolutely probably put a dam just by like learning how to sell shit and I'm using shit in the true poop word like yours.
40:52
Yeah, terrible stuff that doesn't doesn't matter, right.
But if you want to achieve a certain level of scale, my recommendation is to continue to do the thing at a scale, way below your friends until you figure out a way to get everybody who buys stuff from you to tell a friend.
41:08
Like if this is a mental exercise, I like putting People like our portfolio CEOs through, I said, okay, the marketing gods have decided that you are no longer allowed to Market anything and they eliminate all of your customers except for one.
And every single customer from this point going forward has to come from that one.
41:27
Customer, how do you treat that customer?
And what happens is you start thinking like, well shit, I would do this differently, this different, it's like well, then do that stuff and then what you'll see is that the result you get from the remaining, the remaining a It's of your advertising will compound rather than continue to go linearly in the wrong direction, they compound in the right direction.
41:49
And so like this has been something that's taking me too long to learn.
And I'm trying to like Ram this right now because I because the biggest mistake that I made with Prestige lab just myself, I'm coming.
I'm glad we wrapped around was that I treated the supplement business.
Surely transaction.
I did everything that I'm telling you that not to do.
42:07
I did it.
That's why I'm telling you that it didn't work.
Is that it?
By the way, that's the norm for the Supplement industry, right?
Hundred percent.
So sorry you were doing something abnormal, that's normal.
Yeah, another normal example of like, hey if everyone else is doing it is probably not the best idea.
But anyways, and so I basically built the whole brand off of transactional sales and teaching how to hardcore close is that was a skill, I had.
42:30
So I was like, okay, I'm going to hit it with my sales Hammer because it's like, yeah, everything looks like a sales, a when you're good at sales and so I taught all the scripts, all the processes, how to set up the lobbies, how to, how to get assume closes and how to get people on subscriptions, all that stuff.
Right.
The thing is that I like it actually happened the first one.
So this is a plug for you.
42:46
A close friend of mine was a first for mathlete, right?
And I was like dude saw Prestige Labs, it wasn't because I was you know it's like we know each other.
Yeah.
I was like, dude.
So my stuff and and and and the commission that I was paying was significantly higher and I was like, and I'll give you the special home, eat it?
43:04
Like, I just like the one I like, we're going to dinner.
Let's be on the same team.
You know what I mean?
All the time.
Yeah, and the thing is that he You to, he and Hall and to this day he still sells for form and I was like, I don't get it because I knew because I did have this really super doctor, like make all the products and like make them accept like that part, I felt very strong about and I knew my commissions were higher, so it's like the products are very good and the, you get paid more.
43:27
And I just like I couldn't compute which meant that I had a distortion of reality.
I saw the world in a way that it wasn't and that hurt my business.
And so, when you're taking these lenses off and like Andy's squeegeeing, Your eyeballs right?
Yes, you can see things more clearly.
43:44
The thing that I missed was actually the soft stuff.
It was the brand stuff.
Actually, my creative director sent me a podcast.
My eighth podcast of all time.
I'll tell you the title, stop branding.
Because I felt so confident about the fact that I was like, you don't need a brand.
I was like, need a run at.
44:00
You do, cold and cold, cold cold Outreach.
I see, you're the guy I'm talking to you.
You're the dude.
I'm talking to saying hey, use those skills to build a brand.
Yeah, yeah dude.
And I didn't get it and the first like and what's happened is it's like Brick by Brick my belief.
44:15
In this verse was like okay brand and the direct response tough and knowing the hand-to-hand are equally important but the longer I've been doing this and you've been doing a longer than me the more I'm just like it.
Just brand over everything because if the Brand's right everything else follows and the reason that he didn't come over to quote my team was because I had no brand or I had a negative or whatever you say.
44:34
But like I didn't have a brand that was the strongest force from.
He didn't want to associate his brand with my brand, got it.
And that was the thing that I did that I just missed, I didn't get it.
And so as soon as I learned that lesson and it took me selling the companies and do other stuff too, like really reflect like what could I have done better?
44:50
Like that's why we built acquisition.com.
And I was like, I've so Think about getting customers, right?
There's like eight ways.
You can do it, you can you can reach out to your friends and family individually.
You can reach out to strangers individually.
You can post content or you can run paid ads.
Those are the four things that one person can do, leveraging, other people, you can get referrals.
45:08
So you get customers to tell people, you get Affiliates.
So you get other people who have businesses to refer their customers to you.
You can hire agencies to go get your customers or you can hire employees to do the first four, right?
Those are the only ways that Pete, like, you can get new new customers and I had built a business off of every one of them, except for Off of content.
45:25
And so I was like, with acquisition.com, I'm going to build it off context, I don't know how to do it.
So I'm going to figure it out and it was only through building content that.
I understand that it was all about brand.
Yeah, and what's weird is that when you do start building a brand or a personal brand, you realize if you do in my opinion, if you do it, the quote right way which is just give and you give and you give and you give and then you take a breath and you give and you give and you give and you give and you're like wait should I turn up?
45:47
You keep giving you keep giving and there's a there's a popular saying that Gary has it's like give give give sorta.
He says jab jab Jab.
Yeah, that's what it's jab.
Jab jab, right hook, right.
I think that that's actually the perfect ratio for a mature platform.
So if you actually look at television, the add to give ratio which the content, the actual shows is 47 minutes to 30 minutes.
46:09
It's jab, jab, jab?
Right hook recorders.
You look at Facebook which is a mature platform, it's 3, news news feed like from your friends and family, whatever.
And then an ad so that is the ratio for when you're maintaining your current level.
But if you look at the platforms that are trying to grow What is tic-tac-toe or when they were growing, what they didn't have any ads, they just who's all?
46:28
Yeah.
It was all give.
Right?
And so the Nuance at least how I understand it.
For that strategy if you're trying to build a brand is give give give until they ask which means that you just keep giving and if no one's asking you just keep fucking giving that and in my opinion that's my whole strategy.
46:44
Yeah.
Yeah.
As a person, all the players.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're like so there's you seen these ads in the drug response?
Rather like the the secret the 1% don't want you to know.
It's horseshit.
There is no secret but there are things that the 99% refuse to believe.
46:59
Yeah dude dude.
Big facts on that.
That's fucking cold.
And so like and I say this up because it because it I went like you I felt so much pain for such a long time because I just didn't understand the way the world Works especially as it related to business and so like if you can build the brand when you actually do it as I've now been doing it like you realize that you were wrong before like I can just tell you where is day, you know that this is the right way to do it and it's slower and you eat shit for a year or two years Or three years of you building it and what you're doing is you're finding your voice.
47:35
You're figuring out your values and your learning how to actually do it.
Because if every person who comes to you only came from just consuming value from you ahead of time, the type of the customers different.
How bought in they are?
They share your values.
And so it actually builds this base.
That becomes a pillar that you just keep that just keeps expanding on your calf and it becomes kind of like so little it's too little for you to notice until it becomes too big for you to ignore, right?
47:56
Like that's how compounding works.
If you start, you know, you invest in the S&P 500, hundred dollars every month, it becomes tiny and then all of a sudden, if you Open stoppable, you know what's crazy, dude?
Is, you know, I don't run ads on this show.
Not even my own shit, you know?
And When we pull people as to why they come by our products, it's one of the highest fucking polling things, you know, I'm saying?
48:16
They listen to the show, I don't ever talk about first form.
I don't ever talk about any of the other things I do except in passing, but I give my shit away for free.
No, like like it's like, dude you and I share that opinion.
Give your best shit away for free.
I fucking do it.
48:32
You know, anyway, the secrets.
Yeah, just give away all the secrets like, Mars more tactical stuff that I can't really talk.
Like like, like When you start saying like do this as higher-level.
Yeah.
You know, there's level a level level.
Yeah.
Right.
And like I'm not going to have podcast about that or I'm talking to this many people.
48:47
Yeah.
But dude, that's how I live man.
Really is people like, why don't you, why don't you take ads, why don't you do this, why don't you do that?
Because like, dude that's like I know that if I come on and and share with you guys and help you guys, you guys help me back and I think it's cool.
49:02
I think it's not, it's human nature.
There's actually science behind.
It was true, you know it too.
Yeah, one of the interesting.
The things that was a big belief breaker.
For me was I was actually really against making content for a long time and it was because I actually saw the content as temporary and I'm big on like long-term stuff and so it's like why would I make a short video that's going to disappear in the newsfeed and never get seen again.
49:23
Like it just felt like a complete waste of time.
But what I realized was that the media is not the compounding asset, the audience is the compounding asset and so you feed the content to the thing that compounds over the long run.
And that was like, it sounds so stupid.
49:38
Like I'd be so simple, whatever, painfully obvious.
I didn't get it.
So that was why for years?
I never made it as I was like, why would I make content?
Because it's going to disappear.
It's like, but the audience doesn't and they're the people who tell to people or four people etcetera and then that becomes the base and like I'm sharing this right now because like, it took me too long to figure it out, dude.
49:57
I think it's everything and I talked to a lot of business owners to who have an existing business, right?
They have.
See, here's the thing.
This is what.
I'm I'm thankful for my own journey is that I did start before the internet was around.
50:14
I did start before social media was even a thing, and that lesson that you talked about where your say, okay, you only have one person.
That was literally how I did it, like and I'm not exaggerating.
That was literally like the first day of fucking business.
I saw one person, second day, I saw a zero third day, I saw another person that person about $23 to me, eight fucking months to have a day of $200.
50:38
Recently had a buddy who started his own business.
He did a thousand dollars is first day, he's like.
Is that good?
I'm like Bro.
Fuck Yeah, that's good.
Like but did before the internet that was the real thing.
That was the really how you did it.
50:54
Like that's how you do it.
And so I try to communicate consistently and have over the, you know, the greater, you know, scale or course of my content over the years to make people understand that concept.
And that how How amazing our opportunity is now with technology.
51:14
If you can grasp that concept and you can translate it to this?
Yeah, dude, you're fucking on it.
And like these people, they get, they get so greedy with the idea of I can gain 100 customers or 500, customers are a thousand customers off of poster a sale or this or that motherfucker.
51:37
You're missing the boat.
You only One.
And you should pour everything into that one.
As if it's the only one, and if you do that across the spectrum of your entire, now, you have a machine that is compounding.
Excellent story about you Legend.
51:52
Word of Mouth.
However, the fuck you want to call it.
That's going to grow your business.
And dude, so many of these people that have these smaller businesses.
They're like, fuck that sounds like a lot of work, bro.
Blah blah blah.
Dude you you're seeing you you see 50 people a day.
Do you know what?
52:08
You can do with 50 people a day if you actually pour into them, like, it's insane and I've lived it.
So I know, like, I remember like I went from one customer 20 customers and dude, 10 years into our business, we still had days where we would have stores.
52:24
That wouldn't see anybody.
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
Like, but once we figured this out, like truly figured this out, everything fucking change, everything we went in the worst economy, up until 2020, that it ever existed between In 2008 2012 and it's all on the simple concept of what we're talking about, dude?
52:45
It's giving first, it's creating experience for people that is worth sharing, you know, unloading value over value over value over value to the point where they feel obligated to use you, right?
53:01
Which is what you're saying when they ask, right?
Like when they say, dude, you like when you're looking at?
How can I support?
Yeah.
Dude.
Hey, run.
My car for 5 grand.
Yeah, like that.
That's that dude.
I have so many people to hit me up and I appreciate the fuck out.
All you guys are like what can I do?
What can I do just support my shit.
53:16
That's all I ask.
Like if you're going to get in shape, use our shit if you're going to, you know, whatever whatever business, you know, like just support the people to give and I think it's I don't know man.
It's very once you figure that out and it clicks.
53:32
It's real simple and actually it's fun too because it's fun, feels good.
Yeah one dude, it feels fucking great.
One of my favorite things about business is not the big business, not the money dude, it's not like once you start, once you have enough money, it's like there's a there's a, there's diminishing returns to have more For me, that was what I could go to a restaurant and not look at the bill.
53:57
Okay, see, I would order appetizers.
Yeah, dude, really?
Yeah, you be serious, 100%.
Oh, this this moment, my explain this on the show, so you guys are listen, you know, this is true because I said this a hundred times my, my, my point to where it became diminishing returns, like, people think it's like my car collection, right?
54:16
Because I'm a huge car guy.
Have a great collection.
That's just my Hot Wheels, bro.
Like that's just me.
Me as a kid living outline, you know, little know-how wheels.
Yeah, it's cool.
I fucking like it.
If you don't get it that's fine.
You don't get it.
So my best friends in the world is great for networking.
54:32
You meet some of these people that you would never meet otherwise there's lots of pluses very little - it's cool as fuck troll up and some badass shit.
All right, but the point is, is that when you start to like, consider how much joy you get back for making more money for me, dude, it was very simple.
54:52
It was being able.
To go to dinner with whether just be mean you or whether it be this whole room or whether it be this whole company didn't fucking matter.
We go to dinner, you can order whatever the fuck you want.
And I don't have to look at the bill to pay it.
That's after that, like to me, it made no difference.
55:09
Like, it doesn't.
As long as I can do that.
Dude, it was.
Now after that, it was diminishing returns, I mean did it make a difference?
Yeah, fucking makes a difference.
I can fly private shit like that.
That's cool.
That's like a time machine.
I know you enjoy that too.
But, you know, and there's something to be said for that like dude, I could stay in my living room and two hours later.
55:28
Be in Manhattan.
You can't fucking do that.
Without the means to do it.
Like it's an incredible thing.
You've experienced a quite a bit, you know not bad commercial stuff.
It's the disparity between the two is.
55:45
It's yeah, it's worth.
It's worth the effort get there.
The results that way is because worth it but dude, it's yeah, no shit.
Dude, the funny thing is is like, it's after that, man.
It becomes more like, what do you really enjoy doing?
56:02
You know what I mean?
Like then it becomes a little bit more about the passion part of it.
Like when you when you have the means then you can be a little bit more luxurious with your decision.
Making about passions.
Yeah.
You get some cushion on mistakes.
Yeah.
For sure when a hard close, the audience on something.
Yeah.
So we were talking about, you know, giving making sure that the product is exceptional like, because We serve those are those are fucking.
56:24
That's those are automatics.
You have to do that.
Like everything we're saying here guys.
Like, there's certain prerequisites that have to be met, like, your product has to be fucking good.
It has to be what you say it is, it has the wow people when they open up this motherfucking first form energy can, which I'm not about to do an ad for but if I was it would probably look something like this.
56:47
All right?
But the point is, when they pop that shit open and they drink, it has to be fun.
Good.
If it's shit, yo, Doesn't matter how nice you are and I'm going to sell you on, why?
It's probably not.
Because some people are like, well, yeah, my thing is that good.
If it were that good, we talking about it and you wouldn't have an issue getting customer.
57:04
Yeah, that's my point because like I used to I used to not like I used to hear these speeches, these talks people way ahead of me was like, yeah, my subscribe, my stuff's great, I see more customers right.
There was always the, the thought process, but like every guy who's excited, the best lawyers, they don't need to Market.
57:19
In fact, they have a waiting list and it's impossible to get in there best investment.
Sirs, they have a waiting list is possible to get to them, like if you're very, very, very good.
You don't have a lack of customers.
Charlie Munger said, the next customers is on your desk.
It's the work in front of you and so like my love that because it's like yeah that's where the next customers.
57:35
He's like it's doing the work that's in front of you and they will always come.
But the hard clothes that I wanted to have on this with, with product is if you actually.
So we look at buying businesses, that's what we do, right?
And so we have to analyze the value of a business all the time.
And so you want something that compounds are because If you're trying to create wealth everything, everything comes down to inputs outputs, which is what do you put into a system and how much do you get out?
57:56
And so the wealthier, you get, you put Less in and you get more out and the one thing that all of us have is time and so it's really like, how much more do you get back for your time.
And so if you see if you have to sell, its a 50 customers, every single month, then as soon as you're selling that many customers, if you have a super transactional relationship, right?
58:14
If you do the same amount of marketing and every month you sell 50, it means that tomorrow or next month, the day you stop marketing.
Your company dies.
That is not a very valuable business.
And so if if you sell 50 and then next month, you sell 50 with the same marketing effort.
58:30
But the other 50, come back.
You now have 100, if you sell the same and the thing is that the marketing effort can be linear in nature.
Meaning you do the same level of marketing, but every month, you get more and more customers because you treated the first ones, right?
If you aren't growing and you're doing the same level of Market, it means the products not good enough.
58:49
I'm trying to sell you on this because like, I, Not at along with so many times, I'd listen to these things.
I'd be like, no, my products, good enough.
The reality is that you're just not as good as you think you are the market tells you.
Yeah.
The market tells you.
It's what you said a minute ago 99% of people, would you say they won't believe they've choose not to believe it.
59:09
The market fucking tells you dude.
Yeah.
And if you if you do have a business and you do have customers right now and you have the fucking blessing of having And people that are interested in your mediocre company.
Right now, you should fucking understand that the way to really compound that is to improve your product and then improve the fucking story.
59:32
They're going to tell about you by overwhelming them with Goodwill and and positive resources around what it is that they're trying to solve.
I got criticized by a just leave the nameless.
I got criticized, because I spent 30 5:00 my editor until his hours first place, my hours for the book that that's, that's coming out.
59:50
Yeah.
And they're like, What's the name of it Hunter million dollar leads.
All right, man in a few months when Ty is 99 Cents.
So there's light, there's my get-rich-quick laws and I saw this with the first book, because I spent a year writing that one too, and it was just me and it made no sense.
1:00:08
This is like, I had gym.
Watch.
I prestige Labs.
I'd Alan.
We had the, did you know deals on the like I didn't believe it.
You don't make money on books.
So I just throw it out there.
But what happened was, You can spend a year writing an exception, but I'm talking like six hours every day is the first six hours of my day when I'm freshest etcetera.
1:00:25
Reworking, only 160 Pages which is the first book, right?
And my launch for the book was a post.
When I had 10,000 followers, which is not a lot of followers.
I just was like, hey, I wrote this book.
Layla told me I should post it cause I was actually make it an internal like document, like this is how we think about making offers for all the companies and she's like, no, like how was it?
1:00:45
I was like, fine.
So I polished it and On that day on we have no ads.
We have no anything to like promote the book specifically.
And it sells more each next month than it did the month before every month, and it's now been 20 months, I think since hundred offers came out.
1:01:04
And now it says 25 to 28 thousand copies every month, Word of Mouth, sounds like a book.
I wrote called 75 hard, but it's exactly that.
And so you can actually fucking helps people guess what?
They're going to buy it.
And so you can either spend a year or two years building, an exceptional product service, experience software, whatever you want to thing, right?
1:01:27
And then let your customers market for the rest of your life or you can spend a month building a mediocre product or service.
And then the spend the rest of your life, trying to get people to buy it.
Dude, I did this shit like, before for like people don't understand before.
1:01:44
First form, there was other shit, excellent, right?
They were just wasn't good.
Yeah, It just wasn't good.
It, you know, people weren't going to buy it twice, you know, and I think that's a big mistake most people make and it's the inputs to outputs because everyone sees the year for the book that you wrote, right?
1:02:00
They see the year.
They see all the time you put in 75 hard right there.
Like that doesn't make any sense.
But if you think about how long life is, if the rest of time people are spreading that the input to Output of how much work.
It takes to spread the message and wider than you ever be able to do it.
1:02:16
If it was just you on your own, you get the highest leverage from thinking about it.
From that perspective if you spent a month on it and it was mediocre, you would have to pump it on every single podcast and it still wouldn't sell as many copies of stuff and you'd have to do it until you die.
Yeah.
And so like if you're thinking about having high leverage or high return on your time, it makes more sense.
1:02:35
Sense to spend more time.
Making the thing you have actually exceptional.
Keep doing it until people keep coming back and then the scale will happen but like it's an input.
It's a like it's a math equation.
How much of this do you?
Because like, I have my opinion on this, but like how much of this do you feel like Struggling businesses.
1:02:56
Like like this one idea that we're talking about, right here to me and my personal opinion, bro, this would fix 97% making this.
Yeah, but the vast vast that up, upper 95 percent of businesses could be fixed by just this thing we're talking about in the converse of that.
1:03:15
How many businesses that have exceptional?
The only thing that would drown a business that has an exceptional product as they be mispriced.
It's the only thing.
Like yeah, they're cost like they can't the economics of the business don't work.
Yeah.
That would mean.
That's the only you know you know how easy it is to fix.
That it changed the fucking price tag.
Yeah, that's how he's that.
1:03:31
It takes 2 seconds.
Right.
So if you want to have the like guarantee the ensure like you want success Insurance like what do I have to pay in order to make sure that I like I'm always covered?
Its make the thing exceptional.
Yeah.
And that's the thing is that most undeniably fucking great is that most people don't understand how much actual effort, it takes to make something exceptional.
1:03:51
Like, you know, I look at Some of the old presentations that I would make for my company and I'm like, embarrassed.
And that the thing is, I remember thinking, when I looked at it, I was like, this is exceptional at the time.
That was probably the best you could do.
Yeah.
And the thing is that, at the end of the day, the markets, the one who makes that decision not you.
1:04:07
So I might have and I think is, I probably was listening.
That's where the fucking disconnect happens, bro.
Because you think you think because it's the best that you did.
That is fucking great.
Yeah.
But in reality, the market says, nah, that's not as good as everybody else's shit.
I heard some That's real shit man.
1:04:24
Dude.
It's huge.
Yeah.
It's, I never thought about that until we just start talking about it like you like you because that's the best that you can fucking offer you, as you see.
It is the best.
Yeah, because it's your best.
Yes, van!
Fuck.
That's some powerful shit.
I heard this guy say this and I'd like, it's been like engraving my head so much.
1:04:42
So that whenever I don't want to do something, this is the actual phrase that comes to my head.
Is that he says, he said two things that I love one.
Was that he's like, Boys are confident men are certain.
I just wanted to share that.
I just love that saying.
The other thing is he's like it's not about doing your best, it's about doing what's required.
1:05:00
And whenever I have a hard thing like Mike I can make more videos for Content or whatever.
I don't want to do this podcast or whatever it is like literally my immediate thought that's like my subconscious is like I will do what's required?
Yeah.
Like that's always my initial thought and so right now, if the thing is things out as good as you think it is, right?
1:05:15
And people aren't coming back.
Like you made of you might have given it your best, but you didn't do what was required.
Word mmm.
Dude I'm sitting here thinking because like I'm going through this phase right now, that's very helpful to me personally.
Thank you for saying that because I'm going through this phase right now where I'm very financially comfortable like forever.
1:05:35
It is what it is.
And like some of the shit that is required.
Yeah, it's not really required, right?
Yeah, fuck that's some powerful shit because now I'm like fuck, dude.
It is kind of required.
It's not required because of you motherfucker.
1:05:52
It's require because other motherfuckers depend on you.
Yeah.
I guess the internal conflict.
Yeah.
So like, because I do my purpose is not me right, purpose is not me.
It's these dudes, these people out here.
It's yeah, it's these people listening.
Yeah, right.
It's it's fucking man.
1:06:09
That's some good shit.
You're smart dude.
Yeah bro.








0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else that is what creates an enduring.
Thing and that is what when you spend the extra time to make the product so good that people have to tell their friends about it, then that's where you get the unending scale and also is the where all the profit is right.
0:44
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
Right now, if you're not making the amount of money that you want to make, it's because the proxy has not good enough and it's really hard to confront that fact.
1:06
But if you really do and sit here, I can't tell you the amount of times I talk to entrepreneurs and they're like, man, if I just had more people, more people would just find out about my product.
Then all my problems will be solved, but the reality is that if you have any amount of customers then people already have found out about your product and for one reason or another, they have chosen not to tell anyone else about it and you have to sit with that for a second if the realize that like people have found out at very product and they're not refundable.
1:29
Bring people.
And you have to ask why, why are these people not sending me business?
And so one of the one of the first times, I heard a statement that I really liked about this was from Dan Kennedy and he said, most small entrepreneurs, try and get customers to make sales.
Bigger entrepreneurs.
1:47
Try to make sales to get customers.
And the difference is one person is all about trying to get to the money as fast as possible.
What do I need to say, to get this person?
Say yes.
What I need to say, to get this person to, by right?
How do I get the money right?
The other way, is, how do I make some sort of exchange so that I can now create a long-term relationship with this customer and continue to provide value over time.
2:07
One has a compounding View and perspective on time and value in.
The other is short-sighted and I can tell you the difference between the people who are Millionaires that I have that.
I'm friends with and people who are billionaires that I am friends with this is probably one of the most fundamental differences and so I was talking to a friend of mine, his worth over a billion and he was saying, he said, if it's not going to grow on its own over time, it's not worth doing.
2:32
And I really sat with that for a second and it was like if if I if you put in a one-time effort, like this is what this is how people who are the ultra-wealthy.
Think if you put one-time effort into something and it compounds over time and that is an Enterprise or a product that they want to continue to invest in on the flip side, if you have to consistently show up and consistently promote and consistently, get out there and sell and sell and do all this stuff.
2:57
Then what ends up happening is that the product itself is not good enough, right?
Because People in and of themselves are not referring business.
And so let me let me give you three questions that really changed, and hopefully will alter your perspective.
Like you did mine around product and service.
3:13
And so the first is, if I have an existing product or service and I were to make it ten times more expensive, so really think about the price so or you can say a hundred thousand dollars per million dollars.
Whatever it is right.
Just huge number and if that's how much are you charging for it, what would I need to do?
3:28
What would the experience thing to be over?
The product need to deliver?
Were in order to for it to be worth that much.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
3:45
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, What happens?
You start thinking in a very different type of mindset about how much value you have to create, right?
4:03
And so, that is the first question that I asked.
There's two more in the third one's, my favorite, I'll get to in a second.
The second question I ask is, if this product that I have cost one tenth as much as it does right now, but I had to make it better than it.
Currently is, what would I need to do?
4:19
What one time assets.
What I need to create that would consistently provide value that I could do at scale.
That could I could do profitably, right?
So, First question, If This Were 10 times expensive or a hundred thousand or million dollars is what I charge for my product, what would it need to be?
4:37
What would the experience need to be?
And what value would I need to deliver in order for it to be worth that much?
The second question is if it were one-tenth the cost but I had to make it better than my current product or service.
What else would I create or do or make in order to facilitate that outcome?
4:54
And the third question, which is probably my favor, which I think underpins the entire ideology that that I'm hitting on here is if I had a business and I will only allow to sell one more customer and the rest of the growth of my business had to come from that customer without me, asking as in the, that customers experience was so remarkable was so positive with so amazing that they they alone had to on their own volition.
5:20
Tell other people about my service, what would need to happen?
What would need to happen to create that experience.
And when thinking about all three of these product frames, I like them because they kind of hit on different aspects of the product.
The first question, which is 100,000 won.
The million dollar question hits on value, which is how do I create the most value in the product itself?
5:42
The second question hits on the profit of the product because if it's one-tenth the cost and I have to make it better, this means I don't have to do high-margin one-time investment type things to make the entire product, more valuable, right?
So that it's on profit.
So first is the value of the product.
The second is the profit to me, right?
5:57
As a business owner and the third question hits on the experience, which is what's the customer experience, which is everything else that surrounds the product that we're selling or service that we're selling, right?
What is the experience that has to occur in order for this customer to become a raving fan?
That the it's so good that the remark about it, they cannot help themselves with remark about it.
6:17
And what's interesting is that every super wealthy person that I know pretty much exclusively talks about product and usually, the really Small people that I know only talk about promotion and promotion, should really only exists to get your product right?
And then once it is right, then you can juice it and then let it go and take care of itself.
6:37
And the reason that it's so important at least in my opinion is that if you think about the six ways of getting customers, right?
And if you don't know what those are, it's paid.
Media earned media.
So Paid media is advertising right?
And promotions earned media is followings right?
If you have any kind of organic following the third is through your contact list.
6:54
So, On your phone and your email list a set of the, you already own their contact information.
The fourth is through manual a pound.
So that's DM's cold emails, cold calls, cold, all of that stuff for you.
Reach out to people.
The fifth is through Philly, it.
So Partners who can promote your stuff and the 6th, which is the most powerful and the only one that compounds is word of mouth.
7:15
So, think about that for a second.
Every of the other five ways of acquire customers is not compounding.
Those are linearly scaled, right.
Means if you double the amount of outbound people, you have, you double the amount of customers that you get, if you double your ad spend, you might be able to double the amount of customers.
7:33
You get, sometimes it's less than that, but you get the idea they skill relatively linearly, right?
Whereas word-of-mouth referrals, which is the 6 way of getting customers is the only one that compounds it multiplies rather than is additive.
Alright, if you get two people to tell to people and those people tell to people that it continues to compound and that is what creates Enterprise Value that is what creates An enduring thing and that is what when you spend the extra time to make the product, so good.
7:59
That people have to tell their friends about it.
Then that's where you get the unending scale.
And also is where all the profit is, right.
You'll have to worry about the turn as much because the product.
So good.
You don't have to worry about the negative reviews because the product so good.
You don't have to worry about customers bad-mouthing you because instead they're telling their friends about how good you are and this has been one of the shifts that has been most helpful for me.
8:20
And honestly what I when I look back on my own trajectory how much I talk about?
That promotion in the beginning of my career versus now, I talk so much more about people in product and and anyways, I wanted to share this with you because it was I could tell you how good I am at this kind of stuff.
8:37
Anyways, the real nuts of this is that Everything that the ultra-wealthy do is compounding, it grows with time where time become an asset, instead of a liability.
And if everything you do, you have to go out and get more business.
8:52
Go out and get more business, go out and get more business, right?
It means that it requires effort every single day.
Whereas if you put a lot of front-end effort, which is the investment which is the patient's, right to make the thing that much better in the beginning, then it will pay you in dividends over time.
And most people skip that step because they just want to make the first sale.
9:11
They're just trying to get a Customer to make a sale rather than trying to make a sale to get a customer.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
This is what's going to keep them popping and continue to convert and which happens is you don't have to, to change the backend, right?
You have to change the actual business model, how you make money?
It's just changing the front.
0:35
It The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt to documenting the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
0:51
I hope you share and enjoy.
Super Pawn to make this podcast for you.
I have so many things that I want to share with everyone because I'm writing this book and I just finished it yesterday.
I'm still working on the title but basically it's going to be about how to make magical offers so offer.
1:09
So good.
That people feel stupid saying, no and I walk through the different monetization structures that we've discovered over there are time and a lot of the med spa offers that created the business.
So we have.
So one of the subsections of a subsection Inside of this book is naming the actual offers.
1:29
And so I figured out make this for you guys because I see a lot of people struggling with making the offers especially in local markets convert, right?
And so one of the key pieces, I think for understanding the differences, you have a the offer, like the monetization structure, which is behind the scenes, which is what you're gonna sell in the person comes in of the upsells.
1:50
And then you have the naming convention like what you can actually wrap around that.
To the general marketplace, right?
And so over, you know, for years, you may not actually change the monetization structure of the business, but you may change the naming Convention of the thing that your show to the marketplace 20 times, right?
2:07
And so the, the magic offer headlight formula that I put together is actually an acronym to make it easy to remember.
All right?
So magic magicc, right stands for em, the magnet.
So what's the, what's the magnetic reason?
2:24
Why some going to click is it free is a discounted is, it's springtime.
Like there's got to be a reason for why we're doing the offer.
That's the end in Magic, a is Avatar.
So the avatars to know that it's specifically for that.
So the idea is a trying to discriminate against everyone else, all right?
2:41
So this would be like, you know, be cave, mobs, right, or dentists, right?
These are like, you know, older dentist or dentist making over 20,000 a month, whatever?
Right?
Sesame discriminatory nature.
So first is Grabbing their attention with ammonite.
Magnetic reason why and Hayes Avatar.
3:00
So you're discriminating against everyone else in just calling it your avatar.
Gee, he's the goal, right?
What's the goal of this thing that we're marketing to them right?
If it's a you know pain-free is that the goal is little black dress.
The goal is you know filled up Clinic the go like what's the goal right?
3:19
That's the G.
The eye is indicate a tie.
Interval, right?
You want to give them some sort of time interval, that this is going to happen in, right?
So, 12 weeks, six months, 30 days, six hours, whatever it is, right?
3:35
It's just the eye is the interval of time and then C is the container, right?
So you have these four things, you got the thing that grab their attention, give them the reason why Reggie discriminated for exactly who you're looking for, which is the Avatar.
Hey, you gave them the goal that they're gonna get really excited about G.
3:52
You told them, when it's going to happen, And I and then finally have to package all that together into a container, right?
And that's in some in sometimes they should call the power word but I like using the word container because you're just kind of containing all these things in this word so that's incubator intensive challenge, blueprint system Sprint, kickoff jumpstart like all of those things are container words for the first four Park this.
4:18
And so when I'm looking at trying to make headlines for things are different variations, bad lines.
You might make. 10 different variations.
If you use that, the acronym magic, right?
The magnet, the Avatar, the goal, the interval, and the container.
You'll be able to make quick variations of these things for the same offer in terms of monetization structure to the marketplace.
4:41
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
4:59
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight.
Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
5:17
All right, so you can in this will keep your ads fresh, right?
This is what's going to keep them popping and continue to convert and which happens is, you don't have to change the back end, right?
You have to change the actual business model, how you make money.
It's just changing the front.
It and so with any of these things, the things especially that you're going to be switching will be the duration of time.
5:39
It may be the goal, they may be the reason why the magnet right now, who you're calling out to the Avatar.
It's unlikely to change.
Want to be specific, but we were looking for within a local market, you might want to you might, you might call out specific.
If you're calling out men versus women, you're gonna probably of different looking creative, different-looking funnels.
5:57
If you're calling this people out, right?
If you're calling out men over, 40 verses twenty old guys, very different creative, very different copy, very different everything, right?
And so that business that you have or you might be serving might serve a specific type of clientele or even if they don't you can sub segment out the type of clients in and you have higher converting offers because to that discriminatory That specific Avatar, this goal might be better than the goal for a 35 year, old mom, right?
6:23
Very different.
And so big picture in creating that formula I like having acronyms that are easy to remember and so magical offer so magic headlines.
So magnetic Avatar is called out, goal, intentions or interval and then And container, right?
6:43
And so I have a nice cool little graphic that goes with it.
That's in the book, the books like 320 pages right now.
So I'm super excited about it because you love it.
First people have said it to maybe they said it's really good.
And I'm pretty excited because I think you guys will all immediately be able to make a lot more money.
7:03
The entire first half, the book is about basically creating the single offer and then the second half of the book is all the tactics.
Monetization the different ways you can weave in three different ways you can weave in discount offers and still drag as much cash as possible up front.
7:19
So anyways, hope you guys dig that, would you guys write that down?
Use that for your creative teams?
When you guys are making offers, especially in a local Marketplace.
Like that's what I was like if you're if you're marketing nationally or marking to be, you don't need a very idea offers you nearly as much, but when you're marketing b2c and like a local market, you've got to change headlines.
7:41
All the time.
You don't have any, you need to change headlines, very frequently, a lot of time.
You know, every 12 weeks, every, every, every month, sometimes you have to change the wrapper for the thing.
It's not that you're changing the thing, your offer, but you can make sure that you're getting around Banner blindness.
And so they're all like, oh, I've already seen this thing.
So, anyway, so that was well before you have to make sense, hope that gives you a easy contract to think through making headlines, you don't need to use all five of them when you're making your head like a sometimes I'd like to get along.
8:07
So in my my thought process around, this is what I found you.
His make it as short as possible but no shorter, right?
Ideally hit off, hit all five but if you feel like some of them get too long, then you can chop off, one of them, one of the pieces and it's an interesting example of this would be sometimes, there are container words that kind of shit to need.
8:29
So like if I said a free six week, summer slim down, I've got free and summer, which are both kind of magnet Tori.
Reason.
Why words I've got six weeks, which is the duration, right?
And then slim down some Down is kind of both a goal, but it's also a container.
8:46
And so words can be can have multiple uses within it.
And so I would need to add like container sister.
Sorry, I like lean down blueprint, like it just would seem kind of duplicative.
And so being selective about the words that you're choosing, ultimately allow you to have more brevity the headline, and make them punchier.
9:01
And the extra bonus points that you get for this, that you can get any of those aspects to rhyme.
It will count for two








0:00
If people have to treat you a certain way for you to be happy, then it means that your happiness is in their hands.
I get asked about mindset a lot on podcast.
They're like when you're building a business or you're building your career, there are stressors that come into play.
How we manage the circumstances or the conditions that come to us dictates how our life turns out.
0:18
Everybody has bad stuff happen.
You probably believed and nodded your head like, yeah, everyone has stuff happen and then we choose to make it bad or good.
Imagine.
For a second, two children that are playing.
One child tells the other child your nose is really big or you're fat.
Interesting is that the child who hears it is unaffected and the child who says it is unaffected.
0:37
They're like, you're fat and he's like, huh.
Parent comes in and overhears it and she's like, Oh my God, takes the child that was called fat.
Humphreys them, gives them the expectation that they should be upset.
And then tells the other one that that was bad.
And in a moment there was something that is now traumatic that otherwise wouldn't have been.
0:56
And so when we're kids, we walk into the world with no meaning.
All we do is we observe.
And then whatever the adults around us tell us and say, this means that we take his fact and it's not true.
It's their interpretation of the world and we inherit them.
And then we spend the rest of our life trying to undo and examine these beliefs that we have been told by people that we probably don't agree with.
1:16
When something bothers you, pull it out and look at it and say.
What happened and why is this bad and what would it look like if it were good?
And so the two tools that I use are time and volume.
The volume example is thinking okay I'm in traffic.
1:32
If this happened every day would I be upset?
If it happened every day, I'd probably expect it, which means that I would not be upset about it because it's just how things always are.
If you want to make it positive, you say, well, what if every time I got in the car, normally it would take an hour and today it took 30?
I'd be pretty excited about it.
And so all we did is just change the volume on the circumstance to recalibrate the meaning that we're choosing to ascribe to it good or bad.
1:55
I like to think of circumstances a lot like weather, which is like you've got sunny days and you've got rainy days.
And the problem in my opinion, is that people, any day that it rains, they say is bad and any day that's sunny they say is good, when in reality it just is.
It's just the weather contrast is what create the quote good and bad.
2:14
When reality there's just a middle line and half of it's above and half of it's below, then what we can do is artificially move the line in our minds by saying whatever this circumstance is, what would it look like if it were worse?
And what would it look like if it were worse all the time?
And if so?
And maybe today's a good thing.
2:29
The 2nd frame that I like to use is time. 100 years out.
But 10,000 years out, how much is this going to matter?
The reason something affects you is because you have deemed it meaningful.
You've said it matters.
It's my worldview that nothing matters with a capital F like nothing matters in the universe.
2:46
It doesn't matter.
There's this statue of a head that's in the sands of Egypt, all right?
And it's bigger than this whole room.
It's just the head.
It's worn out and then it's scripted along.
The forehead says here lies.
Crazy name who owned everything that the eye could see.
The immortal of Soandso and the only thing that was left was a worn out statue.
3:04
Had that no one knew who he was and it was 5000 years old.
If that guy who ruled the known world to him, wealth probably mattered, right?
But does it matter?
No, probably not.
I've relieved a lot of the pressure in my life so that I could make better decisions by zooming way out and thinking 10,000 years from now will this matter?
3:23
And if the answer is no.
Does it matter to me?
And then if I can make the decision of like good or bad based on my new context that I created, then I can live a life a lot easier.
And so for me that helped me decrease anxiety.
It helped me decrease sadness around certain circumstances.
And I'll give you the last example of this.
3:38
So I had a cat named Bill.
Chill Bill, rest in peace, homie, love the cat.
He died like some freak heart thing or something.
So he died in like 2 years.
When he died I was bucked.
I was like, this sucks.
Then I thought to myself, what if cats only normally live six months?
How stoked would I be that he lived four times the normal length of a normal cat?
3:56
I was like, I'd probably be really stoked.
I'd be like, dude, he lived a long life.
I can't believe we had him this long, and all of a sudden my perspective around the death completely changed.
I was like, I was so grateful that I got to have him as long as I did.
When you play with time and you play with volume, First off we have to be aware of the levers of meaning that exist.
And then once you're aware of them, you can start moving them in your favor and then looking at your current conditions through different lenses and say what would this mean if it were amazing?
4:18
What would the conditions have to be in order for this to be an awesome thing?
And then all of a sudden you just exit the game of happy, sad and get to be your own game maker.
At least that's what I tried to do when I get upset.
Look at it, pull it apart thing like is this real?
Is this true?
Is anyone doing this perfectly?
No.
4:34
But simply being aware of the fact gives you a lot more control.








0:00
Have to be so good that they can't ignore you.
And when someone can't ignore you, then everyone then acquiesces they just comply there.
Like he's got you have to gain leverage over other people because of how much better you are at the thing and then when you have the leverage you can whatever you want.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:23
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
A lot of talk about this.
I mean I love talking about business because it's like I Think if you can see, if you can see the business World, clearly then it applies to every other aspect in life because like, I think entrepreneurship is the single greatest pass for personal development because it's the fastest feedback loop like they're very few other situations where you don't have.
0:43
Like the market is slap you right around.
Talk to your friends, about your good idea.
They're all going to tell you it's fucking good Now.
Launch the shit and now we'll find out if it's really good to get their credit card.
Yeah because people, yeah, that's right.
That's right, dude.
And and the feedback dude.
1:00
It's so good because like it's so true like it's it's such a, you learn so much about yourself, you learn so much about people and the real, the reality behind people.
I actually believe that you're paying customers are some of the most honest people that will give you the real shit.
1:16
Like sometimes I just asked ran customers like what they think about like how I'm doing or what is this, is that because I'm like, all right well this person feels strongly enough that they're willing to trade me my shit for their shit like the minute that I don't do it.
They're not going to do that anymore.
1:33
That's a hard thing for people to really process to man because the you like you said, the market will fucking punch you right in the face.
They will tell you that thing that you spent two years on giving your absolute fucking best, they will tell you in one day that it sucks.
And then you have to deal with it.
1:49
Ya like it, it's, there's no arguing with the market.
Like it's not like you guys, are you?
I'm good.
That's where people.
Fuck their shit up.
They give fucking so frustrated.
With the reality that they refuse to look at it instead if you would just look at it and say okay well this is what it says.
2:06
I'm going to make my adjustments.
I'm going to go again which is the whole game of business.
The whole game of business is developed shit.
Put it out, find out what's wrong?
Okay, that's wrong, fix it, put it out again.
Find out what's wrong again.
Dude, the defeat you get defeated a thousand fucking times before you get that fucking first Victory.
2:26
It's just the way it is and you might get I'm talking about Victory.
I'm not talking about, I'm talking about 46 million dollars and I'm talking about, you sold one thing to that guy.
That that one time I'm talking about a victory, not talking about a fucking win in the war.
2:44
It's just a, it's this way.
It is it's the way fucking is dude.
And like, people think it's glamorous.
They think it's like all these winds and all this shit and like throw it really isn't.
It's you got to be built for the fucking game and the game is get your balls kicked in every fucking day and then figure out how to get him kicked in a little less the next day and then maybe like move to the left a little bit so it doesn't get both of them.
3:06
You know I'm saying?
Like you start figuring out all the little tricks.
Like not get the fucking kick, right?
So Is really interesting from a from a topical perspective because one of the things that's benefited me as an investor now because it's technically my full-time job.
Yeah.
3:22
Is that you start to see businesses assets and you become your identity, becomes divorced from them.
And so, like, I'm looking at businesses and like, if I imagine, I buy a business.
Now, I own a hundred percent of it, if something happens, I'm not not heard about it.
The problem is that when you're starting out, your identity is wrapped into the business.
3:41
And so when you get feedback, you Call it failure.
And so then you think I'm a failure and so it just sits as a transitive property from like yeah, you know, High School, whatever.
It was like a personal attack.
Yeah, this is your thing.
Yes.
My thing.
I spent all my limited skill set and all of my effort Barney's account.
3:59
Yeah.
But see, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter that your skill set.
Your skill set is limited.
It just is.
That's what it is.
You're, you're not there yet, bro.
Like this is part of the process.
You're going to The skills are going to pay your bills, bro.
4:15
That's the reality.
And if we don't develop a skill set by being willing to be open, to hearing the critical feedback, how do you ever get better?
And this is why most people don't get better.
Most people don't get better because they can hear the truth.
If you redefine the work you're doing, this is just something that's been helpful for me.
4:32
If you redefine the work, you're doing as the job title that it falls under.
Because in the beginning, when you're a small business owner, you are all the jobs, right, you where all the hats and that's a figurative term.
But like here, Out here.
If you're not getting customers in the door, it might just mean like you're like, oh my marketing director sucks.
4:49
That's me really like, but my to my customer success guys.
Amazing, it's awesome.
Yeah.
And so if you can start thinking in terms of like and I know this is like I'm trying to go big business, small business but like if you start thinking about it in terms of like departments within your business, even though you are the head of all of the Department's, then you can start disassociating.
5:07
Because what's going to happen is if you are successful issue, keep listening stuff.
If you keep doing this stuff, you will gain enough success that you will actually have somebody who's going to fill that role for you.
And then all of a sudden, if they fail, you wouldn't be as butthurt about it, right?
But it's still your business and even when you get into the CEO hat, right?
5:22
Eventually.
I mean, we hire CEOs for, you know, the companies we own, like, you're just the owner.
Like, if Apple fucks up and your own stock of Apple, you're not like, oh my God, I suck.
It's like well no that product sucked or that messaging suck, the story, wasn't there, whatever it is.
And so if you can if you can start drawing the line and saying these are the functions of a business and I am Good at this function, the person who does this job is not good at this function.
5:45
Maybe I need somebody who is good at that function.
But then what happens is in my opinion, for me at least it's given me some buffer between the failure and me is bro.
I do the same shit.
I do a little differently.
Yeah.
So how I do this is when it's still to this day I guess when I have to do when I I pretend that I work for and if orsela yeah I pretend that when I show up here, ya are wherever I go, I work for this do.
6:12
Dude and he's over there right there.
He is right there in the picture right?
And I'm just a dude that works for that dude.
And so when I get feedback on the business, I'm like, okay well I got to fix that.
I don't take it like oh this is an attack on me because I work for that, right?
6:28
It's not that you'll just let any know.
Yeah, that's it.
Like I'm just going to say hey we're fixing this bro.
It's a weird.
It's a weird thing, but I do that too.
And especially when I have to make hard decisions like we have to make hard decisions and most of the time the hard decisions.
All ground Personnel, totally because you care about people and give a fuck.
6:47
It's it's, I have to answer to this person.
The, you know, I'm saying, and that person is not me even though it is actually.
You know what I mean?
Like it's such a weird thing that's so nuts.
Yeah, different dude.
Yeah, that's how I describe it as I described it and you guys have heard me talk about this on the show.
7:03
I come in I fucking hang my my my hat, you know, being Andy, right?
I hang that on the wall and I put on my work uniform that I wear Work for Andy, right?
And like I'm walking around and make decisions that I think he would want to make, right.
7:18
It's so fucking weird that you do the same shit, dude, I feel like if you look at enough, people who end up doing, whatever you want to do, I think the things you have to do to get, there are surprisingly similar and so people have different names for them.
And if you see, listen to different podcasts or whatever it is, like, wherever your sources, information are look for the commonalities because, like, the end of the day, all of that just came down to for both of us disassociation The work from the identity and being able to step into the identity of the person who is required to do the job, whatever that job is, and to your point about personality, I think this is a one of the things that I struggled with really early on, was that my tolerance for mediocrity was very extremely high, very high tolerance, mediocrity.
8:02
When I started out because what happens is, like, like you can write this at, you can write this in your Journal like the best talent has yet.
To come, you don't even know the talent that is in the future of the people who are going to work for you.
You and you have to, you have to be the leader.
That's worthy of that person because like, right now, you're one Higher away from your entire business being transformed.
8:20
Like, if you look at like, as we can see this across the portfolio, we can see huge influx of inflection points in a business up or down, based on key hires.
So we put a key higher-end, huge inflection point.
There's very rarely a massive inflection point that happens without a key personnel, change, hire or fire or promote.
8:38
And so the thing is, is that that tolerance and this is again from the players like it, Little, we're giving that open the kimono of the players room.
If like how those people think is like, it's all about, it's all about the people.
They is your tolerance in your expectations of their performance.
8:54
And you think you have high standards until you've met a player who's ten times bigger than you're like, oh my God.
I didn't know that level of performance was possible because I remember my first, my first 50,000 all your employees because all my trainers were like 30 or 20 right here.
And I was like, whoa, I was like, this is the shit this one talk about and then I had My first 70,000, all your employees like all right, now we're talking now, my first hundred thousand and then 250,000 a year and my first million dollar your employee and I was like each time and I can't wait to hire my first ten million dollars a year in play.
9:23
I don't even don't even know.
They're out there and we're going to find them.
And you listen to Stephen schwarzman who's worth thirty six billion?
Who started Blackstone?
He says the biggest regret ever had was letting Larry Fink go Larry Fink owns Black Rock.
Yeah, right.
And what?
And he let him go even though he called him an 11 out of 10 in terms of his skill, set and soul.
9:43
The only way.
And if, if Steve schwarzman if I'm just paraphrasing him, he's way richer than I am.
If he had been the leader that he is today, when Larry Fink came to renegotiate, that contract, he would have been the person that Larry Fink would have continued to work for correct.
And so, like, that's where the whole becoming aspect because like very quickly like your amount of time that you can do with your hands is tapped out, like as long as you have some level of work, ethic and you work all the hours.
10:06
They like there's not that many hours so that you have to work through other people.
And that's where the influence in the sales go.
Now we're going full circle on this, but like, yeah, If you have that skill, the world unlocks to you, because whatever problem, you have, there's a person who can fucking solve it.
I think there's a lesson there to, bro, for employees like, you know what you're talking about?
10:21
Bye.
You're like, I think a lot of employees believe that if they still believe this old shit that their parents taught them.
If you stick around long enough, eventually you move through and you get a raise you do this?
This is motherfucker.
Yeah, let me tell you the whole thing.
10:36
It's real simple learn some fucking skills real simple and then go execute them, whatever your role.
Is whatever it is.
You do how much money you're getting paid.
It's about giving first.
Okay, so if you can in your own time and giving you the fucking exact hack like all you motherfuckers think there's a hack this is the only hack okay?
10:56
This is it skills, pay the fucking bills, all right.
If you're making 30 fucking Grand a year and you want to make a hundred grand a year, you have to become skilled and offer value to make the company or whoever it is.
You work for say fuck that dude is worth 100 Grand.
I'm not let him fucking go and your job.
11:12
Job as an employee is to drive.
So much fucking value that you can literally extort your fucking boss.
You can walk into the office.
You say, hey motherfucker I'm leaving, are you got to pay me?
Yeah, and that's the fucking game.
Like that's the game.
And if you can figure out like you're like I said you're making 38 Grand right now and you're like, fuck dude, I'm getting underpaid, I'm about, you're not on her pain.
11:36
You're fucking out, underpaid your pain.
Exactly.
What the fucking value that you're offered is now if you think it should be.
Ebony Grand, or you take a should be seven hundred grand, then you have to learn the skills that the seven hundred thousand dollar employee and then, after you learn the skills, you've got to prove that they actually produce in a real-world environment, then you go in and you say, fucking pay me.
11:59
Hmm.
This is how to fuck it works.
Okay, so many people, especially young motherfuckers have a wrong idea about how the fuck this works.
You are not going to sit.
There you will, rot you will rot your life away.
You were not sit there and go from. 38 to 55, to 75, to 150, to your fucking dream, life being here, or there or anywhere that's existing dude.
12:23
And that's the fucking mentality that is, I think it comes from parents who try to instill the proper values into these kids.
Not because, but they can't, because they don't understand, they don't understand themselves, because they never fucking did it, right?
12:41
Sort of like, oh, stay loyal.
Just Showing up, you know, that's that's good.
That ain't good enough, what's good?
Enough is I want to be here.
What does the skill set of this person up here?
Have, what is that surround yourself with people and learning and fuck do we got fucking YouTube?
12:59
Dude, you can fucking look up how to change the O-rings on a fucking washing machine or you could spend it to look at, you know, bullshit fucking people.
This this guy destroyed his his Lamborghini Uris or you can watch really fucking wealthy people, teach you how to fucking have skills.
13:19
And then then you could take those skills and you can go to your place of business, and you can display those skills and be a fucking Superstar.
Like those are your choices, like, either watch the bullshit or wash it that actually helps.
It's free.
Dude, there's so much free game on the fucking internet.
13:35
Like for somebody like me, who started with no internet.
No social.
This is like a point of like super frustration because I'm like, what the Fuck is wrong with you guys?
Like what the fuck is wrong with the with the generation from 32 fucking 20 right now?
13:51
You motherfuckers have all this free game in your fucking face.
All fucking day long and you want to watch someone drop a fucking wrecking ball on a fucking Lamborghini?
Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
And then you want to complain that you don't get paid enough and you're underpaid.
14:06
And this is under pity.
You're not underpaid.
Where to?
That's the market under-skilled do there.
That's it, dude.
That's a big.
And it's so dude.
It's it goes into the 99%.
You don't want to see the reality because you don't want to fucking admit that this is the truth.
14:22
Yeah.
But the quicker that you could admit the truth, the faster you can be who it is, you want to be and that's the reality of success.
Like dude it's very simple.
It's just you have to accept what it is and so many people want to look around.
They want to say oh, you know, they don't like me because I'm this or they don't want to do this because I'm mad or these fuckers, they blah, blah blah and Oh, this is a common thing on the internet.
14:45
I see this on the internet, all over the fucking place.
Now, people people jump from thing to thing to thing.
Other thing over here.
This thing, this, how the fuck can you learn any skills doing that?
Real Talk, how can you learn?
You can't, you know, we have to have this understanding that to get paid.
15:05
I've got to have the skill set.
And it seems like people have gotten away from like even understanding that basic basic reality do basic reality.
Yeah.
Are you good?
Or are you great?
How are you great?
Or are you undeniable?
Because I can tell you, the only motherfuckers to get rich.
15:22
Are the undeniable that's it and you could get Rich inside of a company or outside of a company, but it's the it's not.
Good is not the standard, great isn't even a standard, no motherfucker.
That owns a company is going to say, hey you know what, that guy's great.
15:38
I'm gonna fucking pay them.
A million bucks to do this, that's not what they're going to do, they're going to fucking pay you a little bit more for being a little bit more extra than everybody else.
But when you're undeniable, that's when you get to name your fucking price.
That's when you get to say no, dude, because you guys need this.
15:54
And if you don't have this, It costs this much and that's what it is like, to me.
It's very fucking clear and it's so rare that people can even understand this concept become put something out to you guys.
Let's talk to that demographic of 20 to 30, right?
Because I feel like one could argue that part of that issue and what we just got done talking about is information overload.
16:17
It's too much information out there.
So like do you guys have any tips or advice for that demographic, right?
Because like yeah, there's plenty of wealthy people.
People out there or the guru's the coaches, but is it information overload?
How do you siphon through that?
Like who should they be listening to?
16:32
How do you, how do you vet those people if you don't, you don't know what, you don't know, right?
So what do you guys have some tips on that?
Where do you want to start butting heads?
I mean, I think we're going to say saying, I don't think it's, I don't think it's information overload.
I think it's implementation under load.
16:50
People success shopping shit.
I'm gonna consume, consume consume, consume consume never execute.
Yeah, is like, so, this is an interesting one that might be worth for the audience.
I remember reading many, many, many self-help books, when I was like, in my path, before I quit my job and I realized that after like the tenth book, I was like my life's the same.
17:11
And so it shifted.
The way I saw things is I actually never consumed a piece of sales training until I had after I'd already built a massive sales team, like I was like oh yeah we should get some other Besides just me because I was like, I'm sure other people have done like that, but I was so, like, confident at that thing.
And so like, if you want to learn a skill read, okay, I'm going to say something, might be getting a little contrarian I don't think you should read books.
17:34
I think you should do it and then read, Because if you read a book on sales, you've never done a sale, you will have no context from which to actually understand the information.
It's just going to float around in your brain but it won't have a want like a matte think of it like ornaments on a Christmas tree and this.
Try it before you start reading, right?
You just need to have yeah education.
17:51
You have to have a point of reference.
Yes.
Exactly.
Because otherwise you can't hang the knowledge on it.
Yeah.
So you're just reading all these Chapel you have a good rapport with a fair that's a fair take.
So I because Every school live.
Like I think one of the things that's undervalued is one-on-one tutoring.
So when I so I've done a lot of things for learning the like skills but one of what I wanted to learn how to do National retargeting Facebook ads, is years ago, this is me.
18:15
When I was still running them, it's like learn this.
And so I got on the phone with an agency owner and he was like I don't so my time it was like it's America.
Everybody tells the time he was like five, four, seven, fifty an hour.
I was like so and this is I did not have a lot of money this point and so I showed up one hour once a week and I was like Deal is I have to use the mouse.
18:33
I have to click and I'm going to do it but you have to explain what you're thinking of why you'd make the adjustments.
It only took me eight sessions with the guy to learn how to do the thing cost.
Me six grand that skill made me millions and so it's like, if you do the thing, you'll have ref point of reference to hang the thing on.
18:50
And I make this point because and I'm a little bit extreme on it because everyone always has another reason to feel like they need to be more prepared.
And they think that getting reading more information or watching more videos is going to make them more prepared but you will learn more in your first 100 cold calls than you will from every single book.
You have read.
19:05
I like what you're saying.
Dude, I think that's an important point.
I actually agree with it.
People probably surprised that that I would agree with that because I talk about reading so much because I've learned old shit on from Reading, sure.
Huge advocate really used to be clear but the thing that you pointed out that I haven't communicated, is that I was also doing while I was reading, right?
19:23
And that's a huge deal and that just no, no.
But see I took that for granted because I've been doing this thing since I was 19, right?
So I've always been doing here in the game, right?
Yeah.
And every so that that's a port important important point of contacts.
For something that I never realized.
19:40
Like a lot of people do kind of sit there and they're not doing at all.
And they're just Consuming consuming consuming consuming go and consume at the same time and you'll get exponentially better.
There was a Ted Talk on this but it takes.
That's a fucking great Point.
19:56
Yeah, I love it.
Yeah there was a TED Talk and the guy talks about how to learn most to become proficient in most skills.
It takes 20 hours.
It's all you want to learn the guitar.
It's like the 80s.
Like you'll learn 80% of what you need to learn the guitar and the first 20 hours.
20:12
The last to be clear though, the Mastery comes from the next 20.
But for everyone who's intimidated by it, it takes 20 hours to learn to get proficient when I wanted to learn to build a landing page like a website.
I put it off for four years like she hired it guys and I got so frustrated.
20:30
One day I was like I'm gonna fucking learn how to do this and so I sat down on a Sunday is looking for hours to build a page and you spent four years fucking with not doing it?
Yeah, and so it's like I've in the thing is, it's like we don't even fear failing, we feel we fear feeling stupid Least for me.
20:46
Yeah.
I just like I don't want to feel like a fucking or looking stupid.
Yeah, look yeah, exactly.
Yeah, feel you're looking ship.
And so like, if for me just knowing that that stat that I'm like, I'm 20 hours away from learning something that made it way.
Not this, like amorphous.
Like, how am I going to learn how to be like, in 20 hours?
21:03
I can look at a week and be like, here's 45 our trunks.
I'll learn it.
Yeah, I'll become proficient.
Yeah.
And with YouTube, there literally are step-by-step tutorials, he didn't have to pay nowadays.
I could have just Googled how to retarget bubble, but by God, Not have that.
So I had to hire a guy to do it but like we could, you could Google it just do it.
21:22
And so there were two points, I want to make when you're making the employee thing.
Got to go like, yeah.
But you stay in poverty until you learn all the lessons of poverty has to teach you.
The first lesson of poverty is my fault.
It's it like it's my fault that I'm here.
21:38
The second point that I wanted to make was with regards to employees leveling up.
We talked about how like you want to network with people above you, you do all the work before the meeting.
You do it as though, it were a paid project that someone had hired you to do if you start doing the job that you want, while also doing the job that you're paid for, you'll it will become inevitable.
22:03
That you will get that job because you're already doing it.
And so if you front the work, if if somebody on Andy's teams, like dude, I think we should get on Snapchat and if you're on S, what I'm just making this up, right?
And it's It already cut up the next 30 days worth of stuff.
Already did this thing already.
Did it.
There's two things that I haven't won.
22:19
I can virtually guarantee you that he'd be like if you can run it, run it.
Either, he will give you a raise like, dude, because of the increasing responsibility, I'll give you the pay bump.
Sure, but the Smart Ones, have you be like, no, I'm just here for the brand, like, you can, you can deny, like, you're smart.
22:36
You'll deny, the short term, pay bump, and you'll gain the long-term Goodwill because he will recognize you as a player.
I'm telling you, this is what the people in the room like they see each other, like he's a winner.
Yeah, I already know it.
Yeah.
Like this is how you do it.
This is how you move up.
And that's I love the way you said undeniable because like one of the other rules Of poverty.
22:54
Is that no one wants you to be rich.
And no one's going to give you the riches.
No, yeah.
Like no one wants you to be rich.
Like you have to want to be rich, and you have to make it.
I mean, this is Steve.
Martin thing, which is like you have to be so good that they can't ignore you.
That's it.
And and when someone can't ignore you, then everyone then acquiesces they just comply there.
23:13
Like he's got you have to gain leverage over other people because of how much better you are at the thing and then when you have the leverage you can whatever you want, dude?
It's by the way, I want to clarify.
I love my fucking employees.
These guys get it here.
We promote from within It's a, it's a, these guys get it.
23:31
So I but like, I'm talking about what I observed in general, and you know what you said, dude?
Like it's poverty.
It's there's very few people on Earth, contrary to the social fucking environment that we live in.
And this is this is the dose of reality to a lot of people don't like to hear.
23:49
There's very few people that aren't exactly where they deserved to fucking be very fucking few, very fucking few, very few exceptions.
Kept, if you look on the internet, everybody deserves to be better.
Everybody deserves to be with it, bro.
You deserve what the fuck you got.
24:06
And because what you've done has produced what you have now, if you want something else, you're going to have to do the things that produce the other thing and then that will become what you deserve.
And so stop thinking of it that you deserve anything, because the reality is there's nobody out there to things you deserve, fucking anything sub you That's a big problem in the culture, dude.
24:26
We can't fucking sit here and say, oh, I deserve I deserve I deserve.
Look around you, dude.
Look at the car, you drive.
Look at your bank account.
Look at the person you're with look at where you live.
Look Elvis, shit.
That's what you fucking deserve.
Because that's the actions.
24:42
That's the result of the actions that you've taken to produce this.
And the great thing is we live in this three-dimensional Wells, more than three dimensional who actually talked about it, that's the other episode.
Well, yeah.
About hope that's a whole different thing.
We live in this multi-dimensional world, that is a blank canvas for us to create in.
25:03
And so like when you sit there and you say, I deserve better.
But you're angry about what you have.
Now, you've created a situation where you are not even capable of producing any better, because you think you're getting fucked on what you actually deserve, which isn't even the truth.
25:19
The truth is its inputs and fucking outputs.
It's one plus one.
It was motherfucking to and there's nothing that can change that.
There's not an opinion.
There's not a temper tantrum, there's not a social movement, there's not a fucking hash tag.
There's nothing that can fucking change that and if you want a different result then you must acknowledge.
25:39
It is my decision and my fault as to why I'm here and you can blame your fucking parents.
If you're young, you could be 20 years old listening.
This we have.
Well, I didn't have.
But listen, bro, you may not have had much opportunity yet, but take what I'm saying now?
Apply it because it may not apply to you at 20 years old because maybe you are the circumstances of an unhealthy environment.
26:01
Maybe you were born into a shit situation.
There's lots of people that were a whole lot of people.
In fact, most people, okay?
But the reality, and what separates people from staying there.
And people who escaped that is not defining their identity as someone who's being screwed saying, I deserve better, you don't deserve better.
26:24
Are you can create better but you don't deserve it.
And by the way once you create it, you still don't deserve it.
You're just producing a result from the actions that you take.
Yeah, if you plan to fucking see and you go out and water it, some shits going to grow because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
26:44
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for them.
Employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
27:05
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
It's that simple and that's how we have to look at reality because that's actually how it works.
There's very few people out there that have been born into such a shitty situation or have such shitty circumstances that they cannot move forward as I'll say this in America.
27:26
Maybe other places here in United States, we have a scenario where we have a culture that feels entitled to literally every luxury on the fucking planet for breathing.
That is not how it works at all and if you're going to live your life like that, if you're going to continue to go down the path of Life thinking that because you're born, you're special and you because you breathe, you deserve to have all these things that these other people have.
27:55
You're going to be disappointed and you're going to be better and you're going to be frustrating.
Guess what?
Yank I have shit ever.
That's how it works.
So, you know, I it's hard for me.
Because I understood this from the beginning, like when I this was not something I had to learn, this was something I understood.
28:12
And the beginning, when I was 19 years old and I was broke as fuck.
And I spent my fucking only twelve thousand dollars that I had to start supplement, superstores, which turned into fucking all kinds of different shit over the course of time.
I did not expect anybody to fucking do anything for me, I expected that.
28:32
Okay, I expected to be rich and fucking a year because I was a stupid kid.
Okay.
But after that year went by, and I wasn't rich.
In fact, I still haven't gotten paid.
Here's how I looked at it.
I said, well, I got a year into this.
I don't want to throw away that year.
All right, so I'll do another year, another year student.
28:49
Get fucking paid.
All right, I looked at the same well, now, I got two years in this.
I know a little bit still didn't get paid.
I got paid off my third year and I said okay well I got three years are starting to get paid.
I don't throw that away.
So I just kept fucking going and that's how I ended up here and like When I say we're going to do X and you guys think I'm full of shit.
29:11
I already know it's going to happen because I know how it works.
I know the game, I know this is fucking chess, not Checkers.
I know how to play fucking chest very fucking well at this point in time, you know, how I learned to play chess, bro.
My get my ass kicked by other motherfuckers would play chess better than me.
All right, and we go and we keep going, we going going?
29:29
And like now I consider like yes there's days of course, where I'm like, dude, fuck this.
I don't want to do this shit.
But you know what I say.
Bro, you got 24 years in this.
Why the fuck would you throw that away?
You learned all this shit?
You got all this opportunity.
Now, you have an opportunity to build something iconic, you've built a successful company.
29:46
Now you can build something iconic.
Who has that opportunity.
Not very many, not very many people ever get to that.
So like I just continue to roll it over, roll it over all over but to say, I deserve it because I've been doing it for twenty.
Four years is an absurd statement.
30:02
It's fucking absurdity.
I don't deserve shit.
I deserve exactly what produces from the input side put in and that is fucking it.
And like dude if the whole world like if you guys could understand this right now and operate this way for the rest of your life, you're going to have a successful fulfilling fucking life.
30:20
But this idea of deserving because you breathe or learning, because you put your time in.
Those are those are those do not compute in reality distortions.
Yeah, they are it's time and does not equal result skills equal results and applied skills equal results.
30:36
Now actually not even skills, equal result applied skills, equal result, I'm super pumped, they said all that stuff about deserving because it's probably my least favorite word in the world language like in a few key thing and I love that you The point at the end there, which is like, I've been doing this work like, because I'll be able, like, they still like you deserve.
30:52
I was like, I did it, and they're like, well, you earned it.
I'm like, no.
Like I did these activities and this is the outcome, and I wish to tell that to people because I was like, I don't think I deserve to success.
Yeah.
It was like and that's not like a mental limitation in terms of like I've got sabotaging thoughts or limiting beliefs.
31:08
It's like, no.
Like I don't think I just don't think anyone deserves success.
But what you can do is you can still do the stuff that gets it.
Yeah.
It's like you don't deserve the Hot girl that you want is like you can still do the stuff that gets her.
Yeah.
Right.
By the way, when you eliminate the idea of deserving, it actually creates more gratitude for it.
31:26
Yeah.
Okay.
So like when you when you when you, when you don't deserve the success and you realize you don't deserve it and you realize that it's a result of the of what you did here right now.
All the sudden you're like, okay well I did this it created this, I definitely don't deserve it but I'm very glad it's here.
31:42
It's easy to be grateful.
Yeah.
I want to talk about blaming power, right?
Yeah let's do it.
So I said first, the first lesson of poverty is to were it's my fault right now.
I'm sure that there's there's some people spending their tops right now.
Oh yeah.
On that idea.
And I want to I want to own a lean into this for a second because you may have suffered racial inequality you may have suffered gender inequality, you may have been born in Bangladesh.
32:06
You may have been born, you know.
I mean like we can you be a bit had your uncle rape you every single day as a child that's fucked up, I'm not denying it.
But where you place, the blame is where the power goes.
And so I had this realization when I was 19 years old, I was a very angry kid and I blamed my parents for who I was where I was Etc and I resented both my parents at that time.
32:29
My life pretty hardcore did not like them.
And I had this realization that I was blaming them for my life and then what that meant was because I translated, because I had to hit my own ego on this.
I was like, then that means that they're the ones who have passed.
32:44
Power over me.
These people that I don't at the time that I don't like I'm giving them the power over me, not being successful and so wherever you point, the finger of blame is where the power goes until.
Eventually it points at your chest.
33:00
That's when the first day of your like real life begins.
Because you're like, you know what, all these things happen, I had all of these things that were unequal or unfair whatever you want to call it.
The terrible Uncle thing horrible, I'm still here.
You're still there.
33:15
Yeah, you're still here and first row entrepreneurship.
Use what you got, right?
And so, if you can accept that it is your fault.
It's an awful way of saying it's your responsibility, because like, if you blame the parent, you blame the uncle.
You blame your race.
And I know I'm going to get a lot of heat on that because I'm because I'm not hearing my guys right now.
33:31
That's really.
The thing is, is that like if you blame that then it means that.
That's where you put the Power.
Yeah.
And so it's like that 100%.
I'm not 100%.
Maybe true comma.
So what so what now, well, you have Yeah, you have.
No now what?
Okay, we all acknowledge it now what?
33:48
It's as simple as it gets dude.
And like, what are you gonna do?
Is spend your whole fucking life telling that fucking sad story, that, that honestly, all your friends and family were fucking tired of hearing anyway, like they really are like, I've been talking about my shoulder being fucked up for fucking two years now, 18 months, and it's a legitimate thing.
34:05
I have my shoulder completely reconstructed.
I fucking lost.
My entire physique, I've been working my fucking ass off, and I had thing after thing.
After thing, happened to me in a row and it's a fucking terrible shit story.
But you know what?
I'm not 350 pounds.
Like a fucking used to be.
I'm a pretty good fucking shape and I consider that a massive test passed passed.
34:24
What am I going to do now for the rest of time?
Am I going to do?
Am I going to quit training and I'm going to quit lifting and I must say phone shoulder.
Yeah.
Like what are you going to do?
Like that's some weak ass shit dude.
Like that's why I haven't even talking about it on my fucking stories like because I'm like God I'm fucking tired.
34:43
Don't say like and dude the truth of the matter is to Alex is like all of you guys.
Listening.
Do you guys have these excuse?
And yeah, the mountains going to be big.
It's going to fucking take some time to climb, but there's people who have like, not only like people there's not like one or two people, there's fucking thousands, probably millions of people who have faced the same exact adversity if not worse.
35:08
That have become what it is that you were looking to become so if they can fucking do that.
After going through all the same exact shit even worse.
Shit the what the The fuck.
Are we talking about?
That means it's possible.
That means it's actually a very real thing.
35:24
What?
One, man, can do another can do, it's a real fucking thing.
And the disadvantage is that you have, right now.
If you think about yourself as the hero of your own story, right?
What creates the strength of the hero?
The obstacle, the monster, the bigger, the monster, the bigger the hero, right?
35:42
And so I remember in the early days when I was, I was really going for it.
I used to tell myself that this is gonna be part of the story, I would tell.
And so, like the the many disadvantages that you have become advantages to the story that you have, because sure, if you asked white guy born to well-off Dad, you know what I mean?
36:02
He's a doctor, you know.
Yeah, cool.
That was my life.
And I so here's a story, I will never be able.
So I'll never be able to say that.
I was a black man, born in Africa who made it.
Although I can't who got, who was, you know, an orphan and had been raped and some in kick it.
36:19
I can never tell that story but there is a guy who can and so, like, if you have those disadvantages to you you become you can become the hero of that story and you become a bigger hero than I am.
Or Andy could be because of the things that you are that you had the opportunity to overcome And so like that becomes the part of the story that you can tell, and those becomes the monsters that you say.
36:41
And also paved, the path for everybody behind you.
Who doesn't think it's possible.
That's the key.
The key is that last part, why not work to be the example of the person who overcomes the shit.
So that other people who are in your scenario, will see you as a guide through the fucking Forest of how to get from, where you are to where you want to be like, bro, what's more noble than that?
37:05
I just I don't think I don't think there's much more noble than that like bad creating a life that guides other people out of their fucking shit into the life.
They want to live through your own story.
Not your made-up shit.
Not the fucking fake.
I'm standing in front of my fucking Huracan and this is my story bullshit.
37:24
I'm talking about your real fucking story.
Your real shit.
Dave Stewart here in St.
Louis blackmail.
You know, that they grew up group black black?
I grew up was probably the richest dude in this in this City's.
He I mean I would say in the Midwest, for sure.
37:40
Dude, grew up in up and fucking North st.
Louis.
And Ferguson one of the fucking shittiest parts of the entire you all know Ferguson y'all heard of it before, because we've had fucking riots here.
Great area.
Actually great people in that area.
But it has been known to be a very rough area.
37:57
Historically, and it was a rough area for that man during that time, and this dude has come through now.
He's a little bit older now, but he He's built worldwide Technologies, he's overcome all kinds of shit.
And this dude has with his life experience painted a real fucking path for other black men who come from those neighborhoods to believe that they can actually do similar things.
38:21
What is more noble than that?
What the fuck is more noble than that?
And he's also paid at the same time, like, you fucking?
He's fucking loaded.
Yeah.
There's a lot.
Yeah.
But I mean dude like your obstacles and you're overcoming is the nobility.
38:42
Like there is no nobility and victimhood bro.
There's a tension in victimhood.
There's shares and victimhood.
There's fake comments and victimhood.
Let's only online.
That's not a real room or tell you something new.
Like when you start telling that sad-ass story on Instagram, dude and you get those likes and those comments, those aren't the likes and comments of that.
39:00
You actually want in fact, most of those people, probably wish you shut up.
Being real.
Because I know I do when I see their over and over and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over and over, no, not the same fucking shit over and over and over and over and over.
Like I'm like, shut the fuck up, dude.
39:15
What you do about it?
Like and and I'm not the, I'm just the one telling you that like everybody else thinks, you know, you guys are all their lawyer and he says what everybody's thinking, well I'm telling you right now, that's what the fuck, people think.
And then they think, when you like want to hang out and you want to fuck, they're like I'm not fucking hanging out with that person or persons a drag, they say, The energy right out of me.
39:36
Like, dude, there's no nobility in that.
There's no nobility, staying a victim, there's no nobility.
And, and me telling a story of how I got stabbed fucking 20 years ago, which actually is coming up 20 years this year and talking about how ruined my life for 20 fucking years.
39:55
I could have chosen and said oh dude you know this dude fucking stab me in the shit happened and I can say it fucked up my life.
It gave me PTSD.
Gave me kentuc Cushing's syndrome, which a fucking date.
I got white lesions, all over my fucking brain because of it and I live with that shit, my whole life.
40:11
Okay, I can fucking tell that story and everybody every single person will be justified like, fuck.
That's some fucked-up shit, right?
But what the fuck else would it do?
If I'd be the person, I'd be the old man.
Now who don't have shit?
Who doesn't have fucking anything?
40:27
Who's not out here?
You know hopefully you know some of you guys have been inspired by me.
I'm not doing that shit because I believe I Own Story.
Stay in that spot.
You can't stay in that spot dude.
It's a bad fucking spot to be and there's no nobility in it.
The only nobility cup and there's no nobility and fucking pacifying it.
40:44
Either the nobility comes in overcoming the nobility comes and creating such it's what you said.
Success is the only Revenge.
It's not the ultimate Revenge, it's the only fucking Revenge.
The path that you're on that you're trying to create.
You getting to that point where it's undeniable that you have achieved that to wear every single human being that has ever fucked with.
41:04
You whatsoever that thought there's no way, it's not going to happen.
There's no way they're going to do that.
Which by the way, I've been told all of it, my whole fucking life.
I don't have to say a motherfucking word anymore.
I don't have to say anything, I don't talk shit.
I don't say, hey, watch what I do, or this is day.
41:22
One or wait until you see me motherfucker shoes know, they know.
Okay.
And because they know and because that story is undeniable other people that come from the same fucking Hood.
I came from Over here in South st.
Louis, those people look at that and they say, fuck, dude, if that do did it, I'm fucking do it.
41:40
And that's the whole point.
That's the whole point of the journey were on, dude, because stories are passed down.
Generationally they're not It's not just about us, it's not just about what's going on today.
It's not just about your Instagram following.
It's about what fucking life are.
41:55
You actually living?
And what message does that life's end?
And how does it actually affect the people coming behind you?
Because dude, to me, you know, I'm a little bit older than you and a little bit older than probably a lot of you guys listening.
Like that's all I really think about anymore.
42:11
Like I don't think about like what can I get, what can I do?
But I think about like all right, fuck dude.
How can I make this so great?
That people fucking are inspired by it, not not in a little way but in a massive way, how can it change people's lives by just living that story and like, dude, you guys all every single human being listen to this right now.
42:29
Has that opportunity, bro, you have a blank canvas, you have a blank canvas in front of your fucking face that you get to create with and a lot of you motherfuckers are ruining it because you're sitting there saying, I deserve better well then do better.
It's that simple.
You can spend the same energy justifying your victimhood as justifying your success.
42:47
Yes, yeah, man.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, wrong about that or any other she said today.
So anyway, do we're going on three hours, man.
This is like a record for us, any closing, thoughts, man.
I really appreciate you making the time to come out beyond the show.
43:08
Dude, that was like I was texting and he's like a little kid.
I was like 14 days.
Yeah, like wow, I was reciprocating those facts because I was just excited.
In fact, I told DJ that today, I said dude I'm excited to do the show with Alex because I truly believe.
43:23
Bro, out of all the people I've come across that you have one of the best entrepreneur brains going out there and you know that I I mean, I should like it is very obvious.
Obvious, like, it's from an operator, to an operator, right?
43:38
Like, like there's guys that have put out content, you like.
Yeah, that's true.
That's good stuff.
Like that's good.
Then there's guys, and there's people to put out content that most people are like, what the fuck does that mean?
And that you can only really understand it if you're actually operating and you're one of those guys man I appreciate everything you do and all the content you put out and I think it's what you've done is fucking amazing and it's cool as fuck to like be your friend and like just hear all this shit dude, because like it's very, it's very parallel.
44:05
Well, for my journey like very, very, very parallel.
It's fucking cool, dude.
I'm incredibly honored to be here.
I was looking forward to it.
A ton.
I mean you're an inspiration, in terms of what you have built like you will build the iconic company because you won't stop.
44:24
I don't know how you don't know else, right?
And and I think you know for the audience On a long enough, time Horizon.
If you gain the repetitions, you can.
So I'm going to redefine success real quick.
So if you think about any worthwhile Endeavor, they're actually not finite games, their infinite games and so a finite game, Simon sinek popularized, this a little bit but I'll just recap it real quick.
44:48
Final game is where you have known players agreed upon rules and agreed upon way of winning.
An infinite game is a game where there are known and unknown players.
There are no rules and the only point of the game is to keep the I'm going and so where people fail is that, they apply a finite contract to an infinite game.
45:06
So like The u.s. lost in Vietnam because Vietnam was just trying to stay alive.
That was all they were trying to do.
They were trying to win.
They weren't going to stop, trying to stay alive.
Exactly.
And so we try to have a finite outcome to an infinite game, that's why we lost.
And so people try like most games worth playing, you can't win, you can only play so marriage.
45:26
For example, you're not going to win marriage.
You the point of marriage is to keep the marriage, going at Health, you don't win Health, the point of getting healthy, being in shape is to stay in shape.
You don't win at business.
The point is to stay in business and to stay in the game and to keep playing.
45:44
And I think when I redefine that all of a sudden, I realized that by being in the arena, I was a success.
And so, I was able to enjoy the fact that, by that definition of success.
I was winning.
And so, I think if, if we are able to and anyone who's listening is able to remove the expectation of some finite outcome, that's going to happen.
46:02
Because I promise you all of us here in this room of achieve some goal, then we just move the goalposts, right?
It's more just a game you play with your Self just like you when you're on the cardio machine and you're like okay, 30 minutes is 3 tens, you're like, okay, it's 56 has already hearing you play the game, but the thing is is like with with all of the games that are worth playing, they have fact that you can play them as what makes them worth the effort.
46:23
And so I think that if you can redefine that, then it means you can't lose.
And if you have a fear of failure, making your games infinite games, guarantees Victory.
I love that, dude.
It's fucking true too.
I spent the first First.
Eighteen years being in business.
46:42
Not realizing that I could have enjoyed that entire process.
Yeah, because because I lack that perspective, you just said I could have enjoyed that entire process because I'm still going to get there.
Can I throw something else in real?
Quick are so old person said, this will you don't realize when you're young, is it it's always the good old days.
47:06
Yeah.
That like for some reason that like hit me because I was like, I think, you know, I talked about the time when I was sleeping on the gym floor and at that point I was like, this is not feel like the good old days, you know, when I was a little more successful like, man, I remember when I sleep on the floor, when I had like six years before I lost it all again, right?
And then going through all the shit that happened that you heard.
You know, the beginning this podcast, like I was like, man, this is horrible.
47:24
I can't breathe right?
But they're like, I look back on that.
I'm like, man, those were the good old days like I was forging me.
Yeah.
You know at that time.
And so it's trying to put on my hat of saying, like right now, I'm in the good.
Old days.
Yeah, a future me.
Yeah.
And that's been like a really helpful frame in terms of thinking like how to enjoy it a little bit more.
47:42
And the other way I've tried to think through this, I'm gonna give you a couple things and help audience, or helped me a lot, but I'm a, I struggle with gratitude.
I'm not, I'm not good at it and so I've had a couple of these things and so I have to focus on it too.
Yeah.
47:58
One of them was whatever we're doing right now, many times.
It might be the last time you do it.
Like I, my last sleepover.
I was 11 years old or something with a friend if I had known that, that was the last sleepover I was ever going to have probably would appreciate it more but there's a lot of lasts that we do before we die.
48:14
We think that let me die.
Like that's it's like the last time you might go to Europe and like backpack might be in your 20s.
Yeah.
And like I'm never going back in Europe.
Like I accepted.
I was like, it's never gonna happen.
I've just had a point like, I'm that's not going to happen and so I was like, wow, I missed that like that's it's never going to happen and if you're in that whatever your phases there's these things that will be your last.
48:31
And if you can appreciate them for that, they just taste a little bit sweeter and And the last frame that's helped me out as I called the grandfather frame, but try this out one time.
Even like if you're driving or working out right now, Imagine you are.
You're 85 year old self.
Like you're really old and that you woke up today in your body as it currently is.
48:51
It's a weird.
It's like it's kind of trippy to think about it but like if you're 85 years old and I'm actually here, like I zoomed in to this moment, dude, this is fucking awesome.
Not be like, and he's so young.
Yeah.
Because I remember because I'm 85.
Yeah, and I know what you look like in really fast like to man.
My knees don't hurt.
49:06
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
My uh, my shoulder right now.
Look at Leyland, I remember when you were this young, right man?
We were just getting, you know, we Just build an acquisition of Howard's in our first or second year, like this is so cool.
Like and all of a sudden my morning coffee becomes this reliving of a moment that I have when I'm 85 years old and it's just been something that's like, I try and practice these things because I think they're like muscles like yeah.
49:27
No, I keep remembering those frames.
And so, like, I think that if you can practice those while you're in the game and in the arena, it makes it a little sweeter even the very painful losses.
Well, I love that, dude.
That's, that's an awesome perspective.
49:43
That's and never even thought about like that.
I struggle with that shit to I think when you're ambitious bro it's hard.
It's you struggle with gratitude.
Yeah, part to be satisfied.

0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
This is what causes emotional disturbance in people.
This is also why people don't buy these are all powerless statements.
So this is basically the victim handbook is how you become a victim of your own life or how our prospects become victims of their own lives.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:37
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
So sorry you had to go through the my third introduction.
You're like, you know, I know who he is.
0:55
You spoke yesterday and the day before.
No, I appreciate you guys.
So today will be different than the first presentation I did.
So, first one is a very new style.
You guys like that one?
That's style.
Kind of like, Cool.
That was like a five.
So I was like, okay I'll take that.
1:13
It was funny cause I got off stage and I was like, man.
That's like, I don't know if he was as tight as I want it to be.
Who's like and Caleb.
My head of media actually now director of brand was like that was the first time ever done that, right?
I was like yeah.
He's like I'm going to use your words back to you.
It would be unreasonable that you were good at that.
He's like I can't wait to see the 100th one.
1:29
I was like.
Yeah, cool.
So I do that stuff, too.
Just to be transparent with you.
That being said we're going to do A cool Deep dive together on a topic that I click, you know, hold near and dear to my heart which is closing, all right.
And so there are different styles of sales.
1:47
There are some of you guys who kind of lean on your own story, a lot when you sell like I got in shape and I know how you feel.
I think a little bit of that is lazy selling when I stir first started with some of my newer trainers, they would lean on their story as the reason that they could close.
2:04
But that meant that they could only close people who were related to their story.
And so it's like they could do really well with 25 year old girls, but if you had a fifth year old guy command, they were fucked.
And so in the beginning, sometimes we lean on the few things that we're good at.
But over time you want to become a generalist, in terms of just understanding the psychology behind persuasion.
2:22
Now, the big difference in this, my big caveat here and I'll probably include in the presentation is that from a sales ethics perspective, the difference between help and manipulation is intention at the end of the day.
Either way, you're going to change someone's Behavior or your intention is to change.
Someone's Behavior.
Now, if you want To help the person.
2:39
It's a good thing if you want to manipulate them and hurt them, ultimately it's a bad thing.
And if you think about sales as an education process overall, which is how I see it, if the prospect knew everything that you knew they should make the decision to buy.
Now if you're being really honest with yourself, if the prospect, you're everything that you knew and then they would choose not to buy, then you are deceiving them, which is no 10 and that was is what makes you feel shitty.
3:03
It's also what happens when anyone here ever had a salesperson come in, start crushing it and then go down anyone.
So what happens is they learned more about your product.
And then they don't want to hurt people.
And so they stopped selling like they don't do it consciously but they just don't want to like right when it gets to the point where they really have to lean in, to like get this person across the line, they won't do it because deep down, they don't believe.
3:26
And so barring all the stuff that I'll cover today, which is a lot of the I would consider myself more of a logical closer because I like presenting, like, let's play both these scenarios out, let's see what it looks like and it makes sense for you.
Awesome.
And I believe that logical closing has the best long-term.
3:43
Um's for people.
Like I can get everyone really Rod, get someone over the line and then they regret it the next day and then they call you back or they don't really buy into the concept because thing is that today?
They're excited tomorrow, they're excited.
But two weeks from now when they have it as many carbs and their cheeks are all flushed and they feel like shit, all of a sudden, the emotions are gone.
4:01
And so if the emotions were they needed, in order to make the decision, I want the logic to still be there so they can remember.
Oh yeah, that is this still makes sense.
Right?
So I tend to lean towards being a little bit more of a logical.
Salesman, if you want to call it that and I think it served me well.
4:16
So I want to give you some Frameworks that I use really to help yourself make decisions but also help your clients make decisions and fundamentally.
That's why I think sales is helping people make decisions to help themselves.
Cool.
All right, rock and roll.
So great decision making and selling with logic to make lots of money.
4:34
Fantastic.
So this person is will be the best presentation on sales.
You've ever heard the worst presentation on sales you've ever heard or somewhere in between?
That is a promise.
All right, thank you.
I was saying he was awake.
So Charlie Munger big hero of mine.
He said we have a high moral responsibility to be rational.
4:52
And I think that's how I kind of approach selling and persuading and trying to get people to do the thing that would help them.
All right?
And so what is being rational or logical have to do with selling right?
Sometimes you got logical buyers.
Sometimes you got emotional buyers, there are different types of people who buy in different styles just like they're different selling Styles different buying Styles right?
5:08
Like maybe you and your spouse or your partner whatever.
You know one of you is like Go do this thing and was like hey let's get all the information, right different styles and so most people sit on this continuum.
Quick Test who identifies here is more of an emotional buyer.
5:25
I don't see that as a Bad Thing by the way.
Okay, who here identifies more?
Logical?
Buyer.
Cool.
Interesting.
One of the things that I've noticed just an observation is that the higher up in the business world, you get the more logical buyers, you have the fewer emotional buyers you have.
So I want you to put both hats on while you're thinking through this, because many of your clients will be emotional buyers.
5:49
And you may be more of a logical buyer and that just changes over time the more exposure to sales in general and marketing in general you get the more honest a jaded but the more accustomed to it you becomes kind of like Banner blindness and so you kind of shift on this Continuum over time, who's in between you identify as in between, all right, never mind.
6:10
Okay, so great, you'll love this sales for all people.
So before we get started a few beliefs about selling that, Serve me.
Well, one is that people want to believe you, they want to buy, you'd have to help their logical brains justify the decision.
6:26
Like must be, we're like, hey, I can make you a lot more money.
They want to believe you just have to have them Justified.
Hey, I can help you get in your high school jeans.
I can make you look the way you did 20 years ago.
You try to help them just, they just want, they want to believe you.
You try to help them silly happens before you ask closing happens after all right?
6:44
So everything that happens until you say, here's the money, here's the amount that I need for this thing.
All of that is sales for me.
I Define closing as the moment you present the offer, everything after that is closing.
And to be clear that is what I'm going to be talking about today is just the Red Zone. 3, it's easier to handle obstacles than objections obstacles.
7:05
Are we?
You handle before objections?
Which you happen?
Handle.
After that being said, expect in plan for.
No, it's not failure.
It's expected.
So, stop being surprised.
It's one of the biggest things I see with new sales, people who are just getting to say, health is a Freak out when someone says no, thank you.
7:22
I need to think about it.
I'm not sure I got to talk to my spouse.
Not sure if it's a fit for me.
I don't make fast decisions.
The side of the card, I want to use on me, right?
They say these things, like I say, it's like this is what you trained for because if they were just going to buy, then you wouldn't be needed.
If they already knew that they needed this thing, then they wouldn't be struggling with it to begin with like the sale is the first part of the coaching relationship in my opinion.
7:47
And this one is also really good one to train say.
Those people with is that if you didn't get a gasp from the price tag, they didn't go high enough.
And so I like this a lot because then It prepares us and we shoot for what we used to be afraid of like meeting, get a gas but they're like, it's a lot.
You're like, I know like it's a lot.
8:08
Hey keep PJ.
Okay.
So selling properly is the first step to becoming a coach or first impression the expectations, you set to dictate the relationship.
All right, how you handle this first conversation?
Many of you seen research on First Impressions, right?
It's a lot harder to change a first impression.
8:25
Well, the first impression of your business is the sale.
And so a lot of things happen here, like, oftentimes, you can change ltvs turn simply by changing the expectations.
You set in the sale, one conversation, dictates how months of service are taking in selling is helping prospects, make decision to help themselves.
8:44
So that earlier, keep the prospect not the sale as the priority because it's not about you.
And And I don't know if I have this on here but the person who cares the most about the prospect ultimately wins.
Think about that for a second.
So if you care more about them than they care about them, you will win because you'll have the leverage because you really want to help them, and then you will be kind, not nice.
9:07
You'll ask the hard questions, if someone objects seek to understand not to argue or be, right?
This is something that took me more time to understand is like, if someone objective, To buying.
If you keep a curious hat on, you can keep in that frame.
9:24
For as long as you want.
You just keep saying curious like, huh?
That's so weird.
I wouldn't have thought that way.
Why do you think that right?
As soon as you get into, like, your fists up of like, well, let me prove you wrong.
It's kind of like Dale Carnegie's.
Like no one wins an argument.
Like you don't win the sale by being right.
Getting them to want to buy, is the ultimate objective, right?
9:45
Because if they feel like they made the decision, then you'll also get By and later.
And so you can't be combative, it's much more of a dance that I think is one of these other ones.
So, maintain childlike, curiosity at all times.
Closing is a dance, not a fight.
It is seduction, not rape.
All right, that's the one that wakes everyone up in the morning.
10:02
All right?
The idea is like, it's a dance.
It's fluid.
You're moving, right?
It's not coercion.
It's not forced.
And this is a big one.
This what I was hitting on earlier is that selling is a transference of belief over a bridge of trust.
All right, so you have to have belief in order to transfer it sometimes your new salespeople have belief.
10:19
They gain trust and they transfer it and then they learn more about your company and then they have less trust and even its are they have left less belief and even though they have trust with the prospect because they have trust, they don't transfer the belief because they don't have it anymore.
They used to, they thought you were all that and now they don't and so they can't transfer, because there's nothing there.
10:40
And so, anyone ever met somebody who became like like a born again?
Christian.
I don't want to put a term on anyone change religious beliefs, like, you know, Anyone like in your life.
Okay?
So one of the really interesting things at least that I've observed is that like, if someone comes to me and does he have to be religious thing?
10:59
It's just an easy one to to observe is that they're so convicted in their new belief that you start to question your like maybe they are.
Right.
Right.
And the thing is is that like the best sales tool is belief and I keep repeating this because I'm going to see if I'm going to turn a wholesale Cimarron.
11:20
All the stuff I'm going to show you is is the hand-to-hand stuff.
You got to memorize the stuff.
You got to know this stuff but this is like the sets and Reps, right?
Of sales.
But if the team doesn't believe it just doesn't matter.
I got flown in to turn the sales team around years ago, years years ago and it was a mortgage sales company and they were selling mortgage leads.
11:41
And first the morning I rewrote the script repositioned it blah blah blah and the afternoon.
They want me to train the guys so I got on the sales floor.
They Gather everybody around.
They wanted me to do like a Glengarry, Glen Ross, if you've seen that scene like always be closing and so you only like rally the troops up and so I sat down and I was like, who's the guy who having issues with like John looks like John how good are the leads that's what they were selling.
12:06
It's like how good are the leads.
He's like, well there and I was like I'm good.
Thanks man, and I was like, it was a simple question.
I was like, if you believed you would have been like dude these leads are so good.
Right now, I'm studying for my real estate exam so I can start taking these leaves.
12:22
I got my aunt to quit her job so that she can start taking these.
My uncle is a realtor.
So I'm selling him Lee's right now and honestly, I hope that in 12 weeks.
I'll be out of this role so I can start doing these two.
Looks like that's what it sounds like when you believe you don't believe.
So.
Of course you don't sell as like, it doesn't matter.
12:37
And I ripped up the script to be all dramatic.
I was like, doesn't matter.
What's the words on here?
I was like you guys don't believe.
It's not like none of this will matter and then they want in close to punch, right?
But it was like, it's about the belief.
More than anything.
And so if you need to fix that, fix that first with you or your team, and for the things that, you know, you should do to fix the product to make a better onboarding experience.
12:58
Etcetera, do that because the thing is, is that when you do that, you will approach the cell differently because you be so confident.
What your, what Your what your delivery you can only build trust.
If you generally want to help and humans are exceptionally good at sniffing out intention like we've got thousands of years of adaptation and evolution to help us see who's lying to us.
13:18
And so it's like, Commission breath, I like that term a lot.
If you have commissioned breath, people can smell it.
And so, I think one of the big frame shifts that I like to do.
When I approach a sale is like, it's about them.
I just want to help this person and if I guess I have to reset myself.
Every time I get into the room right, before, I sit down with somebody's keeping that intention to top of mind, which is human first.
13:38
It's like I want to prioritize this human, not the sale, but if you do that, they'll have a positive experience with you either way and you'll also close more deals.
This is a big one.
So I've talked about belief that talk about Bridge of trust.
They are continuum's, not binaries.
So you have to treat them that way.
It's not.
13:54
Do you have belief in your product?
You not have believe in your product?
Do you have trust with the prospect?
Or do they trust you or do they not trust you?
It's how much do they trust you?
How deep is your belief, right?
Because if they trust the shit out of you and your belief is miles deep in terms of how much you believe, how hard do you think will be to sell?
14:13
Not right.
And so a lot of us like did you build rapport?
It's not.
Did you build reports?
How much reported You build that make sense.
Okay, if you can start changing your language this way, then it also gives you an ability to continue to get better.
It's not like, oh yeah, I built Rapport, I have trust.
14:30
They believe me, right?
It doesn't work that way.
It's how much, it's to what extent?
Oops, wrong one.
There you go.
Closers ask our questions because they genuinely care.
Right.
These are the hard conversations.
It's funny because a lot of guys are really good at having hard conversation with prospects, but really bad at having our conversation with your team, you can have our conversation with your team.
14:47
It'll be easy with prospects.
The person cares, the most about the prospect wins the deal.
This is just a side note record all your sales, always, one of my biggest regrets in life is that I have four thousand undocumented sales like boy, wouldn't that be nice today?
I could use all this.
So please for the love of God document all these things.
15:05
Best Champions watch game footage.
The goal of closing is to get someone to decide not to buy.
And the thing is is that you actually have to believe this.
If you're training, your sales team and you're like this is what I want you to do.
I want you to help these people.
Decide, I don't want you to help get them to buy, I want you to help them decide and if their decision is to buy that's awesome, but that means that you reward them when they get someone to decide either way, this is different than many of you probably do this and this took me time.
15:31
So I'm just giving you the stuff that I've learned, all right, because if you do that, then you reward the activities rather than the outcome because they can only Lee control, like the sales team yourself included, can only control what you do, you can't control what they do, but what you can do is actually try and get them to confront the decision that they've been putting off for a long time.
15:48
And finally power is the ability to direct or influence people.
If you want to be powerful, you must learn this skill because fundamentally, if you can move mountains, you can move rooms.
You can get people to do stuff.
You have power, you have the ability to direct or influence other people, and so sales is power, and if that makes you feel, Queasy.
16:09
Then, I think you should check yourself and think, like, why do I not want to be powerful right?
Build hospitals.
Build bombs, right power.
And so I think for me I've eat up sales has been always near and dear to my heart because it's the thing.
If you like you want to make an impact.
16:25
It's like, well, what is an impact?
It means like influencing lots of people.
How do you influence lots of people?
We have to persuade them.
That's what we're doing, cool?
Okay, so, when to selling happen, when you engage the lead, when you qualify the lead when you Set the sail when you close the sale the entire time.
16:41
Now, what are we going to talk about today?
Closing the sale, everything you have to do, after asking for the sale to get someone to buy.
That's all we're going to talk about just the last five yards.
Okay.
And so here's an instance at for you.
And this is something that, you know, killing our talked about yesterday, which is if a gym owner knows how to close.
17:01
We're just not that worried about them because they can afford the most expensive leads they can sell for higher prices.
Because they know how to close their very few people in the fitness world that do not succeed.
If they know how to close, it's just hard to fail.
And I found this at and I thought was really interesting.
17:19
Is that the top five Red Zone office has made the playoffs, 90% of the time of all stats in football, top fine, offenses, in the Red Zone when the game is on the line when they need to close the deal.
Made the playoffs. 90% son doesn't wasn't about special.
17:36
Teams was about defense, wasn't about just in the Red Zone.
People can score when the games online, go to the playoffs. 90%.
I was like that's a good stat.
So if you want to be a top ten percent, Jim might be something worth having.
So here's how I have observed.
17:55
The breakdown of prospects when it comes to closing 10% of people never going to buy which means you can't get upset about the fact that someone is in by that's why we have to focus on getting To decide not necessarily to buy because otherwise, you're always gonna be upset.
On the other hand, 10% of people were going to buy if you were not.
There you were a scarecrow.
18:11
That just said please by question.
Mark got credit card question.
Mark right now. 80% of people need help deciding and this is why we trade and I think presenting this to your team is also really helpful.
Just so that they understand.
18:27
It's like this is what we trained for, it's for the 80% of people that need help.
That's why they're here.
If they knew how to make the decision on their own, and they wouldn't need our help, they would do it already.
And so if after this presentation, you just have one more bullet in your chamber.
One more play In Your Arsenal clothes when we drill per month, my goal is that that pays for this whole weekend for you.
18:42
Cool.
Okay.
Awesome.
There you go.
I even put a little thing there.
Okay.
One of my favorite sayings.
Is that your only one decision away from changing your life forever?
I love thinking about this.
When I think about talking to a prospect, it's like this decision could change their life forever, and that's a lot of power, right?
19:02
But instead of changing lives, this is what's interesting for me.
We blame think give power to sources outside of our control and this is exactly what the people walk in your gym and we do it ourselves every day.
And so, even though I said, originally that this is a talk on logical closing, what it really is, is talk on Power.
19:26
And so, the problem is that, most people cast their power, they become victims of their own lives because they point to other things to cast their power to this is us and our prospects.
And this is why so many people are Weak and Powerless.
And so I believe that if you can talk to somebody who is powerful and you can help them realize that they are powerful, then you talk to an empowered.
19:46
Cool.
Which believe it or not often by shit to help themselves.
Okay?
So we're going to do a fun activity day.
One, help you make a decision of yourself with whatever decisions you are facing in life.
Some of you guys have some hard decisions talking about two days ago, some conversations need to happen, right?
20:03
I don't know why these another one but number one, there you go.
Use these Frameworks to help prospects help themselves.
And finally, just become more powerful yourself.
Okay.
This is what we're going to do.
So rather than keep these hypothetical, I want you to visualize the decision that you need to make.
20:18
All right, so this is my favorite things from Confucius.
I hear.
And I forget, I Scene, I remember, I do and I understand, right.
You might have read a hundred books about sales, but your first hundred actual conversations, probably taught you more than all of them put together, right?
When you do it, you start to understand, it, starts to make sense.
All right?
So think through a decision, if you want, write it down, it doesn't matter to me as long as it's in your head.
20:38
Walk through these Asian making Frameworks for yourself because that way you can transfer them to other people.
Okay.
So who was presented with a decision last 24 hours?
Anyone?
Okay, Sandra.
Skip Ice Age was the good one.
Sarah.
Right.
20:54
Okay, whoo.
Things getting rid of Sarah or doing anything else.
Could better improve your life?
Yes.
Yeah.
Two people.
Fantastic.
Everyone else fucked.
So my goal is that I want to show you as though you were probably had Through decision.
21:10
All right, I can help others using this.
What I want?
What?
I don't want.
Cool.
Let's get this real quick sales, ethics.
I think I covered this earlier because I want to get to the so, helping someone make a decision help themselves.
As not being buying from you, it just means keeping them in their goals at the center of the decision, okay?
21:26
I keep repeating this because it's so important, and you should be happy.
If someone makes a decision, for themselves, independent of, whether they choose to work with you or not.
If you can get to that point, you'll be Untouchable because they have no leverage over you like that.
How you sell from your back foot is that if you were genuinely happy that if they make a decision and Empower decision, that's informed not to work with you.
21:47
You're like what a great day.
I hope this person out.
If you can get there, you become Untouchable because you don't need anything.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
22:05
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can fly anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And so most importantly how to make high stakes decisions and help your prospects to the same.
22:21
Cool.
So here's a fun delineation obstacles versus objections.
Who here has heard these terms.
Good.
Thank you.
Thank God.
Okay, who knows the difference?
Ah, so obstacles are a thing that blocks one's way or prevents or hinders progress when you disagree with something.
22:39
They say.
So you disagree with them, that is an obstacle Here's an example.
Hey, why'd you hop on the call today them, I just want to find out more about the program.
That's an obstacle.
They're giving me bullshit.
That's not why they hopped on.
They find out more about the program.
22:55
Perhaps I was too fat, right?
So either there I was like you don't spend all day hopping on information find out what programs?
Right?
No.
Well then why are you doing that?
Because I'm overweight, I don't like how I look.
I don't like I feel blah blah blah.
So you have a problem.
23:11
I want to solve.
Yes.
Fantastic, right.
If you don't address that, it blows up on you in the clothes right obstacles happen.
Before Were you present the offer objections happen after objections, are an expression of feeling of disapproval or opposition?
23:27
A reason for disagreeing when they disagree with you.
So obstacles.
We're in the offensive.
We get to go attack them and they're limiting beliefs.
You're in the driver's seat before you make the offer.
So you want to destroy as many of these obstacles as we possibly can.
23:44
The things that would hinder them from making a decision before we get to the clothes.
That being said, once we get to the clothes, So we needed a low know how to handle objections them.
I don't want to buy right now you totally reasonable.
What are the main criteria thinking through?
Like I'll fuck you still here.
I thought this was going to end this in your like I've had this more conversation more times than you.
24:05
All right, so learning how to talk through those high stakes decisions with yourself or others, the purpose presentation.
All right?
And the result is everyone, here is more powerful and can transfer that power to other people.
So before I dive needs his arguments, this is a big point is that the person has to really want the goal and believe.
That one the product will get them to their goal, the way they want to get there to that.
24:24
You and others will support them and three that it will work for them.
Not just everyone else.
Super important.
If they don't believe these things, you could understand all the stuff going to show you and they're not going to buy.
All right?
You have to provide proof.
That would be more in reason for them not to believe if there's a pride proof that would be more reason for them to believe than to not believe.
24:44
All right, the reason that Jim watch has it a gazillion testimonials is because like we just want to be like obviously this shit work.
Oops, we've done it.
A hundred thousand fucking times.
We know how the model works, right?
And just like you or talking to your prospect, you're like I promised calorie deficits work.
I promise you don't have a stubborn metabolism.
25:02
You don't, I mean you don't go to Uganda.
They don't have stubborn, they don't have stubborn body fat, they're tough.
Right, Real Talk.
Otherwise if they're unsure of those things, they will ejected something else in the clothes, okay, which is why you should expect no at first because they can make the decision, they wouldn't need your help.
25:19
They would just send you.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Great.
That's the appetizer.
Now to the main course.
So, here's my request.
See a lot of cameras for now, for the rest of it, just put them down and I want you to just be present with me because I'm sure there's recordings or whatever and you can watch these things later.
25:37
But what I would like you to do is just be pressing.
Is the only thing only time we can do this IRL.
All right?
So this is Richard, Fineman big fan of his, he's dead now.
He was one of the guys who worked on the atom bomb.
Understand, don't memorize.
Glenn principles, not formulas.
If you can understand the framers going to show you, then you'll be equipped to have these conversations with your prospects for the rest of your life.
25:58
If you can just understand them rather than memorizing because let's be real, you're not going to memorize them, the next 45 minutes or not, going to.
But if you understand them, you can approach them with forever.
Okay, here we go.
So there are three sources that we cast our power to that'll break down.
26:14
This is Albert Ellis.
He was a probably heard of him.
Anyone heard of cognitive behavioral therapy CBT.
He invented it or is one of the fathers of it.
If you would stop.
Really, stop dimming yourself, others and unkind conditions.
26:30
You would find it almost impossible to up there.
So, upset yourself, emotionally about anything.
Yes, anything.
And so when he was with 30 or 40 Years of therapy, he tried to break down all the things that people were bothered about in the beginning.
He had 11 and then he had nine and then he had seven and then finally, At the end of his career, is that there's only three things that people get upset about.
26:49
And they also are the same three things that people cast their power to.
And these are his causes of emotional disturbance circumstances.
I must get what I want.
When I want it.
I must not get what I don't want and if I get what I don't get what I want, I can't stand it.
That is the belief to other people must treat me fairly and Kylie.
27:07
And if they don't, they are no good and they deserve to be condemned and punished and three self.
I must do else.
I must do well, or else I am.
No good.
This is what causes emotional disturbance.
People.
This is also why people don't buy these are all powerless statements.
So this is basically the victim handbook.
27:24
This is how you become a victim of your own life, or how our prospects become victims of their own lives.
So, I call this the onion and blame.
So, there's a big scapegoats, you've got circumstances, other people, and then finally self, and this is important, because as we're going to be going through this, when a prospect presents with a circumstance issue, then you are at the outermost.
27:46
Our of their onion which means you still might have two or three more layers.
You got to dig through before, you get to somebody who is empowered to make a decision.
And so if you hear a circumstance, just be ready, or like, I might have two or three more layers, I got to get through.
If you talk to somebody in the, like I got to talk to my spouse, then you're like, okay, I got to get through that one and then they're like oh I can make a decision, I need to think about it.
28:06
So you have to be able to Wade through all of these layers and be prepared for that rather than thinking that like, oh I'll just overcome this one thing and they'll buy, people got a lot of shit on their heads, just why they came?
Decisions, which is why they're asking for your help.
So even though these are the things that destroy other people's realities, they manifest in five different ways.
28:24
So, one, equip you how to deal with these.
So, these are the five.
So you got circumstances, other people's self, but this is what they look like.
You've got time.
Obstacles, people say, I don't have time for it.
You got value obstacles.
I don't have the money for it.
You got fit obstacles, which is this isn't for me for XYZ, special snowflake.
28:41
Reason you got Authority which is I got to talk to my friends spouse mom, dog.
And mother employees, business partner, whatever, my online Discord group for my gaming community, and then self, which is, it looks like avoidance.
28:58
They avoid the decision.
They just try not to make it for fear of making a mistake.
And the interesting thing is that you think that when you overcome a money thing, you're actually getting to the root of it.
It's often, not true.
That's a surface level thing.
Anyway, it's easy to say time.
29:13
I don't I might have money, right?
It's easy.
To say that stuff when they're like, I'm really afraid of failing.
That's when you have like a much more real conversation, right?
So you have to be equipped to show someone the logical fallacies around the things that are, keeping them in a state of emotional disturbance, in a state of victimhood, and a state of powerlessness.
29:33
Cool.
So time now's, not a good time value, I can't afford it fit, not sure.
It's for me Authority.
I have to talk to my spouse or partner avoids.
I need to think about it in general, make fast decisions.
Those are the principles.
Quick tests.
Are you physically in the room today?
Raise your hand, awesome.
29:50
All right, because it seemed a little bit more act interactive on this side.
All right.
So raise your hand if you've ever thought or how to prospects a time?
I'm busy now is not a good time maybe in the future.
Alright.
So time now's, not a good time.
Here's I have pages and pages and pages and pages of obstacle, overcomes and I look through all of these to make this presentation.
30:08
I was like, what are the three that I use?
The most that I can simplify and or frame where you guys can use.
Okay?
So I break this down in my head as Mac Micro seasonal, sorry macro micro when then macro is the this is a busy time in my life.
30:24
All right?
Mike roach, I'll get to in a second is I don't have the time in the day.
Slightly present slightly differently, arshad overcome, both of them.
All right, so if someone says, Hey now's not a good time, I'm too busy.
This is why I didn't want you to memorize, because there's no, there's no script here.
30:40
All right, is that you have to believe that there's a false statement implied there.
I was just a does anyone know who it is?
But there's no mic.
So I'll just tell you if they feel like they don't have time now, then they assume that in order for them to be successful they can't be busy.
30:57
Which means that.
Okay, let's play your way, you're busy now.
So when you're not busy getting the future, you'll do it, right?
Yep.
Okay.
So, do you think that means that you'll never be busy for the rest of your life?
Because it assumes that in, if you are busy that you will stop, do you want to be fit for the rest, your life?
31:15
Yes.
Do you think I'll be busy at some point?
The rest your life?
Yes.
Well, that it means that you should probably learn how to do it when you're busy.
That's probably the time where you need the most support, which is what I'm here for.
So, let's get you started.
So that makes sense, logical, right?
Uh, thanks, thanks.
31:31
Yes, had the cell before but this is why I went to like you guys get like, if this If you close one more deal this month, every single month and paid for the weekend, okay?
That was number one, we've got like 16 more, okay?
But this is how I think about, like, my each of these, that little statement, there is my quick Q.
31:50
Someone says, I'm really busy right now my busy the best time.
This is the best time to like, oh, fuck.
That was going to be my obstacle.
Shit.
You're like, that's amazing.
Busy is the best time because that's where you need the most important.
If you learn how to do when it's hard, every the rest your life, it'll be easy.
No, like fuck.
32:05
That's a really good argument, he's right?
Damn.
You can have my Credit card, right?
Okay.
Now let's go micro hour by hour so if someone's like no I literally don't have the time in the day because I have all these other things.
Now we know that the priorities issue but if you want you can show it to them and this how I do it.
32:25
So I say, you know what, totally understand.
I used to say the same thing to my wife.
Now you make yourself the person who they're going to step into their identities, you're not calling them silly pants.
You're calling yourself a silly pants.
Like listen, I was asleep ants to.
I used to say that somewhere off all the Bitch and moan about how I didn't have time to do the things to make more money didn't have the time to do more things to get in shape, etc, etc.
32:45
And one day she got so sick and tired of you complaining about this, that you grab my phone out of my hands.
As I was scrolling social media look to the amount of hours per day and she was like, you spent three and a half hours on social media every day.
I guess I found you some time.
Hmm.
Anyone here have some time, right?
And then as a secondary Point here is like, do you think there's anyone else on Earth who's had less time than you?
33:05
Who's been able to make this happen?
They're like yeah, like, okay, do you Really think that's the issue.
Do you think it's a party's thing?
Because the end of the day everyone is same 24 hours.
I used to say this when I was close to closing deals because it was back when Obama was President, I was like, President Obama gets up every day to run as like he's running the fucking world.
33:22
I was like, you don't have time to come to the gym right now.
Like yeah, you're right.
And the thing is, is like right now.
You feel like you don't have the time but everyone has the same amount of time, right?
And so the thing is that right now, you're not spending the time that you are given Well, and so the first thing we're going to do is cut the 90% of the shit that you are doing this, not working.
33:45
So you're going to gain all that time back.
So you can be a net positive because it have you seen anyone else who's been able to be successful?
Do the things you want to do and stay in shape?
They're going to say, yes.
You're like right.
Which means it's possible to them.
It's possible for you.
You have the right tools.
That's what I'm here for, right?
And to be fair, this works for anything right, everything about your gym stuff, you're like, you're working all the time.
34:03
It's like I don't have time to do.
So will the shit you're just not working.
Obviously you're spending all your hours doing it and don't make any more money.
Spending time with wrong stuff.
Cool.
So that's the Micra hour by hour.
Good, thank you for that one.
Yeah.
We'd have a, will have a lot of those, if we anyways, I'm Gonna Keep moving.
34:20
We'll just do that way.
Okay, so third one is the one then fallacy.
It's one of my favorites.
All right, which is like, I'll start working out.
I'll start saving money when, right?
It's a when then fallacy and you'll recognize a pretty easy and again, you're going to say, I totally understand you're coming from this.
34:36
Kept me stuck for years, right?
I was a silly pants too.
This is fun as a silly pants.
And so, and until I found out, Need that line of reason.
It's called the wind then fallacy.
And so it's like saying, like, when I am healed, I'll go to the hospital, right?
34:55
Once I save money, then I'll start investing, right?
It's like, it doesn't work that way.
Like, you have to get the order cracks, it's like you have to go to the hospital in order to get healed.
You have to go to the gym in order to get in shape, right?
35:11
It's not that you come to the gym, once you are in shape, that doesn't make any Any sense, right?
When I have more time, I'll do it.
It's a win then fallacy.
That make sense.
Everybody is an easy one, but it's just one, they give you this there.
When I have more time, I'll do it.
It's like no we have to make the time and then we'll have the thing.
35:27
Everyone feel like they can overcome time issues.
Yes.
Well as a total tactical one which I'm sure the gym once a already told you like you should also just ask them what times are planning on working out to begin with?
Before you do the sale, have them Circle the X, very easy and then Then you can hopefully knock that.
35:46
Okay fantastic.
So now they're like I can't afford it, you know like okay roll up your sleeves, you're like sure you can't share step into my trap.
Okay?
So raise your hand if you've ever had a prospect say, or do one of these things?
Yes.
Yes, everyone like one bird is like I've never had that happen.
36:04
Not what not to me.
Alright, so here's for these.
There's a zillion of these.
I was talking to my team earlier and they're like, well, what if someone says this and I started doing it and I was like a fucking none of these are in the presentation, but you know what, we'll see.
So there's four reasons that I like using a lot.
These probably, the most common ones I used to overcome this because at the end of the day, everybody here has to understand that.
36:21
Whenever someone says they can't afford it, it's because it's not valuable enough.
So I'll give you a simple example.
Think about whatever amount of money.
All right, let me put it this way.
If I said, hey These are the keys to my Ferrari.
And you're not competing against each other or you're not even competing like whatever, imagine a very poor person, whatever, I'll give it to you for 5,000 dollars.
36:44
If you can give me five thousand dollars in next 24 hours.
What does that person start thinking?
I'm going to find a way to get five thousand dollars to get this Ferrari because it's worth a lot more than five thousand dollars, right?
Very clear.
And so the problem is when we present our thing they don't see it that way.
37:00
And so they don't think I have to find a way to get this to work and so that means that we Medicate enough value.
If you communicate enough value, the resources are never an issue.
Your team has to believe that otherwise it's never going to stick.
Like they have to really believe that because they're like all the guy was broke.
37:17
It's like they should.
And one of the things that I was proud of myself on was, I was an equal-opportunity salesman and I don't mean that in a woke political way.
I mean, that is like, if every person who walks in the door is like, their money spends the same and I had people who really looked rough walking in my door.
Sometimes, pretty sure I had a few people that lived in their cars that I Tried to sell.
37:37
But the thing is is like I was like if this person wants to get a job getting in shape and getting some sort of routine in their life is probably really important.
And so, I sold hard and I wanted to give an equal opportunity.
Some people, many people in this room, you start getting lazy.
You start deciding what you're going to actually try to sell the person before you open your mouth based on what you judge them by.
37:57
And that makes you a worse salesperson and it doesn't help them.
So, my favorite sales were single moms that have four kids that drove Uber on the weekend to make it work.
They're like it's important for me to change the life.
Round got a better job.
Found a guy whatever.
Like I was very proud of those hard closes.
38:14
They're like, how am I gonna make this work?
I was like, let's get a game plan together.
Because if you're on the same side of the table and they actually believe you that you are trying to help them, you can have that conversation of like all right.
Well let's let's let's look at it.
Do you get your nails done your hair done?
Do you like to go out on the weekends?
You got to eat, you know, you can go through all the things and all of a sudden like, okay, we found that we found that we're good, but unless you have that Rapport and they trust that you really do want to help them, you can't have those conversations.
38:35
Stations.
So, let's go through the first one, which is someone says that's a lot of money.
I can't afford it.
And so you just say, so this is a lot of money for you and they're going to be like, yeah, this is called taking the bait and you're like, yeah.
38:52
Well, that's amazing because I'm actually more concerned when someone says that it's not a lot of money for them because I don't think they're going to Care much about it.
All my best.
Testimonials, my best case studies from people where this is a lot of money for them.
Because if it's a lot of money for you does that, Mean you're going to try really hard.
They're like yeah I'm like right then you should be the last person is worried about getting the results because this means a ton to you, right?
39:12
That makes sense.
So then you can transition it's like, hey, well before even before I even close you on that one, would you even believe me?
If I said it was one tenth of the price that was going to do all the things I promise.
I'll be like, well, no, you're like, right.
So you knew you're going to do this either way, right?
39:29
And if you're selling a B2B thing which you are.
But if you were it's like how long do you want?
I can't afford it to be on your list of problems in life.
So why the fact that it's expensive for them is a good thing?
That's point one.
Next one is why it's not actually a lot.
39:46
So this is where you start expanding on value.
Just like, okay, well fundamentally if you got your high school weight, would it be worth it?
Like yeah, it would be worth it.
I was like, okay.
So the issue isn't whether it's expensive for.
They're not the issues that you don't believe that it can happen for you.
40:02
Let's just make sure we're clear here, right?
And so what?
As you can pull, apart the price from the belief and the belief, you can then attack on its own, all right?
Because again, for many people, like if you just say enough, if all this did was there like, yeah, it would do that, it's a great.
So then, it's not about it being expensive.
40:18
It's about you extrapolating, your past experiences that didn't work for you.
Under this present scenario, which makes sense, but it may let me see if I can get.
Fuck it.
I'll just say I'll skip ahead.
We'll get, i'll skip a slide later.
You don't let a bad decision.
Bernie twice, isn't where?
This, this one is probably one of my one of my most.
40:35
Used obstacle overcomes, which was I get it, you had something to happen in the past didn't work, may be multiple things that didn't work, the only thing worse than having, that thing not work is letting that bad experience burn you twice once when it didn't happen.
The second time when preventing you from doing the right, The Right Move by like, did you ever have someone you dated in high school?
40:54
Or just put the anyone date anyone in Middle School?
Anyone over this 16 inches, right?
Imagine that heartbreak that you had when you were in seventh, grade, fun, Caroline.
Caputi imagine that.
Heartbreak right in seventh grade are sick.
41:11
Whatever it was.
Where are you?
You get your heart broken.
And then you say, no people ever.
Again, shall I ever date, right?
You would have let that bad scenario.
Burn you twice and prevent all the good things that have happened from all the people you've dated since then or hopefully that you're married to Ryan.
41:28
If somebody who's married in front of you it's a lot easier.
It's like was the person that you're married to the first one you ever?
Dated I'll say no.
You're like right.
Imagine She stopped eating after that.
First breakup, you ever had that would've been bad, right?
What's kind of like what you're doing right now with this bad thing?
Do you think it's impossible for you to get in shape?
No.
Okay.
41:45
Well then, do you think it's possible that there's somebody who's a good fit for you?
A good program for you?
The husband program for you, if we did it.
Yes.
That makes sense.
Okay.
And so then at this point when you are attacking a belief, I like to have the big wall of testimonials.
42:01
So if you guys don't have this, like please for the love of God, have floor-to-ceiling testimonials of your before and afters and your five star reviews.
It takes an afternoon to do it, just do it because then all you have to do is point around you and say would it be more unreasonable for you to not believe them to believe?
How many, how many before, and after pictures, would you need to see in order for you to believe that this could happen for you?
42:21
Because it becomes Unreasonable.
Right?
This is why Jim Walsh has 5000 fucking actually.
I think we counted like two years ago.
We had 1600.
Testimonials it's a lot, right?
Cool.
So that's why it's actually not a lot.
So the first one is why the fact that it's a lot for you is a good thing.
42:37
The second one is why it's actually not a lot when you think about it, right?
It's about the value, not about the price.
Third one is, what's funny good for anyways, right?
Because the big thing is that money is going to get spent either way, right?
You guys are going to spend your money, your Going to spend their money and the next 12 months, no matter what.
42:55
And the question is, is it gonna be something that's going to make you better resume me?
Shit that you don't need.
If you look at your last 12 months, is there a bunch of shit you spent money on that you didn't need probably do want to do that again.
The next 12 months.
No would be nice to have something that paid some dividends.
Yeah.
Because here's the real real is that you're going to be buying the lessons from this program.
43:12
Either way, that is the line, you're going to be buying this program.
Either way, the question is, whether you want to spend time, we're going to spend money.
You're buying them either way and so do want to spend 15 years trying to figure this out on your own trying to get in shape, trying to grow your gym or doing to spend the money.
43:31
Because the thing is, we always spend the thing that we value least.
So if you've value your time or your money, spend the money to keep your time.
If you value your money, more than your time, then you spend your time and save your money.
Do I need to tell you which one rich people do right?
43:50
And at the end of the day, like what's money?
For anyways, it's to get to the stuff you want, right?
Do you want this thing?
Yeah.
Well, what else are you going to buy with the same money because when you're saying that, you don't want to spend it, you have something else in mind that you want to spend it on, why is that thing?
More, valuable than this thing?
Good questions.
44:05
The person's like, will fuck your like, right?
It's okay, it's normal.
This is my first conversation here, right?








0:00
You're not making as much money as you want to make because you're not getting as many leads as you need to have to sell stuff too.
And you're probably not getting as many leads as you need because you're not giving away enough free stuff.
And not just any kind of free stuff, but enough good or amazing free stuff.
Because guess what, the reason people buy is based on a prediction of future value.
0:19
So they buy because they predict that they will get value from you later.
What is the easiest way to get someone to predict they're going to get value from you after you buy By giving them value before they buy?
There's two ways that you can fundamentally get leads.
You can, one, just make your offer to somebody and say, hey, I will wash your car for $100.
0:36
Now you can put lots of Razzle Dazzle around it.
That is a offer, so products or services that you exchange money for and the terms under which you do that exchange.
And so this is directly from my first book, $100 million offers.
It's $0.99 on Amazon.
Now that being said, a core offer versus a league, man, what's the difference, right?
0:52
Because fundamentally you'll have something that's valuable.
In both of these instances, the core offer is the thing you sell that makes you the most money.
If you're like, which one?
Is it the one that makes you the most money?
That's your core offer.
If all of a sudden you start making more money on your lead magnet, guess what?
That's actually your core offer.
Lead magnet is the thing before the thing.
1:08
Lead magnet is not a partial solution.
All right, What a lot of people try and do is like, hey, I'm going to give you the 1st 6 minutes of this 12 minute video and get the rest.
Click here.
Right.
I think that's that's not the right way to do it.
I think you lose trust.
And that's literally the opposite of the objective of lead magnet.
A lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrowly defined problem.
1:25
And so think about it this way if you're going to do.
Anything for a customer.
There are many micro steps that happen to create a bigger solution.
Let's say I paint houses.
There's a lot of micro steps that have to happen in order for a house to get painted.
First you've got to size up the house, then you have to give an estimate of.
1:41
Whatever.
Then you have to do the design component and you have to do the 3D visualization.
And the bigger The thing is, the more steps there are.
The idea is okay.
Can I pick one of these very painful steps for my prospect and solve it for them at a massive discount to attract more people to want to do it with me?
And I do such a good job at this massive discount that I increase the trust they have with me and now they have one foot in the door.
2:01
We're not giving away partially done work, we're giving complete work.
To a narrowly defined problem that, once completed, opens up the next problem.
For example, you do massage and you're like, I can't get enough massage clients.
Well, it's usually because you're not giving enough free stuff away.
2:19
Because fundamentally, if you give something away for free, you almost always have demand for it.
And if it's good, you'll have exponential demand for it.
If I give away a $10 massage to get people to come in, and then later everyone buys packages of massages from me or buys a massage subscription from me.
2:35
The massage subscription or the massage packages are my core offer and the lead magnet would be the trial offer of the $10 or discounted massage.
The reason people do those discounted massages, they give those trials, they give those mini offers.
The lead magnets on the front end is because they make more money.
2:52
Because if I go to 100 people and say hey let me give you a massage for 100 bucks, a lot of people might say no.
Maybe one person would say yes.
Now if I then said to the same 100 people I want to give you a massage for $10.
I might get 20 people to say yes, and then of those 20, get a third of them to buy the hundred thing after they tried my massage.
3:11
And so you've got one person getting a massage for $100.
Versus 6 people getting a massage, 30% of the 20 after giving them that first trial and so my cost to acquire them is the cost of delivering the lead magnet.
So if it cost me $10 in cost to give the massage, then I break even on my lead magnet.
3:28
If it actually cost me 20, I might lose 10 bucks.
But am I willing to lose 10 bucks on 20 people?
So I pay $200.00 to get 6 customers that convert and are worth 2000?
Probably.
Even if you're lead man, it costs you money to deliver, it should still lower your total cost to get a new customer.
3:45
That's the secret.
That's the sauce of lead magnets and why they ultimately make businesses more money, and why big business owners think long term about.
I'm willing to give more upfront because I know I'll make more in the end.
Big news.
My next book, $100 million Leads, is finally ready.
Is it cool if I invite you to the biggest entrepreneur party that I think has ever happened?
4:04
Right now we have 200,000 people who've registered.
I've put $1,000,000 into this event already just to.
Honor entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship.
And also deliver real tactical money, making stuff that help you grow your business.
Not tomorrow, but today.
It's gonna be Saturday, August 19th day.
After my birthday.
4:19
My way of giving back 9:00 AM Pacific, 12:00 PM Eastern.
I have never.
Put more time into any project.
In my life and so.
I'm incredibly proud of this book.
I think that when I die.
People still continue to read this.
Book and.
As a side note.
And I've been working on something else since 2019 that I just finished that I'll be releasing to everyone live there.
4:37
And give you a little bit of context.
It's more than a gift card and it's less than a Tesla, and I'm giving it to every single person who's there with me live.
You're not going to want to miss it.
Acquisition.com/leads see there.
A lot of people get really afraid of giving away free stuff because they're like, if I give away all this value, then what would I do?
It's like.
Give more value.
4:52
And if you don't know how to give two types of value, then get good enough to be able to give value on the front end before someone buys so that you can give value on the back end.
One of the beautiful things about business in life is that when you solve problems, you create more problems if you're broke.
Being broke sucks when you have money.
Taxes also suck.
5:08
Now, you may prefer those problems, but they are problems nonetheless.
What we want to do is always know what the journey of the customer is going to be ahead of them.
And we should, because we're the ones who've done this 100 times.
And so we should know what next problem is going to come up.
And if we put our thinking caps on, we say, hey, well, if there's six steps to this problem, why don't I solve the 1st 2:00?
5:25
Then they're going to encounter problem three, and then I make that my paid thing.
Now I completely solved problem one and problem 2, but it naturally leads itself to problem three, which I can then charge for.
So, for example, if you're trying to lose weight, there's a lot of steps that have to occur.
And the way that I like to think about this is before, during, after, for everything that has to happen for a customer.
5:44
So a customer wants to lose weight, then they're going to probably have to eat better, workout better, and they'll probably need some sort of help along the way in terms of accountability to keep them on it right, Eat better.
But what does that mean?
Well, they're going to have to buy their groceries differently, prepare the food, eat the food.
The food's going to have to taste good.
They're going to have to get the right macros, think, oh, wow, there's like.
6:02
A lot of little things here.
Can I say, hey, how can I make grocery shopping easier?
Here's a list, Here's a preloaded Instacart grocery list for women who are at this weight, women who are at this weight, women who are at this weight.
Men work this way with this goal, right?
And you're like, wait, that's a lot of those.
It's like, yeah, but it's one time work that you can set up for 100 different types of people, and then they have their grocery list for you.
6:23
Now that's just problem 1:00.
What if after that, what's the next problem they're going to have?
Well, they're going to bring it back.
Then be like, what do I do?
All the shit.
How to clean and prep all of the food that you just bought in under 60 minutes and I'm going to solve it for them.
Then what am I going to do?
Well, how to store it and portion it in a way that you can bring it with you so you don't get that weird Jelly in the bottom of your chicken breast.
6:40
Tupperware, which is nasty as hell, which they pump in there by the way it's increase the way if you solve them very well.
People are like oh shit, but I also need this and you're like aha.
Well, I want me to tell you about that since you got a such a good experience with this one and because I had value, I will have a prediction of future value because you provided me value before I bought.
6:57
Now one thing that a lot of people are afraid of giving away is stuff that actually costs them money.
But I can assure you that if it actually costs you money, it usually will be valued at a significantly higher percentage to the marketplace.
So sure, you can have a free PDF, sure you can have a digital video series, whatever it is.
7:13
But normally, unless it's exceptional, people aren't going to value that because that's what a lot of people do.
Sometimes giving away actual free work that you will incur cost on, a lot more people will take you up on.
And if you do the math, you will ultimately make more money.
And this what I'm talking about, is the difference between small business owners and big business owners.
7:28
They can incur calculated cost up front for a much bigger back end.
Your free stuff should be better than.
Their paid stuff.
Everyone makes that quote, but they don't actually do that.
What your competition actually builds as their core offer, and you do such a good job of it that you can give it away for free.
Then you become unstoppable.
And you're like, wow, that takes work.
7:44
Duh.
Also, so does becoming a multi millionaire.
So did you think it would be easy?
Let's round this out with seven quick steps that I think through when I'm actually trying to create lead magnets for any business that we have.
Step #1, figure out the problem you want to solve and who you want to solve it for.
If you know who you're trying to solve it for, you will name it differently.
8:01
You will approach the problem differently, you'll market it differently, you'll package it differently and ultimately you'll deliver it differently.
If you're very clear on who and what number two is, figure out how you want to solve it.
So inside the book I talk about three different ways that you can solve.
Solve an actual problem for a lead magnet.
So one is be like if I give a free assessment of any kind, I'm revealing a problem to somebody.
8:19
A different way would be giving a trial of something.
They are usually more problem aware.
They know their back hurts and so I just need to solve it for them.
But unless they keep paying me, it'll come back.
And there's other versions and you can combine them, which I talk about more in the book.
You figure out how you want to solve it.
The third step is figure out how you want to deliver it.
There's lots of different delivery mechanisms.
8:35
Do I want to do it with information?
Do I want to do it with a service?
Do I want to do the physical product that I'mma send them that demonstrates it.
All of these are different ways.
To deliver on that one promise, and the question is which of these is going to be perceived as the highest value from the prospect and increase the likelihood that they ultimately buy from you the most?
8:51
That would mean that you get the most amount of people interested and the most amount of people taking the next step.
Then it's like okay, well, how am I going to package this thing?
The first thing that someone's going to see in order to make the decision to consume your lead magnet is how you package it.
So for example, this book, I had the title that I tested.
9:07
I had the sub headline that I tested and I tested the image that I was going to put on the cover itself.
The first Test I ran was $100 million advertising versus $100 million promotions and advertising 169% to 31.
I was like, huh, So then I ran advertising against $100 million leads, leads 158 to 42.
9:24
I was like, huh?
Then the next round I said, OK, $100 leads or $100 marketing and leads one again.
And so I was like, all right.
Well, Leeds is going to be the headline of the book.
A couple of different images that I ran, and then I ran different versions of the image that was the one that ultimately won.
And so there's a story of a book that went out on dating and it tanked and they went back and they changed the cover of the book and the headline, nothing else, inside the book.
9:47
And then it went on to sell over 10 million copies.
Just by renaming the book, you're gonna put all this time in delivering an amazing solution.
And so if there's ever a most important step, it's this one, which is how you name it and how you package it.
So Step 5 is making it fast and easy to consume.
People learn in different ways, have an audio version, have a written version, hardback version.
10:05
They can hold their hands, Have the digital reader version, have the video version.
On my last book, 100 million offers, which now is, I think 350,000 copies sold.
So I have a decent data set.
It's almost a perfect quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter split.
In terms of where people consume it, it's.
So much effort to write the book, and so little effort to just double and triple and quadruple how many more people consume it simply by making it available in more ways to more people in more places 6 is you have to make it fucking good.
10:32
The reason I say that is because so many people give away sucky fluff.
In their lead magnets and they're free shit, and I use shit as the emphasis there because they're afraid or unable to give away more value.
If you're afraid of giving away more value, consider the alternative.
You give away sucky fluff. 99% of the marketplace only consumes your sucky fluff and then makes a decision of how much value you're going to give to them in the future.
10:51
And they're going to say, oh he gave me sucky fluff, why would I ever work with him?
And then here's the shitty part, They then other people are like, hey, do you know Jason so and so and you're like, Oh yeah, I could say one of his things.
It was shit.
And So what happens is not only did this person not buy, they actually get other people.
You know, not by yourself, who otherwise would have.
11:07
You can reinforce your reputation, the marketplace by continuing to over deliver to people who will never give you money.
And that's okay because they know the people who will.
If a lead magnet is not good enough that people, then tell other people about it.
In my opinion you have failed.
Put 100 hours into something.
If you've never put more than 10, put 100 in and see what actually happens to the quality of the work you put out and your audience will appreciate that.
11:30
Because people can tell quality, and step 7 is that you want to make it easy for them to take the next step.
All right, This is so important and people forget about.
It's like we do all this work and then we forget to make it easy for them to tell us that they want to buy more.
When you're making call to actions, don't be clever.
11:46
Be clear.
Just say.
Go to Amazon, search my name and you'll find the book.
Go to my website acquisition.com.
Watch the videos.
Be very clear about what you want the people to do, and if you want, give them multiple ways to do it.
It's the same concept as making multiple ways of consumption, but making multiple ways for people to take action.
12:04
Just like the book consumption, you can double and triple your response rates on CTA's by making it available in the way that is convenient to them is their preference.
Some people like phones, some people like typing in the URL's, some people like scanning.
It just depends on the person and you want to make yourself available to all.
And believe it or not, we covered about 20% of 1 chapter of this book.
12:23
I'm going to have a big launch party for my book, and if the book's already out, either way, it'll still be the same URL, which is acquisition.com/leads.
Go there and they'll either be a training or they'll be registration for the biggest event ever.
It's going to be awesome.
I put two years of like life into this and so I'm going to make it badass and I want everyone to talk about it.
12:40
So like, I will do everything in my power to overlive like crazy for every new 10 so you can be there or be square.








0:00
This one equation will make you rich.
I recently spoke at Adworld.
If you stated the very end, you'll understand how you can use the equation to sell lots of stuff for lots of money and make yourself unreasonably wealthy.
Keep being awesome and enjoy.
Big picture, there's two things that I want to talk about.
One is how do you create and sell valuable things, right?
You probably hear people say, hey, like provide more value, give value away.
0:18
Like it's all about value, value, value.
But like, no one defines what is value.
What does that even mean, right?
What are the components that create a more or less valuable product or service?
The second part is one of the four different things that you can do to enhance value.
All right, So once you have a valuable.
Thing you can enhance it by adding scarcity, you can enhance it by adding urgency, you can enhance it by adding bonuses, or you can enhance it by adding guarantees.
0:37
And you can also as a fifth half bonus.
For you guys, you can enhance the value by simply naming it in a way that resonates more with your avatar or the type of person you want to sell to, OK.
And so if those are the five things that can enhance the value of the thing that you're selling, if you have all five and you do them well, you will sell more than you would if you didn't have them.
0:56
Now I won't have time to get into all five.
I'm just going to talk about one of them, which is guarantees.
It's a big picture.
We're going to talk about how to create and destroy value in the things that we sell.
And we'll talk about how to reverse risk through guarantees to make the things that we are selling more compelling to them because now they won't.
Fear that they're not going to get the outcome that we promised.
1:12
Cool, awesome.
I spent a very long time trying to figure out what value meant and it's because I we work with a lot of portfolio companies and we want to think about how we can create new product offerings that are going to be that are going to sell for lots of money with big margins and make us all rich, right?
I wanted to come up with an equation that would encapsulate this so that we could basically formulate or formulaically approach the problem.
1:33
So it's like if we check these boxes, we're going to get something valuable and we can just do this over and over and over again.
And I had to do it that way because I.
Can't be the person who's making the products in every one of these companies at this point.
So I have to create a process around it.
The four variables are as follows.
So if you're taking notes or you have something on your side screen, these are the writer Downers.
1:50
Number one is the dream outcome is the thing that we are promising something that people actually want.
And I'm going to dive in each of these four in a second, but I'm going to just give you the four and then we'll double click.
So that's number one.
And when you're writing these down, write it down like a fraction.
So draw a line right in the middle of your paper or whatever, and you'll have two on the top and two on the bottom.
2:08
So number one is your dream outcome, #2 is the perceived likelihood of achievement.
How likely does someone believe that if they purchase your thing, they're going to achieve the outcome that we are promising A lot of words, hopefully a simple concept. #3 is the time component in essence, How quickly are they going to get the thing after they pay?
2:26
The 4th is the dual sided coin of effort and sacrifice.
What does someone have to start doing that they don't want to do as a result of this purchase?
And then what are the things that they have to stop doing that they would like to keep doing that they cannot no longer do as a result of this purchase?
All right, so those are the four things.
2:43
And what I'd like you to do in thinking through this as we break it down is think about your own products and services that you have and think about how they stack up in using this equation.
All right.
I'm going to give you a big picture back and forth example.
And then I'm going to dive into each of them in more detail if we were to think about an ideal outcome.
3:00
All right.
So let's use weight loss because it's an example that most people can understand.
All right.
So why is it that, let's say you have some things that you can sell for weight loss, like $50,000 surgeries for liposuction?
And on the other hand, you've got a $5 ebook that promises a skinny tummy.
3:16
If they make the same promise, which is the dream outcome #1.
How these two things are so different in price, right?
Well, it's the other three variables, right?
Because the dream outcome.
People want to lose weight, right?
And so that's unit #1.
Now the reason that that is number one of the four is that if I were to say, hey, I can make you $1,000,000 versus losing weight, Most people, many men especially would probably value making money more than they would value losing weight.
3:43
Not always, but oftentimes as a category investment things, franchise opportunities, business opportunities tend to sell for a higher price, which is the kind of the component of B2B business to business versus business to consumer.
By and large when you have two different things like that, we use the dream outcome.
To differentiate entire industries or categories of products as being more or less expensive.
4:02
Now once we have the same dream outcome like weight loss being delivered, then we move on to the other three parts of the equation.
Let's go on to perceive likelihood of achievement.
If I have two people who are selling the same exact thing, let's use a doctor in that weight loss example like the liposuction guy and let's say that liposuction guy, A doctor has done 10,000 surgeries of liposuction and let's say doctor B has done.
4:26
One same surgery, same dream outcome.
It's going to take the same amount of time, same amount of effort for you.
This guy might even spend more time on you than this guy because he's not as experienced.
Which one you going to go with?
Probably the 10,000 guy.
Why?
Because of the perceived likelihood of achievement.
4:42
We have lower risk associated with making this purchase because we believe that if we give this money, we're going to have the outcome that we desire.
And so if you think through this in terms of your own products, there's like, am I doing a good of job before the purchase?
Of increasing someone's perceived likelihood of achievement because in a very real way that confers itself or it translates into higher prices.
4:59
This guy, even though it probably takes him, takes him less time to do the surgery, he actually can charge more than this guy and that wild.
So we've got the dream outcome.
Is the thing something people actually want?
What's the perceived likelihood of achievement now if we stop there between making big promises and making people believe that it's actually going to happen for them?
5:16
That is what the majority of young and new entrepreneurs spend their time on.
Most people, myself included, spent the first half 2/3 of my career trying to beef up the top side.
I would promise bigger and I would show more testimonials, more results.
Promise bigger, more testimonials, more results, right?
More third party edification, more celebrity endorsements, etc, Right.
5:33
But I believe now, now I've done this a little bit, that the actual fortunes rely on the bottom side of the equation.
OK?
So remember, this is the top side that creates value.
The bottom side of this fraction are the things that destroy value.
Our goal is to increase the top side and decrease the bottom side.
So with time, there's two components of time.
5:50
We have the time delay between when you buy and when you get, and then the amount of time to immediately start seeing any kind of outcome.
So it's like the experience along with.
So for example, if I signed up for a gym membership, right using this weight loss example.
I might know that I'm not going to lose the weight for a year, but if I start seeing value from the community, I start, you know, feeling more upbeat, etc.
6:11
I'm going to start experiencing benefits.
That might not be my big goal, but I'm going to have other things along the way that are going to still deliver value quickly.
The whole component of time here is how quickly between when I buy and when I get.
I'll give you a B2B example on a B2C example in a B example.
Let's see you on a marketing firm.
6:27
So this is Admirals.
I'm sure they'll audit.
This will resonate with all you guys if you have two agencies that are side by side and they both say, hey, I'm going to do some marketing for you and I'm going to get.
Your phone to ring one way or another.
Marketing agency A says, OK, now that we're doing this, you're going to have to start, you know, recording lots of ads for us.
6:42
And we're going to be meeting three times a week, an hour each time.
And you're probably going to take 4 hours a week to record these, these ads for us.
And it's going to take us 60 days to get this stuff done.
At day 60, your phone starts ringing from the ads that they do.
OK, marketing agent #2, you sign the paper and as soon as you sign the paper and they process your credit card, your phone rings and it's a lead within seconds.
7:03
Same product time collapse.
And so one of the easiest things I had a mentor once they say this, he said one of the easiest ways to figure out what product to sell is look at the products everyone else is selling and deliver the same thing in half the time.
And so when we think about the products that we sell, is there a way that we can condense TTV which is time to value.
7:20
And so one of the key, one of the huge ways that we focus on when we bring a portfolio company in at acquisition com.
Is we say, how can we look at this, this service delivery and see if we can do it faster.
Now before the people who are in the room were like, well, my business is different.
We have a company that publishes books for God's sake.
7:36
So a very long process.
But what we were trying to figure out because they had the same situation where it's like it just takes time for someone to like write a book like how can we deliver this value faster.
And so The thing is, is it just like that gym example that I said, it's not that you necessarily have to deliver the longest result first.
7:52
But you want to deliver a result first.
You want to have a tangible outcome that someone can experience literally holding their hands.
And so one of the things that they did was created a little seven day kind of mini book boot camp.
And when they did that, people at the end of seven days could have an actual mini book published and live.
8:08
Now they make it clear this is not the book that's going to make you a millionaire.
But what it was was to break the belief and to prove the concept that they could really do it.
And then they got the bind and really built the, you know, the real book that was going to end up making the money, et cetera, right.
And so the idea here is that.
If you are creative and if you are a loser, then don't think this way.
8:25
But if you are a winner, there's always the question, which is how can I make this work for me?
All right.
And so you have to think it's like, if you're a real estate, it you're like, well, it takes 90 days to sell a house.
How can you give someone an outcome before that?
It's like, well, what else happens?
They have to clean the house.
They have to inspect the house.
They have to, they want to know about ways to make more value.
There's lawn care.
There's fix.
There's a million things that have to happen.
8:41
Is there other things that I can do along this journey?
That I can provide more value to this person earlier so they can get better experience.
In a B2C example, let's say I'm on the Internet and I'm trying to buy something for weight loss, right?
And I click the button that says 6 minute abs and then 6 minutes later I have abs.
How?
8:56
Like literally I look at my shirt like holy shit, how valuable would whatever that thing be if in 6 minutes I would have abs, Probably infinitely valuable.
And so when we can find ways to deliver the outcomes to our customers sooner or faster they will value it.
A lot more.
9:12
Not just a little bit more, a lot more.
Speed is one of the best all time competitive advantages.
And so the last one is effort and sacrifice.
As I said, it's two sides at the same point because when you take on a new customer, they have to start doing things that they weren't doing before, right?
That's effort they didn't and they probably don't want to do it because they weren't doing it before, which is why they don't want to do it right.
9:30
And on the flip side, they've got stuff that they stopped doing that they do want to do, right?
And that's why they're two sides at the same point.
In that marketing example I just gave with the agency, right, Let's say marketing agency A and B.
And I said A had, you know, you have to 333 meetings a week and you've got 4 hours to deliver us copy and creative and whatever, right.
9:48
Versus the other agency.
That's like, oh, we've already tested all the stuff for your industry and we've got videographers and whatnot who can, who can already just start running this stuff like you just passed and it's taken care of.
How much more valuable?
Is the guy who takes none of your effort and sacrifice takes no effort on your part to make this outcome occur.
10:06
So if you're thinking about this within your own business, the way that we like to think about these 4/4 variables, right when we have the effort and sacrifice the goal, just like time is to decrease it.
And if we're repeating the same activities with every one of our customers, how can we streamline that?
How can we predict what is going to happen and how can we, how can we make, you know, 3 onboarding calls into one?
10:26
And how can we make one onboarding call into a checklist?
So how can we streamline this process such that it's seamless and effortless and ideally immediate for them to achieve the result?
All right.
And so I said there's 4/4 variables in the value equation.
You've got a big dream outcome that people want to experience.
They believe that the likely that they're going to experience it is very high.
10:44
The time that they have to wait between when they buy and when they get is as little as possible.
And then the effort and sacrifice is 0.
And when you put those four things together, you have a very valuable product.
And so when I said that this, the bottom half of the equation is the more valuable thing that as I've learned is that a lot, it's very easy to make bigger promises and you know, throw testimonials and things like that.
11:03
It's much harder to actually have the operational effectiveness to drive results faster and decrease the amount of effort that a customer has to put forth.
And so the competitive modes that exist in the big businesses are on the bottom side of the equation.
Netflix took over Blockbuster because they made consumption of movies and TV shows immediate.
11:19
And your effort and sacrifice, if you didn't have to get up in your car, drive around the corner 15 minutes, walk around, grab the thing, and then not to mention return it three days later, which is 0 value add to you, right?
Without getting your late fee, They just got rid of all of that.
So you could just take your phone and start watching.
11:35
But the actual dream outcome and perceived likelihood on both of those occasions that people thought they were going to watch a movie or watch a TV show and they're very certain they wanted to do it right.
So like the top side was the same, the bottom side of the equation is where they killed everyone.
If you look at Amazon, they made the purchasing process seamless on 2 angles.
11:51
If I can click with one button and it comes tomorrow, they made the effort in sacrifice virtually nothing in terms of the purchasing.
And then the time delight is virtually nothing in terms of getting the thing and they continue to shrink that time gap.
They sell the same products as everyone else, literally.
But what did they do?
They increase the perceived likelihood of achievement by adding all the reviews.
12:09
So people believe that when they buy the thing, they're going to get the outcome.
They really want the job they hired the product to solve.
They believe they have when they have that because of the reviews that Amazon leaves right the time because they get it immediately and it's and they can buy it quickly and the same thing with the effort and sacrifice, right.
And so that's ultimately how Amazon is able to beat because they provide value, right?
12:27
Is this making sense?
Is this cool guys digging this?
OK, I'll give you one cool benefit of that four part stack and then I'll, I'll Segway into the guarantees portion.
All right.
So I gave you 4 variables.
Guess what those four variables also equate to?
They equate to headlines and copy.
So if I want to promise something to a prospect, what am I going to say?
12:46
Here's the dream outcome.
Here's a number that is related to the amount of people who have helped achieve this thing.
Here's how long it took them to achieve that thing.
And then here are stipulations around that claim.
And if you have data from your customer success department, which hopefully you do right, which is percentage of customers who maybe leave a 5 star review or percentage of customers who achieve X outcome by X date under this condition.
13:09
Now you have claims that you can use that are very compelling in your marketing and your copy.
These can be headlines and emails.
They can be headlines and ads.
They can be on your sales pages.
They can be hooks in, in your, in your videos and creative content.
And so when you think through these four variables, they are the consistent variables of claims in general.
So when you want to communicate to a chiropractor that you can help market for his facility, you're going to say 70% of our chiropractors that we work with achieve over 100 patients in their first 30 days without having to make an ad effort and sacrifice.
13:39
And so when you do something like that, you use those four parts of the equation that is also reverse engineers copy because they should be related because value is what people want to buy.
And so your ability to persuade and your ability to understand and communicate value should be married.
When you're thinking about your products and services and you have these four variables, you're like, OK, how do I do this?
13:58
Right.
So the way that we think through this.
Is that we create a big list of problems, which is I like to think about in sequence, which is what is every single mini micro step as chunked down as humanly possible that someone has to go through to experience this result.
So if you're in the physical products business, then that's why Amazon spends so much time on the actual purchasing, because there's not a ton that they have to do, but once the person.
14:19
Receives the product, what their first impression of the box, the unpackaging, the directions that they get in order to use it, what the using it experience looks like the first time, the second time, etc.
How can we streamline that process for them?
How can we give them different ways that they can use the same thing right in the services side?
There's probably a lot more micro steps that somebody's going to have to take in order to achieve the outcome, right?
14:38
And so the idea is we want to write down every single problem they could possibly encounter throughout their entire journey with us.
And then we want to write out what the solution of that would look like.
Now we're just putting we're in, we're in fictitious world here.
We're saying you know blue ocean, what would we do to solve every one of these problems, right.
14:54
And we get this huge list.
A lot of guys who go through the book have 100 plus different little mini micro problems and mini micro solutions that they have.
Now once you have this huge thing, this is a fun activity to do with your team is how can we make the thing we sell more valuable, right.
Once you have that list, you then do something I call the trim and stack.
Which is you look at that list and you say which of these is the most valuable to them, which is the ones they suffer the most from that is most valuable to them.
15:15
That's category number one.
Then next to those, which of these would cost us virtually nothing to build or implement after we have a first time experience, right?
So it's like if you have to build out like a grocery calculator, it's going to take you time one time, but then every time after that it's done right.
What's the incremental cost of each of these solutions?
15:33
And so then you order those.
In terms of you, I just would go low, medium, high, it's very simple.
And so then for me what we do with the companies we have is we look at the things that are high value and costs us very little to provide on increment and we cut everything else out.
And then we have something that's extremely valuable and costs us very low.
15:50
And that's how you have a very high value, very high margin product or service that you sell.
That is ultimately how we recreate value in a business.
And we like to think about is like, what are all the capacities of the business?
What are all the problems they could potentially solve?
And then which ones will we choose to solve?
And then once we're very ruthlessly clear on the problems that we choose to solve, we cut out everything else and say that's just not a problem we choose to solve.
16:10
We know we could solve it, but just based on the economics of that solution or that problem, we don't want to be the ones to do it.
And then we stay ruthlessly focused on things that we do.
We do more.
OK, Now most people think that they're selling against their competition.
I disagree.
What you're really selling against is inaction.
16:25
You're selling against doubt.
You're selling against the biggest obstacle, which is risk.
The comfort of not doing the thing or not buying the product is so high.
We have to help decrease their action threshold, right?
We have to lower that bar just so they can just step right over it because up here they don't want to take action because it's too comfortable.
16:42
We have to lower it so much.
So there's so little friction for them to take action with us that they buy.
I think one of the more compelling things that a business can do is offer guarantees, right?
Guarantees are you assuming a certain percentage of the risk from the buyer.
Whenever there's an exchange between two parties, there's a certain amount of risk that both parties incur.
16:59
And so if you have these two parties and there's a certain amount of risk that's shared, you can shift the risk in your favor because you have more knowledge about the fulfillment than the client does.
Why?
Because you've done this 100 times before, and this is their first time.
And so it would make sense that we shift some of that risk in our favor.
17:14
And we do that in the form of a guarantee rather than like insurance.
But you can think about guarantees as purchase insurance for the buyer.
And so there are four ways that I think through guarantees and creating and structure and creative guarantees.
The four types are unconditional guarantees, which means it doesn't matter what you do if you just want your money back and give it back to you.
17:33
That is the strongest type of guarantee.
Now it depends on the type of business, if you can offer it.
I think you should because if you do the math on if I reverse the risk and I get 20% more sales because of this unconditional guarantee and I get 5% more refunds.
And not even 5% more on an increment.
17:50
Let's just say you get 5, you go from 1% refunds to 5% refunds, which would be a massive increase in refunds.
You still added 15% to your sales and it was still worth it mathematically.
That is why having the guarantee is just a math equation.
It's not like you can't let your emotions be like, well, we got our, we got more refunds down.
It's like, yeah, we also got 20% more sales.
18:06
So you just have to think about it like that, just be a business person and not emotional about it. #2 is a conditional guarantee, which is we will give you X if if X happens.
Why?
If this happens, this is what we will do right?
If why?
The next very simple.
If you provide us content for our marketing agency always by noon on Fridays before the ad campaign start for the first eight weeks, and if you don't make at least twice what you paid us over that first eight week period, we will give you your money back, right?
18:34
You can also say we will work with you until you get your money back.
The third is an anti guarantee.
Which if you don't have a guarantee, which there are there are situations where that that makes sense.
You want to lean into the fact that you don't have a guarantee.
You don't want to like not talk about it because it's a normal part of the buying process.
18:49
Be like what are my assurances?
Like how do I know this is going to happen.
You're making these promises.
How should I believe you?
Right.
And that's where you lean in and you say, Oh no we don't have guarantees.
And if you're the type person that really needs a guarantee, this is not the program for you because there's too much work that's on your on your part.
We can guide you.
But the the vast majority of the success is going to be in your hands.
We will guide you, but it's going to be on you.
19:06
And if that doesn't feel good for you, then there's a hundred other guys or you have some sort of proprietary thing.
It's like once I give you the Super secret sauce, you're going to know it forever.
And so I can't, I can't give you a refund because the day after you learn a secret, it's not valuable to you, right.
And so for that reason, we can't, we can't do any kind of guarantees.
19:22
The 4th is what I call implied guarantees.
So anything that's a performance related offer, you know we'll increase your revenue by X and we get 20% of the increase.
That is, that is an implied guarantee to the buyer.
Rev shares, profit shares, performance bonuses, kickers doing things off of a strike, pricing going up, all of those things are implied guarantees based on performance.
19:42
Those are the four different things that you can do in terms of guarantees.
Now the advanced version of this is that you can stack guarantees.
So I can say I will give you a 30 day unconditional guarantee and I will give you a 90 day.
Conditional guarantee, which means that for whatever reason you're like, hey, I'm not sure.
19:59
Then you say, listen, the only way for you're gonna be for you to be sure is for you to be inside the program because I just want you to make an informed decision.
You can't make an informed decision until you've actually experienced the product.
I'm just going to give you a 30 day unconditional guarantee so you can get in there, experience the benefits and then make the decision for yourself.
It makes it a very easy sale because then the sale becomes essentially a trial.
20:14
Now you're going to close a lot more deals, but you're also going to get more refunds, but the net, net is you're going to make more sales.
And so you do the unconditional guarantee and you say, but on top of that, and this is where you get clever, is you look at the customers who've made the most money.
If you're B2B, if you're B2C, you look at the ones who've gotten the result that you that you promised the best results and then you look at the client journey that they had, what are the things they did?
20:33
Who do they talk to?
What was their experience?
And so then what we do is we reverse engineer their experience, the key milestones of their experience and we make those part of the guarantee.
So for example, if I were selling Internet marketing, whatever, then I would say as long as you get your domain purchased and you set up a website and you spend at least $1.00 in advertising or $100 in advertising, if you don't get an ROI from this program by day 90, I will give.
20:55
Give you your money back.
And so we make two or three stipulations that seem very straightforward, but the stipulations are the ones that we know are the ones that drive client success.
In so doing, we basically guarantee that they will succeed, which is the point of the guarantee.
And so we say, listen, if you're trying to lose weight, I will give you 2 times what you paid me by the end of this 90 days if you show up to every one of the workouts and you send me a picture of all your meals.
21:17
That's it.
You do that at the end of the 90 days, I guarantee that you're going to lose.
You lose the weight that I promise you're going to lose.
And so you just look at what are the things in common that the people who had the biggest successes did.
And you just look at the fewest common variables because the more stipulations you had, the weaker the the guarantees going to be.
I'll tell you a fun one.
If you just want to get weird, If if for some reason you have any kind of like coaching or any kind of business that's like that, the compliance of opening a Google doc and writing what you're going to do that day.
21:42
And at the end of the day just saying what you did over, I think it's it's like 6 weeks.
Is like 1% or 2% compliance.
Like people just can't do it.
It's so simple.
If you want you could just say, hey, here's my guarantee.
If you just say what you're going to do and at the end of the day you say what you did for six weeks and you don't get the results, then I'll give you the money back and you automatically know that 99% of people are not going to do that anyways.
22:04
So anyways, fun one for you guys.
One of the things that people suck at with guarantees is that they say they make the guarantee amorphous.
They say results guaranteed.
What you don't want to do is say that because it's like banner blindness.
Everyone's heard that before and.
It means something different to everybody.
What we want to do is spell it exactly what our guarantee is.
22:20
And we don't even need to use the word guarantee.
We can just say if you don't get very specific outcome if you don't lose 6 inches from your waist by this time period and you xed, I will write you a check for the difference between what you gave me and what you think it was worth.
22:39
You want to spell it out in common language so they understand what you're actually saying rather than saying results guaranteed.
The.








0:00
I felt very confident that I would either get what I wanted or die because I was just in a tremendous amount of pain in the need of validation from exterior that That pain was motivation enough for me to just continue to drive no matter what happened until I got where I wanted to be.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:23
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So Alex, what is a view that you have that got you to where you are at today that most people would disagree with?
So I guess the more commonly held view.
So I'll answer the question in a roundabout.
Why?
The more commonly held view is that things should be fast and they are just missing this one thing, and if they had that one thing, they would be successful.
0:46
But the reality is, it isn't one thing.
It's a hundred small things.
And if you can accept that it's a hundred small things, then you don't expect something to happen overnight and you don't expect some secret you're going to find you don't put.
Your hope in a mentor or to be a savior for you, and you realize that you were the only person who's going to have complete control over your own life.
1:05
You're the only ones who could at least influence it.
And so if you shift to that mentality, then everything's your fault, and then you actually can start making progress.
And what did it take for you to realize that I?
Think I always thought that just realistically.
I think I always thought that, you know, I had a Middle Eastern father immigrant came here with nothing.
1:24
So there was never.
There was never an illusion that work was not required to get to where you wanted to go.
I think that the, the, the moment we're really shifted that I was probably in college.
I was about 19 and everything had come easy to me.
Like school wise I did really well.
1:40
I was I was president of like the newspaper and the and the the literary magazine, vice president of the of the creative magazine.
And so I did.
I just did really well with those things.
I was in three varsity sports, like all that stuff.
But in college, I went to Vanderbilt and everyone there was really smart.
1:56
I was like okay.
So I just always expected I could just not say for anything.
And like, I would ace it.
And I didn't have that happen.
And so I ended up going fall break with like a 10 GPA, which is bad.
And so he was like, hey, I'm just not going to keep you in school if this is what's going to happen.
2:13
So I didn't go out, didn't do anything for the remainder of the semester, and I think I finished with a three, two.
So I basically got an A on every single assignment from that point going forward.
And he said cool.
So now that we know what you're capable of, that's the expectation.
And so bar was set.
And that was probably the moment, though, where I tied hours of work to outcome.
2:32
And then that just became my MO.
Like everyone knew.
It was like Rosie's in class at the library, at the gym or at the cafeteria.
There's the four things from 9:00 to 9:00 every day.
And so I started taking being a student like a job.
And so I was 9:00 to 9:00 every day.
And I I pretty much worked 12 hours a day since then.
2:49
But it was just being okay with the fact that things were going to take time and I had to do them for an inordinate period of time without convincing myself I was smarter than I was and let time have its moment.
Yeah.
And after college, you went to this very traditional route of going into management consulting, and you eventually quit that to start the gyms.
3:11
Yes.
Can you talk about that moment where you decided that I'm going to quit, I'm going to try something different that's not on that standard path.
Yeah, that still is, to date, the most terrifying decision I made in my entire life.
And so for anybody who's on that on that edge or that precipice, like, I can only promise you that it actually just gets easier because like once you burn the boats there, you know, I I had to do this risk analysis, which was okay.
3:36
If I continue down this path, I am guaranteed to knock at what I want.
On this other path, I'm not guaranteed to get it, but I have a shot at getting it and so from a risk adjusted basis it made more sense for me to risk it because it was the only chance I had at getting what I wanted.
3:51
Which for me my my mental math at the time was I wanted to make $1,000,000 a year and I wanted to not work that much.
That was at least my like thought process at the time and I figured that if any company would pay me $1,000,000 because it's really at least at that point, I only saw two main tracks for that, which would be investment banking.
Finance slash management.
4:09
There's kind of like the only two pass that I could see in front of me that would pay me that kind of money.
But I knew that if I was going to get paid $1,000,000 a year, they're going to be ripping $10 million out of my soul every year.
And so that didn't seem like an acceptable outcome.
And so I, seeing that, I decided to quit the really prestigious job that looked great on LinkedIn and Facebook and all my college friends and all that stuff to start a gym, which, you know, my parents were thrilled about with my Vanderbilt education, that that's where I was choosing to go.
4:37
But again, it was it was from a risk standpoint.
I knew a lot of people say, like, I want to be a business owner someday, but I thought, well, what?
Like what would I have to use as qualifiers for what someday would look like?
Like what would that day have to look like in order for it to happen?
And I reasoned, at least that the later I got in my life, the harder it would be to change because I would be making more money in the future than I was today.
5:01
I would have more responsibilities than I do today.
I would have wives, kids, etcetera.
I'd also probably have more asset, I'd probably have a house, bigger, you know, car, whatever.
And so it seemed to me that the lowest risk time that I would be able to course correct if I failed was in my 20s.
And so that plus the what I was saying earlier about guaranteed to not get what I wanted to go for those two reasons, I took the jump.
5:21
It just took me 6 months to make the jump and I talked to like my closest friend at the time.
Pretty much every day for like an hour, just heeing and hawing and heeing and hawing until finally I I called him when I was like in Ohio.
And I'm from Maryland.
And I didn't want to let anybody know that I had left because I didn't want anyone to talk me out of it.
5:39
And so that's that was what ended up, you know, being them the breaking point to to get there.
Are you typically very calculated in your decisions, like all of your decisions take those six months?
Or do you go with your gut now where you make a decision in a spur of moment?
It's not a gut thing.
I think I'm pretty calculated decisions, but I don't think that decisions need to take a long time.
5:57
And I think that I would say that as as we've as we've progressed in business, our speed of decision making has decreased.
You know what I mean?
Because I'm also, I can accept mistakes much more easily now and realize that most of the biggest mistakes have come from delay.
6:13
More than actual wrongdoings because a lot of times it's like happy to glad decisions.
It's like okay, should we rent or should we buy the building like well, either of them have like a material out like change in our in our lives.
No.
So I just basically put decisions in two buckets, which is, is it a reversible decision or an irreversible decision?
6:32
And then if it is irreversible, to what degree is it irreversible?
So like having a kid, very irreversible marriage.
Less irreversible, but also it's still pretty pretty irreversible.
Tough, right, to get out of there.
You know where we're going to go for lunch today, like irreversible but very low stake.
6:49
You know what I mean?
So it's like that's it's which I think is why partially our people struggle with it so much because it is an irreversible decision.
But it also doesn't matter, which I do think as a hack is just knowing what you eat for most of the meals that you have just makes life so much easier and wastes so much less time.
But on the reversible decision side than those ones we just say.
7:07
I like using the term What's my best bad guess?
Caleb's probably heard me say this 100 times.
I'm like this is my best bad idea, this is my best bad guess.
And so it just it it sets the bar lower for the expedition of yourself and others.
Not to say that you don't have high, you know, high expectations of yourself, but in terms of like having a way to put language around decreasing your action threshold to do something, just saying hey, it's my best bad idea and we only commit to 1 thesis at acquisition.com and everything we do which is tested at a rate.
7:35
That's what we commit to.
We're not committing to this path, We're committing to test and iterate, and this is just the first Test, and so seeing it that way, then it makes it just a tiny test on a much bigger process that we're all aligned with always.
So it's just the only decision is which test we're going to run first, which is just less.
I know when I so I was a corporate lawyer, I left this very prestigious law firm.
7:53
And when I was going through that decision, similar to you, I was just thinking, what is the best case scenario?
What is the worst case scenario?
And for me the worst case scenario was like maybe I would fail, but I would go back to find a law job.
Like it's a degree that you can typically find a job with.
When you were going through that decision, what was your best case scenario, What was the outcome you wanted and then what would what would have been the worst case scenario?
8:13
The best case scenario is what I'm doing now.
Worst case scenario was I would have a really good essay for Business School because I already took the GMAT too, because I wanted to like, really shore up my options.
I'd already applied to get a masters accountancy too, because I figured if I had that plus my two years of management consulting, I would be positioned to do finance or management consulting really well going into B school.
8:34
And I and I I'd read that, you know, they liked having some entrepreneurial experience if you have that.
And so to me it was just that was actually a really big point from a like the downside protection, it's like.
Best case I I actually succeed and I I'll zoom out for a second.
8:51
When I looked at Business School, for me it was 200 grand in like opportunity cost like hard cost plus what I wasn't going to make probably more than that 250 And then at the end of that the median salary I think was like 110 or 120 from Harvard somewhere in there, right and so.
9:08
I figured if I took $250,000 and I took two years, I thought I could get close to making what my median was, except I would already be living my I'll be a business owner someday, and then I could, you know, scale past that.
And so that was kind of like the reasoning on that side.
But to your point about the knowing that I could use it in an essay, which sounds so silly to increase my likelihood of getting into a good school, actually was one of the major factors of me being okay if taking the jump.
9:33
It's interesting because I went through the same process.
I wanted to go to Business School too when I was already a lawyer at the Yeah.
So I took the G Mat while I was working these hundred hour weeks and I think looking back at it, I think I wanted the Harvard or the Stanford as a crutch to validate that I was a good entrepreneur.
9:50
Like, I'm so glad that I didn't end up going that path because I think it would have been a two year waste of my time and a lot of money.
It's, you know the, I'll say the one thing with the with like the the Super high tier schools.
It's just the network.
I mean you're paying for a mastermind of sorts for you know 200 grand or 250 grand for them to screen high likelihood people who you're going to want to do business with in the future.
10:12
And so I think in that way that's that's the main value.
Besides that, you know, I think the rest of it is like, I mean most of it, half of it's like socializing, like they even build that in because they know that's the value.
Isn't it funny though?
Now that we have social media followers, we can DM people.
It's like the same network effect as an MBA.
10:27
Oh yeah, You could post a story and just be like, anybody know an amazing commercial real estate attorney who does deals over 50 million and then like, you'll get like 60 M's.
You're like, perfect.
Yeah, easy.
You just tap in.
You know it's funny cuz this was a topic that Caleb and I have had a lot of talks about, cuz I'm sure cuz you see the TikTok world and the shortest world and we're just barely getting into it.
10:46
The amount of guruism around like networking, like networking tips and tricks and hacks and stuff and networking's never been an issue for me because I at least.
My perspective on it has been, if I provide sufficient value to everyone in my network, by extension have access to everyone who I've already provided value to.
11:02
And so it's like Joe Rogan doesn't need to do it.
Go to networking events like he's Joe Rogan.
There was a neighbor I had who had a little kid who was eight years old.
We're driving somewhere, just got an ice cream kids in the back.
And she was saying, you've got to know the store owner.
So, like, these are the and.
And she said it and then she like, turned around.
She wanted to teach her kid a lesson.
11:19
And she was like, these are the types of people you have to know.
You have to know these people, all right.
Because you have to stay in contact and you have to know the stuff.
I remember hearing that and thinking to myself I was like, no, I was like I'm the person that everyone needs to be in contact with and it was just a difference in worldview, like it was fun and and she was a super networker like, but she had not She'd never seen herself as the person to provide value.
11:43
It was always like how do I manage all of these hundreds of acquaintances And she was amazing networker but it was just a different view and I feel like, I mean they're both fine.
I just for me it was better suited my personality that way.
Hey guys, real quick.
For those of you guys who are $100 million offers fans, I love you.
12:00
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype for $100 million leads.
But you will have the unreleased chapter.
It talks about your first avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com/leads.
12:18
It's both free.
In exchange for your e-mail so that I can e-mail you when we launch $100 million leads and so that you cannot miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like 8 straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
You mentioned earlier that when you quit your job, your best case scenario is where you're at right now, what you're doing.
12:38
How would you describe that?
And did you really anticipate that that's that would have been your best case scenario?
Yes and no.
Ultra success.
Yes Path No.
I felt very confident that I would either get what I wanted or die.
12:54
And I mean that genuinely.
So I knew that I was, I was just going to continue, you know what I mean?
Because I was just in a tremendous amount of pain in the need of validation from exterior that that pain was motivation enough for me to just continue to drive no matter what happened until I got where I wanted to be.
13:10
Now obviously I have new goals now, but and they're motivated a little bit differently.
But by and large, yes, I did think that I was going to be successful.
Did I think it was going to be necessarily through gyms And then.
Gym turn around business and then like no, I didn't think that was and I think that's kind of the the push and pull of being opportunistic when when things open up, but also being dedicated to the longterm path.
13:28
Do you still feel like you need the validation?
Probably do a degree, yeah.
I think a lot of even just comes from internal validation.
Like I want to prove it to me, like I want to prove it to me.
And so I think that's where a lot of it comes from.
Now I'm sure that I'm sure there is some external stuff because humans are social creatures and.
13:44
Like, if everyone hated me tomorrow, I'm sure I'd have a bad day, but I think it.
I would just say it's shifted in percentage.
I'd say, you know, when I when I was 19 it was 99.999 everybody else and .001% me.
And maybe now I'm 6040, you know, maybe 7030 if I'm lucky.
14:01
I'm having a good day.
But you know, my goal is just to just increase that percentage over time and maybe die close to ninetyish.
So after you quit, what was the first taste of success you had?
That gave you validation that maybe that was the right decision to quit and leave my job.
14:17
I actually saw pretty rapid success with the gym, so I was fortunate in that way.
I made profit every month.
Well, the first month I broke even The second.
Second month I made $5000, which was what I was making at the consulting job, more or less.
The next month I made 10,000.
Next month I made 1520.
And then I kind of went from there.
14:33
And so I had immediate validation.
I would say I didn't feel secure.
I felt like it was going to be over tomorrow.
Always I would say that.
That feeling.
Has taken a long time to get rid of.
And I would say that truthfully right now I don't have that feeling, but I have certainly had that at times with Jim Lunch in the earlier days, Prestige Labs in the earlier days, the gyms, absolutely.
14:53
When I was running those, I was like tomorrow everything could go away, you know.
So I think that that that has diminished.
But yeah from a from the get go and that's probably not the the standard entrepreneur story but I slept at the gym.
I mean I.
People here, the slipping, sleeping in the gym part and they're like, oh, like he went through the grind and I did, But I was also like stacking every single dollar that came in and just plowing into my bank account because I had no employees and the only thing I paid for every month was the rent for the facility.
15:20
I did everything to run an entire gym as like a Met, like imagine a gym you walk into and there's no employees.
There's one guy and I did that for like 6 months.
What is now to you?
Is now what you're doing hard or are you an easy?
Phase hard changes.
15:35
Like the like, the way the heart feels is different.
So like when I was when I was starting out, the heart was just sheer exhaustion and fatigue of.
Just like my first session will start at 4:30, my last sales consult ended at at 10:00.
O'clock at night.
And then I would do all the billing and process all the contracts and whatnot, which ended 11:30.
15:54
And then I would sleep right there, like on the floor.
And then I did that because I didn't have to save the commute time.
And then I would just wake up in a cold terror of stress and I would be up in my.
Sure.
Would be clinging to me because it's soaked in stress sweat.
So that was that.
That's what it felt like.
Then when like when we started doing gym launch, the stress was more around like money.
16:14
It was cash flow issues of Okay.
We're we're launching all these, you know, we're launching 8 gyms next month.
I've got a front hotels, airfare, rental car, per diems, ad spend, get all those, you know, campaigns up and running.
And I had to front all that cash off of last month's like.
16:30
So it was more like a managing the cash that was coming into the business thing which was super stressful, but that was the different kind of stress.
Jim launches hard was well one, it was realizing that there was an opportunity in licensing and just called digital products or B2B services that weren't like in person.
16:49
Like that was the huge that was the big unlock when we went from a few $100,000 a month, I think we were like 3 or 400 when we were doing like turnarounds in person.
To you know two or three and it like four and a half million a month just riding that.
But there the issues were me and so it was my character traits that were the deficiency at that point.
17:08
So I feel like I had to change and I'm sure I had to grow at all these stages, but like my ability to handle stress in general, my focus had to increase because when you were a small business owner you can you can shift the ship really you know quickly, you can turn, you can pivot and all that kind of stuff but when you have.
Hundreds of families that are if just on the employee side, but thousands if you include the customer base that are relying on you, it's like you can't make these snap decisions anymore.
17:30
And so it's like I had to calm down and become less erratic.
And that's where the stress and emotional tolerance fed into Okay.
We have a bad day.
Doesn't mean we need to change the strategy.
It just means you had a bad day and then what do you do?
Nothing.
That's all it is.
So one of the things that it's been a huge epiphany for me as we've gone through this journey is that.
17:48
Because I talk about character traits a lot because when we look at portfolio companies for the most time we're betting on the jockey.
I mean like we understand the fundamentals of business and we, you know, we're betting on this market etcetera.
But like the number one thing, 80% of our scorecard is based on the entrepreneur.
And so when we're looking at that, a lot of people at least myself including when I was coming up, I thought like I'm impatient.
18:08
I would speak that over myself like I'm an impatient person, you know, and I wanted to be more patient so.
The difference between somebody who's loyal to their wife and somebody who is not is not the fact that they might have their eye get caught, because that happens.
They're human.
You're going to have emotions, right?
But the difference between somebody who's loyal and not is whether they cheat, right?
18:28
And so I think that it's the same thing with patients.
It's the same thing with honesty.
It's not do you want to lie?
It's do you choose not to, despite wanting to lie?
Right.
And it's just like courage to the, you know, the famous one with like it's not the absence of fear but taking action despite it.
And so I think a lot of those character traits, a lot of people, it feels like these amorphous things that we want to have and like take off the shelf and put inside of ourselves.
18:47
And so we think that we need to feel a certain way in order to be a patient person or be a kind person or whatever when at least in my experience, it's been you don't feel that way and you take the action that a patient or kind or courageous or loyal or honest person would take despite the feeling.
19:03
And that's that was it.
That was a huge unlock for me in terms of understanding my stress levels in terms of decision making within the company.
Like if I want to be a long term thinker, then I have to, despite not wanting to act in the interest of the long term.
And I think when I started doing that, the compounding of the businesses in general started to really unlock.
19:21
I think it comes down to discipline probably.
Yeah, short term, Yeah, being able to be uncomfortable in the short term for whatever you want in the long term.
Absolutely.
But yeah the in the final chapter which we consider with acquisition.com to to close the loop on that.
The hard now is just I would say it's it's those character traits that I just went over but just more it's just the the standard of patience is higher.
19:43
The standard of discipline is higher.
The standard of focus is higher and so it's not and and even to further this point.
Character traits are not binary, right?
They're not.
You are patient.
You are not patient.
It's how patient are you?
It's not you're dishonest or honest, it's how honest are you.
And so I think that maybe what was able to get me through Jim launch Prestige Labs and Allen was maybe like a seven out of 10 and like to get to a billion plus, which is what we're on the path to do now.
20:09
I got to be a nine, you know what I mean?
And maybe to get to 10 billion I got to be a nine and a half.
And so at least that's my that's that would say that's what hard feels like is choosing the actions that I know is aligned with the person that I need to be in order to do the thing I want to do despite not feeling what feeling like it.
20:25
What types of books or podcasts or media are you consuming to help you to develop these views?
Not many.
I'm not super heavy on consumption to be honest with you.
I would say that.
The degree of my consumption is mostly as silly as it sounds.
20:43
Our stuff, just to make sure that it's like looking okay, it's like I'd say like proofing our own stuff is like I would say 70%, which sounds ridiculous, but it is.
That's also because it's a very small percentage.
Just to be fair, it's a small percentage of my time.
And then the other 30% is like if you looked at my Twitter the the vast majority of people that I follow are is, is, is philosophy stuff.
21:02
That's like, you know what I mean?
If you look at my Instagram, the only people that I'm really following are people that I want to just see what they're doing rather than consuming their content.
I just want to see like understand their strategy, their cadence, how they caption stuff.
Are they doing anything new?
Because I'm new into that world, in the content world.
And so I just, I'm just trying to learn.
21:18
And so that's, but I don't have any specific people that I consume a lot from.
I mean, most of my learning comes from doing.
I had this myth that I used to believe that, like, if I read a book, I would somehow have a skill.
And I feel like when you read a book, you have like, a general idea of, like, the vague outline of what the skill might be, right?
21:38
And so, like you, you learned so much more from your first hundred sales calls than you will from reading every single book in the library on sales.
And so I think that that belief shifted actually when I was doing, when I was in that six month terrible period of my life where I was like, deciding whether to stay or go, I read, I think like. 10 or 15 self help books and I realized that my life hadn't changed.
22:00
And so then I almost like decried all of the hopefully it's not too graphic.
Like the mental masturbation of just like I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm learning, But like I wasn't really learning because it didn't actually affect my behavior.
And if you look at behavioral conditioning, they say the definition of learning is that way you you put the same condition and you have a different behavior and so if someone does something in a condition.
22:22
And then they learn something, and then you present the same condition.
If their behavior changes, they have learned something, right?
Which either happens to reinforcement or punishment.
That's it.
And so I was consuming all the stuff and in the same condition, which means that I had learned nothing despite consuming a lot of content.
And so once I realized that, I realized that behavior in action was the thing that actually got me to learn.
22:40
And so I biased all of my activity towards that rather than massive consumption of information.
And I figured I would learn more from doing than from learning how to do.
And that ended U being true.








0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
Hey, what's going on everyone?
Happy Tuesday, hope you guys are having an awesome, awesome day so far.
And I hope you guys had a good more weekend.
The thing that was on my mind today that I figured I'd make a video for you about Is, you know, rev-share Builder. 5000 and this, the awful agencies that exist out there, and the lie that most of the time, they pedal to gym owners, and the reason I wanted to make a video about it, or if this is being used as audio.
0:46
No.
Audio about it.
It's because it's probably the thing that bugs me the most in the entire industry and there's two aspects to it.
The first aspect is where we have agency owners and, you know, rev-share.
Dudes guys who basically bought clickfunnels and Facebook, marketing course.
1:04
And then consider themselves experts on the gym business, right?
Because they're like, you're supposed to Niche down.
So pick a niche and they pick Jim's, right?
And so, the reason that it bugs the crap out of me, is that they feed this one lie and they ride this lie into the sunset, and they ride it so hard in the gym.
1:20
It down.
Our throats is gym.
Owners is two things.
One is that they preach to you.
How you're supposed to run your business, having never actually run the business, right?
Having never actually owned a gym or Multiple gyms, right?
Or if they did ask them how successful it was right that they act like do they have an exit?
You don't even like, just like things don't add up from a success standpoint.
1:38
The reason that there's so many gurus that are out there is that they didn't make money with their gyms and then they start selling how to make money with Jim after they sold their gym, or close their gym and the reality is that they never knew how to make money with the gym.
And so that's kind of how they transition and that's why none of them really gross.
1:54
Because ultimately the product that they have is shit in the same thing happened with the gym, is that the product that had was good.
And so didn't grow, right?
And so they get along by selling on this this premise that just simply false, right?
So that's the first thing, the second thing is the lie that that you're a gym owner and so you shouldn't know how to Market or run ads for your business.
2:20
That's the lot, right?
And they say this, they say, listen, you should just focus on what you do, invest, which is training clients.
And then we'll just focus on what we do best, which is As you know running traffic and learning the new ad platforms and Facebook's new changes, right Facebook.
Like I've been running ads on Facebook for eight years, all right, the platform has not changed that much, right?
2:40
Like, literally has not changed that much.
You know what's crazy about it is that they will say this to you in one breath.
And then in the next breath, turn to the person that they pay that they hired a week ago that they took they trained for two days and how to run an ad and then they will let that person run and manage your account.
2:57
And they're paying that person. 15 20 bucks an hour, right?
And so they're like you're incapable of doing a 15-hour job because it's so complicated.
Right?
And they try and make it seem like it's overwhelming just to get you to not try, right?
And so anyways, this bugs the crap out of me because it basically a it's demeaning to it to a gym owner be as a business owner.
3:20
What they're saying is that, you don't need to own all the core competencies of running a business.
Like if you don't know how to generate leads, If you don't know how to nurture leads, if you don't know how to sell, if you don't know how to fulfill, and if you don't know how to, you know, retain people and that a send them to higher levels of service they're saying yeah.
3:37
Yeah.
You don't need to know how to do these first few things if you don't want to learn how to do those things, you'll never grow as a business owner like it's just a deficit in skill and that's okay because it's just a learning process, it's a growth process.
But if you're the like right now and so this will probably turn some people off but if you're the type of person who's listening to this right now and it's like, well I don't want to Earn that stuff.
3:57
Am I cool?
You're just not going to grow, you know?
I mean like you're just your business is not going to Boom.
Like, did you have to learn this that you have to learn how to generate increase?
You have to learn how to nurture them.
You have to learn how to sell.
Now that could be based on referrals, it doesn't matter, but you have to have a process around it.
And so when when an agency or a Rapture companies like you just focus on what you do pat on the head, little Little Gym owner, like you just, you just keep training your sessions and getting your clients great results because that's what, you know, how to do best.
4:25
I'm like, dude.
Shut up.
You know what I mean?
Like, you've never run a gym.
It's not that hard.
You can do it.
So like I like I know that you're not smarter than I am, right?
Or like like literally you can Google how to run a Facebook ad on Google right now and we'll find up-to-date video.
4:42
It's for free on the internet.
It's not hard, right?
And so it just bugs the crap out of me.
Well, guys, just like are susceptible to this.
So if there's a company that is an agency, don't listen to them for how to run your gym because Miranda Jim and second.
4:58
Don't like, don't rely on them said, never ever seen somebody who's been with an agency for more than like, like I haven't seen someone ever stay with one for more than a year.
Like, I can't even think of one.
Right?
The, the typical life cycle is this, they run an advertising campaign that they know is like going to do decently well.
5:15
And then it works and the second month who works a little less.
Well, third month, it works less.
But the problem is they signed you up on a 12-month contract, right?
And then you got to get into this whole dispute and then you leave, you know, Burning pissed off and they say, customers don't understand and then you say they suck, right?
But the end of the day like you're going to be.
5:32
Have to be the one who has to learn how to fish for yourself.
It's just is what it is, right?
Because no one's going to care about your cheddar, more than you will.
No one's going to care about refreshing adds.
More than you all they're doing is they're just trying to manage their client load and more realistically.
They're trying to sell on the front end the whole time because that's what they know how to do, right?
5:49
It's Market, but they're not good on the Fulfillment, they just hand it off to somebody who is like who, they're paying minimum wage.
Run your stuff right until like, if they can pay that person minimum wage, you can do these small amount of effort that it takes to learn this valuable skill for your business in order to take control of the business that you own.
6:07
So that's all right.
It like it just drives me up a wall and it's insane.
Like, you have to own every core competency of the business, if you do not know how, if you're like, well, I don't want to learn that them like, good luck, you know?
I mean, good luck.
It's like you're just going to keep bouncing from agency to agency and like because none of them are really ever going to care about your results like you will.
6:25
It just is what it It is like no one will care about Jim watches growth more than I will.
It just is right.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world kidding.
6:42
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now.
It'll take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
6:59
All right, so please go do that now.
Then let's get back to the shop.
And so you have to know how to do this.
And even if even, if you were eventually get to the point where you're like, you know what, we have 10 locations and like running traffic as a full-time thing.
Then you can have a traffic manager, but you need to know what they're doing so that you can give them feedback, right?
7:19
So you feel like hey, this number is out of place, like this doesn't look like right.
Like if you have to know what you're talking about, so that's on the agency side, on the red, share side.
If you're being wooed by somebody, who's saying, hey, there's no money up front, then it means that they know Something that you don't, which is that there's a massive opportunity that you're not exploiting.
7:37
And so they're saying because you're afraid of taking risks.
I'm going to take the risk for you and take all the profit.
Right.
I know because I did it, I had a Rapture company.
That was what my first, the first business like Jim launch.
Original was a rupture company, that's what it was the first four months in business.
7:54
I had an eight-man sales team, we flew them out to gyms, and then I would collect 100% of the revenue would fly them out. 21 days.
We'd be on site.
I would you want average 50 I was in sales per location in the first 21 days.
Now you're like, Alex, do you guys if you did that, why did you stop reason we stop?
8:10
Just because I had to pay the payroll.
So I had to pay the flights there and back Ida pay for the hotels for the 21 days.
I debate for the rental car for the 21 days.
I did make the ad spend for the 21 days and then I had to pay for the commission's on top of that.
For the 21 days that the goes out there and making fifty thousand dollars in sales and the type of guy who's going to fly out and do that and spend 21 days away from his family, ain't going to do it cheap.
8:33
Right?
And so we were still with all of that able to make money, right?
And the thing is is like the models I could see on the writing on the walls like man, I don't want to have to have a 200-person sales team.
Like this is just insane and there was a ton of logistics behind it and the main one, the main reason we stopped doing it is because the gym owners that we were serving.
8:52
Like like there was not there was no personal growth that happened for them.
So what happened is I'd have a gym owner who is unaware sitting there and then all of a sudden the sound of a hundred people just Jim, he's just not ready for that.
It's a we issues with the people not being able to fulfill because the thing is, for me, I was like, I'm a sign up as many people as I can because that's where my intended was.
9:10
But there are some gyms that simply could not handle it, and so, it just, it just put our, it put our incentives against one another, and I didn't like it.
And so that's when we switch to.
Hey, you know what?
I'm going to show you how to do it, but the point is, there, is that what I'm saying?
Like, the ref.
I like, the ref share company, if they are doing it, it means that they know something that you don't know.
9:28
It means that they're, they're able to make so much money on your gym that they're able to they're willing to do.
Do it for that, cover the cost.
So if you're like, if you're getting pitch by that, right?
Then it means that you better.
Just learn how to do it and then take all of the profit for yourself.
9:44
Like I feel like this is obvious, like, I don't know.
Like this is like feels really, really obvious to me, but it might not be, you know what I mean?
It might not be so just to bring this full circle for anyone that's on you.
You need to own every aspect of your business, all five core function need to know how to generate leads.
10:02
You know, how to nurture leads.
You need to know how to sell, you know, how to fulfill you get out of retain and resell special, send people.
All right.
That's we need to know.
If you don't know how to do those things.
It's not a business.
It's not a complete business.
If you have to ask first pieces of it, then you like I do want to say these words but like, you don't deserve to have a successful business because you're not willing to grow and learn this.
10:19
It I said like you feel like you don't deserve that success was because you are not willing to grow and learn and then you will continue to ride the cycle of like not knowing why your business isn't growing.
Because you are grown.
So that's on there.
10:34
Like why you shouldn't use an agency side on the ref your side.
Like I said, it's an opportunity that they're exploiting that you're choosing not to exploit because you're afraid to take the risk.
And the thing is that, as an entrepreneur, you have to take risks, it's just part of the game, right?
But you have to make like, you have to make the logical logical.
Jump that hold on.
10:49
These guys are able to spend the money on the ads and generate a positive return on top of that.
Plus what they're giving me as my rev-share and still willing to do this.
Hmm.
I wonder If I owned all of that Revenue, if I would make more money, interesting, something to think about.
11:09
But anyways, that was just my, my topic for today.
I hope you guys find out, interesting.
It just, it was just on my, on my mind.
And I felt like I needed to share it.
So if you're a gym owner and you haven't signed up for lunch, there's the only two things that I think that you'd be doing other than us.
So hopefully that should explain away some of the concerns you might have.
11:29
And to show you that we are invested in it, we would start for 1,000 bucks.
X is going from that because frankly, most homeowners don't have the money to afford our services, and that's okay.
And that's why we help you make it with us, so that's why we came.
So, anyways, lots of love tag, a friend needs to hear this for those gym owners or engine lunch and have this friend who's, like, on the sidelines.
11:50
He's like, but I don't know, just tagging here because it's an inevitability.
You have to learn how to do it, you have to, you just have to like disappear.
Like he just doesn't like you have to learn how to do it.
So it's like how you gonna learn, you know.
So anyways lots of Guys, have an amazing Tuesday, and rest of week, I hope you guys had an awesome Memorial Day weekend and its usual keeping awesome, send your friends.
12:11
All right.







0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
0:22
I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It means the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world with someone else.
So the question is, which future we can Today because on off the future of more of the same or we killing off the future of everything that you said, you wanted which feature the wealthiest people in the world.
0:41
See business is a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to under million dollars and Beyond, I hope you share and enjoy.
And so one of my favorite closes here at the end here is best case worst clothes, which is like listen at the end of the day, both of these options are risk-free, right?
1:05
You can walk out the door, you can sign up, get a guarantee, but only one of them will get you closer to your goal.
So, if you have no risk with no upside, or no risk with potential of upside, which one you want to do, I have closed a lot of weight loss sales with that close.
It's probably if I had top three, that's of the top three.
1:24
Best case worst case.
Let's play it out.
Best case you change your life, you get into amazing shape.
Would that be a great outcome?
Yes, worst case you do this and you don't have that happen.
I'll give you money back and just got free six weeks of training fair enough because the only other option you have that's also restore easy walk out the door but that one is guaranteed to not get what you want.
1:45
This one's at least got a shot, you boil it down like that.
A lot of people are like, okay, I'll step in that direction.
Cool.
Why you don't need money?
This is a big one and I love this one.
If there's one thing that you can remember, it's the top line on here is that you know what self-made Millionaires and you guys have in common, both started at zero.
2:07
Let me tell you the story of shoe, dog, Phil Knight story.
And we read that book, great book.
There's this moment where he's maxed out his credit cards, maxed out his loans, can't get anyone to give him money and he's got to make payroll and buy inventory.
And he goes to every One.
2:23
And he's like, I don't know what to do because they're making so many sales, he can't, he get the cash, you need a cash flow constraint and so he goes to his vendors.
Imagine going to your landlord, or imagine going to what vendors you go to clickfunnels, whatever, right?
2:39
So somebody like some software and you're like, hey, I need you to pay my payroll for me.
Otherwise, I won't be able to keep paying you in the future because I'm going to go out of business.
That's what he did.
He went to his manufacturing Partners is that I need you to pay my payroll for me.
Like, what is like?
2:54
Otherwise I won't be able to buy shoes from you and they did and then I kept going.
And so it wasn't the fact that Phil didn't have the resources, is the fact that he was resourceful and so it's just like the five thousand dollar Ferrari or if you have the hospital bill that comes up tomorrow, you become resourceful when it's for something that you truly value.
3:15
Quick question who here has had a tax bill come up unexpectedly?
How about that time of year, right?
Okay.
Follow-up question, who here is magically siphoned cash out of their asshole and found a way to pay Uncle Sam, right?
3:31
Of course or an unexpectedly, High payroll, built, whatever it is.
And here's this fucked up.
Is that everyone who just raised their hand, you're willing to flex that muscle when it's for someone else but not when it's for your bank account when it's for your landlord, when it's the IRS, what's for payroll and for other people all of a sudden you get Resourceful, but it means that you don't hold yourself to that standard all the time.
3:54
Interesting, right?
So the big thing here, is that you need someone to be resourceful, not have resources, and that goes for all of us, right?
Like if you have a big decision, you need to make it.
If you really want it, then it just comes down to being resourceful, not having the resources begin with because every self-made millionaire starts at 0.
4:14
So what separates them from everyone else, nothing.
They were just resourceful feel good about that time.
Now we have to value good for moving, this is all right.
Okay, cool.
You feel like you can use this stuff to close more sales.
Okay, cool.
4:31
Also close yourself unless head bullshit.
Okay, fit.
Not sure it's for me.
The special snowflake scenario.
Genuinely, I don't think I've lost a sale on this one in a very long time, obviously a very long time, but but I didn't lose many this.
4:46
I feel very confident.
This which is someone says, I don't like something very specific with the program.
I only like Zumba, I don't want to eat broccoli.
I think you should have a vegan version of this plan, whatever.
Right.
And so, here are the three ways that overcame this new identity, priorities pain of change and hypothetical.
5:03
All right, so let's start with the first one.
So we vote with our dollars with the things that we care about and this was always my that like just like the busy when I was saying earlier, busy is the best time we vote with our dollars.
For the things we care about like that was always my soon.
As someone say, I want to change this thing.
Let me tell you a quick story.
5:20
I was at Sephora, which is a makeup store with Layla and I was standing there.
Awkwardly like this.
Watching them paint faces and there's two little girls come in.
They're so excited.
Yeah.
5:35
Ish High old and they were there are new to Womanhood.
It was clear, right?
And these girls came up and the girl with the Smock goes over to them and she's like, hey girls, now that you guys are women, you're gonna have to start budgeting for this stuff every month because you're going to buy this because you're becoming a woman.
5:52
You have to put this makeup on, and they were like so excited.
They grabbed the things.
No rush to check out and I was like, that's so interesting.
Like they their identity changed from being girls to being women.
And so with that new identity came new priorities, I was like that was like that moment that I got to witness.
6:12
I was like this is a perfect analogy for what people do when they're trying to lose weight when they're trying to be a better business owners is that when you have a new identity, you have new priorities.
And so if you're explaining this to a prospect it's like let me tell you a quick story.
You tell that story or your version of that story.
Say listen, you want to be this person.
6:29
So right now, you're not stepping into a mud, you're already a woman, right?
Or whatever it is right?
You're already a man.
The question is whether you want to be a fit woman for Life.
The question is whether you want to be a successful gym owner.
So he's wealthy.
And with new identity comes to priorities, we vote with our dollars with things we care about, you say, you care about these things.
6:46
But if I look at your bank account, I can see what you vote with your dollars for, so makes sense, right?
You can close it.
Next one is pain of change, right?
And this one's a big one, which is like, I met this girl is like do you think you could change the breakfast to this in this because that's what I already was like girl I know that's what you already.
7:07
I can see that that breakfast.
Got you?
That body right?
That morning routine.
Got you that bank account?
Yeah.
Right.
Got a change to change.
And so the thing is, I always have that conversation.
So hey the pain of Change, Change staying the same.
7:23
This is Tony Robbins go, that's not mine, but when the pain of change is greater than pain of staying the same, you will change and sometimes I look at a girl just like hey maybe you got a gain 50 more pounds and come back.
I was like, you're not enough pain, you're comfortable.
They're like, well, I don't want that.
7:38
I'm like, well, that's what you're saying with your actions and not enough pain.
I like, let's just play it out.
How much you gain last five years. 50.
Cool.
Come back in five years.
What do you weigh now?
250, you'll be 300.
Just come back when you're 300.
Real Talk.
7:55
They're like, well, I don't want that and I'm like you're acting like you do know like well shit.
I'm like, yeah.
All right.
Damn.
But it's like all of us have these things that we hold onto, when in reality, like are you in enough pain?
Maybe need to be broker.
8:12
Maybe you have no money in your bank account.
Need to be in debt.
It's a comeback when you're 50 Grand in debt.
Come back.
When you lose money for another two years, come back, then we'll be ready.
That'll be the right moment.
That'll be all right.
Time for you.
The thing is is everyone's thermostat.
I'm sorry, I'm side question here for a second but everyone's thermostat is different, right?
8:29
Like I feel actually pretty fat and out of shape right now because on my thermostat I'm fat and out of shape for some people.
I'm hashtag life goals, everyone's different.
And what's interesting is that even people were 250 300 pounds, whatever there's a moment where for them, that's their thermostat and they're like, no, no, I can't go above here.
8:50
And what's crazy, is that all you have to do is just reset the thermostat.
It's the same effort, just reset the thermostat right now, your thermostat, maybe ten thousand dollars, your bank account, maybe it's 100,000 bigger, but maybe a million dollars him.
Big guy might be fifty thousand dollars a month in income, it might, whatever it is.
It's like all you have to do is just reset.
9:07
What that thermostat is and I think if you can communicate that to a prospect that it's just made up in their head thing is if you can have that little that little moment that you some of you guys just had if you have that with a prospect like you can change their life and I think that's really cool.
So paint a change you got to change in order to change.
9:28
I really did say that the the breakfast that second girl, I know.
As I want we try my breakfast so we can get the body.
You actually want.
All right.
So here's what this is going to.
I've been trying to come out because when my sales book comes out, I'm gonna do this hypothetical thing, but I'm trying to figure out some like a three step process to closing like most obstacles that I can teach.
9:48
But one that I use a lot is anything that this is why this one I basically never lost sales on fit stuff was okay.
Well if this program had everything that you needed, would you do it?
Hey if this program were perfect, would you do it?
If the program didn't have this thing that you just said Isolate the issue.
10:04
Would you do it?
And then you get agreement and they're like cool, we don't worry about that.
One thing will card you can use.
I don't want to do broccoli.
Fantastic.
Not going to do broccoli.
If we didn't have that, would you do it?
Great.
And so it's just one of those really easy things that you can always use on the flip side.
10:20
It's also just a good clothes overall which is what is it missing?
And then they're like, I've never been asked this question before and you're like right because it doesn't sound like there's anything wrong with the program.
It sounds like you're afraid of something happening.
Let's talk about.
At that, right?
And then you actually get to the real stuff peeling back the layers, so I'm not sure it's a fit for me.
10:41
We covered that, with new identity, and priorities pain of change.
You've got to change to change and hypothetical so isolate.
Hypothesize, a world where it wouldn't have that issue.
Then overcome.
See how we're peeling down.
Peeling down the layers.
Alright, awesome.
10:57
Two more.
Still hanging in there.
Okay, I know this is more tactical, I know this is more tactical, I know this is tactical, but I just want you guys to have stuff that like when you leave here, like I will make more sales.
Okay, raise your hand.
If you've ever thought, or how to prospect say I have to talk to my business partner.
11:13
Spouse friend kids, employees pets.
Yes.
Right.
This is big.
When someone says this what they say is that person controls?
Me wherever they point.
So, if some of you guys like, I got to talk to my Spouse totally get it that person controls, you say, hey, I got to talk to my employees.
11:34
Guess who owns you.
I got to talk to my pet.
It's kind of weird, but, hey, some people do it.
And so I have really only found one way to overcome this, at has been smooth.
All right, so the rest of the other obstacles are zillion ways to overcome it.
11:50
Lack of authority, is one of the hardest ones to overcome exact.
I don't have control of my own life.
I can't make decisions for myself.
I am powerless, I'm a victim to what it says.
And so this one is a process.
So first off, you know, like in many and many selling situations, you don't have the advantage that you like here.
12:07
Like some of you guys could call people yesterday.
Talked to people, whatever right?
Or you have more time in weight loss sales, we all know we're all waiting for Lisa to come back, right?
She said she call you back, it's been five years Stockholm back, right?
And so you want to get the person to bring their spouse.
12:23
You want to get the person to bring the decision maker whenever possible.
It's also worth get worth it gets The second sale.
Why not right?
But if you can't, then this is the only thing that I have found.
That is were consistently, so it's three steps.
Let me go back one.
There you go.
Isolating collapse of oil, the realization.
12:40
They've already given you permission and realization that you never needed permission to begin with.
All right, so I'll walk the room so you said, hey, assuming already asked, right?
Transaction versus long-term you say, hey, what part do you think they wouldn't approve of of this thing that I talked about?
12:55
The reason.
This is what this is the isolating collapse of foil.
All right, your reasoning.
Ask them.
Why do you think your husband, why do you think your partner?
Why do you think your employees would not want you to do this?
Now mind you, the employees and the partner?
And the husband are not here so they have no idea.
13:12
So they're just going to answer it with the reason that they actually don't want to do it and then you have isolated and collapse the foil and then you can attack.
The reason that they say?
So what do you think you're going to be opposed to?
Well, I've done a couple things in the past and they didn't work.
Okay, then let's talk about the thing that you're afraid of, which is that this is not going to work too.
13:32
So it sounds like it's a belief issue.
So let's talk about that right now.
It's not about the husband anymore.
It's about the fact that she doesn't believe, so make sense.
So we just, we pull now, she's back in the driver's seat, and she can make a decision, help herself, or he can make a decision, help himself.
Okay, that's step one.
13:47
Sometimes you just close it off that which is wonderful, two and three go together.
And so if they you've already asked, hey, what do you think they would approve of right?
Then you say, well, do they approve of your current struggle?
And I'm like, well no, it's like, well, then why would they be against something?
14:04
They already don't approve of the, huh?
I think about that.
Well, what if the roles were reversed and your husband was struggling or your partner was struggling, with making money, getting in shape, whatever it is, I was like and they found something that is going to help them.
Also, would you be against it?
No, I don't want that, right?
So why would it be different for them?
14:21
Because I think the thing is, is that you're looking for permission, not for support because let's play this out, three years, you're still bankrupt, you're still out of shape, whatever it is three years from now, you're not making the money, you want, whatever it is three years from now and all the while you blamed now, see how we're changing the language.
14:41
You blame them because they never let you do it.
Is that fair to them Zephyr to, you know.
So I think what you've been looking for this whole time?
Been asking for permission when you really need support.
Do you think you're as well as for you in solving?
This problem?
Already said he doesn't approve of yes.
14:58
So the whole the whole idea here is that we're relying on past agreements to extrapolating, the present and then we're future forecasting.
A negative situation which realistically, like, hopefully for everyone here.
I know that if I wanted something Leila's, not going to be like, how dare you write?
15:15
Like I wanted, it does that mean, like it's not even a discussion, right?
And so it's really a question of power.
And the end of the day, I think, even if the person doesn't buy from you if you can help them make a decision that is empowered, you have served them.
And for me that's my big thing was sales is like if I can actually get in this person's mind, peel back the shit.
15:33
Get them to make decisions one way or the other.
I feel like I serve this person today and that I feel like I'm here convicted about.
And so at the end of the day, it's your decision if they say no no resentment.
And so then I say, hey, let's just get you going.
We have a three-day, no sweat guarantee which is you You sign up today, you get back home, your husband says sweetheart.
15:54
I want you to live 10 years.
Less long.
I want you to be out of shape.
I want you get that diabetes needle, right?
I want you to put those sweatpants on reach the head in this bag of Cheetos, just, you know, and sit down and get comfortable and pass on generational unhealth to our kids who we can make future generations.
16:10
To people who don't understand how he says that to you one have him, give me a call to.
I was like I'll happily tear this up, alright?
And then, of course, they're cracking up.
And you're like, right, of course, You're not going to say that he wants you to live longer.
Wants you to pass on these good habits, your kids.
He wants to be hot and sexy feel good about yourself, right?
16:26
Of course, he does it.
What you're afraid of is, that's not going to work that we can help you with, right?
It makes sense.
All right, cool.
So we're peeling back the onion.
We covered time, recovered value covered fit.
We cover people, casting their power to Authority, all these different things.
16:42
They cast their power to here's the best part when you finally have learned and, you know, how to D bullshit yourself and D bullshit their brains To get them down to this final thing, you're actually talking to a person who's in power.
They can't blame their, they can't give the authority to other people.
16:58
They can't blame the circumstances because it's about being resourceful.
Overall, finding the time, making it work, getting out of pain.
All you have now is just somebody says I get all that I see you think about when someone says anything about it?
Well, I want you to translate that into is I need to avoid this decision.
17:15
For fear of making a mistake, that's what that means.
Because what it really means is just I just want the universe to make the decision for me, what a pussy move.
Like, I'm not man or woman enough, I don't have the gonads, which are both sexes.
By the way, I don't have the nads to make this call, so I'm just gonna let the universe do it, so then I can blame the universe if it doesn't go right.
17:39
It's just fear.
So, big important note, we have exhausted all reasons outside of themselves.
Now, we're talking to someone who's at least in power.
All right, so raise your hand if you ever thought or at a prospect say?
I think about it.
Not sure I needed a this guy still.
17:54
He's like, not me everyone decides, okay?
As a fun side note.
Anyone know like, the ruin of decide so comes from Latin dictionary, which means to kill off.
And so, a good one is to even ask someone that question is like, we just need to decide.
18:10
Do you know what the root of It is the kid.
Eric, it's a kill off.
So the question is, which future we killing off today because on off the future of more of the same or you killing off the future of everything that you said you wanted?
Which feature cool?
All right, avoidance.
18:25
Anything about it.
So this is the frame.
I think about past present future and this is an easy one for you.
So when someone says, I need to think about it, you translate that into, I'm going to avoid this decision for fear of making a mistake.
You're like cool.
Let's talk about your past.
Think it's, this is not a fast.
18:40
Fast decision, right?
You've been deciding this for years.
How long you want to be in shape, my whole life.
So this doesn't seem fast at all, even deciding this forever.
Now, we're just taking action on it.
You decided a long time ago.
There were taken the first step, huh.
I think about like that.
18:57
And there's another one come this far six inches from gold is like, listen.
And this is one where I like to stack all the shit they've done to get to this point where like listen, you saw an ad you clicked it, you bought a ticket, you reserved it, you block the Time you flew out here, you got a hotel.
19:12
You showed up at the crack of dawn, you had all these notes you walked in here.
Of course you want to fucking grow your gym of course you're trying to lose weight.
You block the time.
You got in your car.
You got all the way over here.
This isn't a fast decision, you've indicated with your actions up to this point.
This is important to you.
And you think that maybe the reason you've struggled in the past is because you haven't been able to pull the trigger.
19:34
Do you think meeting to think about is the reason you're here right now, rather than where you want to be?
Could you always need to think about it?
Which means you don't.
So the question is just, do you want to have another year of almost love this one, do another year of almost being in the shape.
You want, almost making the amount of money you want almost being the spouse.
19:51
You want to be, but not quite.
And so the question is, how much is not deciding cost you up to this point, how are the last five years for you?
Is that a cost?
You didn't decide to do this five years ago, right?
So would you say all that pain that you went through?
Is that a big cost?
20:08
So anything about like that, I don't think it's that expensive, right?
That's passed since getting them.
And what we're doing here is were agitating and reminding them of why they are here to increase their action threshold.
Rather decrease, their action threshold to get them to step over and make a decision.
So it makes sense, what we're doing conceptual here.
20:24
We're looking at their past decisions, will go through all of them showing them how far they've come explaining them.
The maybe, the reason that there aren't the fucking seat today is because they have struggled pulling the trigger in the past.
They thought about doing things like this before.
For but they haven't been able to they have it nutted up and today they need to otherwise they're going to have another year of almost and then we asked them if all the pain they've been through has been enough pain for them to make a decision.
20:51
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
21:06
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
And that was the one.
I actually had this last year.
21:24
This lady was like, this is like she was referencing a call.
That was like five years earlier.
Very beginning of Jim Lunch.
She's like, it's crazy.
Think I had two sales call with you six years ago and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not jumping in your program wall.
Well, so funny.
So, funny.
I was like, yeah, you let it bad decision.
21:41
Bernie twice.
Once, when you made a poor investment, the second time we let that bad investment.
S may be making a good one.
I remember the conversation right here.
She is six years later.
Same position.
Same exact shit, but she couldn't because he had one bad boyfriend, she's like, no men for me, that's it.
21:58
Just me and my cats.
So, 2 is present.
All right, so, we talked about the past all the things you've done to get here.
All the pain you've been through.
Do you think not being able to pull the trigger is the reason you're sitting in the seat today, right?
So now, let's talk about present.
So I love this one, I use the rocking chair, close a lot.
22:15
As far as I'm concerned, I made it up.
So Here's your other rocking, chair close Works.
I'd like when you say, you need to think about it.
I was like, you don't really think we're going to think about it, right?
Because like what's going to happen not going to like drive out of here.
22:31
Go home.
Sit on sit in a rocking chair on your portion.
Be like, hmm, am I going to join this program or knots?
Right, of course, not what you gonna do.
I'll sit here and get in your car and check your phone and C6.
Mix, mix text messages and you're like, fuck!
I could pick up the laundry or the dry cleaner.
22:46
Get pick up Timmy from school.
I got to get food, I got to go.
Repeats whatever it is write all the shit and then five days from now you're going to put on one of your skirts.
You can check your bank account and it's be like, ooh, this is tight and in that men are like I should have done that thing.
That's when you made the decision right, then you keep living your life and you do another five years until it gets painful enough.
23:08
So you don't need.
And you've heard this one for me before.
You don't need time to make a decision, you need formation and I'm your source of information.
So what are the main things you're thinking about?
How are you making the decision?
So we're bringing it to the present, right?
We're not letting them kick it off.
We're saying, let's confront this.
What are your main criteria?
23:25
Now, they're going to say, I have no fucking idea because I don't know how to make decisions because I'm a victim and you're like, oh well, you know what?
I've talked to victims before, let me tell Hi teach them how to make decisions.
Cool great.
So here's how to make a decision.
Product us.
You access the money.
All right.
So do you believe the product could work?
23:42
Yes.
Do you trust us?
You trust me.
Do you like many things?
Got bad breath?
No, I think I like you guys.
Okay.
Do you think it'll work for you the way you want it to go?
Yes.
Cool.
Do you have access to the amount of money to start this thing or know?
Someone who does?
23:58
Yes.
Right.
She made the decision.
Let's do it.
A lot of times people need to be walked through how to make a decision.
People actually don't make that me.
Decisions kind of crazy.
We make lots of micro decisions, they don't make big ones so you have to teach them how to make decisions.
Many of you guys suck at making big decisions, Chef to learn having framework.
24:15
That's why all these investors talk about having a latticework of decision-making Frameworks.
So I do a lot of Frameworks stuff so I have to make a lot of big Stakes decisions all the time.
Big strategic, directions, big checks.
Like you have to make big decisions.
You have to have a framework, be able to do it and remove your emotions.
If it checks the boxes, you do the deal, this one's really good if you ever have the opportunity to free trial stuff.
24:36
It's just Free trial and or money back guarantee stuff.
The third one is fucking fire.
Which is listen, can we both agree that you just need to make an informed decision?
They're going to say, yes, that's what I need.
An informed decision.
Absolutely.
They're going to has taken the bait.
That's what that is.
All right, like, okay.
24:52
You need to make informed decision.
Well, how can you make an informed decision without doing it?
Huh?
Hmm.
Got me there.
Like, so when we do this, let's get you started.
And if 30 days in you hate it, Let me know.
25:08
Oops, there you go.
If your thirties in you hate it, let me know.
I'll give you money back.
No big deal but that way at least you have made an informed decision rather than one that's made up in your mind about what I say.
Or what you think it is.
It'll Bridge our communication gap because you've got an idea what it is in your head.
25:25
I know what it is in my head and I'm using words to try and communicate that to you.
That's going to fail versus you actually doing it.
Can we agree that that's a way more.
Informed decision.
Yes.
Well then let's do an informed decision.
Let's get you going right there.
If you close themselves with that.
Yeah, Wags.
25:41
Okay.
Decision, definition already went that one over that out.
So again, when we're in the present, we have to tell them which future we're cutting off, right.
Did you know, it's from the Latin dictionary, means to kill off, which we killing off the good one or the bad one.
Cool future.
25:58
So, you guys getting this pass, we stacked all the past pain.
Bring them to this point present.
It's all about rocking chair time not information, helping them make the decision in the moment.
And future is future.
Casting what?
I prefer to see positive and negative.
So five years in the future, what does it look like if you keep doing what you're doing?
26:16
Are you broker are you in a worst marriage or, you know, worse body?
A lot of times literally say like what did you what did you gain last five years?
Cool, let's tack that on.
What do you weigh now?
2:30, okay 270, how's that feel?
26:34
You can see them visually react to this earlier.
Oh shit your Give ten thousand dollars.
Let's go - 50.
Let's try that on maybe that'll jog your memory right now.
Like fuck.
I don't want that right now.
What we're doing is we're trying to decrease the action threshold so they walk across the line.
26:50
Make the decision, the next one, let's consider the options.
This is the risk-free close.
I mentioned it earlier.
I just love this because again we're future pacing the scenario, right?
Both these options risk-free, only one of them will get you closer to where you want to go.
So what do we do?
We talking about here?
27:05
They're both risk-free.
If someone still doesn't want to do it, then you have to confront with they're afraid of because at that point it makes no logical sense.
Which means there's an emotional.
Need, I love this one.
Well, you're not going to struggle forever, right?
They're like well no, I'm not going to struggle forever.
You're like right.
27:21
Well if you're going to start getting in shape, eventually might as well do it now, why would you not want to be in shape longer in your life?
But rather only be in shape for like three years or for like 30, I promise you, it's way cooler to do it for longer, right.
You're right and Don't this last one is probably one of the strongest decision frames that I can give you guys.
27:42
All right, emphasizing this on purpose, and this comes with all decisions.
So like if if, if I'm ever allowed it in the future, praised in the future for making good decisions, this is probably the single framework that I use the most, which is not.
27:57
Will this get me what I want, but will this get me closer or further to what I want?
Because the thing is, is Willis.
Get me.
What I want needs a high amount of Of predictive value.
Like to really say, this will get me that really tough and you'll be wrong a lot, and that can be very discouraging.
28:15
But simply saying, okay, I've got two paths.
This will get me closer.
Will this be everything?
I need to get there?
Probably not but we'll get me closer.
Yeah, I think so.
And when it comes to education in my opinion, the more educated you are.
28:31
The closer you'll get to where you're going because you'll have context to see the path more clearly.
And so the problem is a lot.
Of Sandy's, right?
Are sitting there and they're like, well you say it's this and that guy said, Bacon's bad for me.
And this guy says kito's good, and I don't know what the, you know, right, the thing is she doesn't have the perspective from which to make a judgment, it's all Gobbledy gook.
28:51
And the thing is, is that we are all in Sandy.
See in different verticals of Our Lives.
We don't have the perspective from which to make a judgment.
And so trying to say, will the first fitness program that Sandy buys be the one that gets her to the promised land?
Likelihood probably not.
29:07
Some of you guys know many of your trainers, who left?
You have some weird things that they do and they teach people, right?
You're like, if they stand, he starts with her or him.
Is she gonna get the perfect body?
Probably not.
Will she be better than she was before?
She was doing something probably.
29:24
And so, if you can regress, the decision-maker framework to Simply like Sydney.
If you walk out of here, do you think you're gonna get closer getting in shape or further if you stay in sign up?
Do you get closer or further closer?
I think that's all we got to do today.
Day.
And if we do that one step closer enough weeks in a row, I think we'll get to where you want to go.
29:42
It takes the pressure off of making a perfect decision, that makes sense that decreases the action threshold and gets people to actually take a step and be like, Jim was, doesn't have to be perfect.
XY.
DZ doesn't have to be perfect.
It's just, we'll get you closer, that makes sense.
Okay, that single framework has made me more money than anything my life.
30:03
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
And real talk, I've had I bought a lot of things in the past that didn't get me the thing.
But got me a thing that I use later, they got me closer where I wanted to go.
And so the question is, was it a good investment?
Well, only based on my expectations, would it be a bad investment?
30:20
And so if I change my expectations of Education in general, which is what I'm trying to encourage you to do with your prospects in yourselves, then you can shift what you expect to get out of something.
And you alternate get more out of it, future?
Okay, no reasons left, it's just you.
You, it's just your prospect right sitting there bare and naked in the field forced to make a decision, right?
30:42
Then he's looking at herself just like I haven't seen my toes and so long.
The idea is you want to get them to be empowered, right?
And so the thing is, is like, Truth Hurts sometimes, but sometimes the sting is what it takes to get someone to take a first step.
And so, like, my big thing is like, I don't want to be nice.
30:59
I want to be kind and sometimes.
Kindness hurts like maybe need to come back 50 pounds heavier.
Maybe you need to go be poor or maybe you just roll them, or maybe that's what you need.
At the end of the day, it is their decision and they have to have that power.
And here's bonus number six.
31:15
So in my like, blanket closes, this one, I separate it out purposely because I've used it.
A lot of times it's kind of like the best case worst case.
Like I've used it a ton of times which is, whatever reason the prospect is telling themselves, you just repeat it right back to them as the reason they should do it.
31:34
Watch this.
I don't have the time to get in shape.
You're like that's the perfect reason you do this program.
So I'm gonna show you Exactly how to have the time so you can do it.
Give a different one.
I don't have the money.
It's the exact reason you do.
This is you don't have the money because you need to get it right.
31:50
Let's see another one.
Come up with one.
Say some spouse, my husband doesn't support me.
That's the perfect resume should be getting in shape.
You would have us, right?
Want a husband who doesn't support you and then not be in shape.
I don't know, right, my wife doesn't support me.
32:07
It's a perfect reason to do this and so, whatever reason they present with you, literally can just say that's the reason and people think about it a little bit deeper in there like fuck, you're right.
And I think if you, if you like it's because like as a salesperson, you always have to have a couple of fast bullets.
Like, if you're like, I need to catch, like, take a breath, like, whatever they say, you're like, that's the reason you're like, what did I just say?
32:25
You're like, okay, I don't have time to get to the gym.
That's perfect reason to do it right.
I hate broccoli perfect reason to it doesn't matter because whatever the reason here's the thing is is that the whatever reason they give, you is usually the perfect as they should do it, right?
Because it's actually the thing that presenting with is the thing I'm most afraid of.
32:43
And so hopefully this helps you realize that you and your clients are always in complete power.
All right, so rather than casting their power to circumstances where they say it's the time it's the money.
It's the fit you transition to saying, I don't need to have resources, I need to be resourceful.
So instead of casting their time their power to other people, their spouses, their Partners, their kids, their employees.
33:04
Whatever it is.
They then say I'm the one who gets to decide.
I do not need permission.
I'm asking for support and notice.
It didn't say I need support saying I'm asking for it and then finally, when you're talking to the person themselves, they're just trying to avoid the decision because they do not want to make a mistake.
33:23
So, whenever someone says I'm like I want you to translate this in your brains whenever someone says I need to think about it.
Just say I need to avoid this decision in order to avoid a mistake.
That's what they're saying.
Need to avoid this decision in order to avoid making a stick.
All right, so it's not about time, it's about information, and then you need to make sure that they have the information.
33:42
They need to decide.
And at that point, hopefully, you've given the person or the prospect enough power and you've debunked a lot of their bullshit, you've peeled the onion of blame back so that they are the ones in power.
And then at that point they can finally just make a decision and maybe it's the first issue.
33:58
They made in five fucking years and you got to help them do that, which I think is there's there's very few things that are more noble that in my opinion.
And so like I promised the beginning, My Hope Is that you become more powerful by making decision rather than letting it life make it for you being a victim of universe somehow, you think that Randomness is going to make a better decision than you, because you don't want to be responsible for making a bad one.
34:18
Well, how are you going to learn?
If you never take responsibility for decisions you make.
So a few final thoughts.
Fortunes are created by taking lots of risk with a little money.
Ford's are maintained Taking little risk with lots of money of everything that ever made in my life.
The result of investing my own education has gotten me a higher returns in the stock market.
34:35
Real estate or crypto or anything else in all Investments myself for skills beliefs and traits have gotten me closer key Point closer to where I wanted to go.
Even if that brick wasn't the last brick.
That's what I mean.
Here is that if you imagine yourself going to go over here, so imagine I'm here and I want to get over there and there's this big thing of lava underneath of me.
34:55
And I have to build this bridge.
There's 100 bricks between where I am.
To where I want to go.
Just because something that I learned didn't get me all hundred bricks, if it gets me, 28 bricks, I am closer to where I want to go.
And what's interesting is that I've observed this in the education space overall is that people will attribute their success to the thing that gives them the last brick.
35:17
But if you had 99 bricks and then the last one, it's like who or what was the thing that really got you there?
It's like people making fun of their Elementary School teacher who taught them arithmetic when they learn calculus.
They're like dishes to shit.
It's like, dude, you did not a fucking add before, right?
Like did you know how to add kids you calculus, right?
35:35
If you didn't know how to do Fitness and training, you won't be able to have a gym, right?
If you do know how to sell, be tough to Market, if you do not sell, be tough to manage, you got to persuade people, right?
And so each of these things are just a little bricks and then we attribute our success to the last break.
35:51
And this is something again for me, I went to think about what are the biases, I have psychologically that filter the information that I make decisions off of.
And so for Me, I'm telling you this biggest and best frame I have is, will this get me closer or further from where I'm trying to go.
And I think if you can relate that frame to your prospects who were walking in the door, it will help them make a lower Stakes decision.
36:10
It's like, it's going to get me closer.
And if I make enough of these, it will get me closer to Visions.
I'll get to where I want to go.
Because what happens is the perfect decision maker makes none, the directional decision maker makes many and then course corrects much faster, I have five minutes and 40 seconds more you guys Good with that.
36:28
All right, all right, cool.
Okay, so it's why I dedicate my life to education that's acquisition.com.
Our mission is to make real business education available to everyone because we realize that you are Source.
Everyone here say I'm Source, right?
You are Source.
Everything comes from you.
36:44
You read Superman is not coming.
Jim won't see coming.
Alex incoming, nobody's coming.
Just you like you have to save you, right.
Can't ask for a savior it's just you So every decision is a vote towards or against the person we want to become and so the question is, are the decisions you're making voting towards the person you want to become or just more of the same many votes every day.
37:06
And so people ask me all the time how do you move so quickly?
And I think the answer is I know how to buy time.
And so the question is, how do you buy Time by buying the time other people took to make mistakes that taught them the lessons?
Because again I said this I think on the first day which is strategy, prioritizing doing the right thing, I don't do this really fast.
37:24
It's just you get For every step, right?
And so when you buy time, you don't have to spend eight years figuring out the right way to have the lobby set up, right?
When your prospect Watson.
It's like I took me, I'm sure.
Took some, you guys like six years to way through the bullshit of like, intermittent fasting and then it's like, no, it's cardio.
37:45
Oh no, its body weight and kettlebells that's functional.
You're like a fuck.
You know I mean my do some of your life.
That's what I do now that's what I mean.
Point is that you go through your own iteration till finally you feel your figure I'll just say your truth.
I'm going to leave it at that so don't get upset.
All right, it's a finally figure out like the thing, right?
38:02
But wouldn't it be cool if you just started there?
You got to buy everyone else's time.
Like I would say if there's a skill that I've had its by its that is I'm just willing to buy other people's time and not it's an egotistical thing.
I think to say I can figure it out on my own because the answer is, of course, you can.
38:20
The question is, whether you want to spend time with spend money, you spend the money value least.
Right?
You're going to learn the lessons, either way, it's just how you want to pay and sometimes that time might be 30 years steep price tag.
Not when I would want to pay.
38:36
So ignorance is the most expensive debt that we all pay every day.
And this is my favorite, my favorite thing, I heard this was a close that I heard from Shake him a name.
Anyways, he wrote this thing on the board and I'll just do it live.
38:52
Okay, how much you make right now per year?
Income.
Just personally go awesome 185,000.
So imagine I wrote a million dollars on here - 185,000 so right now cost you eight hundred and fifteen thousand dollars a year, not knowing how to make a million dollars a year in income every year just paying the universe.
39:14
You're like, here's eight hundred and fifteen thousand and guess what cost you nine point eight million dollars?
Per year, not knowing how to make ten million dollars a year every year and so like, Think about taxes.
We think about all these other expenses, the one that eats me alive is the debt of not, knowing of all not knowing all the shit that I should know to make what I want to make.
39:36
And that's the debt that really, we all pay the most of every day.
There you go.
And so for me, I think you should be willing to invest money to increase your capacity for income because once you have it, it pays you forever, one-time investment pays you forever.
You don't get taxed on education.
39:53
Government can't steal it from you.
You can't lose it in a divorce.
If you think about it, from an asset perspective, it makes every other asset.
You have more valuable it appreciates with time.
It's one of its.
If you actually thought about as an actual asset your investment it actually checks, all the boxes, the amazing, it increases your asset value increases your income, it's great.
40:13
And so that's one that I like thinking and so for me, 10 years ago, out of my little do-or-die decision.
I went for my swing consulting job to sleeping on the floor and I think a lot of times we have the decisions and I think we need to present these to our prospects.
So like you have to do with our decision, where's your action threshold?
40:29
Maybe need to wait another five years.
Maybe need to get another 50 pounds.
And so here's my two cents, make the decisions, help yourself Implement like crazy.
Take ownership realize that there are no silver bullets but some things can move you closer to your goals.
And when those rare acceleration opportunities come in life.
Take them is either win or you learn.
40:46
And both of those get you closer to ever it is you want to go.
Thank you.








0:00
So you want to make money online, but you don't want to feel icky or sleazy to the people who know and love you when you ask them to give you money.
So there's a good way to do it and there's a bad way to do it.
The good news is I can show you step by step how I got my 1st 20 clients posting on social media for my personal training business a decade ago and have continued to use that in each company going forward.
0:19
How you can build brand and goodwill at the same time.
And this is a sneak preview from my upcoming book $100 Million Leads, which you can check out at acquisition.com/leads.
So there was a friend of mine a while back who had a podcast that blew up like early days.
0:35
Podcasts like it it it skyrocketed it.
And very quickly he had millions of downloads and his business started to grow a lot and it was almost 100% from people who were listening to his podcast.
And so he realized he made an ask during one of his podcast.
He made a lot of money.
And what happened was he learned the wrong lesson.
0:53
He thought when I make an ask, I make more money.
And So what I'll do is I'll just make more asks.
And so he did make more asks, and he then made a little bit more money.
And then he would continue to make less and less and less until eventually his listenership dropped and dropped and dropped.
Until then, it got to the point where he didn't even feel like making them anymore, right, Because it wasn't worth it because he had lost the goodwill of his audience.
1:16
And so the key point I'm going to talk about today is mastering the gift to ask ratio.
Now you obviously have to have an audience, which I talk about at length in $100 leads and other content that I make.
So I'm not going to get into that part.
I'm just going to talk about mastering how much to give versus how much to ask.
1:33
Gary Vee popularized the whole concept, jab, jab, jab right, hook right, which is the idea of giving, giving, giving and then asking right, Not take, but ask.
The good news is that this ratio has been incredibly well studied.
Why?
Because the biggest media companies in the world want to be able to ask on their platforms as much as humanly possible without losing viewership, listenership, audience.
1:58
On television, for every 47 minutes of content, there's 13 minutes of advertising.
All right, so you think about that as it's almost like a three to one ratio between how many ads 3 1/2 to one, between how many ads there are and how much content there is.
If you look on Facebook, Facebook, it's every four posts there's one ad, right?
2:16
So four and then 1/4 and then one.
What I want to do is give you my slight tweak on the give, give, give, ask concept instead of give, give, give, ask.
I'd like to just change it to give until they ask you, you can just consistently give and give and give and then only when someone reaches out to you to say, hey, how can I found out more, how can I work more closely with you, How can you do this?
2:40
Can you help me out?
Etcetera.
Only then do you sell.
And my personal preference here is actually to give in public and sell in private.
Whenever you give, you deposit goodwill into the audience, right?
And it basically precedes reciprocity, because from a persuasion perspective, if you give someone something first, they're far more likely to comply with your request later, right?
3:00
And so the idea is that you force people to get favors from you at scale by providing good stuff that builds goodwill that later when you do make an ask, many people feel obligated, just through social construct to comply.
When someone helps us, we feel indebted to them.
3:17
We want to help them back, right.
That's how society works.
But with media, we can do that at scale.
You can gain goodwill and provide value to millions of people at once, but then it all funnels back to one person and that's why it's so powerful and it's free.
When you do it that way, your brand consistently is reinforced publicly and you continue to grow and expand.
3:36
It will force you to keep that content amazing so that you continue to reinforce your reputation.
Hey, real quick guys, are you a business owner or you want to start a business?
Well, the first thing that any business owner needs is someone to sell their stuff to.
And I spent the last decade getting proficient advertising to the point that right now I have a 36 to one return on advertising.
3:54
Meaning for every dollar I put in, I get $36 back.
And I've spent two years and 2000 hours writing 19 drafts of my next book, $100 million Leads, where I share everything that I've learned for you foe free.
And if that sounds at all interesting, go to acquisition.com/leads to register for the event.
4:12
It's absolutely free.
Everyone's invited.
It's virtual.
I'll see you there.
If you consistently give and give and give, then what happens is your audience compounds.
And this is something that I didn't understand for a long time, was that the audience is the asset, not the content you make.
So when I make a video that it disappears in three days on my newsfeed, what that one piece of content is, is it got me 300 more people to start seeing my stuff and then they permanently enter the audience, provided I don't ask too much too frequently.
4:39
In the beginning it'll be really small.
And if you can hold off and you keep giving, you keep giving, you keep giving.
You eventually never even have to ask publicly because instead of asking you to start getting transparently.
This is something that I've now personally experienced and I was like, I don't know, but you know what?
I'll give it a shot.
Let's just see if I can make a bunch of business content and see if that will attract 1,000,000 five million, $10 million profit per year businesses, not revenue profit, so that I can invest them and help them grow.
5:04
And it turns out it did.
Now there's two ways that asks work in content.
And So what you think of your asks as commercials.
You're interrupting your own content with a commercial about your stuff.
An integrated approach would be like during the content.
Like, hey, if you want to learn more about this stuff, got $100 million leads and you can go check it out.
5:21
It's as cheap as I can put it on Amazon with them.
Still considering in a book, which I think is 199 because it's so much thicker than my first book they wouldn't let me put it at $0.99.
There's too many images inside of it, so that would be an example of an integration.
It's natural.
It comes up as you're talking and then you can point to it and you get back to what you're saying.
5:37
Integrations work better for long form content.
Pdf's, books, videos, podcasts, blog posts, those are all things that lend themselves to integrating in very small percentages of the total amount of time it takes someone to consume something.
For example, if I made an integration and I started with a minute about something valuable and then I spend 5 minutes in the middle talking about my thing and I spend 2 minutes on the end, you still need to keep the ratio of minimum 3:00 to 1:00 because remember televisions 13 minutes to 47, right for a 60 minute slot in terms of commercials.
6:06
So that's the Max.
And so for me I would rather be at like 98% give 2% ask.
The other way is intermittent, which means in between things.
Intermittent is typically better for short form platforms.
If you have 10 Instagram posts or 10 TikTok reels on the 11th one, you make one that's a little bit more about your credit repair services that you offer or your national lawn care franchise that you have franchise opportunities for people to buy into, right?
6:34
Whatever it is.
And then you go right back to the preprogrammed show.
It's even harder because if you're doing multiple posts a day, I wouldn't do more than 3%.
So once or twice a month one post that feels reasonable and you're not going to lose audience.
6:49
And so fundamentally the actual cost of the commercial is not money but goodwill.
How much of my audience am I losing by making this ask?
I though to be clear, I always want to under ask my audience personally.
So if you're new to making content now, hopefully you've been using social media.
7:05
If you haven't been using social media then what I say what I'm about to say doesn't apply.
But if you've been using it like a person, so like you post on Instagram, like when you go out with the boys or whatever, like you use it like a user might use it, right?
Believe it or not, you've actually been providing value to certain people for an extended period of time.
7:20
And so you actually do have a decent amount of goodwill.
And I wouldn't normally say this, but I think there's some element that I can appreciate of if you took an action and you could immediately reinforced for taking it, then you'll believe that this could actually work for you if you make your first post.
But I would just call like a declaration of business, which is just saying like, hey, you know, you guys have maybe been following me for a while.
7:40
You might know me, you might not.
From personal, from college, from work, from out of the bars.
This is what I'm doing with my life now.
And I would love to give you guys something for free that would benefit you.
And if that sounds cool, awesome.
If not, keep following me posting more about this stuff.
Very quick, very simple.
And I was actually able to find my first public decoration of business.
7:56
This is April night.
I'm actually coming up on 10 years.
I took my decade in business.
How about that shit.
For those of you who know me, you know, two things.
One, I am terrible with all things technological still true.
For example, I just heard about Spotify a few weeks ago.
Seriously.
Two, I love training slash nutrition and fitness more than, well, a whole lot.
8:13
So today is sort of special because it marks the day when my love of training vanquished.
See me trying to use fancy words Vanquish my fear of technology.
What do I mean?
For the better part of the year I've been taking part in a free personal training project that I would give away.
Free personal training to anyone who's willing to give 500 to $1000 to A cause of their choice.
8:29
Give value for an extended period of time for a small group of people to prove that you know what you're doing so you can get testimonials.
By the way, this way they wouldn't have to be motivated by the same thing as me, but be motivated to give to their cause and benefit themselves.
When I first introduced the idea, I was happily surprised that not a positive support I received.
So, almost a year from my first client, I now have a website to formally show some of the transformation that I've gone underway using my programming, and it's a formal means of contacting me about signing up.
8:54
I currently have a few slots open on my roster, so drop me a quick note if you're interested.
Thanks so much.
Take a second to check out some of these ridiculous transformations in record time.
Would I make this post again today?
Probably not, But I I'm proud of the kid who did it because I had.
I'd given value for free to people, free because they didn't pay me.
9:12
I had them pay someone else because I wanted them to value it.
But making that first declaration of business post was actually how I got my 1st 20 paying customers.
I got 20 people who messaged me because I to be fair, I'd always been in shape and people had known me my whole life as a guy who was always obsessed with fitness.
So it made sense that I would make that my next natural thing.
9:29
And so you provided value to people for a long period of time.
You can make your first post a light ask, which is just declaration and asking for support, and then you can start the business now If you have no content up to that point, show them what you've been up to and then you can make your ask.
I would encourage you to make that first post because I think it'll show you it's possible and I think if I can get you that first win, you'll be far more likely to continue.
9:49
And if you're wondering, well, at what point do I fully right hook my audience and just drain it of goodwill?
Real talk part of the game is, quote, leaving money on the table.
So let me give you an example.
Friend of a friend had a tequila business that was pretty big.
Big enough that the Rock approached him.
10:05
Dwayne Johnson and The Rock said, I would like twothirds of your business.
And mind you, when you did that, that might have been a big ask.
I don't know.
They said no.
Now Fast forward years later, The Rock started his own tequila brand, which is now worth 6 billion.
10:21
So they probably would have made out really well with that.
But here's the thing.
If The Rock had done that deal at that time, he might have actually lost out on what he ultimately made with Terramana.
And so that means if someone says, hey, Alex, can you endorse my thing?
If I say yesterday, it's probably going to be a bad deal for me because in two years my audience will be significantly larger and so will yours.
10:43
When you're thinking about these right hooks, there's a huge time component.
And The thing is, is that compounding gets crazy near the end every time you decide to make the right hook.
If you hold it, it could be 10 or 100 times bigger, 12 months, 24 months later.
Could you imagine if two years ago, when I started making content and I just started getting early engagement, my YouTube videos and Instagram and people started damning me?
11:03
They're like, hey, can you mention me?
Which I don't do.
If I'd said sure, I'm going to do it, I would have stopped my growth curve and I would have just been just another dude.
But by holding back.
And it takes a lot of selfdiscipline, selfcontrol, and patience.
Which, by the way, if you want the definition For me, operationalizing patience is just figuring out what you do in the meantime.
11:22
You don't actually wait, you just figure out what you do In the meantime, because I am in the game of making money, my goal is to always have significantly less supply than I have demand.
And I always want to keep that demand because that is the Holy Grail of what you want, which is far more people who want to do business with you then you have capacity to do so.
11:39
The strongest driver of pricing power and profits is supply and demand.
When we make content, what we're actually doing is artificially shifting the demand curve in our favor.
And the other side of this is that if you are the business owner, you control supply.
And so you can inflate your demand in terms of the amount of people who want to work with you or buy from you and at the same time cut your supply.
12:01
And when you have that happen, price goes through the roof and so do your profits.
And so for me, I'm all about growing as fast as possible again, which means you got to give as much as you possibly can.
Just keep giving and people will start coming to you.
You'll start not even having to ask, you'll just start getting.
And if you're going to ask because you need to put food on the table, which I understand, then make sure For me, I would be way more than the three to one ratio, more like 10 times that would be like a 30 to one ratio of giving to asking.
12:25
So I keep maximizing my growth and keep my brand compounding while still making a little bit of money for me because I know that long term, the more I hold back my ask, the bigger it will be.
If you just liked that episode, then you are going to love the free virtual event that I have for my next book, $100 million Leads.
12:42
And before you click away, listen to what I'm about to say.
Fast forward three months from now.
Your friend is using something that you didn't have access to and their business is growing.
Another person posted about how grateful they are that they went to the event because they're using these skills that they learned from the free thing that I'm going to give to only people who are their life and give you some context.
13:02
We have the tech now that we are going to scrape every single person who is at the event and they will be the only ones who gain access to a project that I've been working on for four years.
Which means that every person who is not on the link live is not going to get it.
13:18
And I'm doing that because I know I'm going to piss off 99% of people who are not there.
And it's because the next time I say I'm going to give away something, it's going to be awesome.
You're going to want to be there.
I want people to believe me.
And if you haven't taken action on it yet, go to acquisition.com/leads.
13:35
I'll see you there.








0:00
This video is for every 17 year old, 16 year old, 18 year old, 19 year old who's considering going to college or quitting college right now.
Should I spend the next four years going to college?
Hopefully I can equip the parents and the kids to make call with his little societal pressure as possible.
When I lived in Austin, my next door neighbor was 18 years old.
0:17
He was at this important decision his life where he was deciding whether he was going to go to college and I knew his parents and it's kind of interesting because I sit halfway between his parents and him so I kind of have both sides.
He decided to enroll at Pepperdine after a semester He.
Didn't really like it.
And I think a lot of it was because it was just kind of expected that he go to college there.
0:34
I had developed a rapport with him and you know, he used to work out with me at my home gym after school and whatnot.
And so I was like, hey man, let's go for a walk.
And I think we walked for about an hour and we just walked around the neighborhood.
And I'm pretty sure that that conversation significantly shifted the trajectory of his life.
There we go.
0:54
All right.
The reason most people to go to college is because that is what's expected.
They don't think about the decision.
They just do it because it feels like the next natural path.
It's the same thing for having kids and getting married and buying a house.
But let's not get into that.
He went from going to Pepperdine, dropping out his friends, his family, his friends, parents started looking at him different.
1:09
He was like the troubled child.
He's like the, I don't know about him.
Two years later, he now has $250,000 saved up.
As a 20 year old makes $200,000 a year right now, as a sales guy, what I want to do is break down the split in the road of two different lives that he could have lived or that you could live or that somebody that you know who's facing the decision could go through.
1:30
And I'll tell you how the conversation I had with him went, what's up, man?
So I said, listen, you're at a crossroads right now.
We have crossroads every day in our lives.
I was like, but some crossroads are bigger than others.
And when you're trying to make a decision, you have to think how reversible is this decision and how much longterm impact is death.
If I'm choosing between Chinese and Mexican for lunch, it's a split in the road and it's really not going to affect much for me down the road.
1:50
Choosing to go and commit four years of my life between 50 and $200,000 of money and the lost income that I would have made during that period of time, Those are very big irreversible decisions and they need to be treated with the same amount of respect.
And a lot of people don't because they make that decision because their parents are telling them to, which seems like the overused one, but realistically because they don't want to be the kid.
2:11
Did it wrong.
Who didn't do what they were supposed to do and didn't do the next natural step.
That's a terrible reason to go to college.
I would like you to approach it with a decision making framework that makes sense.
So it starts with and this is me telling him this, I was like what problem are you solving?
He's like, well, I want to make money.
So the question is, 4 years from now, if you have a degree and you've lost the money and you lost the earning potential you had during those four years, is that you more able to generate income than alternative you?
2:33
Because what we have to analyze is not the cost of college but the opportunity cost of going to college.
The opportunity cost is the loss of potential gain from other.
There are alternatives when one alternative is chosen.
So when we choose to go to college, there's an opportunity cost that exists and it is the single greatest cost that people do not take into consideration.
2:49
It's the cost of not doing of what you could have done in the meantime.
One is it's going to cost you money because you actually got to spend money to do it.
The 2nd way it cost you money is that you're not going to earn what you probably could earn full time working if that's what you wanted to do.
You got two sides there.
If you spent four years versus starting a business and then four years later the opportunity cost is the business you could have started and what you would have four years later.
3:08
So I'm walking with him and this is like a one hour really.
In depth, like, this is probably deeper than he and I have been, cuz I'm still this neighbor from across the street that makes money on the Internet, right?
But his parents trusted me enough to be like, I know that you have a lot of influence over our son, and we just want you to know that we know you do.
And so, like, please be careful.
3:24
And I was like, I'm aware he's in good hands.
Don't be afraid for what I'm going to tell your son.
I was like, listen man, if you want to make money, then you need income generating skills.
Do you think your philosophy degree, your sociology degree, your psychology degree, your economics degree, even, which is still a little more useful, is going to give you actual skills to make money?
3:41
He was like, I don't know and so I'm here to tell you what actually makes money.
There's this lie that has been sold that you need to learn general education.
I can tell you ancient Chinese literature has never impacted my ability to make money.
Aztec culture.
Don't know anything about it, but it's classes.
3:58
And they somehow fool kids into thinking that if they take this class, they're now somehow going to be more equipped to add value to the marketplace.
If Alex were redoing the education system, the majors would be in accordance to the departments of a business.
You'd have marketing, and it would have the actual ways to market, which is creating the materials of marketing and how to distribute it.
4:16
You'd have sales, how to get strangers to give you money, Delivery portion, which would be either physical products delivery or services delivery, which would be customer experience, customer success, or it'd be technical electrician plumber, Lawnmow.
Or whatever it is.
So then you have the actual technical component of the services delivered.
And then you have the supporting services which do like finance, HR, legal.
4:34
Those would be the things that people should major in because those are the things that you're gonna get hired to do.
Google stopped requiring college degree.
Big tech corporations have stopped it because they realized it too, that it's not value additive.
If I'm a doctor or a lawyer, you need a degree, sure.
But for the 99% of people who don't fall in the six fucking careers that you have to have one.
4:49
People like Alex, You went to Vanderbilt.
I graduated a year early, so I try to get out as fast as possibly could.
One of the regrets that I have is that I could have started sooner.
And the reason why I didn't drop out of college is because I was too, too shit scared to disappoint my father.
If you're going to do it eventually, you might as well do it now.
When I see the guys who were starting at 18, I'm like, man, I wish I'd started then rather than 23.
5:08
I would have five more years zooming back out.
I'm walking in the street, we're talking together.
And I told him this line.
I said the world doesn't need another 3-1 business degree from Pepperdine.
Another B student who graduates cuz he didn't really give a shit, right?
He would just do good enough that he would get through and this is what he brought up.
5:24
He's like, but what about like the social experience of college?
I was like, so do you think that if you don't go to college you're not gonna be able to party with people who are your age?
I was like real talk and he was like.
All like, kind of If the problem to be solved is to socialize you, there are way more efficient ways to socialize you than spending $200,000 and not making income.
5:43
You can work all day and then make my objective for this period of time to have fun, then fucking work all day and then literally go out every single night and you'll end up debt free with savings and have a hell of a crazy four stories.
And that's fine if that's what you want to do.
I was like, is that what you want to do?
He's like, no.
5:59
And I think at some point in the conversations, like, I kind of want to do what you do.
And I was like, well, then you got to learn the skills that I had to start fucking five years older than you to Start learning, right.
And the first thing we see to learn how to sell, let's just go down that path.
If you're watching this, you're like, well, I don't like sales.
I told you all the other departments that you could focus on for like, you know what?
I like being behind a camera.
6:14
Then cool.
What do you think behind a camera means in a business?
Behind a camera means you're making content.
You're making commercials.
Pick one.
That's what video is used for, right?
If you're like, I like writing words, what do you think writing words are used for in business?
They're used to sell shit or deliver shit.
That's it.
Or legal to.
Tech people from selling and delivering shit.
6:30
I like dealing with people.
It's like, well, it depends.
Are you a little bit more aggressive?
You might like sales.
If you're a little bit more passive ish.
And I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
You might like more of like the HR or you might like recruiting.
You might like selling people rather than selling products.
Different ways of thinking about it.
And so you can take your skills and then bucket them into which of these departments make more sense.
6:47
And then that's what I'm going to focus on zooming back out.
So I said, now we need to look at your three, one degree $200,000 of debt four years later versus 4 years from now.
You're going to have saved money this whole period of time.
He's living with four guys cuz I was like, dude, you're living cheap.
That's how this works.
So he saves a lot of money, which is why he has $250,000 saved up at 20.
7:06
That's not from Alex doing anything.
Like he worked for it, he worked for it and he saved every dollar that he made.
And what do you think he's gonna be able to do in four years?
You people start his own thing with a ton of capital and skills.
As we're walking through these four years, what do we think happens now?
He's like, I really like sales now.
He happened to have liked sales.
7:21
The blessing that he got was he had a mentor, which obviously it was me.
I could see his personality.
I was like, dude, I think you do well here.
And he did like he did well.
But if he was that.
Camera guy, he really liked more of that stuff.
Or if he was really techie, I would have been like, dude, go start coding.
And so all of like, you have this bass skill and it's like, where do I want to apply it?
7:36
If you're like, I don't know, they're never gonna know because how would you know?
You know, by starting and then you'll gain context to make the decision later.
All you know is the experiences you have.
And so all you have to do is just always look around every so often.
Be like, have I learned everything that I'm going to learn from this branch?
And if you've learned everything you're going to learn, then at that point you can make the pivot, right?
7:53
But if you're like, dude, there's still a lot for me to learn.
Do I want to learn that?
Is it the direction I want to keep going?
I remember when I did my first years of consulting, I looked down the road 25 years and I was like, I don't want that life.
This is a hack that I will give you for very big decisions is that you want to keep thinking on it, keep chewing on it, keep digesting it until you can get into a single state.
8:09
Which is for him, four years from now.
Given the cost, which of these two paths will give me the most potential for my future?
And he was like, well, I think the other one.
And I was like, then what are you going to do?
So he decided to drop out and the end of going to sales.
And he was terrified.
In the beginning, he sucked at sales because he had never done it before.
8:26
Of course he would suck.
And of course you will suck too, because you haven't done it.
But how do you think you get good?
You start by sucking and then you suck less.
That's how it works.
Until eventually you look back after hundreds and hundreds and thousands of repetitions and you're like, oh, I'm actually pretty good at this.
And it's reasonable that you be good because you've done it 1000 fucking times.
He likes sales.
8:41
It's probably going to be the direction that he takes directionally in his life.
He's like, what do I need to learn now?
So it's like, OK, how do you move up?
It's like I can start a business.
I was like, yeah, I was like, what are you, what skills you need to start a business?
I got to know how to market.
I was like, well, you already learned how to cold calls.
Like, that's your first acquisition channels.
We got that handle, which is why I put him there.
8:56
It's like, OK, so I have that so I can get customers, all right.
And I know how to sell.
I got that.
I was like, what are you going to deliver?
He's like, well, I really do like teaching sales.
I was like, well, who the fuck have you taught sales to?
He's like, I guess I haven't.
And I was like, sounds like a skill you need to have.
He's got to learn the skill of how to transfer a skill from himself to somebody else.
What are the other skills he's going to have to learn?
9:12
Well, he's going to have to learn how to do finances.
He's going to have to get contracts set up so you can have services, agreements, things like that.
But again, these are all Googleable things that you can do.
You can figure those things out, you know, a couple days.
It's not a big deal for the parents who are watching and the kids who are watching this at home or trying to make the decision is do I think that four years from now with 50 to $200,000 and.
9:29
Absolutely.
Cost and probably higher than that, an opportunity.
Cost of the cost of the path not taken, which of these two paths will lead me closer to where I want to go?
And if the goal is to to make income, then you have to look at that $200,000 and all the things you could buy with that $200,000 and four years of time and think, is there another way that I could reverse engineer four years to get me to where I want to go?
9:49
Or if you just really like the technical expertise that you have, you go super deep on the technical expertise and then you bolt on one additional scale.
This is the one scale I will give you that you need to bolt on to instantly give yourself the lift and whatever.
Yeah, you got to learn how to deal with people, got to learn how to manage, got to learn how to lead.
You're like, that sounds like the soft, tough, And it is, but it's also how you're going to get promoted.
10:07
It's how you get respect.
It's how you gain influence.
And you also realize that the technical thing that you're really good at is probably not the thing you're going to be doing in the business.
You just got to know it well enough to teach it to somebody else.
His parents came to me after, like, I talked to him and they're like, Alex, can you please just tell me again on why he should be your, like, telling him to to quit college?
I was like, I'm not telling him to quit college.
10:23
I'm telling him to make the best decision for where he wants to be in four years.
I'm not telling him not to get educated.
I'm telling him to get super educated in the thing that he wants to do.
The best people in the world at anything learn for themselves.
They're self-taught.
If you can adopt that mentality, then the world is your oyster because you realize that you can learn whatever you want, whatever you want.
10:39
You don't need a certification or permission to do that.
Which of these paths 4 years from now, given the opportunity cost, is going to get me furthest towards Michael?
Here we go.
All right, what's up man?
So I was responding to the comments they had that they didn't think that you were real.
10:57
So this is, this is to my my YouTube audience to know that Jacob is indeed a real person.
Can you confirm that you lived as my neighbor next to my house and that we did work out every day after school?
And then how are you now?
11:15
I am. 20.
Still can't drink yet?
Tough life.
So you're in sales now, right?
What are you making right now?
I'll.
Probably hit 250. 113 The first six months of this already on track I've already had.
That nice to be king.
11:32
And then how much money you have saved up to 10210.
OK, so over I thought.
I thought it was 250.
I got the 250 mixed up, so it's 210.
What would you say has been the like the biggest mental mind shift, change, etc from our talks and our chats?
That's.
A good question.
11:52
Well, you decided not to go to college, right?
Is that the walk that did it?
That that's the walk that that closed it.
You closed me very hard.
On that walk I did, I did go really aggressive on that walk to be fair.
So you would now at that point been in school for a semester.
What was the reason you decided to to take that jump?
12:09
I think the the, the line that really hit when you said, and I'm paraphrasing it, it's so acceptable to fail at entrepreneurship because you're still in school and you're using it as a crutch.
I think that.
That's like up.
That's it.
So I knew I need to go.
12:25
Yeah, so you were cuz you were dabbling on the side and you weren't succeeding at the octber thing, which is what you really wanted to do.
And you were using college as a social safety net to give yourself an excuse for why you weren't winning.
Exactly.
And so then you decided to go all in on it.
And we went all in.
12:41
We did.
It all right.
Say hi to Mosey.
You're in the closet.
Say hi to Mosey Nation.
So that is to confirm that Jacob was indeed a real person with a real pulse and a real story.
And if it works for him, it can work for you.
12:57
Thanks.
I appreciate you go back to sales calls.
Jacob was lucky as hell that he just happened to have been my neighbor.
That's right, Jake.
I could just tell that he was incredibly hungry.
I knew that he had this really deep desire to prove himself.
13:12
When I see something like that, I'm like, cool, like, and the way I tested that, I was like.
Shop after school.
Every day we'll work out, and I wanted to see if you would show up and like clockwork, no matter what, every day he would text me wasn't like me having to text him or remind him.
I knew that he had that desire and he would take as much as I was willing to give.
13:29
If this video caused you to question a couple things or maybe even brought up more questions than it did answers because it opened up your mind to some things, what I'd recommend doing is watching this video, my video about how to analyze opportunities.
And so if you're looking at okay, maybe I don't do college, but what path do I go on that will give you the framework to make the decision on how you analyze opportunity in your life.
13:47
Business that you might potentially start, et cetera?








0:00
Real quick, guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can.
0:16
Rate and review and share this podcast So the single.
Thing that I has.
To do is you.
Can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me.
And more importantly.
It may change the world of someone else.
A lot of people are like the goat and they wouldn't be the greatest of all time.
And I think that if you're the greatest of all time, then you failed, because especially if you want to be a teacher of some kind, which is a relatively loaded word.
0:36
But if you want to pass on lessons to other people, if you were the greatest of all time, then you failed.
So the only way to be the greatest of all time is to not be.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:53
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Now you're creating content.
How do you want people to consume your content so they can actually just go and do things with it versus just feeling like they're consuming 15 Alex from Ozzy videos and and like they feel like they can check it off their list, but they really haven't progressed at all.
1:13
Use and do like watch do, watch, do.
I think our videos are more tactical than many of the videos that are out there, and that's by design.
And so my vision for the content was I want to make stuff that people would otherwise charge lots of money for.
And then just give it away for free.
And at least from the response in the comments, the community like that seems to be how it's received more or less.
1:32
And so that was the goal.
But the absolute by and large what I want everybody in Mosa Nation to do is consume, execute and keep executing until you realize you hit another point where you need to consume more and consume the next thing and then you can.
Search for specifics.
So it's like if churn's high, go to my channel and search churn stuff and then just try and watch the videos that are around churn.
1:51
If you're like I need sales stuff cuz I'm just getting on the phone with people and I can't close watch the sales stuff and keep like there's a concept of like drilling, like you can watch like there's like immersing yourself in something.
So it's like for like sales guys, I want them to consume an hour day of sales content because I want their subconscious, I want their discretionary time to be thinking about sales.
2:11
But still the majority of their day is selling, which is that a system will grow until it is constrained and then it will grow no longer until that constraint is fixed.
And so we just like and when we look at the portfolio companies usually like our expertise comes down to can we identify accurately with the true constraint of the businesses and can we fix it.
2:29
If we can do those two things, and those are, those are properties that we want to take on immediately because we know what the first constraint is and then we can anticipate what the next one's going to be and then we know we can fix that too.
And so a lot of times, entrepreneurs get stuck or even employees get stuck because they don't realize the constraint of their system output is a skilled deficiency, a trait deficiency or belief deficiency.
2:47
They don't believe something's possible that is.
Or rather, said differently, they believe something to be true that isn't, and that's what's holding them back.
I want to take a little step.
Back So my friend, you were on his podcast three years ago.
And it was so funny to me when I listened to the intro, because in the intro it was like Alex Hermosi does not believe in social media.
3:08
He does not have any social media.
So what?
What changed?
Kylie Jenner Kylie Jenner changed my life.
I saw the cover of Forbes and I was like, she's younger than I am and she's a billionaire and I feel like I know more about business and I need to learn from that.
3:24
And so I will study everyone, the good, the bad, the ugly people that everyone hates.
I will study people that everyone love.
I'll study anyone who's making more money than me.
I'll study.
And so when I saw that it was such a, it was such a paradigm shift for me, I was like how is this possible?
3:39
And I mean mind you, like at the time for context, I was, I was, I was taking home, I think, do you know what you're I've been taking between 13 and 17 million a year personally at that time and I thought I was doing pretty well.
And then I saw that and I just felt horrible about myself.
3:55
It like ruined like a week of my life.
But what came from that was then all of a sudden I like to be honest with you, I didn't change anything after that.
I was like, it's a fluke.
Her mom's Kris Jenner, she organized her whole life, OK.
But then after that, the beauty came out and then boom, she was at 600.
And then after that, Conor McGregor boom, he was at 600 with proper 12.
4:11
And then the rock came out with hermano was at 2 to 4 billion depending on who you're looking at.
And it just happened again and again and again.
And I was like, I'm missing something like my, I believe something that was true that wasn't.
I believe that the only thing that you would need to grow a business was paid ads and outbound.
4:26
If you do those things, it doesn't matter about anything else, Doesn't matter.
Your brand doesn't matter about your content.
You can go and sell shit and you can.
That's the thing.
It's like there are beliefs that will get you to a certain degree and you absolutely can make money.
You can be a deck of.
I mean, I was obviously a deck of millionaire at that point, arguably almost a centa million if you put the equities in, right?
4:43
But for me to be a billionaire, I didn't understand brand and it was my big deficiency.
And when I saw each of those I was like.
Oh, I have to get into this.
But I still didn't do it.
The last, you know, soldier on this little thing was I went to a thing with Dean Gracias.
5:01
Who's Tony Robbins?
Like, right hand man.
All right, they're together.
It doesn't matter.
And we went to his house and he had had like 3 people that week who like weird stalker, you know, weird stuff.
And I was like, dude, how are you willing to put up with this?
Like, I just, I never want to be that famous.
5:17
I want no one to know me want to be rich as hell.
And that's it.
And I was very committed to that.
He said if that's the price I have to pay to make the impact I want to have, I'll do it every day of the week.
And he just looked at me and I just like, I just remember just feeling it in my chest.
I have to do this.
And so that was when I decided and I started making YouTube videos shortly thereafter and that that was kind of the beginning of me starting to post stuff with the intention of actually building bread.
5:41
And what was the what did you have to assemble or get ready in order to do that?
Did you hire a social media team or?
Yeah I didn't.
Well, I had I had infrastructure with Jim launched so I just had the video guy post it at the time.
So I just did that because I was that was easy those low lift for me.
But I've definitely learned a lot about the content game in general and what's funny is that the principles that I learned from outbound and paid ads 100% map to content and I still had to learn it as though I didn't know and so like.
6:05
Volume is still king.
Like the more you spend on ads, the more money you make.
The more cold calls, the more cold emails, the more cold reach outs you do, the more sales you make the more content you put out the more impressions you get the more like everything grows that way And so because like quantity is the only forcing metric for quality, like the only way you get better at something is by doing it more.
6:22
And so I had to do a shit load of it and that's that's basically what we've built over the last 18 months as I started just posting three times a week just videos from a computer which.
I've been relatively, you know, notorious for being terrible quality, you know?
And then slowly, you know, I added an editor and then I was like, OK, well, maybe I should do.
6:40
A guy approached me.
He was like, I could do shorts for you.
And I said, OK, I don't want to do shorts.
And he said, I will take, you have to do nothing.
I will just take all of the stuff that's already out there and I will do all the work and I will post it for you.
So you literally do nothing.
I was like, OK, sold.
6:56
And he did it and he did a good job.
And so we started growing.
And I was like, oh, the short stuff's interesting, okay.
So, like, this is starting to work.
And so once I saw that, that actually became kind of the blueprint for how we approach new platforms, etcetera.
So we go, we find the person, the best person we can, we pay whatever it is that they asked for.
7:14
And we do that with the activation.
We say it upfront.
We say, I'm going to steal everything you have.
That's what I'm going to try and do.
So I just want to be upfront and I think it's going to take us probably between three and six months to do that.
So you factor in what your LTV is for it to make sense for you and if they're cool with it, then we're good.
7:30
And our entire goal is not to just have them do it, but for us to study every aspect of what they're doing and why they're doing it so that we can bring it in house.
And so we've pretty much I went as soon as things started that one vendor worked out.
I basically did that with every platform very quickly and then one by one we started peeling them.
7:47
Back in house.
And so right now we're probably 2/3 in house, 1/3 vendor, and probably by you know, 6-6 months will be 100% in those.
And I think now I I saw him think media that you've hit 1,000,000 followers in six months.
Yeah, yeah, we've.
Yeah.
And we've done even.
8:03
Yeah, even more.
Yeah, it's cool because media is compounding.
And so I always look for compounding vehicles in general.
And so it was again like like dodo bird, Alex, like it took me a while to figure out that media in and of itself.
Grows in a compounding way.
And I was like, oh wow.
So this is not something that, like, I always saw a content where you post something and then it disappears.
8:22
The waste I like when I was coming into it, I was like, why would I post something and then no one's ever gonna see it again.
But what I didn't realize was the asset was the audience, not the content.
And that was my that was my missing link.
And so once I understood that, that's when I went all in on building the brand and doing the media stuff.
So you don't want the fame from the social media?
8:39
What do you want?
I'm OK with the fame now.
There are cons to it, but I would say there are more pros than cons, at least at the level that I'm at right now.
So I'm okay with it.
I am still here to make money and I always want to be clear because I don't want to be put into a corner in the future where people are like he's trying to make.
8:56
I'm always here to make money.
That's that's what I'm trying to do.
But I also because from the brand and the vision, stuff that I've, you know, learned as an entrepreneur, like telling employees like, hey, our whole goal is to make money.
Not very motivating, right?
And so the big reason that we do all the stuff we do, so we donated a few $1,000,000 to get charities for education because I'm a big education guy.
9:15
And so the big vision is like to document and share the best practice of building world class companies.
And so for me to have the credibility to to be able to say that that is my mission.
I got to be able to back that up.
And so the portfolio that becomes worth a billion and then 10 billion and then whatever it'll become after that is is.
9:34
Just to answer the question, why should I listen to you?
Because it's at least my my view that the number one question that everyone asks when they see anything, even if it's good, is why should I listen to this person?
Because you have the, you know, the teacher who's saying dollar cost average in the S&P and they've got Warren Buffett.
They're going to listen to Warren Buffett even if the content's worse just because they don't have to make the extra decision of should I trust this.
9:53
And so it's actually less emotional effort to because you actually don't have to put a decision filter.
You can just take it as truth, which is it's easier for people.
And so I want to make it easy for people to learn and so I have to have the credibility to do that now.
Some people might say you had a $50 million when you're 32.
You'd already taken, you know, almost 50 million in dividends before that point.
10:10
Like, you have the credibility.
But like, I don't have the credibility for me because I want.
Like, the fact that we don't have a vlog from Jeff Bezos from 1997 until now crushes my soul.
The fact that Elon only does the occasional weird interview, which is awesome, but like nothing else, I longterm am willing to sacrifice growth for our companies.
10:34
To make the content that we're making because I think it means more than I do.
So a few years ago when you were saying that no social media, you were at 17 million or so for personal income, can you talk about how that's grown over the years?
So it hasn't grown because COVID was not good for gyms.
10:49
Unfortunately you would have thought that gyms would have been totally benefited from COVID and not being allowed to do business.
But I think in 2018 we did 26 million top line, 17 million take home.
And I also didn't understand the concept of like reinvesting in business or M and A at that point.
So I was just like cool.
So 17 million in profit, I'll leave a million in the business and then I will just scoop 16 million in my bank account, that's what I did.
11:10
And then the next year we, we reinvested more money into supplements and software and so we still grew though we would 37 million top line and then we did I think 13 million is what I took out that year.
And then 20/20 was COVID which was you know three months in and we actually had planned to sell, we went to market the month before COVID started.
11:29
And so that sucked because it was based on 17 and you know 13 is the is the and with a growth rate going into it.
But anyways over the next that year I think we ended up taking home personally like 9:00 or 10:00 somewhere in there.
And then the next year we probably would have paced the same thing because the way COVID hit gyms at least for us was like it was a :) and with January being the middle of the smiley.
11:52
So it's like kind of like half Fox 2 years.
But because we were on upper trajectory coming out of like January and they loosened some of the COVID stuff, we just pretty much started going straight up to the right.
And so we closed that deal in December of 21 and that was 46 plus whatever we took on that year, which is probably around 10:00.
12:12
And then yeah, and then now it's 2022.
And so we went super aggressive in acquisitions because that year, in 2021 the reason I actually decided to go through the sale actually almost backed out of the sale twice was because.
I had done 3 deals that year, that year, and all three were going really well.
12:29
And so I realized I was like, I really like this a lot.
And for me, my big thing is it's almost like if you wake up in the morning and you're not thinking about your wife and you think about somebody else, like you need to fix that one way or the other, you got to fix that problem and so.
Like I was thinking about my wife being gym lunch anymore.
12:44
I was thinking about these companies.
I was thinking about growing them.
And like, I was starting to get excited about all that stuff and it just wasn't as exciting for me.
And I just saw a bigger vision for what I wanted to do.
And so we did those 3 acquisitions and then over the last nine months, we've done another 8.
13:00
So we have 11 now and so we do minority stakes.
And so the portfolio right now does it just under 200,000,000 top line.
We generally are between 20 and 30% owners of those companies and they are usually bootstrapped, profitable, growing cash flow positive because we run most.
13:17
They're usually, yeah, they're very, they're profitable businesses.
So I'd say around between 35 and 40% net margins on those businesses.
And so that's what we do now.
Hey, guys, real quick, if you're new to the.
Podcast I have a.
Book on Amazon called $100 million offers at over 8005 star reviews, it has almost a perfect sport.
13:38
You can get it for 90.
Nine cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1000 hours into writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more.
Dollars, so that later.
On in your business career, I can catch the partner with you, so that's my give.
13:54
Go check it out.
Amazon and.
Back to the show.
Is the hope that the social media will help you attract more companies that may want to take on more investment?
Yeah, 100%.
I just figure Warren Buffett had a great model.
Let's do the same thing except add media like it's like I'm a big believer in like simple things.
14:12
So we have, we have a strategy deck that's like what are the need to believes for this to to be true.
So one is that Alex can gain a social media following.
I didn't know that.
So like it sounds silly, but like I had a big list of like, well if it doesn't work then that's going to, you know, that's going to affect my thesis, right.
14:28
So.
That was #1 #2 was that me making content will turn into deal flow for us and so I didn't know if that was going to be true.
I didn't know if I was just going to make content and people just like cool Thanks so much this is awesome.
But it did translate into deal flow.
And then from there the next need to believe was that I would be more popular in the future than I am today.
14:44
And so if that's true then we will get an increasing amount of deal flow in both quality and quantity in the future than we do now.
The 4th need to believe was that we would be able to add material or outside returns or value through our own experience by.
Taking on companies that fit Art, we call it the VAM, but it's like our value acceleration method.
15:01
So it's like if it's in the sweet spot of the VAM, then we should be able to deliver on that.
And so right now like the average portfolio company triples profit in the 1st 12 months.
We averaged 4.7 X profit in the first 20-4 months.
So we've delivered.
You know, we feel pretty good about it, but that was a need to believe like you know, you, you, you know come in obviously hoping and believing that you're going to do that, but especially because in a minority position, I don't have complete control.
15:22
And so that was a little bit of something that I had to learn how to do and influence the right way.
To get the founder on board for changes, etc, which to be fair for the most part because of how people are coming in, it's not that hard, but it's still a difference of do this versus I was thinking this might be something you'd consider, what do you think, right.
15:38
And so it's just it's a little bit different dynamic.
And so those were the need to believes to get to where we are now and I have more need to believes in the future, but I'll share those later.
What do you think is the biggest threat to your success?
Me saying something and getting cancelled for some reason like that's.
I mean that's.
15:54
That's what I think.
I mean threats wise, yes.
Do I think I would adapt?
Yes.
But like in terms of like because I will either win or I will die.
And so if that's the if that's my base operating system, like I will adapt and I'll figure something out.
It's just.
Like, I can already.
16:10
I was already thinking, So what would I do?
It's like, OK, well, I have a different figurehead.
I'd have multiple personalities.
We pump them the same way that we did with me, like like we'd work it out, but that would be that would be a dent.
It is scary, especially people with cancer culture.
Now they just love to pile on about everything.
Yeah.
So I think in a single word it's brand like irreparable brand damage is you know obviously I try not to do anything that you know that I think would do that, but that's you know that that would be the the single, the single bigger, bigger thing.
16:39
But again, it's not even irreparable.
I would just have to work around it.
I read somewhere that your goal is to become the most jacked billionaire.
So why is that your goal and how do we get there?
I.
Thought it was funny, mostly.
But I figured it was just become a billionaire.
And at that point I will probably be the most jacked guy in the room.
16:56
And so that's that was kind of like default.
Like I'll probably just, I can just be me and then be a billionaire and by default will be the most jacked billionaire.
Do you think Jeff basis is jacked?
Yeah, he's not more Jack than I am.
OK.
He's way wealthier than I am.
He's more, he's more financially Jack than I am, but he's no but not not physically, not yet.
17:15
Why is the billionaire thing your goal?
I think it's it's it's really just a milestone.
It's way less about like the actual billion dollars but I do think to the point earlier about like having the credibility to like there there still has I've.
I could be unaware but I haven't seen any like mega billionaires really try and build education for everyone of how to get all the way up not just like your first 10K. 1st 100K, first million, first 10 million, first 100 million.
17:40
Like I want to go all the way.
And I mean, it's really the document don't create.
It's like I want to go all the way and show every single step of the process how he did it so other people can do it.
And I think the reality is my hope is that we'll pave the way for people to be much bigger than I am.
You know what I mean?
17:56
Like, we've talked about this a lot, but like, you know, Gary, Gary didn't have Gary.
Right.
Gary just paved the way for people like us to go to go do what we're doing and we learn from their mistakes and their best practices and we don't have to wait 10 years to learn it.
He did because he had to figure it out and we just start today, you know what I mean?
18:11
And the the fact that there's like 23 year old multimillionaires and Decca millionaires right now off social media is just testing the fact that the entrepreneurs who came before them laid the path.
And so I have a tremendous amount of gratitude for those people.
I also don't have the illusion that, you know, a lot of people are like the goat and they wouldn't be the greatest of all time and.
18:29
I think that if you're the greatest all time, then you failed because especially if you want to be a teacher of some kind, which is a relatively loaded word.
But if you want to pass on lessons to other people, if you were the greatest of all time, then you failed.
So the only way to be the greatest of all time is to not be and to have set set the stage for people who are younger who I don't know to beat me and I got to be okay with that and I am.
18:50
But.
That was a mindset shift that I had to.
So like this is just like, I'm going to do this thing.
I think it's really cool because this is just like I happen to be really into like I draw pictures about business, I write books about business, I make videos about business.
I do business all day.
Like it's what I like.
And so that's what I do.
And I'm very fortunate in that the thing that I happen to like also happens to be very financial rewarding.
19:07
I don't know what I would do if I just like left painting and I didn't like business.
I could probably be harder for me, but maybe it wouldn't be, I don't know.
But this is just something that I love.
And so I just want to document and I also partially document it for me because if I feel like I don't understand something that bothers the hell out of me and so.
That's where all the frameworks and things happen so that I don't have to remember it.
19:23
It's like I have to make a framework for this.
It's like we're we haven't sent emails, which is ridiculous because we have a bunch of people who give us their e-mail every day.
And I say someday I'll e-mail you, but right now it's like I'm gonna have to write an e-mail regularly.
I have to have a framework for this.
It's like I have to do this all the time and so but then as soon as I have it, I'll just pass it to everybody else and then they won't have to confront the thing and learn and fail for however many months and.
19:47
They'll just be able to take the template and use it and then immediately be that much further ahead of than I was at their age.
Yeah, that's cool.
What would you say to the 20 year old who's looking up to you and saying I want to become a millionaire one day?
What are the three things that they have to do to get there?
You have to start.
You have to do the same amount of effort that the person who you think you want to emulate has done.
20:11
So if you do the volume of work that that person didn't, if you're like, well, that person's been doing it for 10 years.
They do it for 10 years and you don't switch gears and you stay on the path that you're on because otherwise you have to restart over and over again because a lot of that the trench knowledge comes from depth of knowledge, right?
20:28
It's it comes from putting, having deep roots, you know what I mean?
In a subject or a sector.
And I know that that counteracts the whole idea of like sampling lots of things and I and I get that that's a struggle for people.
It also is not.
False.
That somebody who started at 20 and worked for 10 years in the same industry versus somebody who started at 20 and jumped to 30 different things.
20:49
The guy who did one thing for 10 years will be further along.
The question is what's the longevity.
So if they did the the one thing for the decade it was it was it because they enjoyed the thing, which then if they hated it then they do switch, but now they switch way later and so then they they do pay that cost.
So the thing that makes this even harder is that you usually don't like stuff that you suck at, usually suck at everything when you start.
21:11
And so I do believe that like.
If something interests you like, you don't need to Like I'm not even a big believer in like being good at it if it if you just don't have to put effort into wanting to consume the thing.
Whether it's like I really like video stuff or like I really like, I really like sales stuff or really marketing stuff or really whatever it is that you find yourself reading.
21:31
For me, I always liked persuasion.
So like when I would like be in college, I like watch that talks on persuasion.
It was just an interesting way and so it's not surprising to me that I ended up finding myself in kind of acquisition and whatnot.
Customer acquisition, you know, on a tactical level in the beginning.
And so if you find interest, then it's like you just have to strap in and accept the fact that you're going to suck for a very long time, comma and that's okay and it should be to be expected.
21:53
And so I think if somebody's 20 years old, they need to expect that it's going to take a decade #1, #2.
They have to start on a path and not convince themselves to stop and then #3 see items one and two.
The podcast is called Erica Taught Me, but really today is all about Alex Hermosi taught me.
22:13
So what do you want people to be able to walk away from this saying?
Alex Hermosi taught me this.
Alex taught me that the feelings that I have are independent of the character traits that I want to espouse.
And so if I want to be more courageous, it doesn't mean that I don't feel fear.
It means that I act despite it.
22:29
If I want to be more patient, it doesn't mean that I don't want to stop doing the thing that I'm doing.
It means that I feel that feeling.
I accept it, and then I continue on the path that I.
Said I was going to do and so I think a lot of it, we said it very briefly in the beginning, but it's enduring short term discomfort for a long term achievement.
22:44
And so if there's one thing that everyone who is listening to this does, it's that you start on the path and you do not allow yourself to stop.

0:17
Understand is to forgive.
You can't understand and be angry at the same time.
It's actually really difficult the moment you really truly understand where someone is coming from and see their perspective.
Truly it's really difficult to be angry the wealthiest.
0:33
People in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I was going to originally call this how to deal with shit, but instead of going with no pain, no gain.
0:55
And so I wanted to outline 2 of the strategies that I think have helped me become more resilient in the face of like mental strife.
And I think that as we continue to grow in entrepreneurship and the size of our countries grow and impact, etcetera, like having strong processes, mental processes in place in order to safeguard yourself become more and more important.
1:17
And so one of the ones that I wanted to bring up is around anger.
And so I think whenever anything bad happens, right, there's typically one of two responses.
Either you become angry or you become sad, right?
Sometimes they happen in different order, You know, like some people never get sad, some people never get angry, some people get both.
1:34
You know, it's just kind of, it's a mix.
I can really only speak to the anger side because I'm just not.
I'm not like a sad, like I just don't go that way.
Like when something bad happens.
Because immediately, even if I have a feeling of sadness, I get angry with myself for feeling that way, for feeling weak and not taking control.
1:53
And then I get angry.
You know what I mean?
So it's almost immediate.
But then what happens is what do you do with that anger?
And so before I dive into that, I should say, like, why do we get angry?
Right?
We get angry because typically we feel wronged, right?
And so that immediately comes from a place of elevation, like you feel like you were above something.
2:10
How dare someone do something to you?
And it's typically someone who you brought into your circle.
Who then?
Betrays you in a certain way, whatever that be.
Now, in a business context, there's lots of different types of betrayal and relationships.
There's lots of different types of betrayal.
But usually it's just, you feel wrong, right?
2:25
It's it's typically when a promise is made or an unspoken promise is made and then it is broken, right?
And then that is where you feel like justice is warranted, right?
And so since you don't see that person suffering for the feeling that you have, you want to make them suffer, right?
2:40
And that's kind of where the anger comes from, at least to my understanding of it.
So.
How do you deal with this, right?
Because the bigger you get, the more times we were going to break things or break what you perceive to be relationships and do things that are wrong.
Like the amount of times we, I mean just I wish I could give you a laundry list of all the things that have happened.
2:58
You know what I mean, to give context.
But like partnership stealing money.
Like, I mean like like literally, you know, like the employees going behind your back trying to tell people to refund against you and that they're going to do something for like everything you could possibly imagine, right?
You know, it's just everything you can imagine.
3:15
Has happened, right.
And I think that in order to continue to grow, you need to have really strong processes in place in order to process these things where they will destroy you, right?
They'll destroy you.
And so there's two cornerstone stories that shaped my life that I wanted to share with you.
So the first one is from when I was in high school, when I was in 9th grade at a teacher named Steve Gibbons.
3:33
He's the one who stayed with me after school.
A lot of the after school donation stuff that we do is, is a big part because of that.
But he worked out with me after school every day.
And so when I was in 9th grade.
I remember I was such an angry kid, but I think a lot of people, you know what I mean?
9th grade, like you're confused your kid.
3:49
Whatever.
But I was, I was a pretty angry kid And he, I was like, man, I can't wait to come back at the at the high school reunion.
I'm going to show everyone, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And he was like, that doesn't that doesn't actually work in reality.
And I was like, what do you mean it doesn't work?
4:05
I was like, I'm going to show them.
And he was like, if you actually come back 10 years from now and you go up to somebody who's like bugged you and you tell them that like, look at you now he's like.
You're going to look like an idiot because they're going to know that you've been thinking about them this whole time and they didn't even think about you, like they forgot you existed.
4:21
He's like, so there's you can't do that because then you actually have already lost.
And I was like, shit, like, what do I like?
How do I, you know what I mean?
How do I get this out?
You know what I mean?
How do I get this, this rage out?
What do I do right.
And so you left me with a statement that whenever I get really angry about something, I turn to, which is success is the only revenge.
4:40
And so that's been something that's always cycled in my head whenever I get really upset about something, like really angry where I feel like someone wrongs me.
It's success is the only revenge because it's the only thing you can do.
If you think about it, there's nothing else you can do, right?
You can't go hurt people.
4:56
That's not going to serve you.
You're going to get hurt in the long run, right?
There's a lot of people who've said this statement, but I like it a lot, which is like being angry is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die, right?
And so all it is, you just brood and get angry and you become less effective, right?
5:13
And so then and then sometimes it starts turning towards yourself, you start becoming self-destructive instead of destroying the other bird and then it's like then they went even more and then it makes you more angry.
You know what I mean?
It's so this, it's a cycle.
And so the only way that I've been able to break that is by understanding and continually repeating that which is like success is the only revenge which then allows you to sublimate, which is taking a negative emotion and getting a positive, a positive outcome from it.
5:34
And so I learned about that, what that is sublimation, it's like when you are upset, go for a run and then all of a sudden something that was negative in your life becomes a benefit because of positive, right.
And so for me and obviously depends on the, on the level of the grievance that you're going through, how much anger you have and how much you need to expend in order to kind of come back to baseline, right, is with the initial burst of rage.
5:55
And I think I would describe it more as rage or at least that's how I I experience it, just like you know what I mean?
But for me, it's the only way that I've been able to get around that stuff.
And The thing is, is the the longer in the game, the more things like this will happen.
Just because you're exposed to it by the nature of time, right?
6:12
You're going to be wrong with more times.
The bigger you are and the longer you stay in, right, the more beat up you are in the arena.
And so the only way you can stay in is to keep yourself in is to keep your head straight.
And so success is the only revenge.
And so channel everything into that, into the thing that's going to be the only revenge you have which is continuing to succeed.
6:32
And yeah, that's it.
So that's that's like Cornerstone story number one.
That has has helped me deal with anger and that's in the immediate.
So how to diffuse it in the moment when you want to go and write some nasty Facebook poster, do some really mean live or blah, blah, blah, whatever it is, right.
6:48
Whenever you have that feeling and you type it up and you're like, I shouldn't send this like you probably should, right.
And just remembering that it's like been ingrained in my mind and maybe it's because it was such a young age that I heard it, but it was like, I was so angry at that time.
And then that's when I started lifting harder, You know what I mean?
7:04
I was just, she's like, take it out on the weight man he didn't like.
And so he helped me push that in the right direction.
And I'm always grateful for it.
And obviously as you get older, sometimes like, you can push it into the weight I am going to go workout.
But sometimes there's still some left over, you know?
And So what do you do with that?
And so when you have the leftover anger or the anger after the dust settles, you're still enraged about something, right?
7:24
What do you do?
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
7:42
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I has to do is you can just leave review.
They'll take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world with someone else.
So for me, obviously we've been here more times than once in in your life and so a deeper anger was towards parent ahead.
8:05
And so I still have.
And the way that I dealt with that was I actually had a paper that I had to write in college and it was on mental disorders and so we had to pick someone we knew actually I don't and and then and then look at what potential disorders they might have.
8:20
It was a weird kind of paper but it was interesting psychology or something like that.
So anyways I took it and you had to look at.
All of the person, because you have to look at psychology in terms of how people development, you know what I mean?
Like you know where were they at each of these developmental stages, what things are they going through based on what you have.
You can interview them asking more questions so you get more insight.
8:37
And then you write a paper you know about that person and and what factors may have potentially created who they are, their identity, their personality, their value system, right.
All that stuff.
And once I wrote this, the person that I was extremely upset with is what I wrote it about.
8:55
And by the end of finishing a paper, I was no longer upset with them because I understood them and I understood why.
And so the second kind of big quote, so the first one is success is the only revenge.
I think the second quote is to understand is to forgive.
9:12
You can't understand and be angry at the same time.
It's actually really difficult and so.
The moment you really, truly understand someone or truly understand where someone is coming from and see their perspective truly, not just say like, I get where you're like, I get your side, but not like what they're saying, but what experiences they went through to create the value system that creates that worldview.
9:36
Like true, deep understanding.
Once you have that, it's really difficult to be angry and so.
I think in like the the 911 urgency moment, you have to like, channel it into something that's going to supplement something that's going to be a positive benefit to you from the initial rage, right?
9:52
And then after that, after you have your, you know, your big adrenaline rush or whatever and it's gone, then you have to look at like, OK, what experiences do this person go through?
What upbringing, what what's things have happened, what things have happened recently, what things have happened long term?
10:10
That might have created an environment inside of this person where they would think this was okay, right?
And so a lot of times thinking about it like and like, really get in there.
And so I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say that.
So I was heartbroken once in my life, not by a girl, but by my best friend.
10:28
And what I mean by that was I had dated a girl for two years and then I had split up with her.
And it was a hard split up for me.
I mean, I was the one who initiated that.
But like, it's still, you know, like, could break up with anyone.
It's still, it's a hard period of your life.
And so I leaned on my friend, right?
10:44
And then he was kind of nowhere to be seen.
And I was like, I don't really get this.
And a year later, I found out that basically the moment that I had, I'd split up.
He had started dating her in secret for a whole year.
And then they told me and they kept it private from everyone, the entire school.
11:00
They only met in secret.
It was like this, really.
Super dodgy thing to show you kind of like how fucked up it was.
But anyways, the moment I found out about that, it was like pure rage.
You know what I mean?
That that like, how dare they do they like keep this for me and be, you know, do this in secret, like so deceptive and blah blah blah.
11:18
You know what I mean?
Like just rage that I was experiencing.
But I knew that as soon as it happened that I was going to be able to grow a lot from it.
And so the way that I was able to get over that rage right and not do something really stupid was I wrote a story.
Their love story from his perspective.
11:37
And so I wrote this to try and understand like how would if I were him, how would I explain this?
How would I tell this story of when she were like, Oh my God, how did you meet right?
How would he see this experience through his own lens that would allow him to be okay with making that action in secret despite us being best friends and all this kind of stuff, right?
12:00
And then once I went through that whole thing, I understood, and then I was no longer angry.
I'm not saying that I thought it was right, but the motion that was associated with it diffused.
And then I was able to continue to function and then go back to the primary, which is success is the only revenge.
12:17
And so it that's, that's been kind of the the 1-2 pillars of dealing with like massive emotional issues in short periods of time because you have to have that those tools, you know what I mean?
In your arsenal, that kind of armor.
Because the like, the higher up you go, the harder it gets.
12:33
It doesn't get easier.
It gets heavier and thicker, you know what I mean?
And the attacks get more direct and more personal and more whatever, right.
That's why I like some.
I have no idea why people want to get into politics like.
Maybe sometimes like I have no, I have no clue how they go into it and just like or like this is worth it.
12:48
I think that's really is like, I don't know how they're like this is the trade off.
I'm going to get destroyed publicly and everyone's going to hate me for the rest of my life.
Half the universe is going to hate me for the rest of my life.
That's rough, you know?
But anyways, that those are two of the cornerstone stories of my life that have dramatically shaped how I deal with very stressful things that happen.
13:05
And I hope that helps you if you ever have to deal with stressful things or things that anger you.
I don't have one for being sad because I it's that one's not That was not super real for me right now.
Maybe if I get really sad in the future about something, I'll let you know how I do.
But for right now, whenever I get sad, I get angry about the fact that I'm sad and I get right back to anger.








0:00
I'm going to show you how to get your first five customers in 10 steps.
The wild world of YouTube has videos, every word telling you how to scale and grow, but I think people overcomplicate it.
And so this is actually a sneak peek from my new book, $100 million leads comes out 819, You can go to acquisition.com/leads.
Let's dive in.
0:15
I had a video that that did really, really well that talked about how I got my first customers in everyone of the businesses that I ultimately scaled to multiple millions of dollars a month.
But we were like, that's amazing, but how do I do this today?
And so if you don't have a business, one, get an LLC, which you can find on LegalZoom, go to a bank with your LLC papers and get a bank account and then go online with Stripe or PayPal and get a way to process money.
0:37
When you do those three things, congratulations, you're now a business owner.
Now from there, you have to do the next thing, which is you have to let people know about the stuff you sell in order to get them to buy it.
There are 10 steps that we're going to walk through.
And by the end of these 10 steps, you will be able to have 5 customers or more with no money out of pocket.
0:53
Just time.
So the first step to getting this going is you need to get a list.
But I don't have a list, Alex.
You're damn straight.
You do it and I'll show you right now.
Number one, I want you to go to your e-mail account and I want you to pull all the contacts that you have in there, Anybody that you've ever messaged or emailed, that becomes list one.
1:09
List 2 is I want you to go to every single social media profile that you have.
So go to your social media profiles where you can direct message people.
So if you have followers that you can DM or message, I want you to write down every single one of those people.
That's list #2.
List #3, I want you to pull out your phone and I want you to look through your contacts and I want you to export them.
1:29
List one is all your e-mail contacts, List 2 is all of your social contacts, and list 3 is all of your phone and private personal contacts.
If you Add all three of those together, you will have a shit.
Load more leads than you thought you did and you're like, wait, you're going to ask me to contact these people?
Slow down.
Not yet.
And we're not going to do it in a really weird way, all right.
1:45
I'm sure you had to do it in a classy way, is how I start every business I have and have people thank me for it.
The second step is that you pick a platform.
All right?
So you have all these contacts, but you're going to have to pick one platform that you're going to start messaging or emailing them with.
The way to pick which one you're going to use is start with the one that you have the most people on.
2:01
So if you have the most Instagram people, or you have the most e-mail contacts or you have more people on your phone than any of those, start there.
Step 3.
But what do I say?
You personalize your message.
So what you want to do is you want to use something you already know about the person or prospect in order to initiate reaching out to them.
2:16
This is also just called being a human being.
So what you do is you take 30 seconds, you look at someone's profile and you say, oh, they have got this thing, we have something in common, something interesting happened, whatever.
And you could reach out to them with that as your primary message.
So for example, you can be like, hey, saw you got a baby, hey, saw you switch jobs, hey saw you move, hey, you saw that movie last weekend.
2:36
It doesn't matter.
All you need to show is that you took the few seconds to actually not just blast some sort of message and you reach out to 100 people every single day.
So let's say you had 3000 people.
Between all your emails, all your phone contacts, and every single follower across all your social medias, Step 4 you reach out 100 every single day.
2:57
Which means the 1st 4 hours of your day goes to that.
Because when you were starting a business, if no one knows you have a business, the first thing you did is to let people know that you exist.
Which is why advertising will take the majority of the beginning of your business career.
Everything must be hard before it can be easy.
It took you 20 years to send your first DM and it'll take you 2 minutes to send the second one.
3:15
So just get over the hump.
Send it just something so you can realize that you won't die.
Step five, what do I say?
If they reply, you warm them up.
I use a framework that I call A/C.
A.
You acknowledge.
That's what A stands for, Compliment.
And then you ask, for example, I can acknowledge and say, oh, so you have two kids.
3:34
That would be the acknowledgement of something they just told me.
So it shows active listening.
So C, it's the second step, but you're going to compliment them about the thing.
So it's like, wow, you have two kids.
You must be a supermom working full time and having two kids.
We now complimented something about their life.
We gave them a positive label that when we go to ask, we're going to tie our ask to the compliment.
3:53
We just gave them to the label that they want to reinforce about themselves because they want to stay consistent, because they want us to feel that way about them since we gave them that compliment.
So you didn't say, hey, so you're super Mont.
Then we transition to whatever type of question that's going to lead them to the service we sell.
So if I sold therapy, I might say something like, man, how do you get time to yourself?
4:13
If I was selling weight loss, I'd be like, hey, how do you have time to eat right and work out doing all that stuff?
Doesn't matter what you sell.
To talk about them, you compliment them and then you link that to the next leading question that will lead them down the path to the thing that you ultimately want to help them with.
Wait a second, this sounds like selling.
4:29
It's not because we're talking fucking humans.
That's all we're doing.
Which, by the way, this is step five.
You can find the other steps and step ten of the chapter of blah blah blah, which you should check it out.
It's $1.99 cents on Amazon.
It's Mondo.
And I do that because I hope that you make all the money in the world and then eventually get big enough that we can invest in your business so we can make even more money together.
4:48
That's why we do the stuff, all right?
That being said, step 6, invite their friends.
When you're talking about this stuff, you're not going to sell them.
This is fucking cute.
You're not going to solicit them for whatever your services are.
You asked a question, they're going to tell you stuff and then it's going to be like, Oh yeah, by the way, do you know anyone who's looking for XY&Z?
5:12
Because I'm opening up a few slots to help people do exactly that.
Here's why this is so important.
You're not asking them.
You're just asking them if they know anybody.
And since you're friends with them, and since your contacts, you're asking them for a favor.
You're not asking them to buy from you.
This should make you not feel weird about messaging people, because all we really did let's backtrack, is that we paid attention to people, we actively listened and we complimented them and then we asked them how they're dealing with something out of curiosity.
5:40
And then we say, do you know anybody?
If they say, hey, I'd like to find out more.
Now what they have done is they've transitioned from a lead to an engaged lead.
A lead is somebody that you can contact.
An engaged lead is someone who you can contact comma who has showed interest in the thing that you sell.
5:56
If she says, you know what, I haven't had a lot of time to myself or I haven't been able to keep up with my workouts, etcetera.
Now they have shown interest in the thing.
After you say, hey do you know anybody?
Then they say, well me boom, well then how do I get them to buy from me?
We're going to give them the easiest off in the world to say yes to.
6:14
You're going to make it free.
They probably know that you're not that experienced.
I mean in mind you, you're DM ING them, so you're not running some massive, you know, PR campaign across, you know, Times Square.
Just be honest.
So gather round.
I'm going to give you 2 versions of this.
One is a slightly longer one and one is slightly shorter one, you say.
6:31
By the way, do you know anybody who is described their struggles looking to dream outcome in time delay?
I'm taking on five case studies for free because that's all I can handle and we're being honest because this is a first business and you fucking have no idea what you're doing so you better not take more than five customers on.
6:49
I just want to get some testimonials for my service or product.
I help them repeat the dream outcome without effort and sacrifice.
It works, period.
I even guarantee that people get dream outcome or I'll work with them until they do.
I just had a girl named XXX work with me to get dream outcome even though she described the same struggle the person you're talking to is struggling with because you just asked them about it.
7:13
And I also had another guy who got the dream outcome and it was his first time.
I'd like to get more testimonials to show it works across different scenarios.
Does anyone you like come to mind if they say no?
Here's a really funny way you can respond to that.
Just say haha, does anyone you hate come to mind?
It breaks the weirdness right?
7:31
If there is any.
Honestly, that's when you'll sometimes get the real response.
Hey real quick guys, are you a business owner or you want to start a business?
Well, the first thing that any business owner needs is someone to sell their stuff to.
And I spent the last decade getting proficient advertising to the point that right now I have a 36 to one return on advertising.
7:47
Meaning for every dollar I put in, I get $36 back.
And I've spent two years and 2000 hours writing 19 drafts of my next book, $100 million Leads, where I share everything that I've learned for you for free.
And if that sounds at all interesting, go to acquisition.com/leads to register for the event.
8:04
It's actually free.
Everyone's invited.
It's virtual.
I'll see you there.
If you don't have time to say all of those things, you just say I help the type of customer get dream outcome in time period without effort and sacrifice and I guarantee XY&Z to decrease risk.
That's it.
8:19
That's if you just have that moment to deliver one thing of what do I do Okay.
Now this is important.
The reason we do it for free is you say, hey, I'm going to do all this stuff for free as long as you promise to do three things.
One, you actually use my service.
Two, you give me feedback on it, and three, leave a killer review if you think it deserves.
8:36
One, those are the terms of exchange.
I work for free.
As long as you use it.
You leave a review and you give me feedback on what I could do better.
Some special snowflakes are going to be like you should never sell your time for nothing.
You suck.
You have never done this before, so it would be unreasonable for you to be good.
8:52
And so why would you want to sell sucky service to people you know, give it away for free?
You're actually getting the better end of the deal.
I'll tell you the quick story of Warren Buffett and Ben Graham.
Ben Graham was the GOAT back in the day for investing.
Warren Buffett was just a kid out of Columbia and wanted to go learn investing, and he offered to work for Graham for free, Graham said.
9:12
You're getting the better end of the deal.
The actual answer was you're overpriced.
So free was too expensive for Graham because Graham knew that he was gonna have to invest more in getting Warren good enough to actually work for him.
And so right now, these first customers, they are exchanging something in for your service.
They're exchanging their time and their effort and some stuff later that you're gonna have them do.
9:31
Just because you're not getting paid doesn't mean it's free, but it is monetarily free.
The reason I want to start with that is that, one, it'll get you more reps Two, you probably suck.
Three, you need to learn how to suck less, and you suck less by doing more.
And it's way easier to get more people to work with you if you lower the barrier to free.
If people don't want to work with you even for free, then ask them why.
9:48
Because the reason that someone tells you they don't want to work with you, even if you're free, is because there are hidden costs associated with whatever thing you sell.
If you figure out what all those hidden costs are, you can eliminate those hidden costs and then be able to charge significantly more for your solution later compared to the other people who charge for it and still include those hidden costs.
10:07
So I'll give you an example.
I got solicited in this exact manner to do short form videos.
This is way back when I hadn't done any and a guy messaged me and said I want to do short form videos for you.
He said you don't have to do anything.
I will take all the stuff you already have online and I will make them for you and I'll even post them for you like you actually just need to say yes.
10:25
And so I said yes.
And guess what?
You started making short videos and he started accepting payment because he had removed hidden costs.
If people get value from this thing that you have, especially if it's free, they're far more likely to leave positive reviews, give you feedback and send their friends and family.
Once we have that, we have our first customers.
10:43
Now we go to step eight.
You start back at the top.
So you had that big list and we hit all of the months and back again.
So some of those people, by the way, when you ask them if they know anybody, they actually just give you people that they know that might help.
And you get free leads because if you reach out to 3000 people with a free thing, you'll get five people who will take you up on it, I promise you.
So now you're like, but Alex, I can't work for free forever.
11:00
Now we're on step nine, start charging.
Once people start referring, that's when you know you were good enough to start charging.
When this happens, all you do is you go back up to the script that I just read to you and you change free to 80% off and you say that's for the next 5.
What do you do after that?
You change the 80% to 60%.
11:17
After you get those five, change to 40, then to 20.
Then you're at full price.
But guess what?
Doesn't have to stop there.
You can go 20% over, you can go 40% over that because there are no rules.
And if at that point you're way better, you may merit that because of the value that you deliver, because ideally you're charging full retail, but now you're at 10X.
11:34
The value value that you have done has gotten better because you figured out from the feedback that these people that work with you for free have told you so that you can make it even better for people who pay you.
Once you have those people and you started transitioning, congratulations, you are in business and you are making money, you will at some point reach capacity of supply and demand is the single truth of business.
11:54
When you fill up all your slots with free people and discounted people, now you have true scarcity and so you can ethically sell with conviction that you really don't have that much room.
And so then you can sell someone with conviction that you don't have a lot of supply.
They will desire you more because you are scarce from a resource perspective and then they will pay the same or premium in order to work with you.
12:16
And then you turn to your free person and you say, I am accepting somebody who's paying full boat.
In order to do this, if you would like me to keep doing this for you, you would have to start paying to match them.
Are you comfortable with that?
If they're not, no sweat, because all you did is you help them for free and you say no worries.
12:33
Can I get the the killer killer review you asked me for or I asked you for?
And those free people, you have to love and cherish them more than anyone else in your life because they're gonna get your business in three different ways.
One, they're gonna leave you reviews that are gonna get your business to.
They're gonna send you people that are gonna get your business.
And three, they themselves may transition into paying you, which will also get you business.
12:52
Don't think short, think long and you'll make long money.
Now you have paying customers.
You're reaching your capacity, You're consistently raising your price because now there is more demand than you have supply and we have artificially created a condition for profit.
So what's the tense step?
Keep them warm.
You've got this big list of people check in like a human being, provide value to them on a regular basis.
13:10
When you do that, you continue to reinforce and deposit goodwill in the audience, because what will happen eventually is you won't even need to ask them because you've provided enough value.
You start posting enough testimonials, enough results, talking about some of the entrance stuff that you're doing right now that people be like, hey, that's actually pretty cool, hey, can I find out more about that?
13:27
And then they'll actually start soliciting you and that's the game.
That's how you go from zero to hero and get your first five paying customers.
If you just liked that episode, then you are going to love the free virtual event that I have for my next book, $100 million Leads.
And before you click away, listen to what I'm about to say.
13:42
Fast forward three months from now, your friend is using something that you didn't have access to and their business is growing.
Another person posted about how grateful they are that they went to the event because they're using these skills that they learned from the free thing that I'm going to give to only people who are their life and give you some context.
14:00
We have the tech now that we are going to scrape every single person who is at the event and they will be the only ones who gain access to a project that I've been working on for four years.
Which means that every person who is not on the link live is not going to get it.
14:16
And I'm doing that because I know I'm going to piss off 99% of people who are not there.
And it's because the next time I say I'm going to give away something, it's going to be awesome.
You're going to want to be there.
I want people to believe me.
And if you haven't taken action on it yet, go to acquisition.com/leads.
14:32
I'll see you there.






0:00
I'm going to show you how to get your first five customers in 10 steps.
The wild world of YouTube has videos, every word telling you how to scale and grow, but I think people overcomplicate it.
And so this is actually a sneak peek from my new book, $100 million leads comes out 819, You can go to acquisition.com/leads.
Let's dive in.
0:15
I had a video that that did really, really well that talked about how I got my first customers in everyone of the businesses that I ultimately scaled to multiple millions of dollars a month.
But we were like, that's amazing, but how do I do this today?
And so if you don't have a business, one, get an LLC, which you can find on LegalZoom, go to a bank with your LLC papers and get a bank account and then go online with Stripe or PayPal and get a way to process money.
0:37
When you do those three things, congratulations, you're now a business owner.
Now from there, you have to do the next thing, which is you have to let people know about the stuff you sell in order to get them to buy it.
There are 10 steps that we're going to walk through.
And by the end of these 10 steps, you will be able to have 5 customers or more with no money out of pocket.
0:53
Just time.
So the first step to getting this going is you need to get a list.
But I don't have a list, Alex.
You're damn straight.
You do it and I'll show you right now.
Number one, I want you to go to your e-mail account and I want you to pull all the contacts that you have in there, Anybody that you've ever messaged or emailed, that becomes list one.
1:09
List 2 is I want you to go to every single social media profile that you have.
So go to your social media profiles where you can direct message people.
So if you have followers that you can DM or message, I want you to write down every single one of those people.
That's list #2.
List #3, I want you to pull out your phone and I want you to look through your contacts and I want you to export them.
1:29
List one is all your e-mail contacts, List 2 is all of your social contacts, and list 3 is all of your phone and private personal contacts.
If you Add all three of those together, you will have a shit.
Load more leads than you thought you did and you're like, wait, you're going to ask me to contact these people?
Slow down.
Not yet.
And we're not going to do it in a really weird way, all right.
1:45
I'm sure you had to do it in a classy way, is how I start every business I have and have people thank me for it.
The second step is that you pick a platform.
All right?
So you have all these contacts, but you're going to have to pick one platform that you're going to start messaging or emailing them with.
The way to pick which one you're going to use is start with the one that you have the most people on.
2:01
So if you have the most Instagram people, or you have the most e-mail contacts or you have more people on your phone than any of those, start there.
Step 3.
But what do I say?
You personalize your message.
So what you want to do is you want to use something you already know about the person or prospect in order to initiate reaching out to them.
2:16
This is also just called being a human being.
So what you do is you take 30 seconds, you look at someone's profile and you say, oh, they have got this thing, we have something in common, something interesting happened, whatever.
And you could reach out to them with that as your primary message.
So for example, you can be like, hey, saw you got a baby, hey, saw you switch jobs, hey saw you move, hey, you saw that movie last weekend.
2:36
It doesn't matter.
All you need to show is that you took the few seconds to actually not just blast some sort of message and you reach out to 100 people every single day.
So let's say you had 3000 people.
Between all your emails, all your phone contacts, and every single follower across all your social medias, Step 4 you reach out 100 every single day.
2:57
Which means the 1st 4 hours of your day goes to that.
Because when you were starting a business, if no one knows you have a business, the first thing you did is to let people know that you exist.
Which is why advertising will take the majority of the beginning of your business career.
Everything must be hard before it can be easy.
It took you 20 years to send your first DM and it'll take you 2 minutes to send the second one.
3:15
So just get over the hump.
Send it just something so you can realize that you won't die.
Step five, what do I say?
If they reply, you warm them up.
I use a framework that I call A/C.
A.
You acknowledge.
That's what A stands for, Compliment.
And then you ask, for example, I can acknowledge and say, oh, so you have two kids.
3:34
That would be the acknowledgement of something they just told me.
So it shows active listening.
So C, it's the second step, but you're going to compliment them about the thing.
So it's like, wow, you have two kids.
You must be a supermom working full time and having two kids.
We now complimented something about their life.
We gave them a positive label that when we go to ask, we're going to tie our ask to the compliment.
3:53
We just gave them to the label that they want to reinforce about themselves because they want to stay consistent, because they want us to feel that way about them since we gave them that compliment.
So you didn't say, hey, so you're super Mont.
Then we transition to whatever type of question that's going to lead them to the service we sell.
So if I sold therapy, I might say something like, man, how do you get time to yourself?
4:13
If I was selling weight loss, I'd be like, hey, how do you have time to eat right and work out doing all that stuff?
Doesn't matter what you sell.
To talk about them, you compliment them and then you link that to the next leading question that will lead them down the path to the thing that you ultimately want to help them with.
Wait a second, this sounds like selling.
4:29
It's not because we're talking fucking humans.
That's all we're doing.
Which, by the way, this is step five.
You can find the other steps and step ten of the chapter of blah blah blah, which you should check it out.
It's $1.99 cents on Amazon.
It's Mondo.
And I do that because I hope that you make all the money in the world and then eventually get big enough that we can invest in your business so we can make even more money together.
4:48
That's why we do the stuff, all right?
That being said, step 6, invite their friends.
When you're talking about this stuff, you're not going to sell them.
This is fucking cute.
You're not going to solicit them for whatever your services are.
You asked a question, they're going to tell you stuff and then it's going to be like, Oh yeah, by the way, do you know anyone who's looking for XY&Z?
5:12
Because I'm opening up a few slots to help people do exactly that.
Here's why this is so important.
You're not asking them.
You're just asking them if they know anybody.
And since you're friends with them, and since your contacts, you're asking them for a favor.
You're not asking them to buy from you.
This should make you not feel weird about messaging people, because all we really did let's backtrack, is that we paid attention to people, we actively listened and we complimented them and then we asked them how they're dealing with something out of curiosity.
5:40
And then we say, do you know anybody?
If they say, hey, I'd like to find out more.
Now what they have done is they've transitioned from a lead to an engaged lead.
A lead is somebody that you can contact.
An engaged lead is someone who you can contact comma who has showed interest in the thing that you sell.
5:56
If she says, you know what, I haven't had a lot of time to myself or I haven't been able to keep up with my workouts, etcetera.
Now they have shown interest in the thing.
After you say, hey do you know anybody?
Then they say, well me boom, well then how do I get them to buy from me?
We're going to give them the easiest off in the world to say yes to.
6:14
You're going to make it free.
They probably know that you're not that experienced.
I mean in mind you, you're DM ING them, so you're not running some massive, you know, PR campaign across, you know, Times Square.
Just be honest.
So gather round.
I'm going to give you 2 versions of this.
One is a slightly longer one and one is slightly shorter one, you say.
6:31
By the way, do you know anybody who is described their struggles looking to dream outcome in time delay?
I'm taking on five case studies for free because that's all I can handle and we're being honest because this is a first business and you fucking have no idea what you're doing so you better not take more than five customers on.
6:49
I just want to get some testimonials for my service or product.
I help them repeat the dream outcome without effort and sacrifice.
It works, period.
I even guarantee that people get dream outcome or I'll work with them until they do.
I just had a girl named XXX work with me to get dream outcome even though she described the same struggle the person you're talking to is struggling with because you just asked them about it.
7:13
And I also had another guy who got the dream outcome and it was his first time.
I'd like to get more testimonials to show it works across different scenarios.
Does anyone you like come to mind if they say no?
Here's a really funny way you can respond to that.
Just say haha, does anyone you hate come to mind?
It breaks the weirdness right?
7:31
If there is any.
Honestly, that's when you'll sometimes get the real response.
Hey real quick guys, are you a business owner or you want to start a business?
Well, the first thing that any business owner needs is someone to sell their stuff to.
And I spent the last decade getting proficient advertising to the point that right now I have a 36 to one return on advertising.
7:47
Meaning for every dollar I put in, I get $36 back.
And I've spent two years and 2000 hours writing 19 drafts of my next book, $100 million Leads, where I share everything that I've learned for you for free.
And if that sounds at all interesting, go to acquisition.com/leads to register for the event.
8:04
It's actually free.
Everyone's invited.
It's virtual.
I'll see you there.
If you don't have time to say all of those things, you just say I help the type of customer get dream outcome in time period without effort and sacrifice and I guarantee XY&Z to decrease risk.
That's it.
8:19
That's if you just have that moment to deliver one thing of what do I do Okay.
Now this is important.
The reason we do it for free is you say, hey, I'm going to do all this stuff for free as long as you promise to do three things.
One, you actually use my service.
Two, you give me feedback on it, and three, leave a killer review if you think it deserves.
8:36
One, those are the terms of exchange.
I work for free.
As long as you use it.
You leave a review and you give me feedback on what I could do better.
Some special snowflakes are going to be like you should never sell your time for nothing.
You suck.
You have never done this before, so it would be unreasonable for you to be good.
8:52
And so why would you want to sell sucky service to people you know, give it away for free?
You're actually getting the better end of the deal.
I'll tell you the quick story of Warren Buffett and Ben Graham.
Ben Graham was the GOAT back in the day for investing.
Warren Buffett was just a kid out of Columbia and wanted to go learn investing, and he offered to work for Graham for free, Graham said.
9:12
You're getting the better end of the deal.
The actual answer was you're overpriced.
So free was too expensive for Graham because Graham knew that he was gonna have to invest more in getting Warren good enough to actually work for him.
And so right now, these first customers, they are exchanging something in for your service.
They're exchanging their time and their effort and some stuff later that you're gonna have them do.
9:31
Just because you're not getting paid doesn't mean it's free, but it is monetarily free.
The reason I want to start with that is that, one, it'll get you more reps Two, you probably suck.
Three, you need to learn how to suck less, and you suck less by doing more.
And it's way easier to get more people to work with you if you lower the barrier to free.
If people don't want to work with you even for free, then ask them why.
9:48
Because the reason that someone tells you they don't want to work with you, even if you're free, is because there are hidden costs associated with whatever thing you sell.
If you figure out what all those hidden costs are, you can eliminate those hidden costs and then be able to charge significantly more for your solution later compared to the other people who charge for it and still include those hidden costs.
10:07
So I'll give you an example.
I got solicited in this exact manner to do short form videos.
This is way back when I hadn't done any and a guy messaged me and said I want to do short form videos for you.
He said you don't have to do anything.
I will take all the stuff you already have online and I will make them for you and I'll even post them for you like you actually just need to say yes.
10:25
And so I said yes.
And guess what?
You started making short videos and he started accepting payment because he had removed hidden costs.
If people get value from this thing that you have, especially if it's free, they're far more likely to leave positive reviews, give you feedback and send their friends and family.
Once we have that, we have our first customers.
10:43
Now we go to step eight.

And you get free leads because if you reach out to 3000 people with a free thing, you'll get five people who will take you up on it, I promise you.
So now you're like, but Alex, I can't work for free forever.
11:00
Now we're on step nine, start charging.
Once people start referring, that's when you know you were good enough to start charging.
When this happens, all you do is you go back up to the script that I just read to you and you change free to 80% off and you say that's for the next 5.

11:54

And so then you can sell someone with conviction that you don't have a lot of supply.
They will desire you more because you are scarce from a resource perspective and then they will pay the same or premium in order to work with you.
12:16
And then you turn to your free person and you say, I am accepting somebody who's paying full boat.

I'll see you there.






0:00
Burnout isn't real.
I just got off the phone with an 8 figure plus CEO that was contemplating shutting down his entire business because he felt burnt out.
I'm going to release my side of the conversation with him so that I can show you the unlocks that we went through.
Never done this before.
It's an incredibly powerful call.
0:15
You can unlock the unlimited motivation that I think he was able to tap into by the end of it.
You do not have mental illness.
You are not mentally unhealthy.
You do not have anything wrong with you.
If anything, you have a lot of stuff right with you.
I think that you are really hard on yourself.
0:33
You're not only doing great, you're doing extraordinary, like you're doing very well.
And so whatever voices you have in your life, internal or external, that are telling you otherwise, you need to stop listening to them.
I tweeted this morning and I was thinking about you.
0:49
Do not listen to people whose dreams for your life are smaller than yours.
Like parents, friends, only person who can know who knows how big you dream is you.
And if someone does have bigger dreams for you than you do, then you should absolutely listen to them.
You know what I mean?
But if you don't, then their advice is not valid that you don't share a common future.
1:09
And most advice should come from a shared common goal.
But most people give advice that serves them through your behavior, which is another way of called manipulation, like the difference between help and manipulation is intention.
All we do when we communicate with anyone in general is to manipulate their behavior or change their behavior.
1:28
Our goal is to change your behavior from this call.
I hope that this decreases your stress level because it reframes how you act in the company and in so doing allows you to go further.
Because right now what feels unsustainable to you is unsustainable because you've defined it as unsustainable.
1:45
What happens is people start defining normal as good and that is the problem.
Normal is normal, Normal is average.
And so we have to be different than average or different than normal or extraordinary in order to achieve an extraordinary outcome.
2:01
I want to say Andy Grove who said only the paranoid survive.
Arguably one of the goat operators of the century who basically turned Intel around saying that only the paranoid survive And you hear like Steve Jobs, like he was obsessive and he was he was difficult to deal with And so if we try and use standard.
2:20
Is this guy normal?
The obvious answer is no, and I hope not.
And so a lot of these character traits that I feel like I've heard you say about yourself that are set in a negative light.
Said differently, it's just they are not the same as other people.
Well, we can't hope to be have a different outcome from other people and then also hope to have the same behaviors, viewpoints, beliefs and skill sets, right?
2:44
So like, you got to let your lungs adjust the altitude like you just went up, like. 3 rungs of success.
You know what I mean?
From when you and I started talking, whatever a year ago, Almost, I think not even.
Fuck, it's been like 6-7 months and the business is dripple.
3:03
What's interesting though is that you were in pain then and I would say that you're in equal pain now.
Changing the circumstances or our conditions is not going to change how you feel.
You changed your conditions, we actually massively improved them.
Your feelings didn't change, which means that the feelings are not valid, doesn't mean they don't exist.
3:20
It just doesn't mean that we have to listen to them.
Managing stress is a learned skill.
It doesn't come from changing conditions.
Anything external does not influence how stressed you are.
The judgment you have about the external is what influences how stressed you are.
I don't like the term mindset, you know what I mean?
3:36
I just, I hate it overall.
But in terms of like reframing and perspective shifts, I think those are powerful to think through it, which is at the end of your life you will probably be equally satisfied and dissatisfied.
There will be things that you wish you have, you would have accomplished, and there will be things that you will be proud that you have done the same as right now.
3:55
And so I think it's much more about figuring out how to separate your internal dialogue and feelings, or at least response to your feelings from the external.
You don't have to go through the fire.
The fire gives you evidence that you have the trait.
4:11
You can be a patient person but never been tested, but the moment you tested, you have evidence that you are patient.
So all it does is it gives us reinforcement.
That what we thought about ourselves all along was true.
What is the practice of doing this?
It's being able to separate and identify when you feel stressed.
4:29
Step one, I feel stressed, I feel it.
And whatever your your triggers are for me, I feel tight in my chest.
That's how I know that I start feeling stressed.
So when I feel that, I think, OK, what is causing this?
What is the trigger that I have chosen to judge as good or bad?
4:44
What is the label that I'm ascribing to a situation?
You have to peel back the layer and say, what is it?
And then usually if you take it all the way down, it means that you think you're going to die.
Sales were low today, which means sales are going to be low forever, which means I'm going to have to fire everyone, which means everyone's going to hate me and I'm going to be isolated and alone and I'm going to die, right.
5:01
Just because you think it doesn't mean it's true.
Thoughts are not true.
Not all thoughts are true.
They're just thoughts, famous fields.
They're just they're literally just chemicals in your brain that are meant to keep you alive, not to help you succeed.
When you feel stressed, stop and be like, ah, I'm feeling emotion here.
5:20
I wonder what is causing this?
What am I labeling is bad?
Do I need to change anything about this external condition?
Probably not.
So do I think that law of large numbers is that if I have 365 days and I did the exact same thing, there's going to be days that are in the bottom 10% and days that are in the top 10% with the exact same conditions like in terms of behaviors, the answer is yes.
5:44
And so I just described this is like, oh, this just might be one of those bottom 10% days and bottom 10% days happen every 10 days.
Independent, it's three a month, it's almost every other, you know, every weekish.
And even of those 36 days, you might even be in a bottom 10% day of those, which is a bottom 1% day, 3.6 days a year, fucking horrible days.
6:04
But doesn't mean we need to change our behavior.
Probably not because our behavior over a long trend line has tripled this business.
I feel for how much you beat yourself up.
Because I too beat myself up and I do know what it's like to be miserable.
And I prefer not being miserable if I have a Victor Frockle's man search for meeting.
6:22
The man's in a fucking hall like in the Holocaust, right?
And he's like happyish.
So if he can be happy there than me making a fuckload of money being young and healthy and married in the most developed country in the world, do I really have any reason when COVID hit the first three weeks a shit load of gyms closed?
6:40
My judgment of that was that they were people who wanted to have a reason that was socially acceptable for losing.
They were just waiting.
And then finally they had an out that they could be like COVID and everybody like, ah shucks.
Not to say that external conditions don't affect things, they do, but the wave of gyms that I saw that really wanted to keep going but couldn't happen at like month nine when the second shutdown happened, they ran out of cash.
7:05
They literally couldn't keep the doors open.
But the ones that happened in the beginning?
Had lost the will to fight.
And so my goal for this call was to renew your will to fight.
Because if we can separate your internal feelings from the external conditions that are around you, you can be unbelievably successful.
7:22
Now if it is uncomfortable, of course it is.
It's expected to be.
That's why it's growing pains, because if they were doing the same thing you were doing before, then you would already have adapted to it.
Which is why, like I said, you got to let your your lungs adjust to the air.
It's thinner, fewer people can stand it.
There's more.
But it does normalize.
7:40
Just like when you look back at what you were running $1,000,000 business and you were stressed out of your mind, then you're equally stressed out now, but you would wish to have the problems you had with $1,000,000 business because you have adjusted, your lungs are stronger now.
The things that you're doing are not even impossible.
7:56
They've been well documented and done for for decades by other companies.
So it's purely between your ears, which is good news, because it means all we have to do is reframe reality.
When you feel stress, you do not need to behave stressfully because the plan is solid.
8:16
We just need our commitment to the plan to be just as solid.
I think you just have to be able to like Createspace.
If you think about one of those like Yeti mugs, you know the one I'm talking about, you can have something hot on the inside and doesn't.
It's not.
Hold it and it stays hot for a while.
The difference is that there's separation.
8:32
There's air.
Between the outside and the inside, it could be cold outside, it'd be hot outside.
It's not going to change the temperature on the inside of the bottle.
It's like you need to be more like a yig right now.
If it if it gets colder, your inside gets colder.
If it gets hotter, the inside gets hotter, But the more you can stay constant, independent of the external conditions.
8:48
I feel stressed air.
That's because I have labeled something externally as hot.
But is it I have an external stressor?
Do I need to feel stressed space?
What if this were good?
What if this is normal?
But if this is to be expected, but if this is just the bottom 10% day and it's just statistics, of course I'm going to have the bottom 10%.
9:07
Day one out of 10 days is the bottom 10%.
And on the flip side, something internally is off space.
It doesn't mean that I need to act that way.
So it's bidirectional.
If you delay the space between when you feel something and when you behave, I promise you the behaviors that you will do after you had some space will be more aligned with your long term goals.
9:26
To have the expectation that building a business that's going to set you up for the rest of your life is going to be easy is ridiculous.
The reason it is difficult for people is because you have to change how you view reality and you have that power.
You're super introspective, you're very caring, you have all the character traits of an Excellency of the only thing that you suffer from is insecurity and second guessing.
9:44
Less emotionally reactive, more calm.








0:00
If you have nothing going for you, it's another way of saying that you have nothing to lose.
And so it means that you have endless shots on goal and so you should be the most prone to taking action because there's nothing holding you back.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:19
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
And today to say the gentleman's a friend.
I think everybody says that when they first do an interview.
This is my buddy.
Alex our guess who I'll interview here in a minute and I met via text effort and we spent like a six months or you're getting to know each other.
0:37
I laughed every morning at our text.
You know we laughed at before I introduced the formal stuff.
It was a time where both of us waited to invest in cryptocurrency and we both talked about it and we both equally went in the day.
It reached its peak in my life like and then we decided that.
0:56
It crashed after that that we would not invest anymore because we didn't want to hurt the rest of the investors.
So anyway, we built an amazing friendship via text.
We got together and hit it off.
He is truly one of the smartest marketers I've ever met.
Smartest businessman.
He is an incredible husband.
1:12
He's a dear friend.
He's a good human being and I'm so glad we got to know each other.
Yes, he's built, he built five companies in like record time.
Over $120 million exited out of multiple companies.
Now he's got a massive portfolio of companies.
That he's a part of that.
Do over $200 million a year in revenue.
1:29
He's on fire.
He owns acquisition.com.
You've seen him all over social media.
I'm so glad to have my friend here, Alex or Mosey.
What's up man?
It was like the nicest intro.
Thank you.
I'll do my very best to live up to that.
It's true, man.
And listen, the fun part, I wish we could share some of the text.
1:46
I literally remember being at the gym and I couldn't get back to it like the next set because I was still laughing so hard.
So it's been it's been a fun.
Relationship.
You know, call it the own your future podcast.
You know why?
Because Tony and I, Robbins and I did a a a challenge about three years ago.
2:04
We called it Own Your Future.
And I was on a podcast and someone said why would you want to own your future?
And my reply was, well shit, if you don't own your future, someone else is going to.
And that hit me and I watched everybody's comment was like, oh Oh my God, because you don't think about that.
Your career could own you.
2:21
Your old beliefs could own you your your current income.
Because you're not stretching yourself to to finally launch that business you were going to could be owning you.
And I think at the end of the day, we all want to own our calendar, we want to own our decisions.
So that's why I went that way.
2:36
So we'll get into some fun stuff and and if we can go personal because we're friends.
But I love that question.
What does that mean to you?
Like, what does it mean to Alex to own your future?
So I mean, I think it means high agency.
So meaning, like, when we're kids, it becomes real.
2:53
We learn what the world means through other people.
And so, like you're, you know, you, you have Luca and he's like, what does that mean?
And what is that?
And so you're literally telling him what things mean.
And so, like, the first things we learn are only from the the few people around us that tell us how to interpret the world.
3:10
And then once we turn 1617182023, all of a sudden we're like, I don't know of everything, that every one of these people who told me what things mean were right.
And so we spend the rest of our lives trying to unlearn what everyone has told us meant and then make up that meaning for ourselves.
3:27
Wow.
Such a what?
A that's an amazing and true cuz the word that came ahead you're trying to decipher is that my father's perspective or is that reality And what is reality?
Yeah, yeah.
And so that.
So my my goal personally has been to dissect decisions and think like, is this a decision that I'm making because I believe this or because of what I want other people to think about me as a result of this decision.
3:54
And we're social beings.
We care about what other people think and I don't think we're ever going to, like, get completely rid of that from us.
I mean, you'd have to be, you know, Gandhi or whoever you know Buddha, right?
But at least if I can try and be aware of how much something might influence me, then at least gives me the the wherewithal to say okay warning flags.
4:14
This is a sensitive subject that your dad always wanted for you.
Be extra careful around decisions that impact that go in this direction.
And so I can just take the extra pause of space and say okay, is this really me or is this because I want him to think this about me And and like dad is really just a foil.
4:32
It could be your brother, your sister, your spouse, your exwife.
You know what I mean?
That rival or the competitor, whoever it is.
The the moment that I realized this in my life was, I was 19 years old.
And at the time I was an angry 19 year old like some of us are, and probably unrightfully so.
4:49
But I really disliked both my parents really heavily and I remember thinking to myself like they messed me up.
I have all these anger issues like I hate everyone.
I'm a lone wolf, whatever.
And I remember catching myself, blaming them and thinking to myself, that means that I give them all the power in my life like that Wherever wherever I point, the finger of blame is also where the power follows.
5:15
It's like power follows blame.
And so I was like, what am I going to do about it?
Because maybe they did wrong.
It doesn't really matter.
It's only me who can who can own my own future, cuz otherwise they're going to own my future for the rest of my life.
5:31
And then the thing that made it crack for me was the idea that the people that I hated the most owned me.
That was the thing.
So I so it was like, so these people that I hated and blamed, then flipping it from the blame to they own me.
5:46
They have power over me.
I was like, I never want them to have power over me.
And then that was actually the the first real crack I had in like the dam of trying to like, make my own life and start.
That was when I decided to not be premed because that was what my dad wanted me to be.
And like it.
There were many steps on this, you know, this journey.
6:02
But the first one of, like, just not being a doctor like him and being just saying like, I want to get into business because it's like I'm way more interested in this stuff.
Like you can imagine, I was like shaking to try and tell my dad this, But yeah, it was like, I blame them.
They owned me.
I don't want that.
6:18
Yeah.
And I want to dissect this little and I I can't wait to talk about some business things and things that I I know people need in today's world.
But this is more important because what I always I love the term going upstream.
I know it's simple.
It was.
It was a term I heard Tony Robbins talked about, the medical field.
6:34
Right as a doctor pulls into a medical office and there's a stream by and there's someone drowned.
And he goes in, you've heard this before.
And he goes and saves him.
And another doctor pulls up.
He's like, help me, help me save this next person, save this next person.
And finally a doctor pulls up and looks and he goes, come help us.
And he drives away.
6:50
And he stops.
He goes, hey, how come you're not going to help us?
He's like, I'm just going to drive upstream and see who's throwing these people in, right?
It's like you're never going to get it all.
Let's just stop the bastard throwing people in the stream.
And that's stuck with me so much that everything the reason I I love this podcast about business, about marketing.
7:06
But really I want to go upstream because the human condition that so many people are are watching and listening right now.
They think it's the marketing thing or the sales thing or the invention they have to have or maybe they didn't have the right employee or but really when you go up to that next level.
7:23
There are things sabotaging us today that were put in our lives by parents, by a teacher, by an experience, by a bad relationship.
And if we don't solve that, then there's no way we can go downstream and clear up all the people, right?
So thank you for for being vulnerable and sharing that because I would bet to say there's so many people watching today, listening today that don't realize that someone else is owning their decisions based on the past and and I'd love to know going deeper what you shared.
7:53
How did you really, how did you make that?
Like what was the thing 19 is young to be able to recognize that.
I probably recognize that in my 30s and some people maybe never.
And the the question I'll say is.
Would you take any of it back?
8:10
Because I think if you blamed, like, if you blame your parents, up to that, they're like, hey, they didn't support me, they want to be a doctor.
And if I'm not a doctor, I'm nobody, I'm a loser.
I'm pathetic.
You'll never make it.
We can laugh about some of the things we've talked about it all, but like, you're not going to make it.
You're going to be a loser.
You're blowing your life.
Nothing will ever work.
8:25
And then when it does work, you don't get the credit.
They're like, well, you got lucky.
It'll probably fail anyway, right?
How do you get to a point to realize Sorry, I see a shaking eye.
No.
How do you get to the point where you go, wow, thank God they did that.
8:42
Because it drove me to be stronger, faster, more innovative, more creative.
And now you get to you know own your decisions.
I think, I think it's a, I think it's an overtime process because I mean, I certainly think when I was 19 years old, I was not there.
It was the first crack and the thing was just like I was so angry and so the idea and like I define powers just like influence over someone else's events, things, people, etcetera.
9:06
And so like they were influencing my decisions, which means they had power over me.
And it just sickened me to think that these people that I was so angry about, I'm not saying it was right or wrong, but like at the time that these people, I didn't want to give them that power.
And so I even think about this now sometimes even like big business decisions, etcetera.
9:25
A lot of times we say, like, society tells us or society trains us, whatever.
But if you really, like, listen to it, there's usually like two or three voices or maybe just one.
Yeah.
And it's like sometimes you're surprised.
And so one of the exercises I do when I have these decisions where I'm like, I feel like I'm pooled in multiple directions.
9:42
I think, I think I the thing I know I want to do and the thing that I have been trained myself to do, that's not the thing I want to do, is I just try and name the person who's stopping me from doing it.
And so I remember there was like when I was selling one of the businesses, this was like the first massive deal that we were going to go through.
9:58
I started playing these voices, just one particular entrepreneur that I know.
And I was like, he's going to think that this isn't enough money.
Now mind you, it was, it was a big exit and it's totally made-up in my mind.
But I I had to write down his name and say, like, will I let this person stop me from exiting this company?
10:14
And when I saw it, it just seemed so small and I was like, no, I'm not going to give him that kind of power over my life.
I'm going to give this guy is going to influence my decisions, going to change the rush of my life because of a voice I have in my head that he doesn't even know I'm thinking about him and.
You know what?
Before we go any further, it it sounds so silly as you write it.
10:30
Once you wrote it down, it was silly.
But how strong are those voices all of you listening, watching right now that says oh you're too young for this, you're too old for this, right, all of it.
You you had someone that said you don't sell that company unless it's 200,000,000 and and you're getting lots of zeros and you're like questioning until you wrote it down and go am I going to allow him?
10:52
And I think, I think it's a big take away today is.
If something is holding you back in your life and you think it's your own insecurities, of course it is.
Or your own beliefs.
But right down, I love that I'm going to do that.
Next time is literally right down.
Am I not going to do this because of and you really want to give him that power?
11:10
And it's so interesting when we talk about insecurity because most insecurities belong to someone else.
And so it's like, who owns this insecurity of mine?
And why did I inherit it?
Because if, if, because insecurity comes from other people's judgments.
So, like, they you can't be insecure about something unless there's someone else making this judgment.
11:26
Otherwise there would be nothing to be insecure about.
And so naming who owns that insecurity all it takes it from this really amorphous thing to like, it's John.
Really.
Wow.
It is John.
And sometimes it takes a couple.
11:42
You're like, no, it's not my mom.
No, it's not.
You know, it's not my uncle.
You know you know what?
It's it's that my colleague, he's I work with him every day and I think that if he if he knew I'd quit my job, he would think I was like not cool or it's the guys I used to go to school with.
If they know that I quit my job, they would see me as a loser like my senior.
12:00
Year or a Dreamer?
Yeah.
Like, it's not going to work right?
And they have all these good jobs.
And like, I'm going to quit my stable job to go to this thing.
And I used to think, like, there's going to be a shortterm time when they're all making more money than me and they can buy things that I can't.
So here's a quick.
Question if if there's all of us, make the decisions.
12:17
The opposite side, like the main side, is don't let people unqualified talk you out of what you want out of life.
You're broke friend telling you how to fix your relationships or broke friend telling you how to do your business.
Single friend on the relationship, right?
We know that.
What helps fuel the confidence to keep going?
12:34
Right, because we all question ourselves.
How many times have we both?
You're an inch away from signing the deal, starting the new.
You bought a company yesterday.
There's always those moments right before you stroke a check with lots of zeros or start a new company, start a new relationship, say.
I do say I don't.
12:51
Right, this is enough.
Or this is the beginning.
All of those moments I I believe I'm going to digress here.
I believe pressure, at least with me.
When I'm under pressure, I can resort back to the man I used to be.
Right.
I think I'm, I'm growing.
13:07
If I'm not climbing, I'm sliding.
I'm growing emotionally, physically, like spiritually.
And then you get under pressure and sometimes you take a step back and you make a decision of the man that you were running away from or or want to grow from.
So if, if you can be bold enough to take that uncomfortable action to say no, I'm going to sell this company because it makes sense for me.
13:27
I'm not giving that power to John.
I'm not giving this power to my parents.
What keeps you in the game so you can continue to make better and better decisions for you?
So is this.
I want to make sure I understand the question.
There's the what makes me confident to make the next to own my own decision rather than listen to someone else versus what keeps me going in terms of the bigger goal?
13:51
Yeah, I think the first, first one, yeah.
So I'm a big believer, and this is a little bit contrarian, that proof is the best type of evidence for a trait.
And so rather than say like, I'm, I'm honest, I'm honest, I'm honest, But like you're a crook.
14:11
Like all the evidence punch the fact that you're a crook.
Like I think that when you say that on some level you don't believe you because you know that's not true.
And so I try and look at Okay, what experiences or things I've done in the past can I transfer that are close enough to this new thing.
14:30
So if I built a sales team at a weight loss company and then I really want to do this new gig that's at a chiropractor joint and it's also building a sales team, can I say that, that skills going to transfer.
I have high confidence that I'll be successful in this thing.
That would make sense for me.
14:46
If I had built 6 sales teams over my career, I'd probably be even more confident, right?
And so The thing is is like if I'm listening to this.
Borrowing confidence from another experience in my life.
And so the the the problem is what do you do when you're at zero, when you're like, I'm not confident I haven't done anything good, right?
15:04
I've got I've got no achievements to my name, etc.
I think that you're delusional because it's like if you were able, like all you have to do is chunk down and think okay, well, what did I, what did I do?
Like let's be real, what did I do today that was good while I woke up?
Okay.
Cool.
I got out of bed.
Okay.
15:19
Well, I showed up to work on time.
OK, so I'm punctual.
You know what?
I always show up to work on time.
That's OK.
I do do that, right?
And I respond to things pretty quick.
OK.
I do.
So I'm responsive.
So it's you chunk down until you're like, OK, what things can I say that I have proof that I'm good at?
And then those become things that you can stack on top of one other because it's not delusional because let's say, let's say mom says you're not, you're blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
15:42
But you're like, no, no, no, no, I hear you, but I have proof.
So like I get you have your opinion, I have facts, and so my goal in life has always been to stack as much proof as I possibly can to support that I am who I say I am.
Even if you have to embellish a little bit of that proof, right?
15:58
Like even if you say, I know I only did it this level, but that same thing could get compounded 10 times.
It just I didn't have the eyeballs yet, or I didn't have the experience or the time or the time.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I love that thought.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
16:15
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check on my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free to check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show.
16:33
And so that was that was that's always been my goal was like, can I, can I stack enough evidence to give enough proof that I am who I say I am.
And then, so let me ask you, when you want to make a decision, if you stacking up proof, you look at the evidence and you say I'm going to be pragmatic and say I did it here, I'm going to do it here, what keeps you moving forward with that decision?
16:53
When you make a decision, I'm asking you, when you make a decision, you just go, no matter what.
Do you burn the boats or you one step at a time.
This is proving itself because I just know one thing.
There, there's a middle ground between burning the boats and tipping, dipping your foot in, right?
17:09
Take the island, burn the boats.
Or let me just put my foot in the water and see there's a middle ground.
But I see sometimes where people are, they don't realize.
I know we're going off in a different direction, but I think this is really important.
They don't realize deep down they're waiting for it not to work.
They're pretending they're moving forward, but they're actually looking for evidence of it not working.
17:27
So they could say, see, Alex wasn't a great partner or Bob's not that into it or nobody 50 years old wants to lose weight.
They don't care like they're they don't realize it's like when you're sick and you Google it and like, I do have a fucking tumor, right?
You're not looking for.
No, it's a headache.
Take a time, right.
17:43
So how can we help people realize that you you can't?
You can't go into if you decide I'm going to be pragmatic because I have proof, I have past experience, I'm going to do it.
Yes, you want to test, but you gotta go in looking for the right outcome.
It's a really tough cuz like, I see this even.
18:03
And you know what?
And this is everyone who's listening.
It happens at every level, every level.
I talked to founders who are doing $100 million a year, and I'm like, well, have you tried this?
And they're like, yeah, we tried that.
I'm like, I've tried this.
And they're like, oh, we tried that.
I tried this.
Oh, we tried that.
And I'll name six other things.
And I'm like, oh, OK, you're right.
18:19
You're screwed.
You're just never going to succeed.
And I want to say, like, that they're like, well, and I'm like, well, which is it.
And all of a sudden because, like, some people like to be contrarian because of, like, that's their nature.
They just want to disagree.
They want to prove it wrong.
They want to buy the course, attend the workshop and then prove that they're a special snowflake.
18:36
And I think you just look at, like you can look at yourself in the mirror and be like, you're right, you are a special stuff like you are never going to succeed.
Now what?
And I think on some level if you get, if you, if you get to that point, then it's like, well, you have nothing to lose.
And I think in some ways that makes you more dangerous than anyone.
18:54
Yeah.
And it's, it's funny because like it's all about how you frame the position, right.
And I used to tell because we had a big friend was listening like we had a big gym licensing company.
So we had thousands of locations and people would try and come into space and be like, well, how am I gonna compete with you.
19:10
You've got this big brand, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And I was like, you don't realize the advantage you have because.
And I'm gonna, I'm gonna wrap this up to the point I was like, if you were if I were you and I'm coming up against me, I'm gonna say you're never gonna see Alex.
Alex is never gonna, is never gonna help you with your gym is never gonna do XY&Z.
19:26
You're just a number to him.
He's got this massive thing to me.
You're gonna get me.
It's gonna be personalized.
I'm gonna be super responsive.
I was like, that's your position.
I was like, on the flip side, my position is gonna say, I've been doing this for a decade.
I've got more success stories than every single other person put together.
And are you going to trust this kid in his mom's basement who has no track record compared to me?
19:45
Both.
Both positions have advantages.
And so right now The thing is, is that if you're day one, you never get this back, but you get to be underestimated.
And there's no advantage to being overestimated unless you're weak, right?
But right now, no one will see you coming if you have nothing going for you.
20:03
It's another way of saying that you have nothing to lose.
And so it means that you have endless shots on goal, and so you should be the most prone to taking action because there's nothing holding you back.
What do you have?
Nothing.
It's just it's literally just voices in your head from your mom who say that you're not going to win and you say you're right mom and then you keep doing it anyways.
20:21
Yeah, I love In Augmondino's book, I love the World's Greatest Sales.
It's one of my favorite books, and he talks about in one section.
Most people let their mindset control their actions.
What if you let your actions?
Determine your mindset.
Do it when you don't feel like doing it.
20:38
Move forward anyway.
And I think that's the that's the part I want to share today before we get into what's next is how do you get the momentum when you're scared?
It's the uncomfortable action like.
And I would just say it's whatever it takes to get you to move forward.
If it's saying thank you for the, the, the, the telling me I'm not going to make it, I'm an underdog.
20:56
That means no one will see me coming.
I must do it anyway.
Like whatever it takes for you to move forward we must.
And and I think that's why I love these conversations because each thing will impact.
Somebody says today's enough.
Today's the day where I'm not settling.
Today's day I will say yes.
I will say no.
21:12
I will move forward.
One thing before we move forward, I want to ask you is.
Hey dude, you're in amazing shape.
I worked out with you.
It's really difficult to work out with you.
You're so freaking ripped.
You you've sold your company, you're buying other companies.
You decided to go on social media, dude, it's been fun watching you skyrocketed to the top.
21:29
You're all over the place, which is awesome.
What's one thing no one would know that still makes you scared at night when no one's around?
Because most people think when they see success that you've killed all the demons.
There's no Dragons left to slay.
Yeah, but is there still something that goes, man, I could go broke or this could go wrong or I'm not good enough or I think it has.
21:54
Obviously, I think it shifts over.
Time it does, I think.
And I think the answer, if you'd asked me a year ago, would have been different than it is right now.
But The thing is that keeps me up is not being good enough to accomplish what my dreams are now.
So like I there's there's I I my dreams have expanded because of the proof that I have now.
22:14
So now it's like I'm setting goal posts that are bigger than I can really imagine and my fear is getting to the end of my life and not having accomplished those.
And then thing like I guess I wasn't good enough to do that thing.
And I think that like, and I think I've had a little bit of time to be like, all right, is that really, you know, And I, you know, I play the mental game with myself, but I would say on some level that's still a thing that that keeps me up.
22:38
And the reason I ask you that is because I have similar figures and no one would ever think that.
And it doesn't mean it should stop you from moving, for it doesn't stop you.
You still get up every day.
You still love what you do, you still move forward.
You still make mistakes, you still have some fears, you still wake up, some mornings go, what the hell am I doing right?
22:54
Isn't enough is that that when you sold your last company, you could have been done.
You and Layla could be doing whatever you wanted.
You went right back in investing the money and buying companies.
So what you just said about taking the action anyway, right.
I think that going back to what we were saying earlier about giving yourself that proof that evidence, it's like all you have to do is get the first piece of evidence.
23:16
And so it's like if you just take one action, then you can start labeling yourself as, like I am somebody who takes action because I have this proof right here.
And so it's it's just stacking.
And then you stack two or three of those and you're like, you know what, I'm on a streak and they're like I am the type of person who does these things because and you said the mindset preceding the action, right.
23:34
This is the this is the point that I was I was trying to get to.
If the actions lead to the mindset, then it means that the actions give you the evidence of the mindset you should have.
And so it's.
A really good point, right?
And so that gives like the actions become your evidence.
And so if you're like, well, I have no evidence, then it's like then you can make evidence.
23:52
And that's how.
And guess what?
That's how everyone else did it.
What do they say about entrepreneurs?
You make shit up and make it real.
Yeah, right.
I mean that's that's really what we do and we end to fuel.
That is the is the evidence.
You know if if anybody could see our, it's funny.
It's kind of like we have.
Fun alter egos.
24:08
Sometimes when we text the insecurities, I'm going broke.
I'm I'm done.
It's over.
Can I borrow money?
We we had this joke about that we help each other whenever we can when it comes to our businesses.
Just simple stuff when we brainstorm.
And I said, hey, if you sell your company for that much money, I want everything to the right of the decimal and I still have the check.
24:27
I think you sent me a check for $0.46.
It was it was awesome.
I was hoping for $0.99 but as we joke, there is truth in everything, right?
We joke, Oh my God, you know what if what if the the dollar collapses?
What if this country keeps the media and politicians keep making us think we should hate each other.
24:47
And we're so polarized that we're not focusing on the big price.
We're worried about the little things when other countries are exponentially growing and other companies starving.
Like like there's there's so many things that we're distracted with it and right now people have a lot of worries.
Are we going in to a recession?
25:04
Could it be a depression?
Could the dollar actually be replaced in 20 years, 50 years, two years?
I don't right these.
Some people are thinking I don't even that's I don't care about that and some people are worried every day about it.
But there's so many things right now that are have been uncertain, especially since COVID happened three years ago.
25:25
You know, it's like the rules of the game seem to be changing and I think it's caused this level of uncertainty and fear.
That I, again, I said earlier, if when you're under pressure, you kind of resort back.
Sometimes when you're in your pressure you freeze.
25:41
So I don't want to get into if the dollar is going to collapse and if we should invest in crypto or gold or real estate or companies or T-bills that that could go.
We could, we could spend days on that, I know.
But how do you get people?
How would you suggest people get clarity to navigate through this?
26:00
That's kind of the upstream question.
It's a big question, but wherever I go now, it depends on where somebody is and what their economics are.
But most questions people will first say is, Dean, what should I do in my cash or can I actually make cash right now or should I actually want dollars?
Should I invest in India and China?
26:15
But upstream, how do you get people to get out of that uncertainty mode so they can make clear decisions?
So I I have a couple mental exercises that I actually go through for this and so I try and reframe reality in a couple of ways.
One of them is I try and play out the absolute hypothetical worst scenario, right?
26:33
And so the worst scenario is I die okay.
Then I won't be worried about it because I'll be dead, right?
It won't affect me okay.
So like 1 degree less than that it's like okay.
Well, what if I go like I'm deduced to that I have absolutely nothing.
It's like okay.
Well, real talk.
26:48
There are homeless kitchens and there are places that I could crash and eat and whatever.
I'm like okay so I probably won't starve.
So I actually probably won't die in the actual worst case scenario.
And when you look at people for subjective wellbeing in poorer countries, there's often people who are happier on average than us in the US.
27:06
And so I think I reframe it as like what problem are we solving?
And so if it's like, well, I'm worried about a I, is it going to take my job and and will I lose all the money?
It's like, well, you'll probably be just about as happy and unhappy as you are right now because all of those things presuppose a single assumption, which is that your circumstances dictate your mood or your happiness.
27:31
And so if and and you, all you have to do is listen to, you know, anybody who's made lots of whatever, whatever The thing is for you, they got the Grammy, they made the movie that whatever it is, right?
They all get there and they're like, it didn't make me any happier.
Right.
And so we asked these questions about what if all these circumstances change.
27:50
But it has an underlying assumption that because the circumstances change, I'm going to become less happy.
And that's what our fear comes from.
But if we disconnect our circumstances because if Victor Frockel in the Holocaust, and I think about these examples because, like I try and think of hypothetical extremes or like the millions of people who've been slaves in general across countries across time periods, they all somehow actually managed to have kids survive, you know, like and keep doing.
28:20
And don't be wrong.
I'm saying it's horrible, but I use it as an example of how bad circumstances can be.
And yet humans continue to survive.
And so the the problem mind right will always find new things to look at.
28:36
Because it wants to keep you alive, right, Because that's its objective, but it doesn't want to keep you happy.
And so if we can just simply break the connection of the underlying assumption that whatever happens, whether it's the dollar or the yen or AI takes over the world, cuz I I genuinely think I'm like, well, if AI takes completely over everything I'm like, then my 401K doesn't matter too much, right?
28:58
Right.
So like, I worry about these things that in the hypothetical extreme that I'm also worried about wouldn't matter.
And in my opinion, I'll probably be just as happy or as unhappy as I am right now or as I have evolved in my awareness, which will be disconnected from outside circumstance.
29:15
And so that's.
And that's why I asked you cuz I know so many times that we've had conversations.
You have mental models or framework around certain thinking cuz that is so powerful thinking about the worst case scenario.
And if that actually did happen, would you be happier or less happy?
29:32
And the fact of the matter is, I don't think it changes at all.
I'm gonna give you one.
So everybody who's listening to this right now, you remember when you were younger, you were poor and you had nothing.
And guess what?
You still probably think about that as the good old days.
Yeah, true story.
And so, like, why are we so afraid of going back to a scenario that in the future, today we might be in the good old days?
29:51
Yeah, it's like it's a weird mental thing.
And you know, the crazy part about it is if you're living in a future that could go wrong, you're preventing yourself in the present from being all you can be right?
And if you live in the present, saying these might be the good old days, you will take more risk.
30:07
You will have more courage to move forward.
You will make bold, uncomfortable decisions in the moment.
Rather than sitting on your hands hoping things don't go sideways, one of my buddies, my closest friend is a philosopher.
I know that sounds ridiculous, but yeah, that's like pretty much what he does.
And he gave me this frame called the frame of the veteran.
30:25
And so imagine you lose all your money, right?
So it's a terrible thing, right?
Actually, let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I'm going to go micro really quickly.
And then we'll scale it out.
So let's say you're in traffic, right?
And you hate traffic.
Traffic sucks.
Okay.
Well, if you've, if you if you're not in traffic normally and then you're in traffic, it's terrible.
30:43
But if every time you got in the car from here until the day you die, there was always traffic, what would happen?
You would just get used to it, right?
And so you become a veteran.
It's just something that like this is just how it always is.
And so if you can, if your mind can mentally weather itself to get to that point, then it means that you can apply that same frame to this moment that's inconvenient.
31:01
I had this this shirt that I liked a lot and the the my cleaning person like messed it up.
And it sounds ridiculous.
And I thought about this and I was like, well, if every time, and it would just shrunk too much, that's all it was.
And I was like, well, if every time I washed a shirt, it always had this level of shrinking, I was like, what I really care.
31:18
I was like, well, no, I guess not.
I was like, OK.
I'm done with it and that was it.
But like, I just remember that was the first time I ever used the frame of the veteran cuz you just told me.
And then I just got to apply it immediately and so I just give it a shot if you're like really stressing about stuff.
So I love that framework and I always think about.
31:37
I heard Ed my let's say this once.
I always use imagine.
I always thought of imagine meaning the.
The person you could have been at your at the end of your life and my let's, I think he said one time it's like, imagine if God played you a video of the man or the woman you could have been if you would have been bold.
And if if you were at that moment of someone you know God has an iPhone, pulls it out and said, hey Alex, if you weren't so afraid, if you didn't go against what your parents said, if you went and been a doctor, your life would have been okay, but this is who you would have been like.
32:04
Oh my God, what would you wish?
Let me go back and do it again.
Wish granted, right.
If we can put ourselves in that moment, we can give ourselves that wish of saying no, no, this is not one of those things I want to regret at the end.








0:00
Hey, guys, real quick.
So Leila and I are definitely working on our social media presence, if you guys haven't noticed, and we're just breaking down into LinkedIn, all right.
It's not as bad as I thought.
It's actually been pretty awesome so far, and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, go ahead and let's connect and let's rock'n'roll.
0:17
And so I ended up selling the gym for one and 1/2 times more than I quote bought it for, right?
Which I then had the gym pay for it on its own.
And so I basically acquired a cash flowing asset for nothing and then had acquired a cash flowing asset for no money.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
0:36
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I got a message from somebody who said, you know who's dead broke and was like, what do I do all.
0:55
That kind of stuff.
So you absolutely just need skills.
You can have nothing else in your life.
And a beautiful thing is that no government can take it from you.
No person can take your skills from you In a divorce.
Those are always your own, which is something that I don't know, for some reason feels magical to me.
And so one of the things that I've seen as I've kind of moved up, and I'm not saying that arrogantly just, you know, just developed, progressed, whatever, is that the people who I surround myself with now have more money than.
1:21
The people that I surrounded myself when I was earlier on in my career.
And what's ironic is that these people actually spend less money.
They have less desire to spend money, and they find ways to acquire things for less money out of pocket.
And that's always really interesting to me.
1:38
And so right now, I think there's, you know, if you were to look at, quote, investment opportunities, right.
You could invest in buying a house.
So let's say, let's say you've got, I'll do 2 scenarios.
All right.
Let's say you've got $50,000.
All right.
And you're like okay, I'm thinking about buying a house, right.
1:54
And I think for first house, you might only have to put 10% down.
I'm not sure it's 10 or 20, you don't remember.
But anyways, let's just say 10 for sake of whatever.
So 500,000 lower house, all right.
You put 10% down and then you get the mortgage, right.
You get the liability of the mortgage payment every month.
2:11
And let's say that in order for you to save that, you've been making, I don't know, 60 grand a year and you've been saving that for every five years, something like that.
Now let's look at an alternative scenario where you are still making that same amount of money, 60, and you saved up 50.
And instead of buying a house, you have a long conversation with your spouse and you say, or maybe you don't have a spouse, whatever, with yourself and you say, I wonder how much money I could get for this money.
2:38
Ah, interesting, right?
And so you leaf through the businesses that are in your area.
And by the way, the best way to do that is one you should contact, brokers.
Not necessarily to buy a business, but to get an idea of some of the businesses that are in the area and what price ranges look like.
2:54
But if you buy from a broker, you're going to pay retail.
You could definitely negotiate a deal.
And I'll tell you one of the deals that I did that was really good at the end of this.
But anyways, So let's say you, you know, you reach out to some businesses, things that you like or enjoy or feel like you have some specialized knowledge in and you find out that there's a business that's doing, let's say, $250,000 a year in in profit, right?
3:18
And because it's a small local loan business and you're not going to pay retail for it, you get it for 2 1/2 times earnings, right, which would be $625,000 is what a business you might pay for businesses doing $250,000 a year in profit.
3:33
All right, Now here's where it's interesting, right?
So I had an early mentor who taught me this negotiation tactic that I've used pretty much for throughout my entire life since this moment.
And I and I used it in the deal that I'll tell you about in a second, which is agree on price than agree on terms, right?
And so when you would go to, quote, talk to this business, right, there's the price, which you might say cool, you know this business 625.
3:55
And then there's terms, right.
And so the term side, once you've agreed on the price, you negotiate down whatever.
And then you say, OK, well, I'm going to need you to sell our finance, meaning you're not going to pay anything or you're paying them over time, right?
I need you to sell our finance 3/4 of the deal.
4:11
All right.
And so 3/4 of the deal, man, I'm doing some math today, but like 430 ish, 437, whatever, $1000 and they're going to finance that for three years and then on top of that or five years and you can do whatever you want here.
4:27
And then what you have remaining, which would be like in this instance, 200,000 dollars, then you get a note from the bank, right, or SBA loan, which you have a $200,000 loan for it and you put your $50,000 down, right.
So then that would be. 200, so you put 50 which would be 25% of 200,000.
4:44
So I'm going to recap this, 625 is the cost of the business.
You know 437, you get seller finance, meaning you can pay that over time and then you've got $200,000 that you get a loan from the bank.
So what you put $50,000 for.
So if you're thinking about this, the guy who's selling the business, he sells for 6:25, but he's only getting 200,000 upfront, you're only putting 50 of that 200 and you're taking a loan for the rest of it, right?
5:10
And so when you're looking at this, you've now acquired this business that makes $250,000 a year, right.
So you upgraded your income from 60 to 250,000, right.
And within 24 months, all of that income will be yours and maybe hopefully you'll grow it or you'll probably try and work extra hard and take over some of the other positions or to cut out some of the waste etcetera in the business.
5:33
And so that massively speeds you up in life, right.
And if you compare that to.
What it would cost you to start your own business in terms of investment and like existing book of business client lists all the knickknacks you have to buy that you don't even think of zoning permits and all the fees and licenses.
5:51
It's actually pretty decent deal.
I'll tell you one of the deals that I did that was pretty good.
So I had four locations at this point.
This is when I had the gyms and I opened a fifth location.
So the first two locations I opened the first one I think for $40,000.
I mean I put, I didn't, I put as little as I possibly could in this thing.
6:08
And it happened to have been an old gym.
So there was like turf already in, the flooring was already in, it was painted, There was a bunch of things I didn't have to pay for.
So I lucked out there And but the second one, because I thought I was smarter, I put 200.
We put 250,000 into the second location.
And here's the fun thing, it made no more money than the first location.
6:26
Debt, which I always think is hilarious.
So, like, to the undisciplined, everything looks like a spending opportunity.
And so I pretty much would empty my bank account.
And so on my 5th location, my next two locations were corporate locations which are actually pretty cheap which are pretty cool.
Those are good deals.
But the fifth location that I did, I had a gym that went out of business or he not out of business.
6:45
He wanted to uproot cuz his it got divorced or hit some family crisis and so he was looking for someone to buy his gym.
And so it was beautiful.
It had all this equipment that was really expensive in it and I was like man this is like a dream come true.
And so I agreed on price cuz I had my mentor talk me through this.
7:01
I agreed on price which I think was 40,000.
I think it was 40.
Great.
It was 40 or 50.
Think it was.
Yeah.
So that's what I agreed.
And then I was like, cool, I'll pay you over the next year.
And he was like, fair enough.
And so, I mean, he didn't say like that.
We negotiated and then 12 months is what we came to.
7:19
And so, I mean, I try to go for 24 months, but he agreed on 12.
And so the beautiful thing with that was I didn't put any money out of pocket.
So you know, my first year I put 50 grand in the second gym.
I put $250,000 in 5th gym.
Smarter, more experienced.
Me puts no money in.
Right.
7:34
And in the 1st 30 days, we did 51,000 in sales.
So this gym in the 1st 30 days literally paid for itself, period.
Right.
And so this thing that is now kicking off profit, right, every month during this whole period of time.
And then 12 months later, I ended up meeting Russell and telling him how I was doing this stuff.
7:52
And he's like you should be teaching other people how to do what you're doing now.
And so I ended up selling the gym for one and 1/2 times more than I quote bought it for, right?
Which I then had the gym pay for it on its own.
And so I basically acquired a cash flowing asset for nothing and then had acquired a cash flowing asset for no money.
8:10
And so I think about that in light of the original thing that I mentioned was just like I get people who message me all the time, like what happens if I don't have any money, I don't know what to do.
You always have to just get skills or this is just my opinion is that because there's no one who can take them from you, there's no divorce.
There's no government, there's no revolution.
8:26
There's no financial crisis that can ever take your skills from you.
And that's why when entrepreneurs hit zero, they can usually bounce back.
I've done it.
I had $1100 in my bank account at one point at my lowest point after I had six gyms right after this.
So even though I had this experience and it sounds cool, like I messed up.
8:43
And that's why I think I love the saying you only should only have to get rich once.
And that's why people who are wealthy are more risk averse because the downside risk of losing everything is always bigger.
Right.
Like you can reverse 30 years of great decisions with any number multiplied by zero.
8:59
Any number multiplied by zero, you can have a billion dollars.
If you make a bad investment, it goes to 0, right.
And so that's why when people are like, I don't know why you're motivated and I don't know why they're like, it's just there's just always things that can happen, Internet maintenance.
So just being risk reverse is what I have noticed from the people who have the most money is that they actually have way lower risk tolerances than the people who have no money, which is hilarious because it's like.
9:23
The people who have the least amount of money then go buy lottery tickets, which are literally the worst investment you could possibly make, and they consistently invest their money in a terrible investment that has all the downside risk of going to 0.
Whereas the richest people in the world find things that could never go to zero, and they buy them for zero.
9:42
So think about that for a second.
People are using their money.
Poor people use their money to buy things that have virtually guaranteed risk of going to 0.
Right, with tiny risk of upside, right.
Whereas rich people buy stuff for $0.00 that have upside potential, but that doesn't have a billion dollar upside potential.
10:04
They would rather have a guaranteed small return with no risk than a potential for huge return with guaranteed risk.
Think about that.
And it's not like you can shift your perspective on this overnight.
It took me a long time and I still am doing it now and shifting how like as I still get excited about.
10:20
I see these, you know these cryptocurrencies, 20 hexing and stuff, you know, in like a month and I'm like man, that's crazy.
But then I also think, well the downside risk of me going to 0 is far more upsetting to me than me getting 20 times more on some tiny investment that I would make.
10:36
And so I don't do it.
And so anyways, I say all this to say agree on price, agree on terms, try and get something for nothing.
See if you're going to If you're going to make an investment in any kind or you're trying to start a business, there's usually a business that's already for sale or has a motivated seller, an owner who doesn't want to do it anymore, who almost give it to you for free.
10:55
And that's The thing is, when you're new, you're getting so excited, but you're not patient.
That's why you have to have the character traits of being successful before you will see the success.
Because if you have that character trait, you'll look and you'll say, I can take six months because in the next decade of my life, there's no rush.
But me making a good deal or a bad deal of should I put all my investment in this thing or should I be able to get something that makes four times more money for free?
11:18
You can do that.
You can do that.
And I'm telling you, I talk to business owners every day.
I mean, guys making a million, two million, $4,000,000 a year who literally have told me they're like, dude, if someone came today and offered me like guys who are making $1,000,000 a year in profit, like if someone had offered me 200 grand right now, I would take it.
11:35
I just am so tired of this business.
So like, there are.
Opportunities, they're just not listed anywhere.
You just got to look for them, right?
And that's the thing.
No one will do it because it's work.
So, but the good news is that if you have a little bit of work ethic, you can make a tremendous amount of money with very little risk and do it the way the rich people that I know do it.
11:53
So otherwise, have an amazing day keeping.
Awesome.
I'll get you guys something like bye.

0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however, you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Good morning everyone and welcome to the gym shakers podcast, I'm here having a cup of coffee.
Coffee with Charlie, who is aggressively biting my finger.
Charlie's my dog.
0:34
For those of you don't know, he's a tiny little itty bitty dog freely, my wife's dog.
But yeah, he just clings to me.
Anyways, the topic I wanted to bring up today is basically by serving customers.
And I think most people have probably heard a million things on this topic and someone trying to take a little bit of a different approach or at least a more tactical approach.
0:56
One of the things that I've seen within the coaching space and you know, even you Post and content that's out there.
Is that a lot of, you know, gurus and guides or whatever will say like yeah, you've gotta You Gotta Serve your customer the highest ability but why this not that?
It's not true, it is.
But with that is it's kind of like general theory and I just don't see many people like getting Wealthy on that, you know what I mean?
1:19
Like, no one's been like, oh my God, I needed.
I need to serve my clients at a higher level.
Like, do you know what I mean?
Like, they don't think about it like that.
So, the reason that all the guys that we, you know, coach Watch her head like just such an immediate turn around so that like we don't really do much strategy.
1:34
We do a lot of tactics which is like okay wave your Initiation fee ask for referrals if they you're sorry like you know have an Initiation fee and waive it.
If they give you the name of three friends.
It's something that's immediately actionable.
They're like, oh my God.
It's like yeah.
And it multiplies, the effect of all of your paid advertising and they're like, wow, that's awesome.
1:52
And like, yeah, some dates immediately useful.
Is it a strat?
I mean the overarching strategy.
Is get more referrals.
Sure.
But how, you know what I mean?
It's an easy example of just a tactic right versus strategy.
So one of the things here like having a good product or service is obviously really important, but I would go as far to say that.
2:13
If you if you, if you were so sold like you were just like a zealot for your own service and believe it or not, like I've met a lot of gym owners who aren't zealots for their own service.
Like they, you know, they probably wouldn't have their parents work out at their gym.
You don't either they're ashamed of the level of services, some of their trainers will give in some of the sessions and the level of support that they provide.
2:36
And so I would postulate, I would guess that If you like our business was able to blow up.
Once I was just, I mean, I'm like totally in love with our customers, right?
2:53
Like almost like, romantically in love with our customer to everything, we possibly could to serve them.
And so that's the difference between I'll give you a business example and then I'll give you a fitness example.
That's the difference between, you know, saying hey, we want you to run this promo.
3:10
It's, you know, here's the here's the name of it, you should.
You should charge this much for it.
Yeah, send out a few emails, you know, make a Facebook post and I'll be great versus saying, hey this is the promotion.
You're going to run this week.
Here's the five emails.
3:25
Here's how you put it into your autoresponder.
Here's how you segment.
Your audience is each one of those has a video.
Here's the five Facebook.
Post that I want you to make with the images inside of your group.
Here's the text campaign in the text blast that I want to go out to your nurture list and your active clients.
3:42
Here's the landing page.
You're going to push them all to.
Here's the actual poster that's already been done up so that you can print it out and put it inside of your gym in the bathrooms, which is where I recommend doing because that's where everyone sees, and then obviously on the front door.
And then, here's how here's a one-page explanation that you can use during your trainer.
4:00
We call trainer workshops, but your trainer weekly meetings so that you can sell them on the concept of selling it, right?
Like you got to get them on board and then here's the actual workouts that you can do for the program that would recommend.
You can do it on your Obviously, you can come up with your own stuff, but here's one, if you don't feel like thinking about it.
4:17
So like you see the level of like execution difference between like what a traditional, like, oh, no, use quote, Guru do and that.
And that's why most traditional quote gurus have, like one out of 20 people who are successful.
And it's because that person is just a Massive Action taker, right?
4:34
Versus taking all the action on behalf of the customer, right?
And so Fitness example, would be like, kind of what a lot of us are guilty of, right is just saying, like, You know, like you already know how to eat, well like don't eat McDonald's and like just you know, eat some more protein and and and doing that versus and then you know, there's a step above that.
4:52
Some people like have a basic meal plan template and things like that versus saying like, hey what we're going to do is for each week, we're going to come up with a grocery list and we're going to come up with like normal meals, that they're going to be able to eat every single night based on the grocery list that they had, okay?
5:10
And then here's how they can make adjustments for each level of their meal plan.
If there are Or if they had, you know, if they're at 2000 or 2400 or 2800, whatever it is calorie-wise and then go through and do every single piece and then record like was one of those like hands over the bowl type, you know, Facebook videos, each one of those recipes being done each week.
5:30
So that's three different versions.
You got a vegan one.
You've got one that's more like Fishtown.
The other one that's like a regular, like chicken, chicken and beef one.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
5:48
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
6:08
Because last time I sold out for like, Eight straight weeks really fast.
So, that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And you do that for each week of a specific program.
Now, let me ask you this question.
If you went through the effort one of doing that, do you think that people would have better results?
6:27
Yeah, because you did all the thinking for them, like they just need to like freakin press go and just watch your hands and just live their life and then all of a sudden lose weight and get great results, right?
So that's the first thing, you think they would give it a result.
The second thing and I think this is most important for sales which is why I'm gonna Loop this back around with the bottom.
6:45
Line.
If you spent all that time, making that how hard do you think you'd be able to sell that, right?
Like if you know how much work went into this and how good it is because you did it right instead of having to do it twice, right?
Like I don't know if you guys ever had a parent who said that do it right or do it twice but I believe in that.
7:05
And so it's like if you had that level of execution and you'd gone all the way down to the minutiae, there to serve your customer because you were romantically in love with them.
Like You just want to do everything to help them succeed?
Don't you think you'd be able to sell that a lot harder?
I think so.
7:22
And I think that's where a lot of people like, I think a lot of people aren't proud of their product or service.
I think, deep down.
They know that it's not good or not, as good as it should be, you're not even close, right?
I know that definitely the beginning, my gems weren't I don't I wouldn't want to marry squirt my chips but you know, you have to look at it and be honest with yourself, because I can't tell you the amount of Jim's that I get on the phone with her, like we get Eight results of people.
7:47
And like we, you know, we're unique here we're really a family.
I'm like, dude, every single Jim is like that.
That's not make you unique but doing this level of execution for your customers is.
And if you think about it from that standpoint, like how can I like not?
How can I check the box?
And say I did something like, hey, here's our meal plan system Because you ought to look like at the end of the day.
8:08
You're the only one who really knows how good it is, because you're the one who built it, right?
And so you have to convince the hardest person in the world, how good something is and that's yourself.
And if you can convince yourself that what you have is truly amazing because of how much effort you put into it and how many times you've gone through it and ask people, for their feedback.
8:28
Hey, was this clear that?
This makes sense was this a little bit?
Okay, that's that was Fuzzy.
We'll make a new video for that.
You do three, four, five, ten, Raishin Zone that and that product becomes something Untouchable and that's something that can separate you in a Marketplace.
A be your clients will see what level of execution you have.
8:46
And they're going to be like, wow, like these guys freaking execute like this is unbelievable.
I've never seen something that's this detailed.
This, this to the point this easy for me to just plug and play, and get the results that I've been looking for.
Not that I think that results are everything.
9:03
I'll go that and another, and another Another podcast.
But, yeah, that's and and when you have that level of product or service, that's when you can sell your ass off, that's when you can push all the way to like get, you know, pedal to the metal and you can push so hard on the sale because you believed in your, in your loins, you know that this thing is going to help them.
9:23
So if you've ever had any problem with sales or you're like not sure if your product service is amazing, think about it from that level.
Like am I just saying hey you should do XY and z or you actually go to the local.
All Kroger and you buy everything and then you tell them how much that's going to be and you take a picture of the receipt.
9:40
And you say, here's the three types of meals that, you know, weekly plans that you can have, here's the Kroger receipt for each of them.
And then, so that they are literally have the shopping list right there with the brands and everything, and then you making them, you know, breakfast, lunch and dinner, not just one meal, right?
9:58
And that's for three different templates.
Yeah, dude.
That's like a ton of work.
I know it is, but I guarantee you that when you That kind of stuff that's when your clients notice.
And that's when they see that you want to buy from Beyond everyone can make a meal plan template.
Everyone can tell people, just need to eat healthier but you just have to do the work and so you show them.
10:17
Not what but how.
Anyways, have an awesome day.

Hey, what's going on, everyone?
One.
0:30
Happy Monday hope you guys had an amazing weekend or we can do is hopefully as this one was we just finished our gym Lord Summit last week.
And so that's an event that we have.
We had 400 or 450 Jim's, my highest level group that's actually after Jim Lunch, Arjun Motors, group fly out to Austin, to come spend two days basically going over new trends in the industry.
1:00
Prudence the business model, all that kind of fun stuff.
And so it was really really awesome and so I wanted to make a video is totally unrelated to that about Game Theory because after I have a huge event or something like that, I want to like, go and binge like beans to learn.
And so that's what I had this weekend.
1:15
I did like a total beans learning weekend.
I read like a book and a half, and I went through like half of Jordan, Belfort's, closing course.
And anyways, I went through a lot of stuff, so like my mind's a little bit racing but I had a, there's one great.
Video that I watched by, Simon sinek about Game Theory and how it relates to business.
1:37
And I thought it, like, for me, I'm like, geeking out about it.
And it's and it really, really, really has, I would say has fundamentally changed, which is a really strong statement suddenly changed, how I see our business, how I see competitors, and how I kind of see the landscape and if you allow me to share it with you, so, Within the context of Game Theory, there are two types of games.
1:59
There's infinite games and final games, finite games are defined as games where you have known players, fixed rules, and the objective is agreed upon.
All right.
So an example, that would be like baseball.
So, if baseball, you have known players, you got two teams.
2:15
The rules are fixed.
They're not changing rules of baseball.
The same and the objective is to, you know, when the game finishes have more of the other person, right?
Like that's how it works in the Active of finer games is to win.
Okay?
Now the inverse of that is an infinite game and if it's games are I'm like so badly about it.
2:37
Anyways.
So the players are both known and unknown.
The rules are changeable and the outcome is to keep the game going.
Okay, that's the outcome.
2:53
That's the objective, is to continue to play the game.
You.
All right.
So one of them rules.
Our players are known, rules are fixed.
And the outcome is agreed.
Upon the other one players are known and unknown, the rules are changeable and the outcome.
And the goal is to keep the game going.
Now, we're this is, here's an example of the infinite game.
3:11
So, the u.s., when they were fighting Vietnam was, we went in to go and win, right?
The Vietnamese we're playing, Stay Alive to keep the game going, right?
And so what happens?
Is that when you have eight, a finite player versus a finite player like baseball, the outcome is stable to stable system, if you have an infinite player against an infinite player like us with Russia in the Cold War.
3:43
So here's example, there you have two players, the reason what happens is the only reason people stopped playing and into the game as if they run out of resources where they run out of the will to keep I know.
Okay.
And so in this case, Russia ran out of the resources to continue.
You play.
And then the game finished we didn't necessarily be true.
3:59
Sir, they stopped playing.
There's a difference, right?
And so if you have to infinite game players or to find out main players became stable.
Now here's where it gets really interesting.
At least for me, I think it's exciting.
Is that when you pit a finite player versus an infinite player, the game is unstable.
4:17
And so that's exactly what happened, for example, with the u.s. invaded Vietnam, right?
So we came in to win if you need These came to stay alive.
And so what happened there is that like there are much smaller player, right?
But because they were playing a different game.
4:34
We ran out of the resources through will to continue, right?
Same thing happen with Russia when they invaded Afghanistan, right?
When they went in, to take out the mujahideen they came in, they tried to win the mujahideen.
Just wanted to keep fighting as long as they could, and then eventually rushing game, ran out of the world of resources.
4:52
Continue.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
5:08
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Now why I think this is so awesome.
5:25
It's so interesting.
Is that when you look at business, all right, from the context of finite versus in games, a lot of us, myself included.
Sometimes we fall into the finite game mentality and that's mostly because that's what we were raised on, right?
5:41
We're raised on a finite beam system which is like get an egg score more goals.
Whatever.
Right.
And so a lot of times we will measure ourselves well like with revenue or whatever and like will try and say my son.
If included some correcting myself here, I was like we want to be number one, right?
But the reality is under what?
5:58
Like, there's no agreed upon objective.
Like I say, we're number one in what revenue or you want to talk about profit?
Or do you want to talk about, honey, please, you have or in terms of how much square footage you have, under management, whatever, right?
There's so many different contexts that it doesn't.
It's just arbitrary, right?
6:14
It's just like you're picking something out of thin air, which means like the whole number one thing is really just for ourselves.
And at the end of the day, who really cares.
Because even if you were number one, Your own Concepts that you arbitrarily created for how long.
Right?
And so, the game of business is not a finite game, despite the fact that a lot of us in a lot of players in the space, clay, the finite game, but actually an infant again.
6:36
And the objectives is be playing, right?
And so if you can shift your perspective, and then this is why it's like it's totally taken on my entire weekend of like thought.
Oh my God, oh my God, this is awesome.
What it does is funding lishus how you business because if the goal is to keep to stay in the game, It really shifts from like playing doubt lasting right.
6:57
And why I think it's it's like a fundamental switches that for me, I'm super super competitive.
And what this these this kind of game constructed for me is that it redefined what winning was right?
And because I like, you know, just like a lot of people watching this right now like you probably like to win, right?
7:14
I mean you're competitive your business owners remember like we like to win and so for me, realizing that I would never win.
But the goal was to keep playing has given me this like really amazing amount of Peace about how to run the business and then really how to forecast decisions in to talk about, like where we're going, what we're going to do and not like not at all.
7:34
Think about the short term because like if we have to do, let's say we have to go buy a huge warehouse and filled up with supplements or something, right?
Like and there's a huge cost investment for us.
You can look in the six month or 12 of winter.
Be like, oh, wow, you know, this is going to cost us a lot.
But if you're looking at a 50 year window, right?
7:51
The game changes Right?
Because if you think it's going to position you want to succeed.
It also changes how you do have some service, it changes how you manage your reputation, because if the go and like it, also, what it does is it takes the rush out of the game and really just forces you, but one piece and play, and then the next piece and the next piece and the next piece and build on it slowly.
8:10
Because if you're building it to last, rather than just trying to set up, I'm trying to Outsource my gym as fast as possible, right.
I get it but it's also not necessarily the the the wisest game to play, right?
Like in for me, I'm We're like, let's do it all this gold stolen.
Probably, like a lot of you, but like, if you can reframe that, it just totally takes off the self-imposed pressure of, like, I have to do this tomorrow.
8:31
And the question is why, and what happens is, a lot of times, what we do is we make decisions, we go too fast, and the team can't catch up.
And we end up blowing up a whole bunch of stuff and then suffering as a result in the business suffers the customer suffer cetera.
It's because we're operating under a finite construct, instead of an infinite contract and so I hope you guys found that is interesting.
8:52
As I do, I think it's really, really fascinating.
I'll probably be doing more talks like in relation to this because I think the concept is like so applicable.
Because the same thing works with Fitness, right?
You want to have an in-flight, people go in because they're trying to like lose certain amount of where do they come in?
9:08
Because they're trying to like achieve a certain body.
But the real question is like, then one, right?
So there are always finite games within it if the game but if the reality is that like the goal of Fitness we could keep playing right, steam game, then you probably train a Ittle bit differently, probably training like, okay, it's really don't wanna get hurt.
9:25
Try not to get injured, you know, I mean, have a long trip with do everything.
Enjoy, this is a sustainable, right?
From a diets competitive from from your trip from an exercise protective, you think differently about it when the goal is to outlast, right?
And so another like another place that this could totally just is like love, right?
9:41
So marriage.
It's not like no one's like, wow, that's an achievement.
Like, you felt like I fell in love.
I fell in.
Love, like, no one cares, right?
It's like, okay, well, great you fall in love.
The point is Whether you can stay in love right?
The game is to Outlast the game is to keep playing the game.
9:58
That's the goal and so I think it seems like it's super fascinating to me.
I hope you guys found it, interesting?
As interesting as I do, and if not either way, I would be had have an amazing motivational Monday, and for my gym Lords, lots of love, keep being awesome.
10:14
And for those of you who this group, welcome to the group and Gore gym owner, I'm sure there's a link somewhere that I could show you how to apply to work with us.
You're interested in that something, otherwise, it's a joke, but it was have an awesome day, guys, and lots of love.







0:00
Real quick guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
0:19
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I cannot tell you the amount of times we're biting my lip and not talking smack has made me a lot of money because of deals that I was able to make with people that were 1 degree connected from someone I did not like.
0:45
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
The hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I'm making this because it was on my mind and I was like, you know what?
1:04
Might as well just get it out rather than keep it in so grace in business.
So over the last, you know, four years, I'm going to talk about a couple things that I think will be useful for you.
There have been a lot of people that have talked shit about me.
1:21
There have been a lot of people who've taken public stances against me.
And a lot of those people I have helped a tremendous amount and have beautiful testimonial videos to support them in tears about how we, you know, save their business later coming out and saying those things.
1:39
So one of the lessons that I've learned is to have grace in business, and not just because of the whole human element.
We're going to put that on pause for a second, but just for business reasons.
Because one thing that I've learned is that burning bridges makes you no more money.
1:56
You cannot make any money from a bridge that's you can make a money from a bridge that's been respectfully, you know, walked away from.
And there's even ways to say that you disagree with someone without burning the bridge.
Be like, I totally understand what they have going on there.
2:13
We do things differently.
But I can appreciate that everyone has their own way.
That's how if someone asked me about a different.
Method or system, I'll typically respond and you guys have seen me take apart different things that I don't agree with.
I'm like and here's why that I don't think it makes sense.
You know, math, just math wise, you know, independent of the person is just trying to separate the idea or the concept from the person when you're making remarks.
2:35
Because here's what happens when you Fast forward.
I've had multiple of these people who have been publicly against me, right?
Talking lots of shit now.
Come ask if they can try and resell my products, Right.
2:51
What do you think?
Right.
Like what?
What happens now?
Like, like what kind of position you put yourself in?
Now, if you approach, you know, those types of relationships that you have in your life, like with grace, I'm not saying you're going to agree with everyone.
You know what I mean?
3:07
You're not, of course you're not.
You're human, right?
But the way that you do things matters just as much, if not more, than what you actually do.
Right.
Like, two people can just stop doing business with the business.
But one person can make such a huge fuss about it that the person who owns that business never wants to see their face again, Right?
3:24
But no one might know that, depending on how that person carries themselves.
And she.
I was going to give you an example.
So let me flip the tables for a moment.
Let's say you walk into a restaurant, right?
You walk into a restaurant and the Hostess has a scowl on her face.
3:41
She's not looking, you know, she's like.
It doesn't look like she's having a good day.
She's like, hi, do you want a table?
And you're like, yeah, I was just hoping to be seated if.
And then she doesn't even look or say anything.
It just walks away and you're like, is she getting us a table or do we need to sit down?
3:58
And then she comes back and says and then grabs 2 menus and just says this way and you're like, oh, OK, got it.
All right.
And you sit down and all of a sudden your entire experience has been totally shifted by this first person, right?
And now you know, you leave and you're like the food is okay.
4:15
Staff is really crappy here.
Like, you know, two star review.
Now let's replace the word front Hostess right at that restaurant with your front desk girl or your trainer at your gym.
Up to that point, you're like, yeah, you know what, That business probably didn't.
4:34
You know that business, that business sucked.
Now we all have businesses.
And we all have employees who don't follow the fucking script, right?
You're like, smile like say hi, pretend like you want to be here, right?
And sometimes use a business owner aren't there.
4:51
And so sometimes your business wrongs people, because the employees that you have are human and they will make mistakes.
And you are human.
And you will make mistakes too, because all businesses are imperfect, because they're based on humans who are also imperfect.
5:10
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, showed it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ass is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
5:29
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so I always like to have that perspective when doing business with anyone in general, because if I am wrong or I feel like the service that I received was poor, I think to myself, I wonder if the owner of this business had this intention for me.
5:52
My guess is probably not.
So the strategy was not to be a malicious business and trying to ruin people's day.
The strategy was probably to do a good job.
It was just poorly executed.
And I think if you can approach situations that you might have this initial desire to lash out and say negative things and you remember that it's a human that like you're dealing with.
6:13
And a business is comprised of humans who feed families and have kids and have boyfriends that break up with them and have family issues and also and wake up and have bad days.
I think it will give you more patience and I think it will allow you to have more grace and I've tried to approach a lot of things in our business career.
6:31
And I cannot tell you the amount of times we're biting my lip and not talking smack has made me a lot of money because of deals that I was able to make with people that were 1 degree connected from someone I did not like.
Right now, if I had smashed this person right publicly, they would tell the person that I wanted to make the deal with that I was a douche and then that would have been it.
6:55
And so I can just say that being a Dick does not make you more money.
And so it is the economical choice to have grace in business in general because those people may come back to you or you may come back to them and need something from them in the future.
7:13
And if you burn that bridge, you cannot walk across it again.
So just something that I thought I would share.
For me, it's kind of funny being on the other side of it, but just for anybody who's in those world, like when you get in that kind of negative space, just keep it to yourself, you know what I mean?
7:28
Just like, just take it in and think.
Did this person mean to do this right?
What's this experience that I had the intention of the owner, right?
And I think when you can do that and works out with everyone's business.
Now, obviously you as a business owner, you always want to correct that because no one's going to give you grace, right?
7:45
You're going to expect that everyone's going to treat you horribly and make first impressions.
But still, if we can be a little bit more patient and have a little bit more perspective than the average person, and we should, because we're business owners, for God's sake.
You know what I mean?
Like you see, waitresses always tip really well to people.
8:01
Whoever.
Like waitress.
Like, I was in.
I was in.
Shoot, what is it?
Food services.
There's a word for it.
Like, I always tip all We're business owners.
We should tip well in business, right?
By treating other business owners well.
Because every other business owners are the same shit.
8:17
You are, right?
Like employees dealing, doing stupid stuff.
You know what I mean?
Not following instructions, like filing ridiculous claims.
You know what I mean?
Just.
All the stuff that we have to deal with on a regular basis, clients being crazy, right, We all deal with it.
8:32
And so I guess all of this is say, is that like you have the option one way we'll make you more money and we'll and we'll probably retain your reputation and the other way will only cast you as a person who has negative things to say and all that people ever remember and you guys have probably heard this.
8:53
Is No one remembers what the negative person says or even who they're saying it about, but they just remember that what they are saying was negative and so then you become associated with the negativity.
So just figured I'd share is on my mind, I hope.
9:09
I hope someone doesn't talk shit about someone else.
Or one of you goes into a restaurant and then leaves a review.
That's a 5 star review.
That's nice.
Or leaves a 5 star review that says hey.
To the owner, this was really messed up.
Please feel free, like respond to me and then I'll delete this.
9:27
Rather than leaving you a one star.
Like you know, probably doing something like that might actually make a business owner's day.
Imagine a business owner do that to you.
You're probably pretty pretty bumped about it.
So anyways, I hope.
I hope that's a little something.
It was on my mind and I figured I'd share it before I went to bed cuz it was just it was brewing.
9:42
So don't burn bridges.
Do the right thing.








0:00
In this video, I'm going to give you three ways to.
Guarantee that people do not do what you want them to do, especially employees in a business.
Everyone of us every day has tried to influence people internally in the business to do things that we want them to do.
We try to influence them with money.
We try to influence them with praise and accolades.
Come with a big vision so that they get internally motivated to do the stuff.
0:15
But some people don't do it.
And so in this video, what I want to do is breakdown the three best ways to guarantee that no one does what you want them to do.
You can take this process and you can reverse it if you want them to do what you want them to do.
But if we think about the things that we can do to get them to not want to do what we want them to do.
Then it's much funnier from the top.
0:31
The easiest way to make sure that they do not do what you want them to do is don't tell them.
Don't communicate the expectation.
Don't even let them know that you want them to do it.
If you even do, let them know that you want to do it.
Make sure you don't record it.
Because if you just say it in passing or say it on a conversation or a zoom call and it's not written anywhere, you can still virtually guarantee that they're not going to do it, especially if you don't repeat it.
0:50
Don't ask about it frequently.
One line item on a quarterly report that happens versus you checking in twice a day about a statistic like if you do that, they're definitely going to think it's important.
So don't do that.
Just try.
Want to ask for it as infrequently as possible?
Even so, not even give them the metric to track.
So that's number one.
1:05
Number two is make sure they don't know how to do it.
So if you want them to do something, give them the task that's clearly communicated.
You repeated it, You did it in a recorded fashion, You do it frequently In terms of how frequently, ask them, but then just make sure they don't know how to do it.
It's the best way to set them up to fail.
Don't train them around what you want them to do in general.
1:22
Don't train them on how to prioritize their time so that they can get it done given their workload.
And then also make sure that you don't tell them how you specifically like it done.
Because everybody has preferences, right?
Just make sure you don't train them on any of those things.
First two items in the triangle, Alex, is how to make sure people don't do what you want them to do.
1:37
Triangle.
The third piece of this triangle.
All right, this is this is a killer motivation.
We want to make sure that they are as unmotivated as humanly possible, and maybe even ideally motivated or incentivized to not do it.
A couple ways you can do that is one don't pay them or directly compensate them for doing it. #2 You want the work to feel as pointless as possible.
1:57
You want them to feel like they're digging a hole, only to push the dirt back in at the end of the day, and then have no one there to even see that they did it.
You want to definitely not praise them for digging a good hole, and then not actually show them that that hole is how you lay pipe.
How you lay electrical lines to turn a building on?
2:16
Geez, I'm just, I'm just killing it right now.
You don't want to show how it benefits other people that they care about within the company.
So for example, if I said, hey John, I need you to put the call notes in from your sales call because Susie in finance, it makes her life five times harder to have to go through all this stuff.
And she can't be with her kid because she's working overtime taking all these calls, trying to glean all this data, going through customer support logs to fill in the blanks that you could do in 5 minutes.
2:39
And I know that you're the type of person.
So we went from purpose.
Other people they.
About to Now we're going to talk about their own self-interest, which is like, I know you're the type of person who is honest, right?
Of course.
Well, you wouldn't promise something that's not real, right?
OK Well, what you're doing right now, you might not know.
It is that you're not giving us the notes to actually fulfill the promises you're making.
So I peel the values and then you can also appeal to self-interest in the most tangible way you make more money by doing this.
2:58
When you do this thing, it actually helps us sort through the applications so you can close a higher percentage of people at higher prices.
So you make more money per hour if you take these 5 minutes.
Does that make sense?
Cool.
And on top of that, there's a little nugget on your bonuses according to making sure that you fill out call notes for over 95% of sales calls.
3:13
If we did that, we'd have a high likely that they would do it.
So you want to reverse that whole equation when you're thinking about having a lens to which to have the conversation with somebody who's not doing the things that you want them to do.
This is how I would approach it.
This is the scripting.
I got this from Leila.
All kudos go to her.
She has a great YouTube channel.
You should check it out is say, hey Johnny, it's not like you to not attend to the details.
3:31
Is it that you didn't know you don't know how or is it that you don't want to?
One, we protected the person's ego because we said it's not like you.
So I'm not attacking you, I'm attacking the activity.
It's this tiny little shift that makes these conversations so much easier.
Then you give them a context through which that they can reply, Is it that you didn't know?
I didn't tell you, I didn't record it, I didn't talk about it frequently and I didn't give you the metrics.
3:49
Is that what it is or is it that training wise I didn't train you on how to do it, how I want you to do it and how to do it within the context of your larger workload?
Or is it the things that I just covered with motivation, motivation and training?
I stole from Andy Grove ruthlessly a founder of Intel and he wrote a book called High up of Management recommend A little bit advanced and in that book he says the.
4:05
The bosses 2 things to motivate and train.
In his mind, he's that either someone doesn't want to do it or they don't know how to do it.
I add in the third piece, which is that they didn't know that you wanted to do it to begin with, which I think happens a lot.
And so that has given birth to the acquisition triangle of how to get people to not do the things that you want them to do.
On the flip side, you can reverse those things and make sure that you set expectations.
4:22
You record it, you talk about it frequently, you give them the metrics to talk about it, about train them on how to do it, you train them how you prefer they do it, and then you train them on how to do it within the context of the larger workload they have.
And then you motivate them from a global level of how this feeds the business the other.
People that care about employees on how it impacts their life in a real way, how it's going to help the customer and their experience from a values perspective.
4:41
You are this way and by doing this you are aligning with these values that are true to you and then finally you will align to their pocketbook.
Hey, and if you do these things you can get a $500 bonus, right?
Or $1000 bonus, whatever it is.








0:00
Conviction is the #1 secret ingredient to sales, is that you actually have to believe in the things that the first person you always have to sell as yourself and most people actually aren't sold. #1 #2 is that conviction itself is not binary.
It's not Do you believe or do you not believe?
It's how much do you believe?
How deep do you believe?
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:24
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
All right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna switch.
Completely here.
Love this conversation.
Sales influence, impact, you know, persuasion, whatever you want to call it.
0:41
So many businesses, no matter if you're 2 employees, 200, 2005, 5000 a year to 50 million a year.
Every company needs focus.
Exponential growth, shifting evolution, innovation in their marketing and sales.
But so many startups and people launching their business, not only they apprehensive, they could be apprehensive to sales.
1:04
They could be They they we're in a I feel we are in a in an error where sales is considered bad when it's simultaneously it is the oxygen for every successful business that exists.
I've fallen in love with selling because of impact and have converted to service in your life your evolution of sales.
1:27
What has been the biggest lift?
How have you fallen in love with sales?
You're amazing at what you do.
You provide an incredible product and everything you do.
What drives you and what could drive others to fall in love with sales through your lens?
So I see sales as helping the person you're speaking to realize that they are in power.
1:48
And the three things like if we like, you know, the more you sell, the more you hear the same excuses, right.
And so in a lot of ways, selling is the first conversation to helping someone make decisions to help themselves.
And so there are three major buckets that that people use to blame, right.
2:07
We said earlier about the where the finger blame goes, so does the power.
And so the the widest area of this is think about it like an onion, right?
This is the best analogy I can give.
The outer layer is circumstances.
So they're going to blame money.
They're going to blame time.
They're going to blame some particular aspect of the thing that they're buying That's not perfect for them, whatever it is, right?
2:27
But that's the first layer.
Underneath of that, they're going to blame other people.
They're going to blame their partner, their spouse, their kids, their wife, their coworkers or whatever, right?
That's the second layer.
And then the final layer is that you have somebody.
So if if I, if I make you realize like okay, well, the difference between selfmade millionaires and you is that you both started at 0.
2:44
So what's the difference?
They decided to do something right all of a sudden, like, like, you can, you can start breaking down each of these beliefs.
And with other people, it's like, I'll give you a common one.
It's like my spouse, right?
My spouse won't let me do this.
It's like, okay, well, let's play it out.
Well, if every time you want to make these decisions that are going to help yourself.
3:01
And every time your spouse says no, three years from now, I was like, how are you guys going to feel?
So, like, I'll you probably resent your spouse because they've held you back this whole time.
And So what happens is you're actually giving your spouse the responsibility over your success in life.
That's not fair to them.
3:17
It's not fair to them, not fair to your marriage.
I was like, so you're literally you're planting the seeds right now for a resentment tree to grow later.
And So what I think you want is.
You're thinking you need permission, but what you actually need to support.
I love those two layers.
And what's the center piece?
3:33
The center layer is avoidance.
So now you're talking to a person in power.
So it's like okay, it's not the time, it's not the money, it's.
Someone else.
It's not, Yeah.
It's not other people.
What they try and then do is like, I'm going to think about it, I'm not sure right.
It's avoidance.
Now we could get into like is it shame, is it fear, is it self doubt?
3:52
Like whatever it is.
All I know is that they avoid the decision that I can observe.
They avoid the decision.
They just try they.
And so at this point, we then, at least if I'm trying to sell something to someone or trying to help someone make a decision, I help them make the decision, which is, well, what would it take in order for you to feel good about this?
4:11
And at what point is it unreasonable for you to not believe that this would work?
And so this is like, for example, if I had, it's because I sold a zillion gym memberships back in my day.
If I said if someone's like, well, I'm just not, I need to think about it, I'm like, cool.
Well, what are the main things that you used to make the decision?
4:29
And the reality is that you think you need that, right?
You think you need time.
What would you really want is information.
And so we conflate time for information.
So if I have more time, I must get more information.
I was like, but I'm your only source of information.
I was like, so what's your main concern?
And let me give you that information, right.
And sometimes you just ask like and like.
4:45
There's a lot of different ways of asking the same thing, but just saying like, what's the thing you don't want to have happen?
If you do this, what are you afraid of having happen?
Wow, so good.
And a lot of times it just pierces right to the point where, like, I just don't want to buy another thing and have my husband yell at me.
Right.
5:00
And you're like real piece, right?
And then you're like, I got it, I feel you.
I was like, So what if we do this and like and then you and then you can now you actually.
Just have a real conversation.
Now we're not smokescreening.
We're actually getting to the real stuff.
And The thing is, is that if you have, like, I love this, this quote, I don't remember I heard it, but it was, it was closer to ask hard questions, right.
5:18
And so most people hate sales because they were not sold well.
Like true sales doesn't feel like sales.
It just feels like making an informed decision with somebody who is an expert who helps you make the best decision for you.
Yeah.
And you know what?
And this is what I what I train all the sales people to do.
5:35
I was like, my goal is that you help the person that you're speaking to decide, not that they buy.
Make a decision, even if the decision is absolutely no.
They made a decision, yes, and they walk out, right?
Not the miserable maybe.
Right.
Reasonable.
5:50
Maybe right there, write that one down, right, another year of almost right.
Who wants that?
And so it's like we like and this is again, I've trained a lot of sales teams and whatnot And so I'm like you have to train for no.
You have to expect no.
And this really comes with anything in life is that like if every person you just said, hey, you wanna buy the thing and they said yes, I was like, then you're not required, We could just put up a page and people would just go on Amazon and click buy, right.
6:16
And so we have to expect that the people who are coming to us and I trained a lot of weight loss sales teams, if they could do it on their own, they wouldn't be here.
Right.
So we have to expect that they're going to have some demons in the closet that we got to help.
We, we, like, think about it like this.
You're side by side with them.
6:32
You've got a sword and they don't.
And they're like the monsters are in here and you're like, all right, let's open the doors.
Right.
And, like, that's the role of the salesman.
It's like you can kill these demons in front of them.
You're like, it's not your husband's responsibility.
Right.
It's not the fact that you don't have time because I can promise you there's someone who's had it worse, has done better.
6:49
Yeah.
Right.
And so you can, you can have those real conversations.
And so for me that's where I get passionate about it because I think because real sales.
In in real sales is service.
I mean you're serving that person because if it's a gym membership, they've been putting off getting themselves in shape forever.
And if you quit before you get to the root cause the peeling back the onion to get to the avoidance to the avoidance leads to the root cause of why they're not going to the gym.
7:13
If as a salesperson you got to solve that and they were in the gym, then you did good for the world by selling.
And in every business that I've been a part of, every business I consult with, if that.
Sales is service.
Mindset doesn't exist.
If it's just what is the average ticket, How much are we getting?
7:30
What is that lead worth?
I know that company's not going to make it, but when you and you know this because you're buying companies faster than anyone I've ever seen, when you go into a place where they're heart centered and service oriented and they have an amazing sales floor to get people to take the action, it changes their lives.
7:46
That's a company I put money in, so I'm going to give you guys like the secret, like the real, like the key ingredient to making this work.
And it's not.
It's not, it's not like some words.
It's not because The thing is, is that humans are exceptionally good at at smelling out when someone's lying.
8:03
We've year, we've thousands of years of evolution to see if someone's going to trick you and then, you know, steal your food or whatever.
It is like we're actually really good.
And intuitively like you don't know if someone's lying, but you're like, I just feel off about it, right.
And so there's one thing that I know well, there's two things that can fix it.
One is years and years of training of trying to fix your tonality, pausing at the right time, speaking fast if I really want to get someone really excited or slowing down so that you really pay attention to what I'm saying right now.
8:28
Right?
Like, you can shift how you're feeling.
Like pros can do that because they've trained for it.
But if you're a beginner, there's one thing that's even more powerful than that, which is just you just believe in it.
And so here's my example for you.
Have you ever bought something that you were like, this is amazing, right?
8:43
And when you go to your on, you're like, you got to try these shoes on.
They're so are like I got this new.
Thing that covers, yeah.
And The thing is, is the way you talk about it, that's what gives you conviction.
And I'll, I'll ask a question that might, you know, trigger some people.
But if you've ever met somebody who who found a new religion, right.
8:59
And they're like on fire about the religion, if they say it enough, sometimes the person who believes more, you're like, maybe I'm wrong about this, depending on how convicted they are.
And so the thing that will fix your tone will fix the things that you will say is actually believing in the product.
9:15
And so we see this with sales teams.
And I can tell you I can fix the sales team rather than training them on drilling obstacle overcomes and things like that by simply saying what's happened in the last seven days, 14 days, 30 days that made you believe in this class and solving for that.
9:34
And sometimes there's a legitimate problem with a product or a service, and it's like, we're on it and then we start giving them updates every day of the things that we're doing to solve the problem that they brought up, Right?
Good.
And so it's like we're just fixing the act, like we're getting to the heart of it.
You fall in love with what you're selling, right?
9:49
Because if you don't believe in it, you know what?
You shouldn't sell it.
That's the real like.
If you don't believe in it, you shouldn't sell it.
And the problem is, so many people sell things they don't believe in to make a paycheck, and that's.
Why sales get a bad name exactly?
Yeah when people it's funny.
I I love, I love, I love listening.
10:05
I love being a student and I love hearing this when people say to me how did you guys do the biggest launch how do you so good at sales.
What I always say is because I love what I do so much that I feel bad if they don't get it and and people are always looking.
People say give me the secret to say like just what you said is it the slow down, is it the speed up?
10:22
I've never studied any of that.
I've just fallen in love.
You know, again, back to Augmentino's book, The World's Greatest Salesman.
The second, the most important one is I will meet this day with love.
And he said they might not like my clothes, they might not even like my product, they might not like my voice, my complexion.
10:39
But if I'm in my head saying I love you, I know it sounds a little hokey, but if there's that I love you, there's no way they could say no to me.
Because if you meet this day with love, if you don't just love your product, don't just love the the success of your company.
You actually love the person you're serving.
10:56
You wouldn't sell them something that sucks, but you also wouldn't do them the disservice of them not having it right.
If you if you fall in love with the movie, you want everybody you love to go see it.
You fall in love with going vegan.
You are praising from the roof.
My arthritis went away.
I feel better.
11:12
Goal again, right when you love a product or a service of the company you're launching in the coaching program.
You're not selling.
You're feeling bad by not persuading someone to take that action.
And when I see that passion in someone or a company, I know where they're going.
11:28
The top, the number one salesman for like, the last five years at my old company, you could listen to his sales calls and he was unbelievably persistent.
But it wasn't in a pushy or coercive way.
I would watch these sales calls and someone, you know, someone would be on like their 6th.
11:45
And no.
And he would just, he would take his glasses off and he'd rub his face.
And he's like, Pete, I'm not giving up on you, man.
He's like, you said that you're struggling to pay your mortgage right now.
And like, I know because I have all of this proof behind me that like, there's something that's stopping you emotionally from doing this, like help.
12:03
Like, let's work on this together.
Let's figure this out.
Right.
Exactly.
And so The thing is, is it what?
Like I love saying this is that it's not sales is a dance, not a fight, right?
You're just working with the person.
And The thing is, if you're ever selling a physical environment, you always want to be on the same side of the table because it really signals what the relationship should be, which is we're on the same side of the table here.
12:25
I'm trying to help you make a good decision.
And you know what?
And this is the thing about having integrity as a salesperson is that if you find out while you're talking to them that it's not a good fit, then you will be able to.
You will sell so much better if you let a couple people go that you know it's not going to be a good fit for because then you know why you're doing it.
12:44
Because then you have more conviction in yourself that it's not that I just sell every person with a heartbeat.
I saw the people that I think really need this thing, and some people might not need this thing because they have a different demon they got to slay.
You know what?
Then make them a recommendation because you do care about them rather than the sale.
So conviction over Commission, like that's the.
13:02
And that's at the end of the day, it boils back to that love thing, that service thing, that caring thing.
And it is the unfair advantage to sales.
Like, I love, I love hearing your perspective.
You're so good at sales, Alex.
I've, I've watched you train it.
I've watched you train it.
I watch you talk about it.
But it always starts with that caring.
13:20
And I've never met anybody consistent.
Listen, I I can see someone who's got a business doing a million a year.
And when I watch them and I'm not saying a million years bad, please, I I'm not a million years.
Amazing.
But they wanna go to 10, and I could tell the way they sell.
I could tell what they've rehearsed.
13:36
They don't believe in what they're doing.
And in my head, I know you will never pass, that there's no way beyond where you are unless you change how you feel if you sell someone and then think, gotcha.
Yeah, it's not.
You're not gonna make it.
Yeah, you're not gonna make it, cuz what happens is 1 you'll foster a whole army of people who hate you.
13:54
But secondly, like that, like if you have any ethics at all, which most people do, I actually think a lot more people have ethics than other people give credit for.
It starts to eat at you.
And Dean and I have been doing this business game enough to see we've seen people bottle rocket their way up and then fizzle, bottle, rock it up and then fizzle.
14:10
They create another new product every every 12 weeks because.
If it's right, if it's crypto, they got a crypto program.
If it's if it's AI, there's a new AI program rather than going deep.
Falling in love and actually making transformation.
So if if you're in business, starting business, thinking about business even in your career, what if tomorrow if we challenge you to say, how can I fall in love with this business, how can I fall in love with my product?
14:36
And if you don't love it, here's what I'll tell you.
Just go fix it.
Go fix it.
I love this.
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna go real deep on this real quick.
So it's usually like I'm, I look at a lot of businesses every day.
It's usually the biggest, most obvious thing is that the, like, the sandwich shop isn't doing well.
14:54
They're like, it's our marketing.
It's it's the location.
I was like, your sandwiches just aren't that good.
That's all it is.
They're just not.
They're just not good enough.
It's all like, they're like we just need more customers.
I was like, if you serve the customers you had well enough, you wouldn't have this conversation with me.
15:09
You'd already have a line out the door every day at lunch.
When you have the, I mean, we're using the sandwiches, yeah, when you have a killer sandwich.
What do you do?
You post it you and nobody wants to see a poster like please why right.
But you do compared to good.
And you and I both know some companies we talked about 1:00 earlier that's a really good marketer.
15:29
But the company's kind of like a calendar that you put spaghetti in.
They market so good but they keep falling through the holes because their product's not amazing.
Most nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
15:51
And if you like that would like to hear more about it go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And this is that.
This is at least my hack for getting conviction is so like I my next book's coming out.
16:08
I spent 2000 hours writing it and my editor spent 1500 hours.
So it's 3500 hours of time went into this thing.
And I'm not saying that for the book, but I'm saying my understanding of the level of effort that is required to make something that is world class or excellent has continued to move up my bar and my expectation of self.
16:26
And so like the guy who has the sandwich shop, I sometimes I sit down at places.
I'm like, how did someone think this is my life's work and they made this sandwich?
I'm like if I were going to open a sandwich up I'd spend a year trying every sandwich I possibly could and thinking like how can I make.
I would go to the best.
I would drive to the best sandwich shops and think like OK how do they set up their menu.
16:44
What are the few items that they have Like how do they source their agreed like it's doing the actual work.
Because The thing is, is that when you do that work and I'm about to invest in a company that does no strips, it's kind of exciting because I've I've.
Like you've had no strips on my yeah, I know.
And I was like, and I was telling this guy the the, the the creator.
17:02
And I was like, this is what we need to look at in terms of how long the residue stays on your nose.
He's like, and I was like how much coverage it has, how long it sticks.
I was like, I think the plastics used to defarmer and I'm like naming all these things.
He's like, no one has ever broken down our prop with all this detail.
And The thing is, is that once you fix every single one of those things, you make sure it's toasted for exactly 17 seconds and you make sure it gets flipped at this way and this time.
17:24
Why?
Because you did it at 30.
You did it at 5:00, and you found out that 17 was perfect.
When you go to talk about the sandwich, you'll have the conviction.
That that that's what I was going to say and and people don't realize they're saying well I have a good product but it doesn't sell.
Is that true?
17:40
Because when you know that product is the best, the conviction goes through the roof, sales go through the roof.
What?
What?
I'm so glad I asked you that question about sales today because no, because listen, you see more companies in me, I'm going to place right now.
I don't have time to consult.
17:57
I don't have to.
I I invest in about a company a month, but smaller.
I don't take them over.
I just invest them.
But we have so much opportunity coming our way.
And I see the companies that are stuck, especially for years when they asked me to consult on sales or marketing and it's because they don't have conviction.
They it's such a great analogy.
18:14
I'm going to think about this for the rest of my life.
They're selling a crappy sandwich and trying to overlook trying to fix it with better marketing, the magical money machine.
Better, better, better.
Opt in funnels.
Better upsell process.
Like no just go fix the sandwich right.
18:29
And that's the work that has to be confronted and that's the work that most like.
Cuz if you got into the sandwich business because you wanted to make money then that's why you're not passionate about.
Like I can talk about no strips all day cuz I've I've I've had two no surgeries like I just breathe bad and so I know all the different things.
18:45
I've tried every single brand and I've done them all for 30-40, fifty, whatever days and I can tell you all the differences about them because it's I'm passionate.
You can see how I'm talking about like I'm passionate about it, which is ridiculous, but like, but if you have that for the product or service that you're you're getting into, you'll know the details.
It's why mastermind.com with Tony and I, we've been in the Selfeducation for so long.
19:05
It changed our lives.
It made us better humans.
It allows to take care of our family.
We get to feed between him and him way more than me, but hundreds of millions of people like we get to do this cool stuff.
So when I talk about selling what you know or creating an information product or?
I'm not.
It's my life.
19:21
I I would.
I'd be fixing cars if that didn't come into my life.
So it's not If my conviction is an 11 out of 10, yeah, I'm going to give you this line for everyone who's listening to this.
So conviction is the like, if you've gotten anything from what Dean and I were just talking about, is that conviction is the #1 secret ingredient to sales, is that you actually have to believe in.
19:38
The thing is, is the first person you always have to sell as yourself.
And most people actually aren't sold #1, #2 is that conviction itself is not binary.
It's not do you believe or do you not believe it's how much do you believe?
How deep do you believe?
Right.
Yeah.
And so you can look at a sales team and I can say like he's a, he's a two out of 10.
19:55
He's a four out of 10.
If I were to just judge them based on how much they believe in the product, that would map significantly more to what their closing percentage was more than anything else.
But the cool thing is, is that because conviction is measurable and it is changeable, it's also something that you can work on and you can outwork yourself doubt.
20:14
So if you're not like.
If I didn't think the book was good, that I would work on the book until I thought it was good.
And then my doubt would go away because I have evidence, wow, that I've done this thing to make it exceptional.
And so if someone then says, I think your book shit, I would just say like, well, here's all the evidence of all the things that I did like I rewriting.
20:32
Back all the way.
At least talk about in the beginning 100% and so I.
Want to say your first book?
It was Purifier.
I have recommended that book more than any other book, especially when it comes to marketing and sales.
What's the name of your new book coming out?
Can you share it or not?
No, no, I can't, $100 million leads. $100 million leads, Yeah, it's How can people follow you?
20:51
We're not done yet.
I got a couple more things, but I just want people to be able to follow you.
I mean, if you're on the podcast, I have a podcast called the Game Alex or Mosey.
You can just type my name in.
But pretty much on every social media platform.
So.
Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram.
You.
Too If you don't have his first book, $100 million offers.
Yeah, it's on Amazon.
It's on Amazon.
21:07
Go get it and and be on the lookout.
OK.
And so you know it's yeah we made it as cheap as Amazon will let me make it and make it a book still.
So if you if you're strapped for cash it's $0.99 for the Kindle.
Like it's just I just wanted as many people to have it as possible.
Well, and a lot of people got it.
So nice work.
No, it is.
It is my go to when somebody's has me questions, I'm like go get that book.
21:27
We've in the last four or five podcasts, people have asked me a question a lot of times in life, same as you.
People are always like how did you do this?
How did you do that?
So I know you said earlier you got one for me.
What pain do?
You cherish.
I knew you'd get a good one.
21:43
I knew that would be good.
What pain do I cherish?
I know the answer though credibly.
I know the answer is so I'm going to make it light for a second.
So Alex and I are the cofounders of the DLB club daddy's little boy.
22:04
We both had a time in our lives when we wanted to go for own thing that our dads weren't so supportive.
I won't go deep on it and it we have some similar life stories of that'll never work you'll it'll you know so.
There was one day, Alex, I don't even know how sorry, but I I said to you.
22:21
I said I called you Daddy's little boy or something and we just we laughed so hard I think I dropped my phone.
But if we take the funny part out of joking about the the Daddy's little boy club, that sounded weird, even words together.
But when I was when I was about 12 years old, my my father was the youngest of 12.
22:42
I'm going to take just two minutes to give you context this question.
When I was my dad was the youngest of 12, was physically abused.
He was sexually abused, come from an old school Italian family, so he did not get help.
He just suffered through it and my dad had so much resentment for his own father who knocked his teeth out that he he was confrontational with everybody and couldn't control, never physically beat me.
23:06
But I had a bleeding ulcer at 11 years old.
I threw up blood at 11 because my dad would fight with everyone if we went to a restaurant and the waiter was rude. 5 minutes later my dad would be on the floor punching a guy in the face like.
A flag guy doesn't hold the flag fast enough.
My dad's on the side the road fighting a construction guy.
Like like my dad hit a guy with a bat in front of me when I was like and I I hate confrontations that I don't watch fights.
23:26
I can't.
I don't watch, you know, extreme fight.
I'm watch none of it because I still don't like it.
Long story short when I was 12, my mom get remarried to a guy who was amazing.
His name was Lenny Rizzo.
It was her high school sweetheart.
She married this guy.
He was the most amazing stepdad had.
Step brother, step sister, got a Mongoose.
23:42
BMX bike that we couldn't afford.
Before that I lived in a cul-de-sac.
It was like I went from the trailer park to right and my dad couldn't handle it.
And there was one day my dad, my stepdad, my dad was screaming at me, yelling at me, I was shaking and I could talk about this stuff.
23:59
Now my dad's 87, still alive and I talk about this in front of him.
He knows and and I know he's got the he's got a pound of regret 1000 of regret.
But anyway, my stepdad says to my dad, he's in Florida, we're in upstate New York.
He said Hey.
Why don't you calm down?
You don't know what this is doing to your son.
24:15
You can't see your son until you calm down.
My dad got in the car.
Drove 14 hours straight to our house with a bat, knocked windows out of cars.
We got so scared.
I know it's a long story, but I'm going to share this with you because most people don't understand.
We all have our shit.
24:31
So we get in a motorhome and we hide from my dad for a month.
We're going from.
Campground to campground.
And we can't go home.
We're afraid, right.
So finally I get my older sister, we walk downtown.
This is how long ago it was.
24:46
I bring a quarter, go to a pay phone and call my dad.
He picks up the phone.
Where the hell are you?
Where tell me where you are right now And like dad just got to stop.
And like, you know sometimes you got to mature up.
I was, man, manning up at 1211, whatever it was.
And I said.
How will this stop?
25:02
God, I can't take it anymore.
And I was afraid for my mom.
I thought he was going to kill her.
Like I didn't know.
I don't think he would have.
But I was afraid He threatened he was going to kill her.
I thought he was going to.
I know it's getting deep, but I want to.
I want to answer this question.
And I said, he said move in with me.
I'll leave her alone for the rest of her life.
25:18
I walked back and said, mom moving in with dad.
She's like, are you insane?
No, I said I am.
You can't stop me.
I called him up.
He's picking me up.
I walked back down to that pay booth.
My father picked me up.
I moved in with my dad.
I moved in with my dad and.
When I got there, he didn't have heat in his house because he couldn't afford it and he had an electric heater plugged in and at night he was sleeping in the bathroom because the little electric heater could heat the bathroom.
25:39
Slept in the bathroom for six months and my dad never told.
My mom said it was fine and my dad literally.
I realized now that I'm older, bipolar, whatever you want to call a little bit of schizophrenia, would be the greatest man in the world.
Let me drive to school at 15 years old, taught me to hunt, fish, do all kinds of cool things, and also the guy that gave me a bleeding ulcer.
25:58
Long story short.
The pain of when my dad lost it was so bad.
I would shake and and be fearful and I thought it was the worst thing in the world.
But over time, by the time I was 14 or 15, I could read my dad's mood.
I could feel his emotions and I knew how to treat him in advance so I could keep him out of crazy.
26:16
Paul's name is Paul and be more of the dad that I could love and.
At the time I thought what a burden for a kid my age I have to deal with.
I can't tell my mom, can't tell my sister because it'll cause shit.
And I was afraid if I told him he would kill my mom.
Like that's how serious it was for a 12 year old, 14 year old.
26:32
Now I look back.
That was the greatest gift in the world God gave me.
I feel I can go in front of an audience of 30,000 or next week I'll be in front of an audience of 1/2 a million.
I can go in front of half a million people and I think I can feel what they need.
And it's because I had to feel what my dad need.
26:47
I had to do it through empathy and compassion.
It wasn't just a normal father son relationship.
And I think I get to sell the way I sell.
I get to care the way I care, I get to build.
I built 13 different companies.
I get to do all that because of that shit I went through.
27:03
So took me a long time to get there.
And that was a long answer, but hopefully that helps somebody today.
It was a real answer.
Yeah, so.
Man, I appreciate you so much.
Thanks for being a friend.
Thanks for all you do for the world.
The last couple podcasts as well.
I'm just getting in the in the groove of this and I thank God for all your listeners.
27:20
Thank you for sharing.
Go listen to the last three.
You got great ones.
Matthew McConaughey was amazing.
Trent Shelton was amazing.
There's so many good ones.
Go listen to the last three.
Make sure you share it with a friend.
We'd love to get this out there.
We do these podcasts for free for you.
If you love it, share it with somebody.
27:38
But lastly, I love to ask if there's someone in your life you'd like to thank, Whether it was something they did wrong that inspired you, or somebody that just is the gas to your engine or the wind behind your sail, who would you like to thank?
He's a Layla, yeah.
Yeah, I think it's Layla for sure.
Yeah.
I mean I mean it's just it's honestly of all the things that we that you know we I already think this way like we have accomplished cuz it's been you know she and I even though I had businesses before her.
28:05
Like I think I think our marriage is rarer than our business success in terms of like percentage of people who who you know do anything.
And so I'm.
I'm very grateful for that because for the women who are listening or the guys actually everyone.
28:24
I had a decent amount of success when she and I met and pretty much within like three or four months after we met she went all in on me and then I lost everything and I didn't just lose everything once.
I actually lost everything twice.
28:40
And it's it's it's a story we'll tell it another time.
But at the like the absolute rock bottom of that whole period of time I actually told her I thought she should leave me.
I was like I because I'm self aware enough.
I was like listen there are better guys out there who will treat like you know, I care I respect her.
28:55
I cared about I was like, we're cool.
Like if you leave like I'm good, like we're I respect you and I.
And I was trying to sell her on leaving me and she grabbed my chin and she pulled it towards me and she was like, I would sleep with you under a bridge that came to that.
And like I think that kind of conviction, like we talk about conviction right to go full circle is that in some ways like she sold me on me And so she was like, I guess that was her you know burning the boats.
29:23
Mind you I'm sleeping at her parents house people.
I'm not we're not married yet I'm.
I'm just the guy she met on the Internet who lost everything and now we're crashing at her parents house for a little bit like real winner.
And that's the moment where she's like I'll sleep with you in her bridge if it comes to that.
29:39
And I think that that I think every guy stands.
The power of that I I have that in my relationship and I feel beyond blessed.
I'd answer the same way, but I I get to see that in you.
It's not a you guys don't have an Instagram relationship.
It's it's a no.
It's a it's an amazing connection.
And I knew you'd say that.
29:55
You led me on.
Yeah.
Now she's so that's to Layla.
And Layla, if you're listening, you are awesome.
Alex, thank you so much, man.
Appreciate you coming in today to be here.








0:00
Real quick guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
0:19
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
There's a ton of leverage for media creators because what they sell and how they market themselves are one in the same.
And with that leverage, he's able to gain access to other people's massive distribution bases that might even be different audiences than him.
0:45
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wish Bezos, Musk, and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
Mr. Beast is gonna be worth over $100 billion and it's gonna happen faster than you think.
1:06
So Jim, this is me calling my shot for you.
In 2022, Mr. Beast had the fastest growing account on TikTok and YouTube, so two of the platforms that had the most eyeballs, right now he has the most of them.
You think about the amount of creators on each of those platforms and he was literally number one on both.
1:24
The reason that I'm so bullish on him isn't because of what he currently has accomplished, but because of how he approaches his accomplishments in general.
The fact that he actually transitioned platforms.
Not that he stopped YouTube, but was able to build the team and understand content to such a degree that he could come to the game late on TikTok Cuz relative to other creators who'd been on there, he waited years before he decided to get on TikTok and then still beat everyone on the platform within his first 1224 months.
1:52
Like to me that's a sign of a champion and it's that approach that he has to everything that I think is why he's going to be worth 10 billion and I'm going to give you some numbers to back that up.
And if you don't know who I am, my name's Alfre Mozzie on acquisition.com to portfolio companies, just about $200 million a year in aggregate.
I make these because I hope to attract other business owners towards us that are over $1,000,000 a year in profit so we can invest in your business and help it scale.
2:14
Right now I think the entire world is under indexed on how valuable influencer traffic is.
Even though people still talk about influencers and like it's, it's almost feels like it's old now.
I still think they're wildly underpriced.
And so let me just give you a couple ideas here.
2:30
So Logan, Paul KSI and Jake Paul recently partnered on Prime right and in trailing 90 in internal sales, meaning like what they sold to distributors, not what the distributors marked it up as.
They did over 250 million in revenue, which means that they're pacing over a billion this year in sales in the company and they were able to do that with almost no marketing budget because of the reach of Logan Ksi and Jake Paul.
2:59
But here's the kicker, Mr. Beast is bigger than all of them put together just from a views and subscribers perspective.
And this isn't me throwing rocks.
I'm just looking at the numbers of total subscribers and to be fair, Logan owns 20% or whatever he owns of of that.
It's more than acquisition.com does in revenue.
3:15
So like that's not me throwing shade.
The reason I make this content is because as a businessman, I can see how undervalued an audience is and I'm just attaching a different back end.
So rather than having a consumer based product, I have a business product which is really just me buying into businesses.
3:30
Now let's talk about what that means from a valuation perspective.
So a company that's fast growing that has significantly better margins because they don't have nearly the the marketing cost because most times CPG, so consumer pack goods when the biggest costs in them is inventory and marketing.
3:47
And so if you can cut out an entire massive cost center and get instant national recognition or international recognition, then the, the potential of the brand day one already becomes a billion, 10 billion, etcetera.
And so the fact that right now I would say that their company could probably trade at a few billion right now, like if as soon as they finish this year with a billion in sales, they'll probably be able to trade at multiple billions.
4:12
And the fact that Jim has a significantly larger audience than they do and he's international in a way that they are not.
Like he has an Indian channel, he has Spanish channels, he has Chinese, he has, he's translated all of these things, We can get even wider and wider reach.
4:28
And so the the tradeoff is that right now he's got feastibles, right.
And so despite the fact that Mister Beast has, you know, Mr. Beast Gaming, he has The Ghost Kitchen that he does with Beast Burger.
In my opinion, where he will generate all of his wealth is actually not in gaming and not in the Coast Kitchen.
4:46
And I'll give you my explanation why The Ghost Kitchen just has really, really bad margins in general.
And so even though that company probably does, I think I heard it on a podcast, it does a few $100,000 a day in sales.
He might actually only receive net 10% of that.
5:02
Now then he also has a partner who has half of that.
And so it's a very small percentage of that that he's able to actually collect in cash flow and that thing would probably trade on earnings.
And so it might be worth 100, maybe $150 million.
Now not saying it's small money, but I said 100 billion.
5:19
And so compared to that, it's kind of a negligible.
Now let's talk about gaming.
So gaming absolutely has the potential to become from a from an opportunity vehicle perspective, and he has one of the biggest, if not the biggest gaming channel on YouTube.
But it's just that I think right now Jim has realized the power of CPG and there are more people who eat chocolate than play video games.
5:41
And just like what I think he's witnessed with what Logan, Paul, Jake, Paul, KSI have done with Prime is that there's even more people who drink beverages.
Think about how much chocolate any consumer is going to buy per week, right?
Probably not a ton, maybe a bar right now.
5:57
Compare that to how many cases of water or energy drink or sports drink that you might consume.
Because if you become a regular consumer of a beverage, usually just keep buying that beverage over and over and over again.
And the reason that it's so powerful in the influencer space is that most people don't have incredibly strong affinity to the brands that they consume.
6:18
Most brands are really old people don't remember they come up.
They just like have been drinking it because they've always drank it, not because they actually made a conscious decision.
They might have got introduced to Pepsi or Coke or or one of their sub brands by the way, that not everything they have is evil.
One of the sub brands that they own.
And then just like they just continue to drink that.
6:34
But as soon as one of the influences that you saw come up and that you are a fan of or even recognized and you're like, oh, this is John's company, I watch John's videos, then even if it's water that's branded John's water, we wouldn't brand it that way.
You'll be more likely to take it and maybe even pay a little bit of a premium on top of the commoditized product.
6:53
And that's where the opportunity exists for these massive brands.
All right, now these are personal brands, but they are still brands in general.
And you can measure the strength of a brand based on how much of A premium you can charge on a commoditized product.
And so for example, if I have two white T-shirts, right, and one of them has an LV logo on it, and this one can go for $100 and this one goes for $1.00, then I have significant branding and pricing power as a result of that, right?
7:21
And that discrepancy is the strength of the brand.
Now, how powerful the brand do we know this is?
Well, right now the richest man in the world owns this brand.
So pretty damn valuable, right?
So Bernard Arnot owns Louis Vuitton and a zillion other luxury brands because he understands the pricing power of brand And those gross profits that you can generate for selling.
7:42
The same thing is what you can then reinvest in innovation, staying ahead and marketing even more to reinforce the brand.
And that's what becomes the brand five wheel is that you create a little bit of a premium, you make the spread, you reinvest that into the branding itself, then that reinforces the brand.
8:00
You can raise the price more, increase the spread and then around and around you go until you have this incredibly strong brand that's established that consumers in general are willing to pay more for.
And if you think about enterprise value in general, it's a discount applied to future cash flows from a business.
And if pricing power is the strongest lever on cash flows in a business, which it is by the way, like for example, if I had a business that, you know, ran 50% margins and I double the price and I get the same amount of people to sell, then I triple the profit of the business because I went from 50 to 150 in terms of actual profit.
8:31
And so pricing is the strongest lever on how much money a business actually makes and what is the strongest lever on pricing?
Brand.
And so building a strong brand gives you influence over the strongest lever of profit for a business, which then translates into the highest enterprise value.
And for that reason, I think that Mister Beast will be a sense of billionaire.
8:50
And it's also because he has so much time to do it.
Based on the Intel I have, and this isn't me validating that these are the actual numbers, but basically Intel that I have right now, Feastables is probably going to pay 3 to $400 million this year in sales, All right.
Now if we assume a 20 to 25% margin for that business, then it's going to do $100 million in profit.
9:09
Now that business on its own would probably be valued at over a billion.
Now Mr. Beast has already sold chunks of Beast Industries at over a billion dollar valuation.
So from a he's already a billionaire if you don't know that, like he's already a billionaire from an equity value perspective.
And so all I'm making the argument is that he's going to 100 X his net worth over the rest of his life, which actually I think is a very easy argument for me to make.
9:30
And so The thing is, is that he was able to accomplish that with 110th of the distribution of Logan, Paul, KSI and whatnot in terms of their brick and mortar distribution.
So think about it like this.
He might have five times the brand size and he's got 110th of distribution.
9:48
And so there's a 50X discrepancy between what their sales are, which we can prove and have been public and what I think his sales could be.
Now again, this is only on chocolate and the idea is not like Mr. Beast isn't going to make his most of his money on chocolate.
10:04
Chocolate was the first thing that he saw everyone would buy and so the next follow up is like okay.
Well then is it chocolate or feastables?
The brand.
And then you have Feastables chips, and you have Feastables Water, and you have Feastables energy drinks that he can then category by category, crush everyone else with because he will have a stronger brand.
10:25
Because when he's compared to three other bottles that look like the ones you've always seen, and then you see Feastables, what are you going to do?
You'll probably try it once and if it's at least as good and to be fair or to be real, your perspective on the brand in a real way will influence how good you think it tastes.
10:44
So just like there's a famous wine experience where they had expensive, medium and cheap wines, they had people taste test them and people rank them expensive, medium and cheap.
But what they didn't know is that the wines are all the same and they just changed the labels.
So how you perceive the brand also influences how much you like it.
And so if you have strong affinity for Mr. Bees, which millions of people do, he could even have an identical product and people will perceive it as better.
11:07
And so I think that the fact that he can do three or $400 million with chocolate bars shows that when he gets into far larger categories with larger lifetime values and larger average purchase like sports drinks, like energy drinks, where people will consume one or multiple per day.
11:23
Like most people aren't eating multiple chocolate bars a day, but people will drink multiple Gatorades or multiple powers or multiple energy drinks per day.
And again, that's just the beverage category.
Like he can still come out with other verticals.
And knowing Mr. Beast, he'll do his research and he will look at what is the largest category by revenue across the widest base because he has his audiences, everyone.
11:44
And so he needs to find products that everyone consume.
And then for that reason he will be able to sell more than anyone else.
If we were to 50X the sales, and that's again his chocolate versus beverages, which is a unfair pairing, he could already be worth it from that.
12:01
And that doesn't include global.
That's just US.
And he has a larger audience outside of the US than he does inside the US.
So right now, if Jim goes into a 711, person after person will walk in and take a picture with him, which means that he already has mass brand awareness, which is the hardest thing to accomplish and the most expensive thing to accomplish.
12:21
And so he has this brand that's already established and all he has to do is plug in distribution into that brand.
And so with every added distribution, he will just generate more revenue instantly and likely from what I understand with these, he sells out faster than any of the other brand.
12:37
So he's taking up more shelf space and pushing through his product at a faster rate than any other brand on the category.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called $100 Million Offers.
At over 8005 star reviews, it has almost a perfect score.
12:54
You can get it for $0.99 on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1000 hours into writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career.
I can catch the partner with you.
13:09
So that's my gift.
Go check it out, Amazon and back to the show.
And so when he applies that to multiple things in the vertical, feastibles will just grow and grow and expand and expand.
And so do I think that he could do it in gaming?
Sure.
But kind of why bother?
13:27
Because you could just do this and do it All in all the way and get to a cent a billion.
And just to give you some context, my team had to go to a zillion different grocery stores and we still couldn't find these nuts as one of the dog bars because they're sold out almost everywhere, right?
And Jim's already learned a lot about, like, how to taste test these things.
13:46
And what's crazy is that he's in his early 20s, like, he's just getting started and he's a master of content.
And over the next decade, he'll become a master of business because he has access to the best and smartest people in the world because of his brand.
And so you can immediately, you know, jump to, hey Elon, what should I do?
14:05
Right.
And Elon will probably respond.
So let me give you an idea of what Beast Industries is all about in terms of the ecosystem.
So across like 4-5, six YouTube channels, he's got 183,000,000 subscribers.
And that doesn't include the international channels, which are more than half of his audience.
On top of that, he's got TikTok, he's got Instagram, he's got Twitter, and in aggregate he's got over 300 million plus subscribers.
14:25
And I think the main argument I would make there is that they're also incredibly engaged.
Like, there's a difference between Mr. Beast and another mega influencer who just has 200,000,000 Instagram followers versus him, where people have been following and watching his videos and they have seen him start from counting backwards or counting forwards to 1,000,000 or whatever it was as a kid to seeing him become and live out his own vision in front of people of what he wanted to create.
14:51
And he has tremendous goodwill because the amount of philanthropy work that he does.
And so he has one of the strongest brands out there.
Now on the business side, he's got Beast Burger, which is a Ghost Kitchen, which basically leverages the network of restaurants that already exist.
And then he uses his distribution base of customers to buy stuff on an app.
15:08
And then it gets delivered and filled on from whatever local restaurants he's already partnered with.
And I know he's got a few 100 restaurants that are already there, so he can already hit national distribution, but I don't think that's where he's going to make the main money.
The next thing.
He's got Beast Gaming, right, which is where he'll try and make apps and video games because he has a big gaming audience.
15:24
He also has translation services, which I don't know what's going to happen with a I because A I is moving at such a fast pace that that might have been started and might not be the best opportunity vehicle for him now versus when he started only a few years ago.
But I think we're the real winner for him is going to be, and this is what I would make my bet on is that he's going to be going all in on Feastables.
15:43
Because Feastables, if you think about if you're an influencer, you have a massive audience.
What you want to do is simply reverse engineer maximum enterprise value.
And the way you would do that is number of sales times lifetime gross profit.
All right.
And So what that means is what do I, what do the most amount of people in my audience want multiplied by what is the most gross profit I can make per customer, right.
16:06
And so an example of one that I've told Miss Jimmy, I'm still making my make my point here.
I still think you should start a credit card and start a banking platform.
Just saying, because what is banking about trust, right, Everybody would switch to a beast card and then there's a zillion ways you can monetize because the wedge product for most consumers into banking is a card and then you can offer loans, you can do all sorts of stuff anyways, you might not want to do that.
16:26
But if we're looking at what does everyone use banking and what makes the most lifetime gross profit banking and we look at what business has been around the longest banks, then I think that that's a really strong competitive thing.
That being said, CPG makes a ton of sense for him because so many people eat chocolate, eat chips, eat pretzels, and a lot of those people are in his audience.
16:47
And I think that what we are seeing with feasibles just with chocolate is a drop in the bucket compared to how big this brand will be once he enters bigger, more profitable categories.
What I mean by that is okay, how many chocolate bars does the average person buy a week?
Now, how many sports beverages or water do people consume per week and purchase per week?
17:08
Significantly more.
And so if he goes into those categories, he might be able to in and of itself, even if the same number of people purchased get 10 times the revenue he's currently getting with chocolate bars.
Now his chocolate bar distribution, compared to some of the biggest competitors that are out there in the space, is a 10th or 20th in terms of actual brick and mortar locations that sell his stuff.
17:29
And right now he's selling out faster than any other brand.
And so he's still way under indexed on how much revenue he could be making from what I would consider a less than ideal product for how many people he could potentially sell.
And the lifes and gross profit he could achieve with a different vertical, which Jim's smart and he will do that next.
17:48
And what I respect about Jim is that he's just here to win it.
Like he will do whatever it takes to win no matter what he he gets people to move in with him in this house so that he they can just, he can indoctrinate them into the Mr. Bee's way of doing things, which is just when it all costs without hurting anyone and do good while you do it.
That's me consolidating it.
18:04
But there's eight points that I want to make in terms of why I really think he's going to get 100 billion.
So first is he has massive leverage in terms of what he puts in versus what he gets out.
So he may spend a million, two million, even $4 million on a video, but the amount of impressions that that one video gets across the world because he also translates it is worth hundreds of millions.
18:24
Like his biggest videos are bigger than the Super Bowl.
It's hard for people to comprehend that.
And he can make one of those Super Bowl videos every single week if you wanted to.
And there's no other people who's advertising against.
It's just him #2 is that when you have a media company, your product is your marketing, which is one of the unique advantages that only media companies have.
18:43
Meaning the more you spend on your product, which is your media, the more marketing ends up happening.
And so the stuff you put out, which you spend money on because people consume your product as media, also double s as your media department in terms of how do I market my thing.
19:00
And so there's a ton of leverage for media creators because what they sell and how they market themselves are one in the same.
And with that leverage, he's able to gain access to other people's massive distribution bases that might even be different audiences than him.
So when I talked to Jim the other day, he was talking about how he was surprised how much Joe Rogan's podcast with him, how much, how many older people started recognizing him from that podcast.
19:25
Right.
And so he can get on Flagrant, he can get on Joe Rogan, he can get on Impulsive and all these other ones because he's already established this brand, because they know that if he's on their podcast, that podcast will crush because he brings his own audience.
19:42
And so that's the leverage that he brings to every conversation.
And so whenever he does knock on the door, the door is open for him, #3 is that he's able to monetize the widest base of his audience.
So like at the most basic level, when he, when he monetizes all the Adsense, every single person who uses video, he gets some money off of, right.
19:58
But what's the level underneath of that?
And so an interesting concept here is that if someone paid Mr. Beast like for an integrated ad inside of one of his videos, fundamentally they believe that they're going to make significantly more by paying him for the integration.
Then they're going to, sorry, they believe they're going to make significantly more than they paid him off of that ad.
20:19
And so he would then.
Make more money promoting his own thing and make up the arbitrage.
So if someone gets 12:50 or 20 to 1 by paying him $20 million a year to market their thing, then it means that he might be able to get 200 million or 400 million a year marketing his thing.
20:36
And that's not to mention the fact that if he says hey, check out Shopify or hey check out, you know, Pepsi or whatever, right?
I know you wouldn't do Pepsi.
You get the idea.
Why would he not do that?
Because he's gone trying to get it going to consumer products.
But point is, there's also some degradation of the call to action.
20:53
So what I mean is, if Mr. Beast talks about Mr. Beast stuff, it's all Mr. Beast.
If you talked about something else, then there's certain amount of trust that gets lost, not with him, but just like he doesn't own Shopify and so a certain percentage of people are just like, well, I don't want to do that.
Whereas if he's promoting his own thing, the trust transfers 100% from him to the product.
21:13
So if someone else can make 10X on it his ads, then he might be able to make 100X on his ads because it stays within the brand and it's congruent.
And some point underneath of that is that his media, his content, touches the broadest audience, which is simply entertainment, right?
21:31
People want to be entertained because they want to be attracted from lives, whatever.
But everybody can watch Mr. Beast's content and so his products.
As a consequence he gets to reach everyone with what he sells.
If I started a chocolate bar, it might not even resonate at all with my audience.
Because one, I think a lot of my audience is probably relatively health conscious.
21:48
A lot of them are entrepreneurs trying to be better and they might not be like well Alex, chocolate bar is not really like on brand for you right now.
If I sold Nosal nasal strips then that might be very on brand because they would have breathed better.
They want to perform better, they want to sleep better.
All those things that are a lot and I do it and they know I live this stuff, right.
And so again, the consequence here is we want to sell the the thing that the most people in the audience will buy #4 is that.
22:12
And this is the main reason I believe that the CPG angle, so Consumer Packaged Goods compared to his software slash gaming play will be better for him is that it takes a, it's like getting into software is already an incredibly hard and competitive space.
Now he has this huge competitive advantage of having the big brand, but I think that he doesn't basically why introduce another risk variable when he could just do a very simple business model and have a superior brand on top of it.
22:36
And so like manufacturing what you know the chocolate bars or chips or water is not overwhelmingly complex compared to making a software or an app or something like that.
And so he can leverage the fact that with his, with his audience, he can have a very simple transactional business and then focus the rest of his time on distribution #5 is that Jim is smart enough to know that he doesn't know everything and that would be very tough.
23:01
I could I it's it's actually really hard for me to imagine being one of the most popular people on planet Earth in your early 20s and not letting that get to your head.
And having had many conversations with him, he's confident that he can kill it, but he's incredibly openminded to listening to people who he feels has expertise outside of what he has mastered.
23:20
And so now is he going to take advice on concept from a lot of people?
I mean, I think he listens to everybody because he wants to take anything that he can, but he takes that same win winner's attitude to every other thing that he does in business.
And so he hits up people, anyone who he thinks he can learn anything from.
23:37
And he doesn't judge the fact that he's further ahead than some business people.
Because think about this, if he raised at 1 1/2 billion or 1.6 or whatever it was for Beast Industries, he's technically a billionaire on paper, right?
And so why would he talk to somebody who's not a billionaire on paper?
Because he still feels like there are things that he can learn from them and then implement into his machine and instantly get to 10 or 50 or 100.
24:00
And just as like a micro example, like he still texts like the thumbnails that he's thinking about going on for his videos to some of his close buddies that are super high Youtubers just to get their feedback.
Because at the end of the day he cares about winning more than being right.
Number six is that he's trying to hire a God squad and he's doing it aggressively.
24:18
So he wants The Avengers of business and content to be on his team in house.
And the thing that he has that's, again, the huge advantage of the personal brand is that smart people recognize the fact that he's growing like crazy and they want to get on the ship.
24:34
And so the access to talent that he has, the same way he has access to expertise is second to none.
And so he can get someone to take a pickup to join Beast Industries for one of the verticals he wants to go after who are maybe even underpaid.
Not that saying that he doesn't pay well, but I'm saying like they're willing to take a smaller slice because they believe in the bigger pie and the reason able to do that is because the value they're getting from Mr. Beast and Beast Industries isn't just monetary.
24:59
So even cuz The thing is that the more he develops his brand, the more just saying I work at Beast Industries or I work for Mr. Beast becomes a an asset that you get to live with for the rest of your life that you can then leverage in other places.
So the trade is still a great trade, it's just not all denoted in money. #7 is that he?
25:17
For being so young, it's amazing how collaborative rather than competitive he is.
Now don't get me wrong, he's super competitive as a person, but I think a lot of it is him against him.
But he's willing to collaborate with other creators rather than cut them down, and so he spends time like he He helps people out on their first channel with no subscribers.
25:36
He does TikTok videos with Tik tokers that aren't nearly as big as him and he does that because he sees the world as larger than a Zerosum game, meaning we can just both win.
And I think that's actually been one of his low key secrets of successes.
Because early on he was masterminding with all these guys who are all together trying to get millions of subscribers and all of them did.
25:57
And I think, you know, this is me just putting my theoretical hat on.
So I'm, I'm going into conjecture, but I'll bet that him seeing that all of them could win when they all work together and they all won faster and bigger than if they worked on their own probably change the way he saw the world in terms of how he creates and how everyone can win together.
26:19
And I think that might have actually been a really core pillar of why he is more open to collaboration and helping everyone.
And #8 is that Jim is playing an infinite game.
And what I mean by that is that he's in the game to play the game.
Like by any stretch he doesn't need money anymore, right?
He's got a billion dollar, you know, plus billion dollar valuation personally in terms of his net worth.
26:38
And if you lost everything tomorrow, he would still make YouTube videos.
And the reason I know that is because when he had nothing, he made YouTube videos and because he plays the game that way, he's going to have one of the biggest piece of leverage that everyone under plays, which is time, right?
Because it doesn't matter.
Like on a long enough time rising, you can actually pursue a lower leverage opportunity and still win huge.
26:59
It just takes a longer time.
But he is in a high leverage opportunity vehicle and he has time.
So he's already got almost a decade of experience under his belt in his low 20s.
And so in terms of like entrepreneur years, he's actually older than people give him credit for, but he's still being old for what he's given credit for still has 6070 years ahead of him where he can continue to compound that meaning his audience compounds unto itself, his media compounds unto itself.
27:30
And so if you imagine any reasonable rate of progress over that 6070 year period, I feel incredibly confident that he could, that he can hit that sensibility and probably far more than that.

The Kindle book is $0.99.
The audio book is as low as they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
And when we make these choices, I think just as important, if not more important, is the story that we are telling ourselves about why we made the choices and what that tells us about who we are.
0:41
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and.
Beyond, I hope you share.
And enjoy.
I want to tell you a story that may be applicable to you if you're an existing entrepreneur, a new entrepreneur, or somebody's about to make a big decision in life.
1:05
Yesterday I had a conversation that transpired between me and an 18 year old.
Who's now a freshman in college.
And I think there were, I wish I could have recorded it, but there were a lot of kind of decision points and lessons and thought processes that we walk through together that I think will be valuable for many because it's the same, it's honestly the same decision making process whether you're making a multimillion dollar decision or you're making a you know, relationship decision or whatever it is.
1:32
And so this 18 year old kid is my neighbor.
I think I've referenced them before and he's entrepreneurial.
He did a little car washing business.
He's done a little.
Ecommerce business that he started on his own and and it's and it's worked out, you know, pretty decently well for him.
But because of the pressures that he's had on himself and from outside he decided he had to do college.
1:50
And so he started his first semester in college and to make a Long story short he did something he wasn't supposed to do and now he's in trouble and that may jeopardize his future in college.
And so he's obviously really wrecked about this And so I I said hey let's go for a walk.
And so on this walk, I said, You know what's?
2:08
What's your plan?
Well, I think I'm, you know, I think I'm going to try and fight this thing and, you know, give college another shot.
And I I wanted to walk him through this because I wanted him to make any decision for the right reasons.
2:23
Right.
And so I said, you know, do you think, like, what do you, what's the outcome you want to have from giving another shot at college, Right.
Because he didn't really like high school that much.
He's like, well, you know, I just want to, I want to give it a try.
I was like okay again.
2:39
What do you want to have happen or what do you think is going to happen?
What is the positive outcome that you're potentially looking for?
What's the negative outcome that you think could happen?
He's like, well, honestly, I don't know.
And I was like Okay, now we're getting somewhere.
So do you think that taking, you know, genders, literature, studies and history of Aztec culture, whatever?
3:04
Is going to be more interesting to you now than the stuff that you studied in high school, which was, again, general literature.
Is that going to be interesting to you?
And he's like, well, probably not.
And I was like, OK, then what's the real reason that you want to go to college?
I was like, well, you know, I feel like I, you know, I'm a kid and I should experience, you know, having fun and all that kind of stuff.
3:23
And I was like, OK, having fun is fine.
Do you feel like you can have fun without going to college?
Do you think that you could?
Not spend $200,000 in four years of your life and still have fun in that same period of time if you weren't at college but still with other people who are your age, like, well, yeah, I guess so.
3:42
I was like, okay cool then I'm assuming that's not the only reason you want to go to college.
What else is there you started thinking?
He's like, honestly, I don't really know.
And so, to give you a little bit more context, before what I told him next, I asked him, what do you think?
4:00
Because he's doing his, he's starting a new entrepreneur thing right now with real estate and he hasn't, he hasn't cracked it yet, right.
And so I said, do you think it's possible that you want to go to college because it's an it's a it's a socially acceptable shield for you not being successful in entrepreneurship.
4:17
Do you think, do you think that that might be a reason?
Because if you're in college then you you're not seen as a failure if you're not.
Winning at the thing that you're doing right, it's your side hustle.
It's your side gig.
He was like, well, maybe, yeah.
4:34
And I think First off, you know, kudos to him for being able to realize and admit that.
But I think that that was is such a core issue for many of us is that we present these socially acceptable solutions to ourselves when deep down, the reason that we're doing them is not for the right reason.
4:52
And so in this instance, he's using it as a foil to protect himself against having to confront the realities of life, of business, of the marketplace, of not being good enough.
Right.
Yet.
And so I said, all right, well, what do you want to have happen in your life?
5:09
Do you think you want to have a job?
And he was like, no, I don't want to have a job.
Like, what do you want to do?
He's like, I want to have my own business.
And I was like, what do you think Business School looks like in the real world?
He was like, well, probably.
Doing business, I was like, OK, so if you have four years and $200,000, if you invest that in college versus investing $200,000 and four years into learning into trying to start your own business, which of them after four years do you think will get you closer to your goal?
5:39
He was like we'll probably the business one and I was like OK so then right now what you have is a clear, logical, logical outcome in terms of which decision path to make.
But then now we have to start looking at what's the emotional driver that's preventing you from doing it right.
5:55
And so for him, going all in means making the first real trade off he's ever made in life, right?
Because if you're newer or you have a job or you're, you know, it doesn't matter where you're at in your life.
There.
A lot of times, especially when we're younger, there's there's fewer big branch points, right?
6:15
But as we get older, we have to commit and trade off.
Something else, right?
It's this for that.
And I think, excuse me, sorry, I think that a lot of times we have to frame these things in terms of the things that we're willing to sacrifice.
And so I told him the story of when I was starting my gym.
6:33
The mindset that I approached it with was I will not outwork everyone, but instead I will out sacrifice anyone.
And So what I meant by that is I'm willing to put everything and anything that I have on the altar of my success.
6:50
And that's what I started from a mindset standpoint.
So I wasn't like, I'm going to be smarter or I'm going to do something else.
I just knew that anytime my competitors or other people were going out or they were, you know, seeing friends or playing video games or watching football games, which I used to do all the time before I started a business.
7:07
Or sleeping in or just all the the many things, you know, even honestly, my fitness even suffered during that period of time.
I'm not saying it's perfect, but I'm saying I was willing to do, I was willing to sacrifice anything to get to where I wanted to go.
And I I introduced that kind of concept to him of like you tell me you want these things.
7:25
And yet, when it comes time to sacrifice, to pay the piper, to make the tradeoffs that are that are necessary to have that outcome, that's when you're faltering.
And so do you.
Are you willing to sacrifice for the things that you want in the long run?
7:43
And I was like, because he's my neighbor and we live in a nice neighborhood.
I said, like, I'm the age I am and we live here.
I was like, I sacrifice my 20s straight up.
I sacrifice them.
And I'm not saying it's the right path, but I want to make sure that whatever decision you make, you make it for the right reasons.
7:59
If you want to go four years in college, do it by all means, but understand the reason you're doing it.
It's because you believe that four years of from college and spending $200,000 is the best use of your time.
And then having the story that you'll have to tell yourself about the type of person who makes these types of decisions and then you'll have to live with that.
8:23
Because The thing is, is the stories that we tell ourselves are create the identity that we that we have, right?
My favorite scenes in Matrix is in the third one.
I know people don't like the second and third.
I like all three, is when Morpheus is standing in front of all of humanity.
And he says, I can tell you that I stand here truthfully unafraid, not because of the path that lies before us, but because of the path that lies behind me.
8:49
And I think that's such a deep message, because where we are is because of the stories that we have that have led us to be who we've become.
And when we make these choices, I think just as important, if not more important, is the story that we are telling ourselves about why we made the choices.
9:06
And what that tells us about who we are.
Real quick, guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, showed it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
9:24
My only ass is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so I wanted to clarify the decision for him in terms of, is this what you want, yes or no?
9:44
Of these two paths, which one will get you closer to that thing?
Yes.
Like this one or this one?
Cool.
Now why are you not making it, which now goes from logic to emotion?
And then at that point saying, OK, I think we've discovered the rude issue, which is that you're afraid is being seen as a failure if you're not immediately successful.
10:03
And So what I wanted to give to him was.
If you fail, it does not make you a failure.
It means that you failed.
And part of entrepreneurship is failure and being able to deal with failure and how you come back from failure.
And I said, right now you're in this instance where this is the first real big hit life has ever given you, right?
10:21
Everything's relative.
But in his life at this moment, this is the biggest thing, worst thing that's ever happened, right, This bad issue that he had it with his school.
And so I said the story that you now get to tell is what you do from here.
Right.
Do you use this as the catalyst to realize that you actually don't aren't interested in the school stuff and you never have been?
10:42
And I've always wanted to do the entrepreneur thing, but it's been a side hustling.
You've never fully committed to it.
I was like, is that, is that the story you want to tell?
Or do you want to go and try and fight this thing and try and beat it and then spend you know, another 3 1/2 years spending more money and then be another 3.1 student that graduates from Pepperdine right?
11:04
Which one is the story that you want to tell?
And so I think I wanted to share the story with you because I don't know where you're at or what decisions you're facing.
But I think there was a lot of many things that we kind of covered in that conversation and unearthed.
And so many of us know what we need to do but have some emotional trigger that's stopping us from doing it.
11:24
And I think digging deep and saying, like, what am I afraid of happening?
What's my biggest fear?
Because if I know this is what I need to do, then why am I not doing it?
And I think if you can simply name the fear of what you are afraid of, it allows you to face it and it removes the power it has over you.
11:40
Because then you you have clarity.
And then it's simply Am I willing to let my fear of failure stop me from having what I want to eventually have in my life?
Or would I rather let that have me walk down a path that never actually helps me realize my potential?
11:58
And so when you think about a maybe versus a never, then I'll take a maybe over a never any day of the week.
And so like I said, I don't know where you're at.
I don't know what trade-offs are facing.
I don't know what sacrifices you may have to make in order to get to where you want to go.
But I think literally listing those things out of what you were willing to give up.
12:16
There was a point in my life where I, I wrote down all the things that I had to additionally give up because I was at a point of just rubber meeting the road and I had to push harder.
And this is probably three or four years in my entrepreneurial journey.
And I remember making this video about that where I actively gave up football on Sundays, which was like a thing that I enjoyed, you know, watching.
12:36
I know that I gave up all TV of all kinds, even like the wind down TVI gave up any kind of going out.
And I'm not saying that you have to do that.
I'm just saying that that's what I did.
And I know that this kid's father was like, hey, you need to have balance.
12:54
You need to, you need to be able to enjoy life.
You're still young and.
My father, when I was younger, really hit on that really hard.
And I really pushed back.
And I still pretty much do because I don't believe that anything great was ever accomplished by someone who was balanced.
13:10
I think that it takes extremes, it takes extreme effort, it takes unreasonable sacrifice in order to achieve things that are unreasonable.
And so, you know, and I was telling him yesterday, the kid, not my dad, if.
You were competing against someone else who was a coder.
13:28
You guys are both coding software, right?
I was like, and you're going to college, you're having fun, you're going out on weekends and you know you code a couple hours a day versus the kid who drops out of college code 16 hours a day, doesn't go out, doesn't see his friends, just codes.
13:44
For 3 1/2 years, I was like, who do you think will be further on?
He was like, well, the other kid and I was like, right.
I was like, how much further along he was, Like, probably a lot further.
And I was like, right.
Do you think it's reasonable or unreasonable that he would be further ahead than you?
He's like reasonable.
And I was like, so why would you not want to take the reasonable bet that you will be so much further ahead by making that choice?
14:04
And so all that to say, I don't know any people who are really successful who don't approach things in an unbalanced way.
And I think that there's a differentiation between seasons and your entire life.
What you do for a season of life doesn't have to be forever, but sometimes it does have to be for that season.
14:22
And sometimes you are uneven.
And so sometimes it's difficult to look, you know, at what I do now versus what I did to get here right.
If I, you know, I sacrificed my fitness for periods of time, right?
I'm not saying it was good.
I'm just saying I did.
There were times where I did not sleep as much as I probably should have.
14:41
There were times where I did not see I didn't do anything social at all for months.
I'm not saying it was right, I'm just saying that's what ended up happening.
And when I hear stories of many people who kind of go through the shit who go through their Rocky Balboa period, the Rocky cutscene, almost every hyper successful person that I've seen goes through a three to five year period where they just get hit in the face day after day after day after day.
15:06
You know some of the some of the great market or some of you guys may have heard of, you know, Russell Brunson pitched for five straight years on stages unknown, before he became Russell Brunson.
You know Billie Jean did cold calling for 2-3 years.
Dan Kennedy did face to face, door to door sales for three years, right?
15:21
I did 4001 on one consultations over 4 year period, selling fitness, doing 1520 appointments a day, right?
And The thing is, is like I wasn't Alex for Mosey then.
I was just a dude who was selling and just getting better and better.
And The thing is that there's this unreasonable amount of effort, this unreasonable amount of sacrifice that usually has to go in to get the unreasonable goal, and yet people are not willing to make the sacrifice to do it.
15:43
And so I think if we can simply look at what is the decision that's going to get me to where I want to go, which of these do I think will be better?
And then what is the sacrifice that's required and am I willing to make that sacrifice Then I think it'll, it makes much simpler decisions and we know why we're making decisions.
We are so that decisions are not made for us by life.








0:00
My last book, $100 Million Offers, just crossed its one year anniversary and sold over 200,000 copies with no publisher, no advertising campaign.
I launched it before I had an audience truly off of word of mouth.
Alex Wilmazy just launched a brand new book.
It's $100 million offers, $100 million offers, and so people read the book and shared the book you need to create Grand Slam off.
0:18
If people aren't sharing it on their own, then it's not worth promoting because it's not good enough.
I think that when I die, the thing that I will be most proud of is not the businesses that I've built, but the books that I've written.
I think the books will outlive anything else, and I think that they will help more people.
That's why I spend right now about 20 to 25 hours a week, every week on my book.
0:37
Most authors pretty much only do that.
They write for four or five hours a day and then they end their day.
For me, I write for four or five hours and then I start my day.
And so I wanted to do 1 deep dive video into my writing process.
The most powerful ability in the world to influence other people is the ability to tell stories.
0:52
That's because you can both educate and entertain with stories.
It literally changes people's brain waves when they're listening to a story, and they become more suggestible.
So I'm going to break down the elements of storytelling.
How to edit a story to make it better, how to increase the stakes that make it interesting to a reader.
And then how to do it in such a way that you're actually breaking someone's belief so that you can actually influence how they behave.
1:12
And once you have that ability, you can use it to sell.
You can use it to educate, you can use it to teach, to reshape someone's beliefs, you can change someone's character.
You can give skills like there's endless ways and it's the most effective way to communicate to other people that there is.
If you want to write a book, the way that I outline these things is what's the point of writing this book to begin with?
1:31
What is the problem that I'm solving?
The vast majority of books that are written right now are not written because they want to serve the audience.
They're written because the author wants to make money from the book, accolades, whatever.
Most books are not worth reading when writing, and publishing a book became easier was about the 1960s.
From that point, going forward, the amount of books that were published, you know, has exploded. 1.6 million books are written per year.
1:51
The reason people published has changed.
But I believe that great writing comes from a place of wanting to add to the body of knowledge.
And when you do that, then it allows to compress five years into three hours or 4 hours or somebody, and that's where a book becomes valuable.
Next is kind of like, how do you come up with a big idea?
2:06
And then after that I'll talk about the editing stuff from a big idea standpoint.
This is what actually takes me the longest period of time, which is narrowing down the focus of the book to a single problem to be solved.
I have to answer the question very truthfully, what do I want someone to get from this book?
The first book offers is people don't know what to sell.
And so that's the first problem somebody has before they can make money is they have to know what they're actually going to sell someone, which is is the offer.
2:25
And so that's why I started my book series there.
The next problem is they don't have anyone to sell it to.
They need leads.
And so the idea is that when someone's going to meet somebody else, I have to think, like, where does my book come out in the wild?
Just saying, like, oh, I read this great book, You should read it.
Some people read that.
But where I think it's best is where someone's like, dude, I wish I had more leads.
2:42
People are like, oh, if you're suffering from that, you have to read this book because now it's a solution to someone's problem.
The problem with most books is that they don't actually solve anyone's problem because they basically name hundreds of problems and don't completely solve them.
So I would rather very narrowly define the problem and then solve it completely.
2:58
A good book is a complete solution to a narrowly defined problem.
And So what is the problem that we're solving?
And then what are the ways that I would think about solving the problem?
Usually it's going to be 3 to 6 big buckets that are going to fit for solving a specific problem.
Once I have those buckets, I'm going to think, what are the experiences that I've had that have shaped this belief that I have about this?
3:14
Like, why do I think there are these three to six buckets?
It's like, well, this is what happened in this time.
That's what shaped this part.
And this is what happened this time.
This was shaped that part.
When I saw the charity event at Arnold Schwarzenegger's home that we were invited to, I saw scarcity in action about how how are they able to sell these things that were never normally worth more than $10,000 for $100,000.
3:31
There was all these other factors at play.
And so it was a very good story for me to transfer, like why scarcity is important.
There's lots of different frameworks for trading stories.
I will give you the one that has been useful for me.
You have a setting, which is where this is happening.
You have the character, the person who's doing the doing.
You have the desire, which is the thing they want.
3:47
You have some sort of struggle.
Why they can't get it.
You have some sort of Eureka moment that changes things, achieving the victory and then some sort of resolution.
They talk about this as the heroes. 2 journeys, but not all stories have heroes that have two journeys.
But the externally internal and you want to tell both.
The external is what you can see with your eyes if you were in the room.
4:05
The internal is what you'd have to experience as the person emotionally and see.
We want to weave both of those together in the story And so someone might have the victory but it might feel empty.
And so it's like we want to tell both sides of that.
There's two kind of rules of thought that I use.
One is I want to use all 5 senses.
So I talk about I smell what I hear, what I see, see what I can touch, how things feel like I could feel the back of the chair against me.
4:24
My back was sore cuz I've been sitting for hours.
So I could set the setting that way by kind of describing rather than telling #2 is you want to show rather than telling.
So I'll give an example that Stephen King uses in his book on writing, which is a great book.
Instead of saying Cheryl walked in, she was his exwife, he might say something like he stroke the spot on his finger that was still bleached from where his wedding ring used to be.
4:42
You show the situation to the reader rather than telling them.
And that is also true of great copy, of great marketing, Of great ads is that you want to demonstrate rather than saying it.
Well then what details do you include?
Because I could spend an entire book to describe this room, but if I just said there was a pelt on the wall and it's made of wood and there was a view of water and and pine trees, you probably have an idea of what kind of place this is.
5:05
You want to be selective about the details that you're choosing to call out because otherwise you're just wasting time.
Now, if the pelt that I have on the wall in my mind's eye is a deer and in your mind is a Buffalo, does it change the story?
And if the answer is no, then we don't need to go in more detail on it.
5:20
You want to be vivid in your description about the things that matter.
For me, I've always had stories heavily ingrained in books because I want to bring the experience that taught the lesson with it, because then it gives context to why the framework that I introduced in that chapter is useful.
So what makes a story interesting?
5:36
I like to think of it as one main thing, which is steaks and struggle.
I can give you a simple story.
I was at home, I was hungry.
I couldn't find any food.
I realized I had my phone and I ordered Ubereats.
Ubereats arrived.
I ate.
I was satisfied.
5:52
That is a story.
It's not a very interesting story, but it is a story.
If I tell that same story and I were to say I was hungry, I'm a diabetic, if I don't eat, I could die and there was no food in the house.
As I was rummaging around, my vision started to narrow.
I started getting cold sweats, and I was like, am I going to be able to get food before I pass out?
6:10
My family's out of town.
They're not going to be able to find me.
And so I started having thoughts about like, is this how they're going to find me?
My body on the floor?
What are my kids going to think all of a sudden?
I created stakes in the story.
The reason game shows are inherently interesting is that they literally put money on it so that there are stakes.
6:26
That's why those exist.
Imagine you were watching a bunch of poker players play and the chips were meaningless.
Like, stakes is what makes things interesting.
So there was a textbook that my buddy Dr. Kashi also sent me to create better ads, write better copy, and ultimately write things that are more interesting.
6:42
What are the factors of newsworthiness?
And so if you think about newsworthiness, it's just what are things that make things interesting?
And so there were seven components.
The more of these components that you can tie into a story, the more of a story it is.
And they literally even talk about stories in the news, like what's the story?
The first one is recency, how far away the event was to the things.
7:00
If you think about, you know, hopping on trends as fast as possible when you're telling stories, the recency with which the thing occurred to when you're telling the story makes it more interesting.
The second one is impact of the event.
So there's a story, but it has no impact on the reader or the listener.
It's going to be limited, which is why it's on the job of the author to a select the stories that they're going to tell and then make sure that they're bridging why this is important for you as they're telling the story and then they tie it to the action items, especially if you're teaching that you want someone to take as a result of that.
7:25
The third is prominence, like if Kim Kardashian sneezes, it becomes interesting because of how prominent she is.
And so if you can involve characters that have prominence in a story, then you make the story more interesting in and of itself.
The next one is proximity.
So it's close to homeness, if you will.
If I tell you a story of a house that's burning down, it might be kind of interesting, but if I told you it was your neighbor next door, it's probably much more interesting to you.
7:47
If you have an ad in your marketing to a local market, the closer you can get the headline, if it says rather than like Baltimore MD, it says Towson MD, which is a sub suburb or whatever, they're going to be much more inclined to listen to it.
The next thing that makes something interesting is conflict, whether that's natural or whether it's between people.
We're here recording this video, and a man with a gun walks in.
8:05
All of a sudden, this got way more interesting.
And so it's because there's conflict, there's tension and there's unresolved, There's mystery.
The next one is, how unusual is this thing?
Is there something odd or bizarre or unique about this particular situation or story?
Like if you see something that you expect, your brain doesn't say, oh, let's pay more attention to this because it matches the patterns that you expect.
8:23
And so the idea is that you want someone to cast a pattern or expectation on your story, and then all of a sudden you shift it and they're like, whoa.
And then their brain will divert resources towards the story because it's not matching the patterns that they already had in their mind.
Which means they need to create attention to reconcile the conflict between what they expect and what is reality.
8:40
And the last one is the amount of times you can update.
This is a little bit more around news, but it's like how many times can you update someone on the same thing, right?
That's why news stories love giving updates up.
We're pressing news right from the crime scene.
When you're telling a story, might not be always able to do that.
If you're fixed in a story setting, you don't have to have all of these things.
8:55
But if you have two, three, you know of these things in one story, it makes it a much more interesting story.
Hey guys, the much awaited sequel, $200 million offers is $100 million leads.
It is coming out in the next 12 months.
Realistically probably six months if you want to get on the early bird list because last time we sold out in less than an hour.
9:12
So if you want to get on the early bird list and just make sure that you have a guaranteed copy ready for you for distribution, so you're going to use it and get it.
More leads in your business, go to acquisition.com anywhere and just opt in.
And then you'll get automatically added to that list that we can send you the link the moment it launches.
Once you have that, you have a way to tell a story.
9:30
Now it's like, OK, well then how do I bridge that into a wireframe for a book?
And so for me, my general rule of thumb is that I just put stories in where I feel like it starts to get heavy.
I want to deliver as much of the things they need to do in their business.
And right when I start to feel like it's heavy, I zoom out and I create a story that creates more context.
And we dive back in.
I have my big problem, the supporting arguments that lead up to that single thing.
9:48
And then I have the stories about how I learned each of those things to fill in the blanks for that book and then the framework for each chapter.
Now, once I have that, I have a general idea of how I want to go about solving that problem.
Everyone has different writing processes for me.
I go as far as I can until I realize that I have a logical inconsistency or an inconsistency with my own experiences that would prove my theory or model wrong at that point.
10:09
This is the part where most people don't want to do it.
I go back to the beginning, I adjust my assumptions, and then I restart the book and I write it again and I usually get a little further.
And then I realize that something is wrong with the model.
And the bigger it is, the more I have to adjust the book and start over again.
Models have to be two things.
They have to be useful and they have to be valid.
10:26
There's too many things in life that you don't want to rediscover and redo the work.
So your brain creates these mental shortcuts, these mental checklists that you go through in your head.
A lot of them are not documented, so all the framework really is is documenting the checklist you already go through.
There's always a process everyone goes through to make a decision as simple as they may be.
Which cereal am I going to grab?
10:42
The one that's closest to me?
You know what I mean?
Like it could be as simple as that.
There's a framework that you use and it is useful.
Now the question is how valid is it?
And the validity of a framework depends on how many different circumstances it can be applied to and also still work.
The very valuable frameworks like E equals MC squared apply in everyone that we have found to date, which is what makes it so valid.
11:02
When I'm testing a framework, I know the situations it does work and so then I start testing it in new situations, seeing if it's still valid.
And if it isn't valid, I go back to the original framework and say how would I need to adjust this so it would incorporate both?
And then I test it in another situation, in another business situation until eventually I get a framework that I can't find a way that it's wrong.
11:19
The longest process for me is ideating all the pieces that are going to be in the book.
The next longest process is actually writing the first draft.
From there I go through my heavy editing of going from 12th grade language to 3rd grade language with more pictures.
My goal is that when someone reads the stuff that I have, that they spend as much of their mental capacity on consuming the concepts and not translating the words into things they understand.
11:41
The average American reads somewhere in the neighborhood of 5th to 7th grade, depending on where you read, which means half of Americans read.
Below that there's a free app called hemingwayapp.com that literally is just a paste box and when you paste your words into the box, it highlights it and says this is too complicated.
12:00
Adverb.
Pass it if you want to train yourself to be a better writer.
Using it gives you immediate feedback because as soon as you change it, the color changes.
And so when you talk about changing people's behavior, having something that immediately gives you feedback when you make a change is the best way to reinforce behavior quickly.
And so I think it's one of the best teaching writing tools that exist.
12:16
It's so simple, you will be amazed at how much better your writing comes.
So if you have a paragraph and you can eliminate a sentence and the paragraph's meaning stays the same, eliminate it.
If you can use shorter sentences versus a long sentence, it is better to use the shorter sentence.
If you have a shorter word, it is better to use it.
12:32
Try to eliminate adverbs whenever possible.
Really whenever possible.
Like whenever you're like.
I'm really not sure, still trying to eliminate it.
Most times when you see an adverb, it's because you did not use the right verb.
I walked quickly.
It would be much better to say I ran.
I always use simple tenses, so rather than like would have liked to, I just say wanted or wanted to.
12:52
If you can't make something sound simple, it's because you don't get it.
Not them.
From there I go and send it to 4 to 8 of my, like, ideal readers, people whose opinions I value but don't hold me in high enough esteem that they're not gonna tell me the truth.
So they're like, hey, I had questions here, or this didn't make sense, or this sounded a contradiction to something else, whatever.
13:09
And so they send me back their notes again.
I used Stephen King because he's just like my hero for writing, but he's like if you get lots of different feedback from everyone, then you did a good job.
If everyone's saying the same thing he's like you probably should change it.
Once I get the feedback from those readers, I create what would be considered my third and final draft.
Then I send that to an editor for like grammar, typos, etc.
13:26
And then at that point I have what I would consider my finished book.
I spend 1000 hours on a book, roughly, and a lot of people can't comprehend that like level of work, which is also why most people can't make good stuff.
People think that writing a book is like just literally getting the word count to a book size and then slapping a cover on it and shipping it, which is why there are so many bad books.
13:45
There's this visual that Stephen King gives that I think is like the best visual, and it gave me hope about writing, he said.
Writing is walking uphill with a bag of rocks where you keep adding rocks the higher up the hill you go.
So the longer you've been writing something, the heavier it feels.
14:01
He's like you just have to have the endurance to be able to go through the hard work, pruning through the writing and killing the darlings where you're like, I spent so much time on the section, but it shouldn't be in the book.
With this particular book, I went through eight full drafts, so it's about 600 pages of writing to create what is now 200 pages of version eight of the book.
14:21
So with the leads book, I can tell you the sections of the book are understanding how to talk about leads, get leads, get other people to get you leads, get even more leads do it.
Those are the sections of the book, right?
Like that's very simple.
And then within each of those subsections is the different types of ways that you can collect leads And so, but all of them align to that single point which is how do I get people more leads If this thing that I'm writing does not apply to that, you take it out.
14:42
I'm shooting for a book a year.
We'll see if I get there.
But like, that's what that's my like mental back of napkin goal is, you know, I still have to like run all the companies and make these videos and stuff.
So if you took some takeaways that you can write into your stories, into the content that you make, into your marketing, into your advertising, into the stuff you use to sell people's things.

What's going on guys?
I have a special special surprise for you.
This is not announced publicly, so you guys will be the first one to hear it, but I have actually made my 100 million.
Dollar offers audio book which has been available on Amazon for the last two years and it's been top 100 throughout that whole time.
0:16
It's now here.
Free for you guys and I did that because I just want more people to have it and more people to share it, so.
The next few chapters and episodes will be directly from the audio book for your listening pleasure and my my only ask is that that you share it, share it with somebody who you think it would benefit from, and it would just mean the world to me and hopefully to them.
0:41
Enjoy.
Welcome to the special edition of $100 Million Offers.
In this episode Collab with the game we will be going.
Over opening credits, dedication, start Here, How We Got here, and Grand Slam offers.
And I hope you enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed making it for you.
1:00
And if it does provide you value, I hope you'll share it with a friend.
Acquisition.com Publishing is proud to present acquisition.com Volume One 100. $1,000,000 offers How to Make Offers So Good People Feel Stupid.
1:15
Saying No.
Written and performed by Alex Tremozi.
Guiding Principles.
There are no rules.
Dedication to Layla you are my ride or die.
A term used to describe a person, usually a woman, that is willing to do anything for their partner, friend, or family, even in the face of danger.
1:36
Couldn't do this without you and wouldn't want to you make waking up every day worth it.
Thank you for being unapologetically you, you're a downed motherfucker.
To Trevor, you're the best friend a guy could ask for.
Thank you for spending hours upon hours beating up the ideas that became this book with me.
1:53
It would not have been half as good as it is without your relentless drive for simplification and clarity.
Eternally grateful for our friendship.
You make me feel less alone in this world.
Cheers to becoming old and crotchety.
Start here.
Outsize returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right.
2:15
Given a 10% chance of 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time.
But you're still going to be wrong 9 times out of 10.
We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot, but you're also going to hit some home runs.
The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution.
2:34
When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is 4 in business.
Every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1000 runs.
This longtail distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold.
Big winners pay for so many experiments, Jeff.
2:52
Basis As entrepreneurs, we make bets every day.
We are gamblers, gambling our hard earned money on labor, inventory, rent, marketing, etcetera, all with the hopes of a higher payout.
Often times we lose, but sometimes we win and win big.
3:09
However, there's a difference between gambling in business and gambling in a casino.
In a casino, the odds are stacked against you.
With skill.
You can improve them but never beat them.
In contrast, in business you can improve your skills to shift the odds in your favor.
3:25
Simply stated, with enough skill you can become the house.
After beginning a series of books on acquisition, it became apparent that I could not talk about any other topic without first addressing the offer.
The starting point of any conversation to initiate a transaction with a customer, what you are literally providing them in exchange for their money.
3:46
That's where it all begins.
This book is about how to make profitable offers, specifically, how to reliably turn advertising dollars into enormous profits using a combination of pricing, value guarantees, and naming strategies.
I call the proper combination of these components a Grand Slam offer.
4:04
I chose this term partially in homage to the above quote from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and because like a Grand Slam in baseball, a Grand Slam offer is both very good and very rare.
Additionally, to extend the baseball metaphor, it takes no more effort to make a Grand Slam offer than to strike out.
4:20
The difference is dictated by the skill of the marketer and how well he connects his offer with his audience's desires.
In business, you can have so SO offers the singles and double s that keep the game going, pay the bills, and keep the lights on.
But unlike baseball, where a Grand Slam scores a maximum of four runs, a Grand Slam offer in the business world can score you 1000 full payoff and a result.
4:43
In a world where you never need to work again, it would be like connecting with the ball so well during one single at bat that you automatically win every World Series for the next 100 years.
It takes years of practice to make something as complicated as hitting a Major League fastball into the bleachers look effortless.
4:59
Your stance, vision prediction, ball speed, bat speed and hip placement all must be perfect in marketing and customer acquisition.
The process of getting new customers.
There are just as many variables that must all align to truly knock it out of the park.
But with enough practice and enough skill, you can turn the wild world of acquisition, which will throw curveballs at you every day, into a Home Run Derby knocking offer after offer out of the stadium.
5:25
To everyone else, your success will look unbelievable, but to you it will just feel like just another day at work.
The greatest hitters of all time also have many strikeouts, just as there are many failed offers in the track record of great marketers.
We learn skills through failure and practice.
5:41
We do this knowing that nine times out of 10 we will be wrong.
We still act boldly, hoping for that offer we connect with so well that it results in our big payoff.
The good news is that in business, you only need to hit one Grand Slam offer to retire forever.
I have done this four or five times in my life.
5:58
As for my track record, I have a 36 to one lifetime return on my advertising dollars over my business career.
Consider this my lifetime batting average, if you will.
That means for every $1.00 I spend on advertising, I get $36 back, a 3600% return.
6:14
That is my average over 8 years, and I continue to improve.
This book is my attempt to share that skill with you, with a specific focus on building Grand Slam offers so you can experience the same levels of success.
It's also the first in a series of books meant to get entrepreneurs to financial freedom.
6:31
In plain words, fuck you money.
Subsequent books in the series will look more deeply at getting more customers, converting more prospects into clients, making those clients worth more, and other lessons I wish I had learned earlier in scaling my businesses.
Pro tip.
Faster, deeper learning by reading and listening at the same time.
6:48
Here's a life hack I discovered a long time ago.
If you listen to the audio book while reading the e-book or physical book, you will increase your reading speed and retain more information.
The contents are being stored in more places in your brain.
This is how I read most things worth reading.
I've priced my products as cheap as the platforms.
Or allow me so this is an employee to make an extra $0.99 promise.
7:07
If you want to give it a try, go ahead and grab the audio version and see for yourself.
You might find it as valuable as I have as someone who struggles to stay focused.
It took two days to talk this book out loud and record it.
I figured I'd put this hack at the beginning of the book so you had a chance to do it if you found the first chapter valuable enough to earn your attention.
7:26
Section 1 How We Got Here, The Ugly Truth, Chapter One.
How We Got Here Magic will find those with pure hearts, even when all seems lost.
Morgan Rhodes, December 24th, 2016, Christmas Eve.
The room was pitch black, my shoes stuck to a floor covered in dried soda and crushed bits of candy.
7:48
My nostrils were full with the smell of stale popcorn.
We had just shown up too late to get good seats and ended up pressed near the front of the theater, just a few rows in front of me.
The movie's blazing projection occupied my entire field of view.
In the reflective glow, I could see the outlines of Layla's family's faces.
8:05
They may as well have been hypnotized.
I envied them.
They sat entranced, soaking in their paid time off for Christmas.
Must be nice.
Anybody else would have missed it.
But Leila, my girlfriend at the time, knew me too well.
Anybody else would have thought I was watching the movie, but Leila could tell.
8:21
I was staring blankly at the screen, my eyes not tracking with the movie.
My face was pale.
My cheekbones and jawline appeared gone.
Weeks of chronic stress had killed my appetite.
What's wrong?
She asked.
I didn't answer.
She rested her hand on mine to get my attention.
I didn't react.
8:37
Within moments, her fingers tightened around my wrist and she looked at me, her eyes searching for mine.
Your heart is racing, she whispered, concerned.
Without asking.
She took my pulse.
It was 100 beats per minute, nearly twice what it should be for a fit 27 year old male at rest in a cool, dark room.
8:55
What's going on?
She asked, more forcibly.
It's still whispering.
The truth is, I was terrified.
A few hours earlier.
I looked like a giant.
I sat scrunched up in a children's miniature play chair.
My knees almost touched my chest.
Even with my feet firmly planted on the old beige carpeted floor.
9:14
My laptop felt hot, sitting atop my steeply angled knees.
Dolls and toys were scattered around me.
They stared at me with wide eyes and toothy grids, motionless.
I had been there entertainment for the past few weeks.
I was in Layla's parents house.
They had recently become grandparents and used the spare bedroom as a playroom when their children visited.
9:33
I didn't have a place to live so they were letting Layla and I stay there quote as long as we needed.
End Quote.
They had let me use the children's playroom as my office for my business, which at this point felt almost as make believe as the stories they had told their grandchildren In this room.
I literally felt like I was playing dress up, except the stakes were real and this was my life.
9:52
My ears were hot and red from the phone being pressed against them for what felt like ours.
I kept switching hands because my arms would tire from holding the phone up for so long.
I'm sorry, Mr. Homozy.
The voice on the other end of the line said we have to hold on to these funds for the next six months.
We've seen some irregular activity, so this is precautionary.
10:11
Are you fucking kidding me?
120 grand.
I said a precaution.
I'm sorry, Sir.
Our underwriting team.
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.
I said cutting him off.
I don't accept that, Sir.
It's not up to me.
It's just our.
What am I going to tell my salesman there's a baby on the way?
And another one.
Are you going to tell him he's not going to buy his pregnant wife and newborn food?
10:29
Are you going to pay his mortgage for him?
I was seething, Sir, the beginning in with unfazed apathy, just trying to deliver the news.
It's not yours to take.
My aggression was quickly turning into desperation.
Shit, just send me half so I can pay my employees.
10:45
It's Christmas Eve.
For fuck's sake, Sir.
We're going to be holding on to the entire of your funds for the next six months, per your agreement.
The voice faded into the distance.
Fuck.
I hang up and check my accounts $23,036.
I owed my salesman a $22,000 Commission check for 120,000 in sales I never got.
11:06
Without wanting to give myself the opportunity to think about it, I wired it to him -22,000 payment, successful balance, 1036 dollars.
Fuck.
The sunlight blinded me as we emerge from the matinee family shuffled in and out through the revolving doors, making their happy memories.
11:26
I was in a daze.
Lela led me to the car, her hand wrapped firmly around mine.
What's wrong?
What happened?
She asked.
The money isn't coming.
What do you mean it's delayed?
I exhaled In defeat.
They're keeping it all.
Can they do that?
Apparently, I said stoically, trying to maintain my composure in front of her parents.
11:46
What are you going to do about the commissions?
I already paid him everything, I said without looking at her.
Lela's concern turned to dread.
We sat in silence the whole way home.
I stared out the window.
She held my hand in hers.
It was more comforting than I anticipated.
We'll get through this. 30 days earlier, I decided to go all in on this new business I called Gym Watch.
12:08
Here was the idea.
I would fly around the country to gyms and fill them up to full capacity using this new methodology that hinged on an offer I had perfected when I owned my chain of gyms.
Leading up to this moment, I had sold five of my 6 gyms.
The funds from selling them My life's work I'd put into an account that I had with a new Bartner.
12:26
This money was supposed to be the seed money for our new company.
I was finally going to realize some level of success.
My alarm went off.
I groggily swung my arm over, blindly clawing at the bedside table.
I switched off the alarm.
Well, Layla somehow managed to sleep through the commotion.
12:43
I laid there, silently pulling up the bank accounts, a daily ritual.
The balance said $300.00.
Wait, that can be right.
There was 46,000 in here yesterday.
My adrenaline surged.
Looking closer, I saw minus 45,700 payment successful.
I was frantic.
12:59
The money from selling all my gyms was gone.
I checked where the money went to my quote partner.
End Quote.
He had taken all the money out.
Fuck.
The last four years of my life had vanished that fast.
I officially had nothing and even last to show for it.
13:15
No gyms, no equipment, no employees, nothing.
I felt dead inside.
Adding insult to injury, in that same 30 day period my mother was in critical condition because of a near fatal accident and was still under 24 hour supervision and I had told him my car in a head on collision at 60 miles an hour and earned ADUI as my consolation prize.
13:35
This was the cherry on top.
My one saving grace during this time was selling a new challenge offer at a gym and collecting all the cash up front as my fee for turning their business around.
So I did the only thing I knew I sold.
My salesman had done 120,000 in a single month, and I owed him $22,000 in commissions.
13:52
The problem was, the 120,000 never came.
We need to talk, I said as Leyland.
I went to the other room.
I woke up to the courage to speak, but stared at the floor, embarrassed.
I've got nothing, I said to her.
I'm a sinking ship and you don't have to stay here with me.
She grabbed my chin and pulled my face towards hers so she could look into my eyes.
14:12
I would sleep with you under bridge if it came to that.
I would have cried tears of joy, but I was so emotionally exhausted that my response appeared.
Apathetic.
I wouldn't stay with me.
So we still going to do these launches starting tomorrow?
She asked.
All my friends quit their jobs to do this.
She was being matter of fact, but it still stuck.
14:29
I felt defeated.
Listen, this could go horribly wrong.
I trust you.
We'll figure it out.
I had two things left at this point, a Grand Slam offer and an old business credit card with $100,000 limit from when I had my gyms on the day after Christmas, two days after the gut wrenching call with the payment processor, we were scheduled to launch six new gyms at the same time between airfare, hotels, Rona, cars, gas and ad spend, all multiplied by six.
14:55
I was going to be spending $3300 per day of money I didn't have.
My last dollar had gone to paying my salesman.
I still remember my handshaking as the advertisement went live off to on.
Just like that I was going into debt at a rate of $412.00 per working hour.
15:14
Just like that, $3300 per day begin getting deducted from my account -3300.
I now officially have nothing -3300.
I now officially have less than nothing -3300.
I have $10,000 less than nothing -3300.
15:31
This one decision is going to ruin my future forever.
But things started shaping up.
Here's what happened that month, January 2017, as documented by my old processing records I dug up in the physical book, there's a chart that I am referencing.
You can see the month along the left column and the revenue collected on that month along the right.
15:51
We made $100,117.00.
It was just enough to cover the $3300 a day that had been coming off the credit card.
It was actually working.
I could hardly believe it.
I threw the Hail Mary and the universe had caught it.
I went from looking up bankruptcy lawyers to figuring out what to do with $3,000,000 in profits accrued within the first 12 months.
16:10
It felt surreal, and in hindsight, it still kind of does.
By the end of the year we were doing $1.5 million per month, 12 months from then, $4.4 million per month 24 months after that we crossed 120 million in sales and donated $2,000,000 to help fund equal opportunity in low income areas.
16:29
We met and befriended Arnold Schwarzenegger, my lifelong hero, and we were asked to become board members of his charity After School All Stars. 12 months after that.
We now have a portfolio of 7-8 figure and multi 8 figure companies across a variety of industries.
Photography, Publishing, Fitness, Business, consulting, beauty and business types, Rick and mortar chains, Software service, ecommerce, training and education.
16:52
Our portfolio companies now do about $1.6 million per week and growing.
I say this because honestly I can't believe it.
All of this was because of a girl who believed in me, a credit card and a Grand Slam offer.
I know I teleported you from rag to riches and the natural question is how.
17:08
That's what I'm going to use.
The rest of this book and the remaining books and free courses in acquisition.com to break down.
The skill of making offers saved me from bankruptcy and likely saved my life.
I've made so many mistakes in my life.
I've made so many bad life decisions.
I've hurt people knowingly and mistakenly.
17:24
I've done bad things with good intentions.
I say this because I am human.
I don't pretend to have the answers.
I have my own demons that I buy it all every day.
But despite my many shortcomings, I've still managed to get really good at this one thing and I'd like to share that with you.
I can teach you how to build great offers.
17:40
I don't know who you are.
Yes, you the one listening to this.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you for allowing me to do work I find meaningful.
Thank you for giving me the most valuable asset you have Your attention.
I promise to do my very best to give you a positive return on it.
Here's your first piece of good news.
If you are listening to this, then you already are in the top 10%.
17:59
Most people buy stuff and then promptly ignore it.
I can also throw out a spoiler.
The further you get in this book, the bigger the Nuggets become.
Just watch.
This book delivers.
The world needs more entrepreneurs.
It needs more fighters.
It needs more magic.
And that's what I'm sharing with you.
Magic.
18:18
Hey guys, real quick.
I don't know if you know this, but $100 Million Offers has a physical copy and a Kindle copy online, so you can go to Amazon and grab those if that's helpful.
For me, I prefer to read with my eyes and listen at the same time, and especially the books that I.
18:34
Refer to often.
I like having on my desk next to me so I can pull them up and use them to make money doing whatever it is that I'm doing.
Chapter 2, Grand Slam offers Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no.
Travis Jones I was 23 years old and to quote Ruth from Ozark, I didn't know shit about fuck.
18:55
But there I was in a Las Vegas penthouse hotel room, along with ten business owners learning about marketing and sales in my most fashionable Beast Mode Tshirt, a shirt I had gotten for free, and one of the five shirts I owned at the time.
Truthfully, I was anxious, selfconscious and thought I was making a huge mistake.
19:12
I paid $3000 of money.
I didn't have to get a seat at the table.
I knew I needed to learn.
Everyone there had a business except me.
I was planning on starting one at Gym.
TJ, the organizer had multiple successful businesses.
While going over the agenda, I remember he made an offhand comment about making $1,000,000 that year, $1 million.
19:32
I was felt about I want to be like this guy, do anything.
The problem was I didn't know what any of them were talking about.
KP I's, CP, L's, Conversion rates.
My head was spinning as I pretended like I knew what they were talking about, but I didn't.
And I'm bad at pretending.
Between sessions TJ found me, You could tell I was way over my head.
19:52
TJ was kind, curious, and caring.
After a little bit of small talk, he asked me a simple question that changed my life forever.
Do you want to know the secret to sales?
I had never sold anything in my life.
I never even read a book on it.
I just recently learned what the term even meant.
Seriously.
I lean forward, intent to download every syllable that he spoke right into my brain.
20:12
I opened my notebook and stared at him with intent.
I was ready for the secret.
He looked at me soberly and said make people on offer so good they would feel stupid saying now.
I nodded, wrote it down, underlined it, and circled it.
And with that my entire world view of selling was transformed.
20:28
Make people on offer so good they would feel stupid saying.
Now my mind was racing.
I didn't have to be skilled, or even any good.
I just had to come up with things that anyone would say yes to.
The greatest game of my life had now begun what this book is about.
20:45
At some point, every successful business owner was a entrepreneur, a person full of ideas and frustrated at having potential to spare.
Something clicks when they realize the horrible trade they and so many people make, trading their freedom for falsely perceived security.
Their discomfort compounds.
And once the discomfort of staying the same surpasses the discomfort of change, they take the leap.
21:05
I'm going to be an entrepreneur so I can be free, they tell themselves.
Free to do whatever I want, whenever I want, with whomever I want.
Some learned about entrepreneurship through personal development.
Others got into it through a franchise.
Others bought courses, and some just said fuck it, I'm doing it and I'll make it work.
21:21
And make it work they did.
Most of us opened up shop with the intention of helping people in some way.
Many times this assistance is in some way related to something that's affected us personally.
We set out to give back by providing to others, by helping them solve a problem that once plagued us.
Then again, sometimes this isn't our way.
21:38
In neither case, we cling to the dream of making more and being freer than we are now.
Mavis thought naively that owning a business would be our crowding accomplishment, a final destination, when in reality it was just the beginning.
Somehow, in the transition between passionate to helping others and owning my first business, we gradually realized that we don't even know the first thing about business, let alone turning a profit.
22:00
We may know a lot about our passion, about why we started the business.
That doesn't mean we know anything about succeeding in business, much to the disappointment of idealists on the sidelines.
Succeeding in business means getting prospective customers to trade us money for our services, our passion for their hard earned coins.
22:15
That's the agreement.
The only way to facilitate that exchange, to transact, to literally carry out business as a business, is by making the prospect an offer.
What's an offer anyways?
The only way to conduct a business is through a value exchange, a trade of dollars for value.
22:33
The offer is what initiates this trade.
In a nutshell, the offer is the goods and services you agree to provide, how you accept payment, and the terms of the agreement.
It is what begins the process of getting customers and making money.
It is the first thing that any new customer will interact with in your business.
22:49
Since the offers would attract new customers.
It is the lifeblood of your business.
No offer, no business, no life.
Bad offer, Negative profit.
No business.
Miserable life.
Decent offer, no profit.
Stagnating business.
Stagnating life.
Good offer some profit.
23:06
OK Business.
OK life.
Grand Slam offer.
Fantastic profit.
Insane business freedom.
This book helps entrepreneurs craft those Grand Slam offers.
These are the offers that are so effective, profitable, and life changing that it seems like they could only be the result of luck.
23:22
That's how it looks to an untrained eye, anyway.
As you likely know now, I have crafted thousands of offers over the last decade.
Most have failed, some did OK and some struck gold, but I never really knew why.
As Doctor Bergelman, a famous Stanford Business School professor, said, it is far better to understand why you failed than to be ignorant of why you succeeded.
23:44
But as the data started rolling in, what seemed like luck and fortune was closer to a repeatable framework.
I've been fortunate enough to strike gold enough times to document these frameworks, and have gotten lightning to strike twice.
I've put the steps and components of those frameworks in a logical and digestible format so they're actually useful today.
24:02
Like now I'm giving you action instead of a sad but typical book of vague business theories and mental masturbation.
The two main problems most entrepreneurs face and how this book solves them.
Although you can make a list of the problems you face a mile long, which is a great way to stress yourself out, all these problems typically stem from the big two kahunas 1.
24:24
Not enough clients, 2 not enough cash.
In other words, excess profit at the end of the month Seems obvious, right?
It costs more time and money to get clients, thereby solving issue one.
And that money is coming from the profit margins which create problem too.
What's more, annoying Prospects savagely compare and belittle our services in favor of cheaper and crappier alternatives, with the cheapest 1 winning.
24:45
This of course, when winning means getting to work for more for even less.
Sad face, let's see you've slashed prices to get more customers.
You may even have a full client look, but here you are barely making it because profit margins are too thin.
Competition becomes a race to the bottom.
If you're struggling with one or both of these issues, you're not alone.
25:04
I've been there, back.
I think every entrepreneur has the same challenges.
I also want you to know that it's not your fault.
Typical models weren't designed for profit maximization.
They were designed by companies who have built loads of funding and can operate at a loss for years.
When these models are used in the real world, business owners just barely get by.
25:20
They essentially buy themselves a job and work $100 a week to avoid working 40 crappy trade.
My guess is that if you're anything like me, you signed up for something better.
Keep an open mind.
The contents of this book, if executed, can transform your business fast.
It's OK if you're not into money numbers or business models.
25:36
I've done all that work for you.
I'm walking through the process step by step in these pages.
I'm going to explain each of the two big problems we touched on above in detail, including why they don't work.
Then I'm going to show you the solutions and to wrap this adventure up.
I'll explain how to enhance value to maximize how much you make per customer so that you can out market everyone and stack cash.
25:55
We use this offer model for every niche we work with Cairo's, dentists, gyms, agencies, plumbers, roofers, dog walkers, physical products, software, brick and mortar stores, and so many more.
And it's amazing how fast things can improve with each and every one of them when they use this framework.
What's in it for you?
26:13
I've made every dumb business mistake in the book.
Now you can learn from my embarrassing, brutal, multimillion dollar fuck ups without having to suffer the same pain yourself.
Building these businesses has been a very hard and emotional journey for me.
I wouldn't trade these experiences for the world.
However, if this book helps just one entrepreneur avoid suffering as I did, keep their business open or accomplish their dreams, it will all be worth it if you're willing to exchange the time it takes to watch two episodes of your favorite TV show and really study this book.
26:42
And if you implement even a single offer component, I can guarantee you will add more clients and more dollars to your bottom line.
Reading this book and taking it to heart will be the single greatest return on time for your business.
Nothing else will allow you to do what this book can do in the same amount of time.
That is a promise.
As a side benefit, implementing a new offer is about one of the easiest things to do in a business.
27:01
So you really can do this.
This isn't some management practice or culture building hoodoo.
This is the real how you sell shit for lots of money type stuff.
What's the name for me?
I give all these materials, this book, the accompany course, and all the books and courses which you can find at acquisition.com for free or at cost in order to help as many people as humanly possible make more and serve more.
27:23
I've made these with the intention of providing more value than you can get from $1000 course, any $30,000 coaching program, and hilariously, more than $200,000 college degree.
And I do this because although I could sell these materials in that format, I just don't want to.
I've made my money doing this stuff, not teaching how to do this stuff, contrary to most of the marketing community at large.
27:43
So my model is different.
I'll explain more in a second.
That being said, there are two key archetypes I'm trying to provide value to with my published materials for archetype #1 entrepreneurs under $3,000,000 per year in revenue.
My goal is to help you get there and earn your trust.
Try just a couple the taxes from this book, watch them work and try a few more, watch them work, and so on.
28:02
The more you see results in your own business, the better.
Once you succeed, you'll become archetype #2 entrepreneurs at minimum between three to 10 million a year in revenue.
Once you get there, or if that's you now, I'd be honored to invest in your business and help you cross 3050, even 100 million plus.
I don't sell coaching masterminds or courses or anything like that.
28:20
Instead, I have a portfolio of companies I take equity interest in.
I use the infrastructure, resources and teams of all my companies to fast track their growth.
But don't believe me yet?
We just met.
If you're curious, my business model is simple, just like the four piece pyramid logo of acquisition.com.
Step one provide value at no cost, foreign access to what the rest of the marketplace charges for.
28:41
Step 2.
Have entrepreneurs use the materials that actually work and make money, helping more folks.
Step three, earn the trust of the hyperexecutor business owners who use the frameworks to scale their businesses to three to $10 million per year and beyond.
Step 4.
Invest in those businesses to make more impact at scale while helping every single other entrepreneur for free.
28:59
If you look carefully at the process reverse engineer success, I think it's pretty cool.
Here's how I know these business owners can execute the frameworks I have without handling and therefore would be very likely to succeed with the next set of frameworks.
Getting to 30,000,050 million, 100 million looks different than getting to three to 10 million.
29:15
They know my style works for them because it already has.
So we operate on shared trust.
I trust they can execute and they trust that our stuff works again because it already has, all while helping everyone else vote for you.
So it allows me to preemptively avoid failures and dramatically increase success likelihood.
Let me show you how much.
29:32
At the time of this writing, every business I've started since March of 2017 has achieved a $1.5 million per month run rate, at least according to the Small Business Administration.
The odds of a single business even achieving $10 million a year, or 833,000 per month, which is almost half of what I just said, are .4% or one in 250.
29:58
Having it happen four times in a row is .4% times .4% times .4% times .4%, or in other words, very very very low probability that it was luck.
As such, I can say with conviction that we know how to recreate success using the frameworks I share over and over again.
30:16
They work because they are timeless business principles.
I actively visualize every day how it felt to wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweats wondering how I'd make payroll.
That gut wrenching meditation keeps me hungry as an entrepreneur, but also grateful for my security and Peace of Mind.
I want the latter for you and anyone else who gives a damn about what they do.
30:34
Fair enough.
Cool.
So let's get to it.
Basic outline of this book This book is intended to be a resource.
As a resource, I mean, it will be something that you read through then keeping your toolbox, coming back to it again and again and says never memorize anything you can look up.
30:51
Business is not a spectator sport.
You're not cramming for some midterm and you're not some limp rested philosopher.
You do work and to work you need tools.
This, my friend, is one of those tools.

Hey, guys.
This is another special edition collaboration between the game podcast and $100 million offers.
Today we're going to break down the pricing and commodity problem.
This is the number one issue that most businesses have and why they can't make enough profit.
The starving crowd problem, which is that they're they're selling to people who don't have enough pain, who are hard to find, who are in markets that are not growing.
0:22
And there's an easy fix for that, and I'll walk you through the process.
And the third chapter we'll go over today is charge what it's worth.
All right.
This is probably one of the biggest unlocks for the majority of people who have listened to the book.
In the many messages and reviews that I have read of it, these upcoming chapters are heavy hitting and I hope you enjoy them.
0:43
Section 2.
Pricing, How to charge Lots of money for stuff.
Chapter 3.
Pricing The Commodity Problem.
Think different.
Steve Jobs, Gore Die is a core tenant at our companies.
We believe every person, every company, and every Organism is either growing or dying.
1:00
Maintenance is a myth.
What this means is if your company isn't growing, it's dying.
This is sobering reality for many of us.
I learned the hard way and my business suffered for a long time because of it.
Let me explain.
The market is continuously growing.
1:17
The stock market grows at 9% per year.
If we aren't growing at 9% per year, we are falling behind.
Maintenance in the most generic sense would be 9% per year growth year over year.
Furthermore, if you enter growing marketplace, then you might have to grow at 20 to 30% per year just to keep up or risk falling behind.
1:35
So you can see how maintenance is a myth.
So then what does it take to grow?
Thankfully just three simple things.
One, get more customers.
Two, increase their average purchase value, 3 get them to buy more times.
That's it.
1:51
Sure, there are lots of ways to acquire customers and zillions of ways to increase order value and purchase frequency, but Simply put, that's it.
Those are the only three ways to grow.
Example, if I sell 10 clients a month and a client is worth $1000 to me over their lifetime through average card value times number of average purchases, then my business will cap at $10,000 per month AKA 10 * 1000 dollars paying new clients per month times $1000.
2:17
Lifetime value equals $10,000 per month in Max revenue.
If you want to grow, you've either got to sell more clients every month while maintaining suitable margins, or have them be worth more by increasing the profit per purchase or number of times they buy.
That's it.
Author note only two ways to grow To simplify this concept even more, they're really only two ways to grow, get more customers and increase each customer's value.
2:42
Increasing each customer's value has two sub buckets 1 Increasing profit per purchase.
Two, increasing the number of times they buy.
For the purpose of this book, I highlight both of those sub buckets as individual growth paths.
I did this because I think it will be easier to understand the money models that will come in volume 3.
2:59
All three, getting more customers, increasing their average purchase value and getting them to buy more are repeated themes in this book.
But if you seek simplicity, both increasing average purchase value and increasing the number of times a customer buys results in one outcome, increasing each customer's value business terms.
3:15
Before going any further and to better flesh out the concepts that will follow, we should take a second to define and better understand some key business concepts.
When I stood in that Las Vegas penthouse in my BSMO tshirt, I was clueless about such terms.
Let me help you be better than well me.
3:31
Gross profit, the revenue minus the direct cost of servicing and additional customer.
If I sell lotion for $10 and it cost me $2.00 my gross profit is $8 or 80%.
If I sell agency services for $1000 per month and it cost me $100 per month in labor to run that clients advertising, then my gross profit is $900 or 90%.
3:52
Note this is not net profit.
Net profit is what's left over after all expenses are paid, not just the direct cost of fulfillment lifetime value, the gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer.
This is gross profit multiplied by the number of purchases an average customer will make over their lifetime.
4:13
Using the example above, if the average customer stays five months and they pay $1000 per month while it cost me $100 per month to fulfill, then their lifetime value is $4500.
Here's the breakdown.
Revenue equals $1000 per month times 90%.
4:30
Gross margins times 5 month equals $4500 Lifetime value, or LTV.
Note that the indirect costs like admin, software, rent, etcetera are not included in LTV.
Note you will find different definitions for lifetime value depending on the source.
4:47
The biggest difference is that some sources only count total revenue while others focus on gross profit over the lifespan.
I focus on gross profit.
You may also see me refer to this as LTGP or lifetime gross profit in other texts just for clarity sake.
Value driven versus price driven purchases.
5:05
This book was intended to be a textbook for any business that wants to grow.
I spent and continue to spend.
Hundreds of hours on calls and in person meetings, consulting entrepreneurs on crafting their offers.
I've seen the ones that take off into the stratosphere and those that fizzle.
Having a Grand Slam offer makes it almost impossible to lose.
5:24
But why?
What gives it such an impact?
In short, having a Grand Slam offer helps with all three of the requirements for growth.
Getting more customers, getting them to pay more, and getting them to do some more times.
How you ask?
It allows you to differentiate yourself from the marketplace.
5:40
In other words, it allows you to sell your product based on value, not on price.
Commoditized equals price driven purchases, aka a race to the bottom differentiated equals a value driven purchase aka sell in a category of one with no comparison.
5:56
Yes, market matters, which I'll expound on in the next chapter, Commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places.
For that reason, it's prone to purchases based on price instead of value.
If all products are equal, then the cheapest one is the most valuable by default.
In other words, if a prospect compares to your product to another and thinks these are pretty much the same, I'll buy the cheaper one.
6:17
Then they commoditize to you.
How embarrassing.
But really, it's one of the worst experiences a value driven entrepreneur can have.
This is a massive problem for the entrepreneur because commodities are valued at the point of market efficiency.
This means that the marketplace drives the price point down through competition until the margins are just enough to keep the lights on, just enough to become a slave to their business.
6:37
The business makes just enough to justify the owner waiting anxiously for things to turn around.
And by the time that lie is realized, they're in too deep to pivot.
At least until now.
A Grand Slam offer solves this problem, but what does a Grand Slam offer do?
All right, let's start by defining a Grand Slam offer.
6:54
It's an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available.
Combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model, a KA payment terms that allows you to get paid to get new customers forever, removing the cash constraint on business growth.
7:14
In other words, it allows you to sell in a category of 1, or to apply another great phrase to sell in a vacuum.
The resulting purchasing decision for the prospect is now between your product and nothing.
So you can sell it whatever price you get the prospect to perceive, not in comparison to anything else.
7:31
As a result, it gets you more customers at higher ticket prices for less money.
If you like fancy marketing terms, it breaks down to this one increased response rates.
Think clicks 2.
Increased conversions, think sales 3.
7:47
Premium prices.
Think charging a lot of money.
Having a Grand Slam offer increases your response rates to advertisements a KA.
More people will click or take action on an advertisement they see containing a Grand Slam offer.
If you pay the same amount for eyeballs But one more people respond, two more of those responses by and three, they buy for higher prices, your business grows.
8:09
I've struck gold on my fair share of offers, not because I've got some superpower, but because I've just done this a lot of times and failed even more.
Are sorted through the crop that chronically fails and pocketed all the stuff that reproducively succeeds and put it into this book.
Here's the key take away from all this.
8:25
A business does the same work in both cases.
With a commoditized offer or a Grand Slam offer, the fulfillment is the same.
But if one business uses a Grand Slam offer and another uses a commodity offer, the Grand Slam offer makes that business appear as if it had a totally different product.
8:42
And that means a value driven versus price driven purchase?
If you have a commodity offer, you will compete on price having a price driven purchase versus a value driven purchase.
Your Grand Slam offer however forces a prospect to stop and think differently to assess the value of your differentiated product.
9:01
Doing this establishes you as your own category, which means it's too difficult to compare prices, which means you recalibrate the prospects, value meter, real life Grand Slam, offer money, math before and after quick back story.
One of our companies is a software that advertising agencies use to work leads for their customers.
9:18
Using the software agencies transform their offer from a commoditized offer of lead generation services to a Grand Slam offer of pay for performance.
Let me show you the multiplicative effect it has on revenue for business.
While rounded for illustrations sake, the values I will share with you are based on real numbers.
9:34
A lead generation agency selling services to brick and mortar businesses experience old, commoditized, way price driven race to the bottom.
Commoditized offer $1000 down, then $1000 per month retainer for agency services.
I will read through the chart that is displayed.
9:55
Advertising spend $10,000 Impressions reach 300,000 Response rate .0013 Appointments booked 40 Show rate 75% Appointment showed 30 Closing percentage 16% appointments closed. 5 Price $1000 Total $5000 Row as or return on advertising spend .5 to one Here's the breakdown at .5 to one return on advertising spend.
10:24
You lose money getting customers, but in 30 days those 5 customers will pay another $1000 each, bringing you $10,000 in total and breaking even.
The next month, the $5000 that comes in will be your first profitable month, and each month thereafter will be profitable, assuming they all stay.
10:40
This is an example of a commoditized service, normal agency work.
There's a million of them and they all look the same.
Commoditized businesses and offers have a harder time getting responses from ads because all their marketing looks the same as everyone else's note.
It all looks the same because they're all making the same offer.
10:57
You pay us to work, we do work.
Maybe you get results from that work, maybe you don't.
It's reasonable.
But easily duplicated and subject to commoditization.
This commoditization creates a price driven purchase.
They were forced to be priced competitively to get clients and to stay that way to keep them.
11:14
If the client sees a cheaper version of the same thing, then the value discrepancy will cause them to swap providers.
This is a dilemma.
Lose this client, the rest of your clients, and potential clients or stay competitive.
Your margins become so thin they vanish.
Furthermore, it's hard to get prospects to say yes and keep them saying less unless you're hyper vigilant about clients commoditizing your business by staying again competitive.
11:38
And that's the problem with the old commoditized way they're able to compare.
Unless you switch to a Grand Slam offer, your prices will keep getting beat down.
The business eventually dies, or the entrepreneur throws in the towel.
No bueno.
We want to make an offer that's so different that you can skip the awkward explanation of why your product's different from everyone else's.
11:56
Which if they have to ask, then they are probably too ignorant to understand the explanation anyways, and instead just have the offer do that work for you.
That's the Grand Slam offer way.
Let's dive in to see the contrast and sales numbers.
New Grand Slam offer way differentiated, incomparable, value driven Grand Slam offer.
12:14
Pay one time.
No recurring fee, no retainer, just cover the ad spend.
I'll generate the leads and work your leads for you and only pay me if people show up.
And I'll guarantee you 20 people in your first month or you get your next month free.
I'll also provide all the best practices from all their businesses just like yours.
12:31
Daily sales coaching for your staff.
Tested scripts, tested price points and offers to swipe and deploy sales recordings.
And everything else you need to sell and fulfill your customers.
I'll give you the entire playbook for insert industry, absolutely free, just for becoming a client.
So in a nutshell, I'm feeding people in your business, showing you exactly how to sell them so that you get the highest prices, which means that you make the most money possible.
12:53
Sound fair enough?
It's clear that these are drastically different offers, but So what?
Where's the money?
Let's compare both in the chart below.
Advertising spend $10,000, same as before.
Impressions reached 300,000, same as before.
Response rate .00332 point five times the response rate because you have a more appealing offer, so more people respond.
13:15
Appointments booked 40 becomes 100.
Show rate 75% stays the same.
Opponent showed 30 goes to 75 and that's just a result of numbers flowing down the funnel.
Closing percentage goes from 16% to 37 percent. 2.3 times the closing because there's more value so more people buy.
13:36
Appointments closed goes from 5 to 28.
That's just a result of the higher closing percentage.
Price goes from $1000 to start to 3997, which is four times the price because we're charging a one time fee versus recurring.
The total collected upfront goes from $5000 to $112,000.
13:54
That's 22.4 times the cash upfront collected and the row as goes from .5 to 1 to 11.2 to one, which means you're getting paid to get new customers.
Breakdown.
You spend the same amount of money for the same eyeballs.
Then you get 2 1/2 times more people to respond to your advertisement because it's a more compelling offer.
14:13
From there, you close 2.5 times as many people because the offer is so much more compelling.
From there, you're able to charge four times higher prices upfront.
The end result is 2.5 * 2.5 * 4 = 22.4 times more cash collected upfront.
Yes, you just spent $10,000 to make $112,000.
14:30
You just made money getting new customers comparison.
Remember the old way?
The way you lost half the ads, been upfront With the new way, you're making more money and getting more customers.
This means that your cost require a customer is so cheap relative to how much you make that your limiting factor becomes your ability to do the work you already love.
14:50
Doing cash flow and acquire customers is no longer your bottleneck because it's 22.4 times more profitable than the old model.
Yep, you read that right.
This is the part in the action movie where you walk away from an explosion in slow motion.
This is the exact Grand Slam offer we used with our software business that serves agencies.
15:07
The numbers can become wild fast.
I know 22.4 X better sounds unreasonable, but that's the point.
If you play the same game everyone else does, you'll get the same results everyone else does.
Mediocre.
You hit singles and double s.
Keep the lights on but never get ahead.
Or remember the opening passage of this book that when you align all the pieces, you can nod out of the park so well that you win for good.
15:28
In my first 18 months in business, we went from 500,000 a year.
To $28 million a year off of less than $1 million in ad spend.
So when I say 20 to 150 to 100 returns, I mean it.
When you get this right, the results are well unbelievable.
15:45
Summary points.
This chapter illustrated the basic problem with commoditization and how Grand Slam offer solve that.
This gets you out of the pricing war and into a category of 1.
The next chapter will focus on finding the correct market to apply our pricing strategies too.
It's one of the most important things to get right.
The Grand Slam offer given to the wrong audience will fall on deaf ears.
16:03
We want to avoid that at all costs.
We must detour from pricing for a moment to learn what to look for in a market.
It's an essential box to check before continuing on our journey.

Finding the Right Market A Starving Crowd.
The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and understand God's word and produce a harvest of 3060 or even 100 times as much as has been planted.
16:52
Matthew 1323 NLT.
The marketing professor asked his students if you were going to open up a hot dog stand and you could only have one advantage over your competitors.
Which would it be?
Location, quality, low prices, best taste.
The students kept going until eventually they had run out of answers.
17:09
They looked at each other, waiting for the professor to speak.
The room finally fell quiet.
The professor smiled and replied.
A starving crowd.
You could have the worst hot dogs, terrible prices and be in a terrible location.
And if you're the only hot dog stand in town and the local college football game breaks out, you're going to sell out.
17:26
That's the value of a starving crowd.
At the end of the day, if there's a ton of demand for a solution, you can be mediocre at business, have a terrible offer, and have no ability persuade people, and you can still make money.
An example of this was the toilet paper shortage at the beginning of COVID-19.
There was no offer, the pricing was atrocious, and there was no compelling sales bitch.
17:45
But because the crowd was so big and so starving, rolls of toilet paper were going for $100 or more.
That's the value of a starving crowd selling newspapers.
A good friend of mine, Lloyd, owned a software business that served newspapers for almost a decade.
They set up digital ad services on newspaper websites with a few clicks and instantly helped them sell a whole new ad product.
18:05
He only charged them a percentage of revenue, he added, so if they made nothing, neither did he.
It was pure gain for the papers and a great offer.
But despite having a great offer and natural sales ability, his business began to decline.
Being a high achieving entrepreneur, he tried all different angles to solve the problem but nothing worked.
18:23
He couldn't figure out what the issue was.
It was hard for me to see him struggle with this because I think Lloyd is much smarter than I am and the answer seemed obvious to me.
But watching him go through this has been a lesson that I have taken with me for life.
Before I reveal it, what do you think the problem was?
Product offer?
18:39
Marketing and sales?
His team?
Let's break it down.
It wasn't his product that was great.
It wasn't his offer.
Get a zero risk Rev share model.
It wasn't his sales skills.
He was a natural salesman.
So then what was the problem?
He was selling to newspapers.
18:56
His market was shrinking by 25% every single year.
He had looked at all the angles except for the most obvious one.
Finally, after use of fighting an uphill battle in his market, he realized his market was the source of his problems and decided to downsize his company.
Don't worry, the story has a second-half to illustrate the power of a market.
19:15
As soon as COVID hit, Lloyd pivoted.
He started an automated mask manufacturing company with new technology.
He brought the cost per mass down below what people could buy them from for from China.
Within five months he was doing millions per month.
Same entrepreneur, different market.
19:30
He applied his same skill set to a business he had zero experience in and was able to win.
That's the power of picking the right market.
I give you that story as a cautionary tale.
Your market matters.
Lloyd is a very smart human.
He's obviously very capable.
19:46
But we can all be blinded as entrepreneurs because we don't like to give up.
We are so accustomed to solving impossible problems that we will keep ramming our heads into the wall.
We hate quitting, but the reality is that everyone is affected by their market.
So how do you pick the right market?
What to look for?
20:03
There is a market in desperate need of your abilities.
You need to find it.
And when you do, you will capitalize, all while wondering what took you so long.
Don't be romantic about your audience.
Serve the people who can pay you what you're worth.
And remember that picking a market like anything, is always our choice.
20:19
So choose wisely.
In order to sell anything, you need demand, we're not trying to create demand, we're trying to channel it.
It is a very important distinction.
If you don't have a market for your offer, nothing that follows will work.
This entire book sits atop the assumption that you have at least a, quote, normal market, which I define as a market that is growing at the same rate as the marketplace and that has common unmet needs that fall into one of three categories, Improved health, increased wealth or improved relationships.
20:48
For example, Lloyd could have gone through this entire book and nothing in here would have worked for him.
Why?
Because he would be targeting newspapers, a dying market.
That being said, having a great market is an advantage, but you can be in a normal market that's growing at an average rate and still make crazy money.
21:06
Every market I've been in has been a normal market.
You just don't actually want to be selling ice to Eskimos.
Here are the basic tenets of what I look for in markets.
Let's run them before we return to the offer.
When picking markets, I look for four indicators.
One pain 2.
21:22
Purchasing power 3.
Easy to target for growing.
One massive pain.
They must not want but desperately need what I am offering.
Pain can be anything that frustrates people about their lives.
Being broke is painful.
21:38
A bad marriage is painful.
Waiting in line at the grocery store is painful back pain, ugly smile pain, overweight pain.
Humans suffer a lot, so for us entrepreneurs, endless opportunity abounds.
The degree of pain will be proportional to the price.
You will be able to charge more on this in the Value equation chapter.
21:55
When they hear the solution to their pain and inversely, what their life would look like without this pain, they should be drawn to your solution.
I was saying that I used to train sales teams.
The pain is the pitch.
If you can articulate the pain prospectus feeling accurately, you will almost always buy what you are offering.
22:13
A prospect must have a painful problem for us to solve and charge money for our solution.
Pro tip The point of good writing is for the reader to understand.
The point of good persuasion is for the prospect to feel understood 2 Purchasing power.
22:30
A friend of mine had a very good system for helping people improve their resumes to get more job interviews.
He was great at it, but try as he did, you could not get people to pay for his services.
Why?
Because they were all unemployed.
This again may seem obvious, but he thought these people are easy to target.
22:46
They're in massive pain, There are plenty of them and it's constantly adding new people.
This is a great market.
You just forgot a crucial point.
Your audience needs to be able to afford the service you're charging them for.
Make sure your targets have the money or access to the amount of money needed to buy your services at the prices you require to make it worth your time. 3 Easy to target.
23:07
Let's say you have a perfect market, but no way of finding the people who comprise it.
While making a Grand Slam offer will be difficult, I make my life easier by looking for easy to target markets.
Examples of this are avatars that have associations they belong to, mailing lists, social media groups, channels they all watch, etcetera.
23:25
If our potential customers are gathered together somewhere, then we can market to them.
If searching them out, however, is like finding needles in a haystack, then it can be very difficult to get your offer in front of any potentially interested eyes.
This point is tactical.
It is reality, not theoretical.
For instance, you may want to serve rich doctors, but if your ads are being displayed to nursing students, your offer will fall on deaf ears no matter how good it is.
23:48
Main point you want to make sure you can target your ideal audience easily.
Clarifying point, There's no issue wanting to serve rich doctors, They are easy to find.
This is just illustrative that your promotions must be served to the right audience for growing.
24:05
Growing markets are like a tailwind.
They make everything move forward faster.
Declining markets are like headwinds.
They make all efforts harder.
This was Lloyd's example.
Newspapers had three of four makings of a great market.
Lots of pain, purchasing power, easy to target.
24:21
But they were shrinking fast.
No matter how hard he tried, the entire marketplace was fighting against him.
Business is hard enough and markets move quickly, so you might as well find a good market to give you a tailwind to make the process easier.
Making this real Health, wealth, relationships.
24:38
There are three main markets that will always exist, Health, wealth and relationships.
The reason that those will always exist is that there will always be tremendous pain when you lack them.
There's always demand for solutions to these core human pains.
The goal is to find a smaller subgroup within those larger buckets that is growing, has the buying power, and it's easy to target the other three variables.
24:59
So if I were a relationship expert trying to find my avatar, I'd rather focus on second-half of life relationship coaching for old timers than helping college students in relationships.
Why?
Because senior citizens who are alone are likely suffering more pain as they are near their deaths, have more buying power, money, and are easier to find targeting.
25:18
Lastly, at the time of this writing, there are more people turning 65 each year than turning 20, AKA growing.
That is the idea.
Think about what you were good at in regards to health, wealth and relationships.
Then think about who might value your service the most.
AKA is in the most pain, has the buying power to pay what you want, money, and can be found easily targeting.
25:40
As long as those 3 criteria are strong and the market isn't shrinking, you'll be in good shape.
But how important your success is finding a quote great market versus a quote normal market versus a quote bad market?
The answer It actually depends.
Let me explain order of importance. 3 Levers on Success It's unlikely you're going to be in a dying market like the newspaper example.
26:04
It's also unlikely you're going to be selling toilet paper in COVID, a buying frenzy.
You'll likely be in a normal market and that's totally OK.
There's a fortune to be made within normal markets.
My single point here is that you can't be in a bad market or nothing will work.
That being said, here's the simplest illustration of the order of importance between markets, offers and persuasion skills.
26:24
Starving crowd is more important than your offer strength, Which is more important and your persuasion skills.
Let's say you were to rate these elements on a scale of great normal and bad.
You could essentially move down the line from left to right in order of importance.
A quote great rating on a higher order piece overpowers anything else lower on the priority scale.
26:45
A quote normal rating moves the buck to the next part of the equation.
A quote bad stops the equation unless a grade from a higher order component nullifies it.
Here are a few examples.
Example one.
Even if you had a bad offer and are bad at Persuasion, you're going to make money if you're in a great market.
27:03
If you're on the corner Hawking hot dogs, when the bar closes up at 2:00 AM with mobs of starving drunk folks, you're going to sell out of your hot dogs.
Example two, most of us.
If you were in a normal market and have a Grand Slam offer, you can make tons of money even if you're bad at persuasion.
This is most people reading this book.
27:20
That's why I wrote it, to help you maximize your success by learning to really build a Grand Slam offer.
Example 3.
Let's say you're in a normal market and have a normal offer.
In order to be massively successful, you would have to be exceptionally good at persuasion.
27:37
Then and only then would you succeed with your persuasive skills serving as the fulcrum for your success.
Heck, many empires have been built by exceptional persuaders.
It's just the hardest path to follow and requires the most effort and learning.
Nailing your offer helps you shortcut this path to success.
27:54
Otherwise you will just have a normal business that takes exceptional skills to be successful.
Nothing wrong with that, but probably not what you signed up for.
Commit to the niche.
I have a saying when coaching entrepreneurs on picking their target market.
Don't make me niche slap you too often.
28:11
A new entrepreneur halfheartedly tries one offer in one market, doesn't make $1,000,000, then mistakenly thinks this is a bad market.
Most time that's not actually the case.
They just haven't found a Grand Slam offer yet to apply to that market.
They think I'll switch from helping dentists to helping chiropractors.
28:28
That's it.
When in reality both of those are normal markets and represent billions of dollars of revenue.
Either would work, just not both.
You must pick one.
No one can serve 2 masters.
I've coined the term niche lap to remind entrepreneurs in my communities to commit once they pick all businesses and all markets have unpleasant characteristics.
28:50
The grass is never greener once you get to the other side.
If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be niche slapped.
You must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error.
You will fail.
In fact, you will fail until you succeed.
But you will fail far longer if you keep changing who you market to, because you must start over from the beginning each time.
29:11
So pick, then commit.
Riches are in the niches.
The other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make simply.
But niching down will make you far more money.
Author note went to broaden advice for most people.
For most if you were under $10 million per year, niching down will make you more money.
29:31
After that it will depend on how narrow the niches or what is called Tam.
Total adjustable market A business can only grow to meet the total adjustable market.
That being said, for most people getting to 10 million per year is already a .4% achievement.
Only one in 250 businesses achieve this.
29:47
So for 99.6% of readers below $10 million per year, it's almost always easier to serve fewer clients more narrowly.
But if you want to go beyond that, you may, depending on the size of your Tam, have to broaden your audience by going up market, down market or into an adjacent market where your existing services can provide value.
30:04
For context, many companies expanded to $30 million plus per year serving a single niche chiropractors, gyms, plumbers, solar roofers, salon owners, etcetera.
If you were at 1,000,000 or $3,000,000 per year thinking you have capped and must expand, you are wrong.
You just need to be better.
30:21
When I truly grasp how much more profit I was leaving on the table, it changed my life.
It was what took me from doing acquisition for anyone to teaching it to a specific avatar.
In my instance, I decided on a microgem owner with 100 members, assigned lease at least one employee and wanted to help clients lose weight.
30:40
That's pretty specific compared to quote small business owners or my favorite quote, anyone who will pay me, which is common.
And I was very specific in that business gym launch we turned down and still do anyone who is not the avatar.
That means no personal trainers, no online coaches, etcetera.
30:56
Could I have helped them?
Of course I could have.
I mean, heck, the majority of our portfolio is comprised of non gym companies.
But in order to maintain product focus and high converting messaging, knowing exactly who the product was for was a game changer.
It helped us know exactly who we were speaking to at all times and exactly whose problems we were solving.
31:15
But simplicity and ease may not be enough to sway you, so let me illustrate why honing in on one niche will make you more money.
Reason you can literally charge 100 times more for the exact same product.
Dan Kennedy was the first person to illustrate this for me and I will do my best to pass on the torch to you in these pages.
31:33
Niching Product Pricing Example Product and then Price time management.
Product Price $19.00.
Time Management for Sales Professionals price $99.
Time management for outbound B2B sales price $499 Time management for outbound B2B power tools and gardening sales reps Price 1997.
32:00
Dan Kennedy taught me this and it changed my life forever.
Let's say you sold a generic course on time management.
Unless you were some massive time management guru with a compelling or unique story, it would be unlikely it would turn into anything significant.
Do you think Quote yet another and quote time management course is valued at 19 dollars $29.00?
32:18
Sure, nothing right home about let's just say $19.00 for illustration sake.
Now we shall unleash the power of niche pricing in various stages on your product.
So let's imagine you make the product more specific, keeping the same principles and call it time management for sales professionals.
32:35
All of a sudden this course is for a more specific type of person.
We could tie their increase to even one more sale or one more deal and it would be worth more.
But there are a lot of salespeople.
So this might be a $99 product, neat, but we can do better.
So let's go down another level of niching and call our product time management for B to B, outbound sales reps following the same principles of specificity.
32:58
Now we know our salespeople probably have very experienced deals and commissions.
A single deal would easily net the salesman $500 or more, so it would be easy to justify 499 price tag.
This is already A25X increase in price for almost an identical product.
33:14
I could stop here, but I'm going one step further.
Let's just niche down one last level.
Time management for B2B outbound power tools and gardening sales reps Boom.
Think about it for a second.
If you were a Power Tools outbound sales Rep you would think to yourself this is made exactly for many and would happily fork over maybe 1000 or $2000 for a time management program that could help you achieve your goal.
33:39
The actual pieces of the program may be the same as the generic $19.00 course, but since they have been applied and the sales messaging could speak so much to this avatar, they will find it far more compelling and get more value from it in a real way.
This concept applies to anything you decide to do.
33:56
You want to be the guy who services this type of person or solves this type of problem and even more niche.
I solve this type of problem for this specific type of person in this unique, counterintuitive way that reverses their deepest fear.
That's why a fitness program for generic weight loss might be priced only at $19.00, while fitness program designed and marketed only to shift nurses might be priced at 1997 even though the core of the program is likely similar.
34:23
Eat less, move more.
End result.
The market matters, your niche matters.
And if you can sell the same product for 100 times the price, should you?
I'll let you decide.
Summary Points The purpose of this chapter is to reinforce 2 things.
First, don't pick bad markets.
Normal markets are fine.
34:40
Great markets are great.
Second, once you pick, commit until you figure it out.
If you try 100 offers, I promise you will succeed.
Most people never try anything.
Others fail once, then give up.
It takes resilience to succeed.
Stop personalizing.
It's not about you.
34:55
If your offer doesn't work, it doesn't mean you suck, it means your offer sucks.
Big difference.
You only suck if you stop trying.
So try again.
You'll never become world class if you stop after a failed attempt.
If you find a crazy good market, ride it and ride it hard.
If you pair a Grand Slam offer with a crazy market, you'll likely never need to work again.
35:15
Seriously.
So have the skill set, the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into account pain, money, targeting, and growth in your back pocket so that when lightning strikes, you can make sure it strikes twice.
Having established how to nail a market, let's get back to pricing.
35:30
The first step to making crazy money is charging premium prices.

Dan Kennedy, January 2019.
All I could see was black.
My eyes felt glued shut.
I was awake but the fatigue in my temples felt like a 5 weight was duct taped to my skull, dragging my eyelids back down.
I had to concentrate forcibly to open them.
36:52
The details of the dimly lit room beamed in.
I rolled over to the edge of the hotel room bed, feeling each and every muscle on my body as my weight shifted.
Punched on my side.
I could see my clothes scattered on the floor.
I was so beat the night before that I didn't even remember taking them off.
37:08
I had just finished A5 day gauntlet of keynote after keynote presentation. 2 days of presentations for a highest level clients.
Immediately followed by spending two days planning with our entire company, 135 plus employees.
I had missed a FaceTime call from my father that day before.
37:25
I didn't have anything on my agenda for the morning, so I quickly got up, slid into a hoodie and some sweats, and walked into the hallway to call him back.
After the initial pleasantries, he immediately dove into why he was calling Parental concern.
I saw the picture you posted of all your clients, he said, but in an unusually concerned tone.
37:44
I thought the event was for all your high spent clients.
I didn't know it was a big event.
It looked like you had 1000 people there alone in the hallway and struggling to shake the heavyweight of exhaustion.
Still, I tried to gauge where his concern was coming from and what he was getting at.
I'd explained this to him already.
38:00
It was only for our highest level clients.
That wasn't all of our clients, I said.
Just the ones who pay 42,000 a year are Jim Lords.
Like I told you, every single person in that picture paid you $42,000.
He sounded almost frightened at the idea.
Yeah, wild, right?
38:15
My voice was hoarse from days of speaking and thousands of 22nd conversations.
Is it legal what you're doing?
He asked.
Wow, that escalated quickly, I thought to myself.
Do they know you're paying you that much?
Yes, it's legal.
And of course they know it's not like a magically siphoning money.
38:33
That's a lot of money.
I hope what you're giving them is worth it.
I contemplated whether it was worth the effort to dive into this or just ignore it, but knowing this is going to be a thing, I took a deep breath and begin to explain.
If I made you $239,000 extra this year, would you pay me $42,000?
38:50
I asked using 239,000 because it was the average increase in top line revenue of a gym.
Using our system For 11 months, for sure, he said.
I mean, if I knew I was going to make that back, but what would I have to do?
About 15 hours a week of work?
And how long would it take me to make the $239,000?
39:10
Eleven months?
And how much of the $42,000 would I have to pay you upfront?
Nothing.
Just pay me as you start making money using the system.
I watched it.
Click.
My dad got it.
Oh, he said.
Well then yeah, I would do it.
And that's why they do it too.
Making shit loads of money breaks people's minds.
39:29
It literally stretches their minds so far past what they can believe is possible.
They assume you're doing something wrong or illegal.
They literally can't even.
Why?
Because they think to themselves they can't be that much smarter than me or work that much harder than me.
So how is it possible for them to make 1000 times more than me?
39:45
Enough money that it would literally take 10 lifetimes for me to make what they make in a year?
In the three years leading up to me writing this book, I took home over $1.2 million per month in profit every single month.
That's more than the compensation for the CE O's of Ford, McDonald's, Motorola, Yahoo combined every year as a kid in his 20s.
40:08
It angers those who believe that life is unfair.
It confuses others who cannot comprehend and believe that there must have been a mistake.
It inspires a select few who are bound for greatness.
I hope that you were in the last category because that is who I am writing this for.
You can do this, you just need to learn how and I'm going to show you price to value, discrepancy, quote.
40:29
I hope what you're giving them is worth it, End Quote.
Those words would probably sting for most, but when my dad said them to me I just knew he didn't understand the value we were providing.
What I want to show you is how to create and communicate value, AKA the worth it Ness of an offer.
In order to understand how to make a compelling offer, you must understand value.
40:49
The reason people buy anything is to get a deal.
They believe that what they are getting value is worth more than what they are given in exchange for it price.
The moment the value they receive dips below what they are paying, they stop buying from you.
This price to value discrepancy is what you need to avoid at all costs.
41:06
After all, as Warren Buffett said, price is what you pay, Value is what you get.
The simplest way to increase the gap between price to value is by lowering the price.
It's also, most of the time the wrong decision for the business.
Getting people to buy is not the objective of a business.
41:23
Making money is, and lowering price is a one way road to destruction.
For most, you can only go down to 0, but you can go infinitely high in the other direction.
So unless you have a revolutionary way of decreasing your cost 110th compared to your competition, don't compete on price.
41:39
As Dan Kennedy said, there's no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest in the marketplace, but there is for being the most expensive.
So the goal of our Grand Slam offer will be to get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy.
41:54
In other words, we will raise our price only after we have sufficiently increased our value.
This way they still get a great deal.
Think buying $100,000 worth of value for only $10,000.
It's money at a discount.

Enjoy why you should charge so much.
42:27
It hurts.
Most business owners are not competing on price or value.
In fact, they're not actually competing on anything at all.
Their pricing process typically goes something like this.
Step one, look at marketplace.
Step 2, see what everyone else offers.
Step three, take the average.
42:44
Step 4, go slightly below to remain quote competitive.
End Quote.
Step 5, provide what their competitors offer with a little more.
Step six end up with a value proposition of more for less.
And the big secret those competitors they're copying are dead broke.
43:01
So why on earth copy them?
Pricing where the market is means you're pricing for market efficiency over time.
In an efficient marketplace, more competitors enter offering a little more for a little less until eventually no one can provide any more for any less.
At this point a market reaches perfect efficiency and the business owners participating make just enough at the end of the month to keep going.
43:21
The bottom 10 to 20% of operators get washed out or lose the will to fight.
Then fresh business owners enter with no idea and repeat the process of their forefathers and around and around they go.
In plain words, pricing this way means you are providing a service at just above what it costs for you to stay above water.
43:38
We are not trying to barely stay above water.
We are trying to make egregious amounts of money that will have your relatives asking if what you do is legal.
Again, we are not trying to get the most customers, we're trying to make the most money.
That being said, since there is no strategic benefit to being the second lowest priced player in your marketplace, allow me to give you a brief overview of why I see premium pricing as not only a very smart business decision, What a moral 1.
44:03
Furthermore, it's the only choice that will allow you to truly provide the most value, a unique and strong position in the marketplace.
Let me introduce you to the virtuous cycle of price.
I've used this framework and most of the materials I release because it needs to be consistently reinforced.
44:19
The forces of the marketplace will great on your belief system, you must stay strong and ignore them.
Here's the basic premise of why you need to charge a premium if you want to best serve your customers.
When you decrease your price, you you decrease your client's emotional investment since it didn't cost that much.
44:35
You decrease your client's perceive value of your service since it can't be that good if it's so cheap or price the same as everyone else.
You decrease your client's results because they do not value service and are not invested.
You would track the worst clients who are never satisfied until your service is free and you destroy any margin you have left to be able to actually provide an exceptional experience.
44:55
Hire the best people.
Invest in your people.
Pamper your clients, Invest in growth.
Invest in more locations or more scale and everything else you had hoped in the goal of helping more people solve whatever problem it is that you solve.
In essence, your world sucks.
And to make matters worse, your service probably sucks because you were squeezing blood from the proverbial stone.
45:15
There's just not enough money left over to make something exceptional.
As a result, you fall in line with the armies of average businesses that race to the bottom.
I've lived that life.
It's terrible.
If you love your customers and your employees, please stop shortchanging them when there is a better way.
Here's the reverse.

This is what happens when you raise your prices.
When you raise your prices, you increase your client's emotional investment.
You increase your client's perceive value of your service.
You increase your client's results because they value your service and are invested.
You attract the best clients who are the easiest to satisfy and actually cost less to fulfill, and who are most likely to actually receive and perceive the most relative value.
45:52
You multiply your margin because you have money to invest in systems to create efficiency, smart people improve customer experience, scale your business, and most importantly of all, to keep watching the number in your personal bank account go up month after month.
Even with reinvesting in your business, this allows you to ultimately enjoy the process for the long haul and help more people grow rather than burning out and shriveling into obscurity.
46:15
To swing the argument even further in favor of higher prices, here are a few interesting concepts.
When you raise your price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product.
Wait, what?
Yes, higher price means higher value.
46:30
Literally.
In a blind taste test, researchers ask consumers to rate 3 wines, a low priced wine, a medium priced wine, and an expensive wine.
Throughout the study, the participants rated the wines with the prices visible.
They rated them unsurprisingly, in order of their price, with the most expensive being the best, the second most expensive being the second best, and the third cheapest option being rated as a cheap wine.
46:53
What the tasters didn't know is that the researchers gave them the exact same wine all three times, yet the tasters reported a wide discrepancy between the high-priced wine and the cheap wine.
This has deep implications for the direct relationship between value and price.
In essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value provide.
47:11
What's more, the higher the price, the more lower your product or service has.
People want to buy expensive things, they just need a reason.
And the goal isn't just be slightly above market price.
The goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves this is so much more expensive.
47:27
There must be something entirely different going on here.
That is how you create a category of 1.
In this new perceived marketplace.
You are a monopoly and can make monopoly profits.
That is the .1 final point I want to drive home.
If you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the result or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested.
47:48
The more invested they are, the more likely they are to achieve the positive result.
Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible.
Ideally this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it stings a little when they buy that sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service.
48:09
Those who pay the most pay the most attention.
And if your customers are more adherent and follow through, and if they achieve better results with your service than your competition, then you are in a very real way providing more value than anyone else.
This is how you win.
But I know this isn't easy and it shouldn't be.
48:25
Your product must deliver, so many wish to shortcut the real work.
Do that and you will fail in the real world and have the quote gonads.
To charge big ticket prices.
You must outwork yourself doubt.
You must be so confident in your delivery because you have done it so many times that you know that this person will succeed.
48:42
Experience is what gives you the conviction to ask for someone's entire year salary as payment.
You must believe so deeply in your solution that when you look at yourself in the mirror at night alone, your conviction remains unshakeable.
So let me bring the section home with my personal experience, my premium price experience.
48:59
In my first niche consulting business, Jim Launch, I teach owners a Better Business model before productizing my consulting services.
I flew out to 33 gyms in 18 months to do full gym turnarounds.
We would fly out, fix everything in gym and relaunch it in 21 days.
49:15
We would average an increase in $42,000 in additional sales in 21 days.
It was wild.
My fee was 100% of the revenue I would bring in.
At our peak, we were turning around 8 gyms a month.
This quickly became a logistical nightmare after the wear and tear of living in motels month after month after month, I thought to myself, there has to be a better way to do this.
49:35
One month there was a gym we were scheduled to go fly out to, but I simply didn't want to do it, so I told them we were going to cancel the engagement.
The gym owner practically threatened me to help him, so I said I would help him, but he would have to do all the work.
But I would show him how.
Within 30 days, this gym made almost $44,000 in new upfront cash collected, which was four times their previous month.
49:58
As soon as I saw that my process could be duplicated from afar without me having to fly, people in our business exploded.
I had found the missing link because my travel schedule was no longer a constraint.
We went on to sell 4000 plus more gyms over the next few years and counting using a done with you rather than done for you model.
50:15
But back to premium pricing.
When I entered the space, low price competitors offered full service marketing solutions for $500 per month with a single high price competitor charging $5000 for his product.
I wanted to be the premium price leader.
50:31
I wanted to be so expensive that it created a lure around what we were doing.
So we came in at three times the highest price player and 32 times more than the lowest priced player.
A price of 16,000 for 16 week done with you intensive.
Then we upsold 35% of those people to a three-year $42,000 per year agreement for us to help them grow their gyms.
50:51
For context, the average gym owner makes $35,280 per year and take home profits.
If that's the average, it means half make even less than that.
So for many of them, they were committing to half of their yearly salary or more to buy our program.
And I was selling this to grown men as a kid in his 20s, telling them I was going to help them make more money.
51:10
This was possible because my conviction was stronger than their skepticism.
How?
Based on a voluntary survey taken at our last full company event with 158 gyms responding, we found that a gym launch gym who has been in our program for 11 months will experience the following average improvements.
51:26
Top line revenue growth of $239,000 per year, recurring revenue growth of $160,000 a year, bottom line growth AKA profit from 2943 per month to 8940 per month.
That's three-point 1X increase.
51:43
Average client growth of an additional 67 clients Churn AKA percentage of clients who leave each month drops from 10.7% before to 6.8% retail sales and additional 4400 per month in retail sales after they started working with us.
51:59
Prices on average went from 129 per month to 167 per month in average revenue per Jim member.
The survey just proved what I already knew.
I had complete conviction our product.
I knew it worked.
I had outworked myself.
Doubt Summary points.
52:15
What should you take from this?
First and foremost, charge a premium.
It will allow you to do things no one else can to make your client successful.
We were able to charge a premium because we provided more value than anyone else in the industry in a real way.
We were charging only a fraction of what our clients made using our system.
52:31
This is important.
Our clients still got a deal.
The gap between what they paid price and what they got value was massive.
As a result, the virtuous cycle continued to spend.
We charged the most money, we provided the most value.
52:47
Our gyms remain the most competitive, made the most money, always had the latest and best acquisition systems and had the support to implement them at lightning speed.
We made many mistakes along the way, but our pricing model was not one of them.
It allowed me the room to make big bets without losing the farm.
The truth is that 99% of businesses need to raise their prices to grow, not lower them.
53:07
Profit is oxygen.
It fuels the fire of growth.
You need that if you want to reach more people and make a bigger impact.
In order to charge so much, though, you must learn.
To create tremendous value, let's head there next.

Welcome back to Episode 3 of $100 million, offers the audio edition and Collab.
With the game podcast, Today's episode is the most famous chapter that I wrote in the book.
The Value equation it's probably.
The most retweeted.
The most shared.
The most posted concept, This concept changed my life and changed my businesses and I hope it does the same for you.
0:23
And at the very end, I have a special call to action that would mean the world to me.
If you got value from this free content, it takes a second and again it would mean the world.
Section 3.
Value Create your offer.
How to make offers so Good people feel stupid saying no.
0:41
Chapter 6.
Value Offer the value equation.
We question all of our beliefs except for the ones we really believe in and those we never think to question.
Orson Scott Card, I want to be abundantly clear.
The goal should be to charge as much money for your products or services as humanly possible.
1:00
I'm talking heinous amounts of money.
That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can charge these rates and get people to say yes.
From this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about what's fair.
Every enormous company in the world charges you money for things that cost them nothing.
1:17
It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except they don't mind charging you hundreds of dollars per month for access.
It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they don't mind charging hundreds of dollars per month for it.
Media companies charge advertisers a King's ransom for your eyeballs, and it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media.
1:36
You need to have a big discrepancy between what something costs you and what you charge for it.
It is the only way to become unreasonably wealthy.
Many entrepreneurs believe that charging too much is bad.
The reality is, yes, you should never charge more than your product is worth, but you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill.
1:56
Think up to 100 times more, not just two or three times more.
And if you provide enough value, it should always still be a steal for the prospect.
That is the power of value.
It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit power to scale your company.
2:12
For example, one of my private clients whose company I have equity and in our portfolio is in the photography space.
Over 2 years implementing the tactics outlined in this book, the owner was able to increase the average ticket from $300 to $1500.
That's a 5X increase, gasp.
2:28
Even cooler, they now spend less time per customer and have higher customer satisfaction.
The 5X increase in average ticket 38X the profit of the business.
It went from making $1000 a week in profit to $38,000 per week in profit and continues to grow.
2:44
As a result, the company was finally able to continue to scale to multiple occasions and provide meaningful work to great employees and a fund benefit.
We were able to donate even more money to children's charities, which is something the owner and I have in common.
Almost $1,000,000 at the time of this writing, but none of that.
3:01
Would have been possible without figuring out what people valued most, tripling down on it and ruthlessly eliminating everything else.
A 5X price increase may seem crazy to you, but clients voted with their dollars that what the company provides now is far better than what it did before.
Cracking value opens up the world of unlimited profit impact and possibilities.
3:21
Those who understand value are the ones who will be able to charge the most money for their services.
The good news is that there is a repeatable formula that I have created.
I've never seen it displayed elsewhere.
To help quantify the variables that create value for any offer, I call it the Value equation.
3:37
Once you see it, you can never Unsee it.
It will operate in your subconscious running in the background calling out to you.
It's a new lens through which to see the world.
The value equation Dream outcome times perceived likelihood of achievement divided by time delay times effort and sacrifice equals Value Free Gift #4.
3:59
The Value Equation Bonus tutorial and Free downloads If you want to know how I break down businesses core offering, it is something more valuable.
Go to acquisitions.com/trainings/offers and select the value Equation video to watch your tutorial.
I also included downloadable checklist.
My goal is to gain your trust and deliver value in advance.
4:14
As such, it's absolutely free.
Enjoy.
So as you can see or here there are four primary drivers to value two of the drivers which are the top two parts of the equation.
You will seek to increase the other two on the bottom of the equation.
We will seek to decrease so one yay the dream outcome.
4:32
Our goal is to increase 2 yay perceived likelihood of achievement.
Our goal is to increase three Boo, perceived time, delay between start and achievement.
Our goal is to decrease 4 Boo, perceived effort and sacrifice.
Our goal is to decrease.
4:48
If you notice the questions in the last section that my father asked me, you'll see the correspondent with these pillars.
What will I make dream outcome?
How will I know it's going to happen?
Perceive likelihood of achievement.
How long will it take time to lay what is expected of me.
Effort and sacrifice get the bottom to zero.
5:06
In the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement, social proof, third party edification, etcetera.
In other words, the top side of the equation.
That's where beginner marketers make bigger and bigger claims.
It's easy and it's lazy.
But as time has gone on, I've realized these larger than life claims are the easiest to establish and therefore less unique.
5:27
After all, anyone can make a promise the harder and more competitive are the time, delay and effort and sacrifice.
The best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation, making things immediate, seamless and effortless.
Apple made the iPhone effortless compared to other phones at the time.
5:44
Amazon made purchasing a single click of a button and made purchases arrive almost immediately.
Maybe by the time you read this, they'll be sending drones to our doors within 60 minutes.
Netflix made consuming television immediate and effortless.
So the older I get, the more I've shifted my focus to the quote hard stuff, decreasing the bottom side of the equation.
6:03
And I believe the better you do this, the more you will be rewarded by the marketplace bottle.
Note the reason this is a division equation and not addition is that I want to convey one key point.
If you can make the bottom part of the equation equal to 0, you are golden.
No matter how small the top side is.
6:19
Anything divided by zero equals Infinity, which is technically undefined for math nerds, in other words.
If you can reduce your prospects true time delay to receiving value to 0, AKA you realize your immediate dream outcome and your effort and sacrifice is 0, you have an infinitely valuable product.
6:38
If you accomplish this, you win the game.
Given this postulate, a prospect would in theory purchase something from you and the moment their credit card was run it would immediately become their reality.
That is infinite value.
Imagine clicking the purchase button on a weight loss product and instantly seeing your stomach turn into a six pack.
6:56
Or imagine hiring a marketing firm and as soon as you sign your document, your phone begins to ring with new highly qualified prospects.
How valuable would these products or services be?
Infinitely valuable.
And that's the point.
I don't know if we entrepreneurs will ever get there, but that is the hypothetical limit we should all strive towards and why I structured the equation this way.
7:16
Perception is reality.
Perception is reality.
It's not about how much you increase your prospects likely to have success or decrease the time delay to achievement or decrease their effort and sacrifice.
That in and of itself is not valuable.
Many times they will have no idea.
The Grand Slam offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time to life, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice.
7:42
A prime example of this happened on the London Tunnel system, the biggest increase in rider satisfaction, AKA value.
Was never from faster trains to decrease wait times.
Instead it was from a simple dotted map that showed them when the next train was coming and how long they had to wait.
The dotted map, which only cost a few $1,000,000 decreased the rider's perception of time delay and sacrifice, AKA being bored.
8:04
Waiting more than actually making the trains faster which cost billions of dollars to do.
Isn't that cool?
This is how we need to think about our products pro tip logical versus psychological solutions.
Most people naturally try and solve problems using logical solutions, but the logical solutions have already been tried because they're logical.
8:24
It's what everyone would try and do.
As business owners and entrepreneurs, I increasingly approach problems to find psychological solutions rather than logical ones, because if there were a logical solution, it probably would have already been solved, thereby eliminating the problem.
All that remains are the psychological problems.
8:40
Example inspired by Rory Sutherland, CMO of Ogilvy Advertising.
Any fool can sell a product by offering it for a discount.
It takes great marketing to sell the same product for a premium.
Logical solution.
Make trains faster to increase satisfaction.
Psychological solution Decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map.
8:59
Psychological solution Pay models to be the hostesses on the trip.
People would wish it took longer to get to their destination.
Logical solution?
Make elevator faster.
Psychological solution?
Add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator.
9:15
Logical solution make it cheaper.
Psychological solution make fewer of them and raise the price which would cause more people to want it.
Often most logical solutions have been tried and failed at this point in history.
We must give the psychological solutions a shot to solve problems.
9:30
As such.
As business owners, it's up to us to communicate these value drivers with clarity to increase the prospects perception of these realities.
The extent to which you answer these questions in the mind of your prospect will determine the value you are creating.
Only then will we truly be able to realize the actual value of our product to the marketplace, and by extension, the egregious prices we wish to charge.
9:50
It's difficult to separate 4 value drivers from one another as most vehicles combine many of these elements together, but I will do my best to isolate and clearly explain each one below #1 dream outcome Our goal increase.
People have deep, unchanging desires.
This is what marriages are lost over, wars are fought over, and people willingly die for.
10:09
Our goal is not to create desire.
Our goal is simply to channel that desire through our offer and monetization vehicle.
The dream outcome is the expression of that feeling and experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind.
It's the gap between their current reality and their dreams.
Our goal is to accurately depict that dream back to them, so they feel understood and explain how our vehicle will get them there.
10:28
The dream outcome is simple.
It's the getting there where the value gets enhanced or detracted.
People generally, and our clients specifically want.
To be perceived as beautiful.
To be respected.
To be perceived as powerful.
To be loved.
To increase their status.
These are all powerful drivers, but multiple vehicles may accomplish the same thing.
10:47
Take the desire to be perceived as beautiful, for example.
There are a lot of things that touch on this desire.
Makeup, antiaging, creams or serums, supplements.
Shapewear.
Plastic surgery, fitness.
All of these vehicles channeled the desire to be perceived as beautiful, and we further pack the idea of a desire to be beautiful.
11:04
We see that it may be a surface level declaration of a deeper desire to achieve higher status in one social group.
The dream outcome value driver is most prominently used when comparing the relative value between two different desires being satisfied.
In general, the dream outcome that most directly increases a prospect status will be the one they value the most.
11:24
As such, a prospect may value that entire category of vehicles that satisfy one desire more than another category that satisfies a different desire.
For many men, making money is more important than being handsome.
Why?
Because money drives status for men more than being handsome does.
11:39
So in general, they will value all offers that make them money more than offers that help them look good.
I once heard Russell Brunson tell a story about this concept.
He explained how his wife, Colette, at first hearing the status concept, rejected it.
She claims she wasn't driven by status and would never want a Lamborghini.
11:55
Instead, she favored her minivan.
But.
After talking further, she revealed it was because driving a Lamborghini would decrease her status amongst her mom friends, while driving a minivan would show that she was a good mom increase in status.
So it's not about the money, it's about the status, the perceived increase or decrease in relative standing when compared to others socially or professionally.
12:15
Talk in terms of things your prospect believes will increase their status, and you'll have your prospects drooling.
Pro tip frame benefits in terms of status gained from the viewpoint of others.
In writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how other people will perceive the prospects.
Achievement.
12:31
Connect the dots for them.
Example, if you buy this Golf Club, your drive will increase by 40 yards.
Your golf buddies jaws will drop when they see your ball soar 40 yards past theirs.
They will ask you what's changed.
Only you will know.
That being said, when comparing 2 products or services that satisfy the same desire, the value from the dream outcomes will cancel out since they are the same.
12:52
It will be the other three variables that drive the difference in perceived value and ultimately price.
For example, if we had two products or services that both help make someone beautiful, it will be the likelihood of achievement, time, delay, and effort required that will differentiate the perceived value of each offer.
13:09
Simply put, if two things make someone beautiful, what makes 1 worth $50,000 and another worth $5?
Answer the extent of the other three value variables #2.
Perceived likelihood of achievement.
Our goal increase.
This was the last of the variables that I added when trying to think through this framework a few years ago.
13:29
I just felt like something was missing with only the other three.
Then I realized people pay for certainty.
They value certainty.
I call this the perceived likelihood of achievement.
In other words, how likely do I believe that it is that I will achieve the result that I'm looking for if I make this purchase, for example?
13:47
How much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon's 10 thousandth patient versus their first, if you're a normal same person, A lot more.
I mean, heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you're their first patient ever.
So you can see even from the simple example that while the service you're receiving is technically the same, the only thing that changes is your perceived likelihood of getting what you want.
14:09
Both surgeons take the same amount of time to do the surgery.
If anything, the guy who has done it 10,000 times.
Would likely get it done faster and still charge more.
The more experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result which incentivizes their desirability.
People value this perceived like of achievement.
14:27
Increasing A prospects conviction that your offer will actually work for them will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end.
So to increase value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likely of achievement through our messaging proof.
14:42
What we choose to include or exclude in our offer and our guarantees.
More on this later.
Number three time delay.
Our goal increase.
Time delay is the time between a client buying and receiving the promise benefit.
The shorter the distance between when they make the purchase and when they receive value slash the outcome, the more valuable your service or product is.
15:03
There are two elements to this driver of value, long term outcome and short term experience.
Many times there are shortterm experiences that occur and route to the longterm outcomes.
They happen along the way and provide value.
It's good to understand both.
The thing people buy is the longterm value, AKA the dream outcome, But the thing that makes them stay long enough to get it is the shortterm experience.
15:26
These are the little milestone of prospect seas along the way that shows them they are on the right path.
We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer.
We want clients to have a big emotional win early, as close as possible to their purchase.
This gives them the emotional buying and the momentum to see it through to their ultimate goal.
15:46
For example, it takes a while to add an extra $239,000 per year to a gym, but that's what they're buying.
So once they have purchased, we need to create emotional wins fast.
One of the ways we do this is to get their ads live and get them to close their first $2000 sale within their first seven days.
By doing this, their decision to work with us is reinforced and they immediately trust us more.
16:05
This makes them more likely to follow the rest of our systems and get to their ultimate destination Pro tip.
Fast wins.
Always try and incorporate short term immediate wins for a client.
Be creative.
They just need to know that they're on the right path and they made the right decision trusting you and your business.
Let me give you another example.
16:22
If I sell someone a bikini body, their time delay to realize that outcome may be 12 months or even longer along the way though as they change their bodies.
They may experience higher sex drive, more energy, and an increased community of friends.
They aren't initially buying those things, but those things may become shortterm benefits that keep them in the game long enough to achieve their ultimate outcome.
16:43
They buy the dream, but they stay for the benefits they discover along the way.
The faster and more clearly you can demonstrate those benefits, the more valuable your service will be.
For a weight loss customer, we would get them to meet someone else, so they immediately had some social benefits from the program.
And we usually give them a more aggressive diet in the beginning.
17:01
Why?
Because we wanted them to have a big, fast emotional win so we could get them to commit to the long term.
This is also backed by science.
People who experience a victory early on are more likely to continue with something than those who do not.
That being said, having to wait 12 to 24 months to get you what you want is a long time when you can do liposuction and be done in an afternoon.
17:22
This just shows one of the reasons people pay $25,000 for a liposexual with a tummy tuck.
While people will barely pay $100 a month to join a boot camp.
But that's not the only reason, is it?
That leads me to the last driver of value, effort, and sacrifice.
Pro tip Fast beats free.
The only thing that beats free is fast.
17:40
People will pay for speed.
Many companies have entered free spaces and done exceedingly well with a speed first strategy.
A few notable companies, the MVD versus the DMV, wait in line forever or pay $50.
You can skip the line and get your license renewed privately.
Medex versus USPS when it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight.
17:59
Spotify versus slow free music.
Uber versus walking fast.
Beats free.
Many will always be willing to pay price for the value of speed.
So if you find yourself in a market competing against free, double down on speed #4 effort and sacrifice our goal decrease.
18:18
This is what it costs people and ancillary costs, AKA other costs accrued along the way.
These can be both tangible and intangible.
Using the fitness liposuction example, let's look at the difference in effort and sacrifice, fitness, effort, and sacrifice.
Wake up one to two hours earlier in the morning, 5 to 10 hours per week of time lost.
18:37
Stop eating the foods you love.
Constant hunger, physical soreness, feelings of embarrassment and not knowing how to exercise.
Risk of injury, Literal nausea.
Working out meal.
Prepping new groceries.
More expensive groceries, new clothing.
Fear of gaining it back.
After all this effort AKA impermanence etcetera, Liposuction, effort and sacrifice.
18:57
Fall asleep, Wake up thin, guaranteed be sore for two to four weeks.
Massive difference right?
In fact, in looking at the marketing of plastic surgeons, these are the exact pain points they hit on when they say things like tired of wasting countless hours in the gym, tired of diets that just don't work.
19:13
This is why when you sell fitness, you have to spend an hour arm wrestling a client to give over 110th or one 100th of the amount of money they pay for surgery.
There's just not a lot of perceived value because the perceived likelihood of achievement, the time delay to achievement and the effort and sacrifice are so high.
So even though the outcome is the same, the value of the vehicles are dramatically different, hence the difference in price.
19:33
Decreasing the effort and sacrifice, or at least the perceived effort and sacrifice, can massively boost the appeal of your offer.
In an ideal world, a prospect who wants to simply say yes and have their dream outcome happen with no more effort on their behalf.
This is why done for you services are almost always more expensive than do it yourself.
19:49
Because a person doesn't have to do all the effort and sacrifice, there's also component of perceived likelihood of achievement difference as well.
People believe that if an expert does it, then they will be more likely to achieve the outcome than if they try on their own.
My hope is that you now have a foundational understanding of the components of value and how the interplay between each of the components creates or detracts from the value someone might be willing to pay.
20:10
Putting it all together.
As I said earlier, these elements of value don't happen in a vacuum, they happen together in combination.
So let's look at a few examples that utilize all four components of value of once.
In an effort to quantify the value, I'll write them on a binary scale of 0 or one.
20:26
One being value achieved, 0 being missing.
Then I will Add all four together to give you a relative value rating of a type of service.
Our goal as marketers and business owners is to increase the value of the dream outcome and it's perceived likelihood of achievement while decreasing the time delay of achievement and the effort and sacrifice one has to put in to get there.
20:45
To start, I will do a side by side comparison of two vehicles with identical dream outcomes.
Meditation and Xanax both offer the buyer relaxation, decreased anxiety and feelings of well-being.
I will demonstrate how the other three variables dramatically shift the value of delivering that dream outcome and ultimately the price meditation versus Xanax.
21:07
So I'm going to read the chart below to compare relative scores on each of the four value drivers.
Meditation, Dream, Outcome, Relaxation, Decrease Anxiety, Feelings, Wellbeing.
Score one out of 1 Perceived likelihood of achievement?
Low since most people get distracted and don't actually think they'll follow through with daily meditation.
21:27
Score 0 out of one time to life, Long time to yield longterm results.
Some immediate benefits after 10 to 20 minutes, assuming you don't get frustrated.
Score .5 out of 1 Effort and sacrifice.
Physical discomfort Numb body limbs often.
21:43
Mental discomfort.
Feeling like you are feeling constantly.
Time sacrifice.
You have to set aside time every day to do this.
Score 0 out of one overall value.
Score for meditation.
Low 1.5 out of four Now let's look at Xanax dream outcome.
Same as meditation.
21:59
Relaxation, Decreased anxiety, feelings of well-being.
Score one out of 1.
Perceived likelihood of achievement high since most people are confident that if they take the pill it will make them feel more relaxed.
Score one out of one time.
Delay 15 minutes for effects to be felt.
Score one out of 1.
22:15
Effort and sacrifice swallowing a pill.
Score one out of one.
Overall value.
Score high four out of four.
And that is why Xanax is a multibillion dollar product.
While I know of almost no multibillion dollar meditation businesses value, I'm not here to argue about whether meditation is better than Xanax.
22:32
Obviously it is, but that doesn't mean it's perceived as more valuable.
This is also the reason that supplement industry 123 billion according to Grandview research, is twice the size of the health club industry, 62 billion according to HERSA.
They both accomplish the same perceived objectives, being healthy, losing weight, looking good, increasing energy, etcetera.
22:51
But one is perceived as more valuable because it has lower costs.
People are more willing to pay $200 for supplements than they are for a $29.00 per month membership.
Taking a pill or drinking a shake is so much faster and easier than going to the gym every day.
Hence valued crazy world we live in and you can either sit there and make complain posts about how people ought to be a certain way, or you can take advantage of the way people are and capitalize.
23:17
This book is for those people who want to be victors, not victims of circumstance.
You can either be right or you can be rich.
This book is for getting rich.
If that bothers you, you can put this down and go back to arguing against human nature.
Hint, you're not going to change it.
Now that being said, knowing what people value versus what is good for them is key.
23:34
It means you can find ways to monetize the things that people value in order to give them what they really need.
Win.
Win.
You can make your dent in the universe while making your profit.
Hey guys.
If you're, you know, struggling to keep track of this, or you like highlighting, you like writing notes in the margin, or you like seeing the frameworks because you might not know this.
23:53
But I actually hand drew every single framework inside of this book, and I think there's at least 50.
Hand drawn images and frameworks inside this book that I painstakingly.
Put together to make the consumption easier and so that it stores in more parts of your brain.
24:08
And so if that sounds at all interesting, you can go to Amazon and grab the physical copy or the Kindle version of that.
If you prefer either of those formats, they're available to you.

Welcome to episode 4.
Of $100 million offers in this episode, we'll be coming.
The thought process behind making a Grand Slam offer value offer part one and value offer Part 2.
It was such an indepth media chapter.
This is the meat and potatoes.
0:17
This is where the rubber hits the road.
This is where you actually make something that people cannot say no to as soon as you show it to them.
I hope you enjoy and use it.
Chapter 8 Value offer the thought process.

If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again.
Thomas H Palmer Teacher's Manual I want to do an exercise with you right now.
I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem solving.
Why?
So that you can actually create the Grand Slam offer that will become the cornerstone of your business.
0:51
Convergent and divergent Thinking In simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known with unchanging conditions and converge on a singular answer.
Think math example.
You have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month.
1:08
It takes 4 calls to create one sale including no shows.
You need to get to 110 sales.
How many salespeople must you hire?
Deduced information One salesperson equals 100 calls. 4 calls equal 1 close. 100 calls divided by 4 calls per close equals 25 closes per 100 calls. 25 closes per Rep goal. 110 sales total divided by 25 sales per Rep equals 4.4.
1:37
Since you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have 5 answer, and since you have three you hire two.
More.
Math problems are convergent.
There are a lot of variables and a single answer.
We are taught all our lives in school to think this way.
1:52
That's because it's easy to grade.
But life will pay you for your ability to solve problems using a divergent thought process.
In other words, think of many solutions to a single problem.
Not only that, convergent answers are binary, They either right or wrong.
With divergent thinking, you can have multiple right answers and one answer that is way more right than the others.
2:13
Cool, right?
Here's what life presents us for.
Divergent thinking.
Multiple variables, known and unknown.
Dynamic conditions, multiple answers.
As such, I want to do an exercise with you right now that will engage the part of your brain that you will need to use in order to make something magical.
2:29
I call it the brick exercise.
Don't worry, it will take 120 seconds.
The brick exercise right now.
I want you to set a timer on your phone for 120 seconds.
What you need to do Think of a brick.
Write down as many different uses of a brick as you can possibly think of.
2:45
How many different ways could a brick be used in life to provide value?
Ready.
Go.
It's okay to write in the book or write on a notepad on the side.
All right, stop.
Now, before I show you my list, did you consider the following?
How big is the brick?
3:02
A tab of gum?
3 to 5 by 8, Two to 1 by 4.
Standard. 2 feet by two?
Feet by 6 feet.
What's the brick made of?
Plastic.
Gold.
Clay, Wood.
Metal.
How's the brick shaped?
Does it have holes in it?
3:17
Does divots for interlocking Now as you think about that, can you think of even more uses for the brick than you probably wrote down.
Well here's my list.
Paperweight doorstep building things home for a fish in a fishbowl plant holder with dirt holes.
Hold brick as a trophy.
3:33
Painted brick.
Rustic decoration to brick a window make a mural Tiny bricks painted a weight for resistance training.
A wedge under an uneven platform?
Pen holder or hold brick?
Children's toy Lego bricks, flotation device, Plastic brick, Payment for goods.
3:51
Gold brick, Stabilizer for leaning against something, Retainer of value Holder for flagpole, Hold brick, a seat jumbo brick.
Every offer has building blocks, the pieces that when combined make an offer irresistible.
Our goal is to use a divergent thought process to think of as many easy ways to combine these elements to provide value.
4:11
So if I were selling a brick, I would find out what my customer's desire was and then devise how many ways I would create value with my brick.
Now let's do it for real.
Chapter 9.
Value Offer Creating Your Grand Slam Offer Part 1, Problems and Solutions ABC Easy as 123 Ah simple As do re Mi, Michael Jackson ABC When I started my gym, I struggled.
4:37
I wanted so deeply to be successful, prove my dad wrong about my decision to start my own business, and prove to myself that I was worth something.
But try as I did, I couldn't even sell people into a $99.00 a month boot camp.
People would say LA Fitness is $29.00 a month.
This is expensive.
I even tried getting people to start for free.
4:54
They said they wouldn't bother because $99.00 a month afterwards was still too much and they didn't want to start something they couldn't continue with.
It's a new level of frustration when you can't even give your services away for free to people.
I felt worthless and I didn't know what to do.
Thankfully during this time I was in groups with other gym owners and I started hearing about marketers and books.
5:13
I devoured everything I could and as soon as I stumbled on Dan Kennedy's books, I was hooked.
In his books he talked about making irresistible offers.
Again, this theme of making an offer so good people would feel stupid to say no kept reappearing.
But this time, remembering what TJ had told me, I'd have decided to go all in on this concept rather than just do what everyone else was doing.
5:31
But how everyone else was selling $99.00 per month boot camps.
How is I going to compete?
So I decided to look at what we did differently.
I thought, what do they really want?
No one wants membership, they want to lose weight.
Step one, identify dream outcome.
I'd heard of weight loss challenges, so I started there.
5:50
Lose 20 pounds in six weeks.
Big dream outcome.
Lose 20 pounds with a decreased time delay.
Six weeks.
Note I wasn't selling my membership anymore.
I wasn't selling the plane flight.
I was selling the solution.
When you are thinking about your dream outcome, it has to be them arriving at their destination and what they would like to experience.
6:08
Step 2 List problems next.
I wrote down all the things people struggled with and they're limiting thoughts around them.
When listing out problems, think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product or service.
What's the next thing they need help with?
These are the problems.
6:25
Think about it in insane detail.
If you do, you will create a more valuable and compelling offer as you'll continually be answering people's next problem as they manifest.
So let's go ahead and list out the problems from a prospects perspective as you think about them, what points of friction exists for them?
6:41
I like to think about it in sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles again, channel in same detail.
The more problems, the better.
Example problems list weight loss.
The first thing they must do.
Buying healthy food.
Grocery shopping problems.
6:58
One, buying healthy food is hard, confusing and I won't like it.
Two, buying healthy food will take too much time.
Three, buying healthy food is expensive. 4I will not be able to cook healthy food forever.
My family needs will get in the way.
If I travel, I won't know what to buy.
Next thing they must do cook healthy food.
7:16
One, cooking healthy food is hard and confusing.
I won't like it and I will suck at it.
Two, cooking healthy food will take too much time.
Three, cooking healthy food is expensive.
It's not worth it. 4I will not be able to cook healthy food forever.
My family's needs will get in my way, and if I travel, I won't know how to cook healthy.
7:33
Next thing they must do eat healthy food.
Next thing you must do, exercise regularly, etcetera.
Now we're going full circle here.
Each of the above problems has four negative elements and, you guessed it, each aligned to the four value drivers as well.
Dream outcome, Perceived Likelihood of Achievement, Time, Delay, Effort, and sacrifice. 1 dream outcome.
7:52
This will not be financially worth it.
Two likelihood of achievement.
It won't work for me specifically.
I won't be able to stick with it.
External factors will get in my way.
This is the most unique and service specific of the problem buckets 3.
Effort and Sacrifice.
This will be too hard.
8:08
Confusing.
I won't like it.
I will suck at it four time.
This will take too much time to do.
I'm too busy to do this.
It will take too long to work.
It will not be convenient for me.
Now go ahead and list out all problems your prospect has.
Don't let these buckets, which are just meant to help your brain get going, constrain you if it's easier for you.
8:25
Just list out everything you can possibly think of.
What I showed here isn't just 4 problems though.
We have 16 core problems with two to four sub problems underneath.
So 32 to 64 problems total.
Yaoza.
No wonder most people don't achieve their goals.
Do not get overwhelmed.
This is the best news ever.
8:42
The more problems you can think of, the more problems you get to solve.
So to recap, just list out each core thing that someone has to do.
Then think of all the reasons they wouldn't be able to do it or keep doing it using the four value drivers as a guide.
Now we go to the fun part, turning problems into solutions.
8:59
Now that we have our dream outcome and all the obstacles that will get in someone's way, it's time to define our solutions and list them out.
Creating the solutions list as two steps.
First, we're going to transform our problems into solutions.
Second, we're going to name these solutions.
That's it.
So let's take a look at our list of problems from earlier.
9:16
What we're going to do is simply turn them into solutions by thinking, what would I need to show someone to solve this problem.
Then we're going to reverse each element of the obstacle into solution oriented language.
This is Copywriting 101.
It's beyond the scope of this book to get into, but simply adding how to then reversing the problem will give most people new to this process a great place to start.
9:36
For our purposes we are giving ourselves a checklist of exactly what we are going to do for our prospects and what we are going to solve for them.
Once we have our list of solutions, we will operationalize how we are actually going to solve these problems AKA create value.
In the next step.
9:52
And I want to be 100% clear, you will solve every problem.
We'll explore how together in the next step.
Problem, solution, problem buying healthy food?

How to eat delicious food without following complicated systems?
Problem Exercising regularly?
It's hard, confusing, etcetera.
Easy to follow Exercise system that everyone enjoys Okay.
That was a lot of problems and a lot of intuitive solutions courtesy of divergent thinking.
11:34
You'll also notice that a lot of them are repetitive and that's totally normal.
The value drivers are the four core reasons our problems always relate to those drivers and our solutions provide the needed answer to give a prospect permission to purchase.
What's even crazier is that if even only one of these needs is missing in a solution, it can cause someone not to buy.
11:50
You would be amazed at the reasons people do not buy, so don't limit yourself here.
Brooke Castillo is a friend of mine who runs an enormous life coaching business.
To give you a different take on the problem solutions list, Brooke sent me her list as she was going through this book to make a Grand Slam offer for a 90 day relationship course.
Take a look to see this process through a totally different lens.
12:09
The main take away though, don't be fancy, just get all the problems down, then turn them into solutions.
Regardless of whether the offer you created is their own fitness, like the example a relationship course like Brooke, or something wildly different like ear eggs, we now know what we need to do.

Hey guys, real quick.
14:00
If you're enjoying the audio, just want to let you know there's a physical copy and a Kindle copy available on Amazon for your consumption.
I'm the type of person who likes to consume things in multiple formats, and if I love a book, I buy every format because I like to have it on my phone.
I like to have it on my desk.
I like to have it when I'm.
Listening in the car, I like to have it every place I possibly can.
14:19
We also have an audible format if you just prefer listening to.
Audible instead of podcasts, you can do that too.
But just figured I'd let you know Chapter 10, Value Offer Creating Your Grand Slam Offer Part 2 Trim and Stack Cut Cut Cut Friends to Rachel Green in Friends.
14:36
I divided this chapter into two parts because it's the media section in the book.
It's also the most important.
Without a valuable product or service, the rest of the book won't be as actionable.
We just covered all the problems we're going to solve.
The second-half of making your offer is breaking down tactically what we're going to do or provide for our client.
14:53
In theory, we'd all love to fly out and live with our customers to fix their problems.
In reality, that wouldn't make a very scalable solution.
We need our offer to be incredibly attractive and profitable.
That being said, if this is your first Grand Slam offer, it's important to over deliver like crazy.
Maybe flying out isn't such a bad idea in the beginning.
15:11
Make some sales.
Then think about how to make it easier for your clients.
You want them to think to themselves.
I get all this for only that.
In essence you want them to perceive tremendous value.
Everyone buys bargains.
Some people just buy $100,000 things for only $10,000.
15:27
That's where we want to live.
High prices but a steal for the value.
Like hopefully this book has been so far sales to fulfillment continuum.
Something that is easy to sell is typically hard to fulfill.
Most things that are hard to sell are typically easy to fulfill.
15:44
In order to best absorb the notions of trimming and stacking, we need a mental reframe and to the sales of fulfillment continuum.
Whenever you are building a business, you have a continuum between ease of fulfillment and ease of sales.
If you lower what you have to do, it increases how hard your product or service is to sell.
16:00
If you do as much as possible, it makes your product or service easy to sell but hard to fulfill because there's more demand on your time investment.
The trick and ultimate goal is to find the sweet spot where you sell something very well that's also easy to fulfill.
I have lived by the mantra create flow, monetize flow, then add friction.
16:17
This means I generate demand first, then with my offer I get them to say yes.
Once I have people saying yes, then and only then will I add friction in my marketing or decide to offer less for the same price.
Practicality drives this practice.
If you can't get demand flowing in, then you have no idea whether what you have is good.
16:35
I'd rather do more for every customer and have cash flow coming in, then optimize my business, but have zero cash flow coming in after, I can have zero idea about what I needed to just to better serve my customers.
Here's a perfect example to drive this home.
When I started gym lunch, gym owners reached out asking for help.
16:51
They needed so much help I didn't know where to start, but I wanted to make sure they got more than what they paid me.
So here's what I ended up doing.
To fill their gyms, I would fly out to their gym for 21 days, spend my own money on hotels, car rentals, eating out advertising, generate the leads, work the leads, then sell for them.
17:09
I would even do the first onboarding meeting with the clients to get them started.
In short, I did everything.
I took on all the risk.
They only had to put $500 down to reserve their date, which I made refundable at the end of their launch.
So they had zero financial risk, zero time risk, zero effort.
And the deal was I got to keep all the upfront cash collected from selling their services and they got all the clients for free.
17:29
You can imagine how this was a pretty compelling offer on my own.
I was able to sell about $100,000 per month in cash upfront for myself.
So these deals were very lucrative for me.
Over time I scaled that to a team of eight guys selling a month, but this began to wear on me and the team.
It was at that point that I realized that if I were to simply teach them how to do what I did, I would charge maybe 1/3 of what I would normally make, but I would be able to help hundreds of gyms a month instead of eight.
17:54
And I could do it all while sleeping in my own bed every night.
My promise was fundamentally the same.
I will fill your gym in 30 days.
It was simply the how and the what I did that changed the how and the what is what.
We are breaking apart when talking to business owners about their model.
18:09
I tell them to create cash flow by over delivering like crazy at first.
Then use the cash flow to fix your operations and make your business more efficient.
This revision process can be pretty seamless.
You may not even have to change what you offer.
You may just end up creating systems that create the same value for the customer but cost you significantly fewer resources.
18:27
Ultimately, this is how businesses beat one another.
Understanding this will be important as you scale your business.
Now that we've established the importance of the fulcrum and how to approach the sales to fulfillment balance at the outset, let's cover the last two steps of creating our Grand Slam offer.
To recap quickly, remember that we've covered identifying Dream Outcomes, step one, Listing Problems, Step 2 and Determining solutions step three-step 4, Create Your Solutions delivery Vehicle.
18:52
The how.
The next step is thinking about all the things you could do to solve each of these problems you've identified.
This is the most important step in the process.
This is what you're going to deliver.
This is what you're going to do or provide in exchange for money.
For the purposes of keeping creativity high.
19:08
Divergent thinking.
Think about anything you could possibly do.
Think of all the things that it might enhance the value of your offer so much though, that it would be stupid to say no.
What could you do that someone would immediately say all that?
Seriously, yes, I'm in.
Doing this exercise will make your job of selling so much easier.
19:27
Even if you come up with something you're not actually willing to do.
It's okay.
The goal here is to push your limits and jog your brain into thinking of a different version of the solution you'd normally default to.
This is where you get to flesh your entrepreneurial creativity.
Remember, you only need to do this once, literally one time for a product that may last years.
19:46
This is high value, high leverage work.
You ultimately get paid for thinking you got this.
This should be fun.
Go ahead and list out all your possibilities now.
Then I'll take you through my example.
I'll just use the buying food problem from earlier as an example.
I'd like to group things by how many people I'm going to deliver this thing to at once.
20:04
My list is below.
At the bottom I've given you my quote, cheat codes End Quote for how to think through this to get even more creative problem.
Buying healthy food is hard, confusing and I won't like it.
If I wanted to provide A1 on one solution, I might offer a.
20:20
An in person grocery shopping experience where I take clients to the store and teach them how to shop.
B.

D in person orientation, not at the store where I teach them what to get E tech support while shopping, where I help them if they get stuck, F phone call while grocery shopping where I plan to call them when they go shopping to provide direction and support in real time.
20:50
If I wanted to provide a small group solution, I might offer a in person grocery shopping where I meet a bunch of people and take them all shopping for themselves.
B personalized grocery list where I teach a bunch of people how to make their weekly list and I could do this one time or every week if I wanted to C buy their food for them where I purchase their groceries and deliver them as well.
21:11
D in person orientation where I teach a small group offsite what to do, just not at the store.
If I wanted to provide A1 to many solution, I might offer a live grocery store tour where I might stream me going through the grocery store for all my new customers and let them ask questions.
Live BA recorded grocery store tour where I might shop once, record it and then give it as a reference point from that point onwards for my clients to watch on their own.
21:34
CA do it yourself.
Grocery calculator where I create a shareable tool or show them how to use a tool to calculate the grocery list every week.
D predetermined list where each customer plan comes with its own grocery list for each week.
I could make this ahead of time so they have it.

E grocery buddy system where I could pair each customer with another which takes no time and lets them go shopping together.
F pre made Instacart grocery carts for delivery where I could pre make Instacart lists so clients could have their groceries delivered to their doorstep with one click.
22:09
As you see the list can really go on and on here.
This is just to illustrate the many ways to solve a single problem.
Now do this for all the perceived problems that your clients encounter before, after and during their experience with your product or service.
You should have a monster list by the end of this product delivery cheat codes.
22:26
What's that?
You're having trouble being creative?
I'm going to give you the cheat codes right now, kind of like I did with the brick example.
Like the brick could be gold or plastic or have holes in it, or be a Lego, etcetera.
Here are my cheat codes for product variation and enhancement and a visual to break down the process for you.
22:42

How do I want to support F10X to 110th?
Test if my customers paid me 10 times my price or $100,000, what would I provide if they paid me 110th of my price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is?
23:49
How would I do that?
How could I still make them successful for 110th the price?
Stretch your mind in either direction and you'll come up with wildly different solutions.
In other words, how can I actually deliver on these solutions?
I am claiming I will provide.
Do this for each problem because solutions from one problem will give you ideas for others you wouldn't normally have considered.
24:09
Remember, it's important that you solve every problem.
I can't tell you the amount of times one single item becomes the reason someone doesn't buy anecdote.
Why We Must Solve Every Perceived Problem When I started selling weight loss, I insisted that folks prepare all their food at home.
24:25
I found it too difficult to help clients lose weight when they ate out because they always blew their diets.
Rather than solve the problem, I insisted they do it my way or not at all.
As a result, I lost many sales.
One month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent.
My next sale walked in the door.
It was a business exec looking to lose weight.
24:42
As we got into the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn't work for her because she went out to eat for lunch every day.
Normally I would have lost the sale.
I was a stickler for making people not eat out, but I really needed the money refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing.
I concede it.
24:58
I'll make you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat out 100% of the time and still hit your goal.
How does that sound?
She agreed and I closed the sale.
I took the time to make an eating out guide for her, but from that point, going forward, whenever someone said but what about eating out?
I had the solution.
25:14
Over time, I continued solving obstacles with templates and trainings until there were no more one things to prevent my sales.
This lesson has stuck with me to this day.
Don't get romantic about how you want to solve the problem.
Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with.
When you do that, you make an offer that's so good people just can't say no.
25:31
And that's what we're building here.
Note, you must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people.
That's not to say that if you don't, you won't sell people.
Not at all.
You just won't sell as many people as you otherwise could have.
And that's the goal, to sell the most people for the highest possible price with the highest possible margin.
25:52
Step 5, TRIM and Stack.
Now that we've enumerated our potential solutions, we will have a gigantic list.
Next, I look at the cost of providing each of these solutions to me, the business owner.
I remove the ones that are the highest cost and lowest value first.
Then I remove low cost, low value items.
26:09
If you aren't sure what's high value, go through the value equation and ask yourself which of these things will this person one, financially value 2 cause them to believe they'll be likely to succeed 3 make them feel like they can do it with much less effort and less sacrifice, and four, help them accomplish their goal and see the result they want in far less time.
26:27
What should remain or offer items that are one low cost, high value or two high cost high value?
Example, let's say I moved in with someone and did their shopping, exercising, and cooking for them.
They would probably believe they would definitely lose weight, but I am not willing to do that for any amount of money short of a gazillion dollars.
26:45
The next question becomes, is there a lesser version of this experience that I can deliver at scale?
Just take one step back at a time until you arrive at something that has a time commitment or cost that you are willing to live with, or obviously massively increase your price so it becomes worth it for you, I E the gazillion dollars to live with someone.
27:00
If there's one type of delivery vehicle to focus on, it's creating high value, one to many solutions.
These will be the ones that typically have the biggest discrepancy between cost and value.
For example, before I started my gym, I had an online training business.
I created a small excel sheet application that, after inputting all of someone's goals, automatically generated 100 meals perfectly suited to their macro nutrient calorie needs.
27:22
Better yet, depending on which meals they selected, it would tell them what they needed to buy at the grocery store in exact amounts and how to prepare them in bulk for the exact amounts.
It took me about 100 hours to put together this entire thing, but from that point going forward I sold truly personalized eating plans for very expensive prices.
27:38
But they only took me about 15 minutes to make high value, low cost.
These types of solutions require a high one time cost of creation, but infinitely low additional effort thereafter.
FYI, this is exactly why software becomes so valuable.
That doesn't mean you don't want to ever do something in a small group or 101 model.
27:56
After all, I do 101 with all My Portfolio company CEO's that we help scale past 30 million.
Plus.
You just want to make sure that you save those high cost items for big value ads only.
If you think you can accomplish the same value with a lower cost alternative, then do that instead.
When I was running my gym I went through this exact exercise and created walking blueprints and eating out system, a travel eating and workout guide, Meal plans for everybody, weight and gender, a grocery list calculator, plateau busting meal plans for when they got stuck fast.
28:24
Cooking guides partnered with a meal prep service and did in person nutrition orientation with every client 101.
Many of the one to many solutions require more work upfront, but once created they become valuable assets that create value in perpetuity.
It's worth putting in the time to create these because they will create high margin profit for years to come.
28:43
Real talk, the meal plans I made for my gym have been used by 4000 plus gyms now and literally hundreds of thousands of people.
They are simple and easy to follow, so they've provided ample return for the week or two of dedicated time I spent making them.
And if you ever have the desire to build a repeatable business model, something that scales, these assets you create will become the bedrock.
29:02
This book, for example, is a high value asset that is low cost overall.
Sure, it cost me a lot up front, but each additional book I sell after my first one cost me very little and provides tremendous value.
The final high value deliverable.
Let's sum this up before we configure our final high value deliverable.
29:20
Step one, we figured out our prospective client stream outcome.
Step two, we listed out all the obstacles they're likely to encounter on the way, aka our opportunities for value creation.
Step three, we listed out all those obstacles as solutions.
Step 4.
We figured out all the different ways we could deliver those solutions.
29:37
Step 5A, we trim those ways down to only the things that were the highest value and lowest cost to us.
All we have to do now is Step 5B, put all the bundles together into the ultimate high value deliverable.
So let's go back to the example we see our prospects struggled with the following buying food.
29:54

Author Note Most of our facilities now sell this bundle for longer periods of time for $2400 to $5200.
Wild.
As we got better at creating and monetizing value, the prices and profit of our facilities skyrocket.
Once you start this value creation process, each additional piece of value creates stacks up over time.
32:32
This is why it's important to begin.
Can you see how much more valuable this is than a gym membership?
The bundle does 3 core things.
One, it solves all the perceived problems, not just some.
Two gives you the conviction that what you're selling is one-of-a-kind.
Very important three makes it impossible to compare or confuse your business or offering with the one down the street.
32:54
We finally have what we are going to deliver in all its glory.
That being said, it's unlikely we would present it this way.
Depending on whether we sell one-on-one or one to many, we would present this differently.
I will address how to present each of these bundled items in the bonus section, which is the next section.
Summary Points.
33:11
We went through this entire process to accomplish 1 objective, to create a valuable offer that is differentiated and unable to be compared to anything else in the marketplace.
We are selling something unique.
As such, we are no longer bound by the normal pricing forces of commoditization.
Prospects will now only make a value based rather than a price based decision on how they should buy from us.
33:31
Hurrah.
Now that we have our core offer, the next session will be dedicated to enhancing it.

Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hey, what's going on?
Everybody?
Help you guys.
I had an awesome Thursday.
I was just in my wife's office and we were chit-chatting and I brought up something that I had seen this morning in a video.
0:42
And so she was like, this sounds like and I kind of went on a little rant about it and she's like that sounds like a video that you should probably make.
And so here I am making this video based on what Leila said.
So, you know, I'm titling.
This, how to inspire team and create an Evangelical.
1:00
Your clients and your employees.
And so, if you think about, like, there's two ways to get people to do things, right?
One of them is to manipulate them with carrots and sticks, which will be, you know, incentives of like, you know, if your business is to give discounts discount this counts or, you know penalties, right?
1:19
It's one of the other and those motivate Behavior.
That's from the manipulative side.
The other side is the inspirational side, and the difference is huge.
And most people operate from the manipulative side.
And I don't say that in a negative way.
It's just kind of is, and a lot of people have seen the growth of our business and whether you, you know, Believe in Us or not.
1:41
Or if you're watching this video, then maybe Believe in Us a little bit but we have pretty pretty loyal clients and we have an incredibly loyal team and especially our clients are almost Evangelical.
And I'm probably have to define a couple things as I go because it's pointing to do.
1:57
So, the difference between A repeat buyer and a loyal customer is that a repeat buyer?
Someone who you've met a certain threshold of quality and price and therefore they just continue to business because it's easier for them than to take on the cognitive load.
2:13
Make another decision about another business, right?
The difference between that and a loyal, customer is someone who will forgo a potentially better option that might even be priced lower to continue to do business with you.
And the reason and things that differentiate Those are what I'm talking about with the, which is manipulation versus inspiration.
2:34
And so if you can Inspire your clients and you can Inspire your employees, then you can get that kind of loyalty.
Then the next question is naturally like, well how do you do that?
And so a lot of times there's two aspects that one is probably more aspects.
But the 2000 about is one is a wide base cause right?
2:52
Which is so.
I've been like binge watching all of Simon sinek stuff on leadership and I think there's a lot of stuff that are parallels with branding And really, which is like a poo poo term, sort of, but for me, but I'm just go with me on it but a wide base.
3:08
Cause because what happens is, people don't actually buy from your company necessarily because of what you offer.
But because of what you represent, right.
Which is why they buy and it goes the same thing for a local gym and what it does is that your services and your products are just tangible proof of the beliefs that you have.
3:27
And so people buy into Hands because it it stands as proof of what they say about what they believe about themselves.
And so, when they purchase from you, they're saying something about themselves.
Now, most people most businesses don't operate that way and it's purely transactional, which is why most businesses on except front of my most people don't have loyal.
3:46
Following switched why most people don't have oil employees because they're, they're only for a paycheck.
And thus cats are overwhelmingly negative when it comes to fulfillment for her employees.
It's like 90% of people are not filled by their work, right?
And that's because most of Time they're simply trading time for dollars and it's best pays the bills but they're not really seeing the cause that the the business is after.
4:07
And so if there's one that you can take from this, without me getting to the second point, it's that if you don't know what your beliefs are, right?
You have to you have to cast that provision what that inspirational vision of what you believe and it does have to just be one thing.
It could be multiple things that you believe a lot of times people tease out the beliefs that we, you know, that Lila and I have about about business, but also about marriage or not.
4:29
To treat people and how to communicate clearly and how to set standards and how to hold yourself to a higher standard.
And the way to do that is by not.
And like if you have that wide base cards, then you don't have, you don't look at your competition, right.
This is kind of goes in parallel with the whole infinite game concept that I talked about a couple days ago is that, if you're 100% focused on continuing to play the game, and chasing an ideal that you know, that you'll never actually accomplished.
4:55
Then that's how you inspire people to take action because most people don't actually take action with their logic.
A ticket with their logical.
Mind third of their limbic systems like the deeper green, right?
They just say, feels right, feels good.
It feels like the right decision because they can't put words to it because that's not where they make the decisions anyways, right?
5:12
So we can put as much proof out there as we want to about lights, might be a good job for an employee year about, you know, the benefits and the payroll and blah blah blah, right?
But the thing is is that people will follow you because they believe in you, because they trust you which and they believe in the cause you're really trying to pursue.
5:27
Now, you can say and This is kind of like my second point is that you can save it.
This is what your belief is.
This is what you're trying to accomplish the difference between those companies and people that are able to do that.
And actually have people follow them is the extent to which those people actually believe.
5:44
And so, this is what I was talking about with Layla, but it felt like it was necessary to put the groundwork in.
Is that People want to follow people who are authentic, right?
And being authentic is simply being the exact same in private as you are in public and having zero discrepancy between the two of those things.
6:04
And so most people say you need to just be courageous and say you the beliefs that you have in private and I think that it's actually somewhat different than that.
I mean I think that's true but I think the reason that most people aren't doing it is actually because of something a little bit deeper and I think it's because this just my theory.
6:21
People actually don't have the beliefs that would Inspire the people and that's where the issue comes up.
And that's why it can't be authentic is because if they said, I really don't care that much about my employees.
Like customers are just, people are just sheep.
They're just what I'm, you know, they're just the the hurt that I'm trying to just, you know, just get dollars from right because the thing is, they can say certain things with the things that they truly believe and to coming out and the tangible proof that of the quality of the service and the extent to which Their customers and their employees are bought in to their company right now?
6:56
Right now.
Do you think that you're all of your employees if offered a equal position at with better pay at another company would leave you?
It's a real question, right?
If you have loyal employees, a lot of times they wouldn't because they're like, I love my job, I feel so fulfilled by it.
7:12
And so a lot of times people come for those things, but they stay for the belief in the vision and you're trying to cast right into that y, right.
Simon sinek talks about the three three levels of communication, right?
Until I keep all of the Golden Circle, but it's most companies talk about what they do, and then how they're different, and then that's it, they're like, you know, we are a Fitness business and we're different because we offer personalized approach specific to you, and that's their, that's their special sauce, right?
7:40
And everyone has their own little Special Sauce of their unique, selling proposition right at the end of the day.
It's that's not what inspires people to take action.
Some people will because they're hyper active buyers there in the huge amount of need and they'll buy, right?
Right.
But the thing is that to create that kind of loyalty Evangelical following is to show your beliefs and start with the why.
7:59
Right?
That's why it's book is called star Y and like so for us you seen a lot of the beliefs that we have we believe in absolute truth at all times.
If we mess up, I just want to tell you what we messed up or if I don't know the answer.
Something will tell you, I don't know the answer or if it's something.
If we release something, it wasn't gonna be like guys, that sucked and we're gonna do everything we can to not, you know, have that happen again.
8:19
So we believe in truth, you know?
Above all else we believe in treating our employees really, really well.
And we treat them just as well, if not better than our customers and we believe everyone should receive that.
Love from us because of a testament of what we believe.
Right?
And so the business in the way that we talk to our team, the way we structure in the way that we provide quality trainings to our customers is based on the fact that we believe in that, Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
8:50
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Right?
9:08
And that would be the proof.
Now, we can say, we believe the bit more delivering up and it would be the tangible proof that that that's not really the true bleep, right?
And that's where I think the fundamental disconnect is.
And that's where the conversation I was having with Layla.
Is that most people will say those things, they don't actually believe them.
And in our little Community, we call them singe moments, which is when something that you've heard over and over and over again, in your life suddenly becomes real for you, right?
9:29
And there's a lot of things as we've grown this business, much bigger than I would have ever.
Anticipated became real for me and among them.
This is one of them, we kind of fell into the mass movement that we have sort of created among gym owners.
I would never have guessed.
9:45
It would have grown as fast as it has.
And I don't want to take credit for it because it's not really about us.
And people don't follow us or, you know, people aren't inspired by this because we're somehow special, but it's because of the beliefs that those people have and how it, confirms our up firms, the belief that they believe about himself, right?
10:07
They Hello, because they're like, I stand for that.
Like, I'm an alignment with that and if you have no beliefs, that they can be aligned with alignment with then there's nothing that they would go to fight for you for because in the reality, people aren't really fighting for us.
When they go in, they comment on other people's ads where, you know, smash us for no reason because biggest competitors, but it's because they're defending an aspect of themselves.
10:28
They're just defending an aspect of their own beliefs and so we were just a proxy for that, right?
The example, I think that time it's not given one of his talk.
I mean, Probably, while the talk was that when everyone showed up to see Martin Luther King speak his hot.
As I Have a Dream speech, was it wasn't?
10:46
I have a plan.
I have a superior, whatever it was.
I have a dream.
It was an ideal that everyone knew that we wouldn't necessarily achieve, like, when the United States was founded.
It's like, we have like it wasn't about like screw screw Europe.
Like this is all the things wrong with the world was like, no, we believe that all men are created equal, right?
11:02
And so, it's this ideal that we have yet to achieve, but that we will all continue to die.
Fight to achieve it, right?
And so, but at the end of the day, the reason that all of these things can work together in this abundant, this growth-oriented like how we can continue to grow as a nation and how we continue to grow as humans is based on trust.
11:23
And the way that you trust people is when you surround yourself with people who have similar values and simmer ideals.
And the only way to do that is if everyone knows what those similar ideals and beliefs are also means seeing what you don't write and that That creates this level of bond because you're like, those people are just like me, right?
11:41
That guys like me or that organizations like me, that's how when people like, it's like this huge accomplishment when a brand will get, you know, when customer will start yet start to get their brands tattooed on them.
And the reality is, it's not because a lot of times people will tattoo Brands them stuff that they don't even own, right?
11:57
Some people, I hardly gave us some tattoo.
They don't even own a bike, but they believe in what Harley-Davidson stands for because what it does, is it stops becoming a logo, becomes a symbol of beliefs.
And that's what motivates people to take action.
That's what motivates people to become Evangelical and defend your brand.
12:13
It's what motivates your employees to work overtime and not clock with because they just want to serve your customers because they believe that they're serving the cause and because that is telling them and reinforcing their own identity that they have about themselves.
And so I thought that it might be useful for you.
12:32
I thought this might be useful for you.
If you're thinking about like man, I wish my team were more reward, you know, they'll take more.
Initiative or I wish they wish.
My clients would defend me more.
I wish I could have like and the reason that this happens is you can actually like from business standpoint you actually get huge benefits from this you get higher lower lower employee turnover.
12:48
You get way more productivity per employee.
Your customers are willing to pay a premium for an extended period of time for even a inferior product.
I'm not saying that ours is inferior in any way.
I think.
Ours is superior for a lot of reasons, but it's it's because of the way that we approached it necessarily because of whatever, right?
13:05
And and if you have longer lifetime, Use as a result of that because then people stopped even comparing anywhere else in the marketplace to you.
Right?
Like apple doesn't have the best products, like their computers.
Simply are not as powerful as PCS and yet.
So many people don't even look at other computers because they're like, I'm in, I'm a Mac, you know, I'm an apple butter.
13:23
That's it, right?
Because they believe in what that company stands for, right?
And it's because of what it sells about about themselves.
And so right now if you're like, if I'm you're having difficulty with that, then you need to write down the things that you believe it could be all of the things that you believe.
And even the honestly the more polarizing it is the more you will get the people who are aligned with you and you're like those are my kind of people.
13:46
You don't know why but you just trust them, right?
The trust is the basis of having people take initiative having going the extra mile because they live in a culture of manipulation, right?
Where it's only carrots and sticks.
They can never venture outside because they don't know there's uncertainty about what's going to happen after work.
14:03
So they don't take the risk, which means you never get Innovation.
You don't get that kind of productivity from everyone.
And your clients look, I'll sort.
So, anyways, I thought that was cool and I thought you guys might think that so that is for y'all and look at what you believe and I recommend you start saying it because it'll benefit you and it'll, it'll very quickly.
14:24
You'll see, the people who are in your organization, you don't believe what you believe and you should probably let them go not because of lack of skill, but just because you should surround yourself with people who believe what you believe, because you'll just create a stronger organization and then that will also attract the customers who believe what you believe.
And so, then you have this symbiotic like environment that gets created, what everyone kind of likes, everyone.
14:44
And that's kind of if you went to the gym words, that you would have seen this where everyone just like underst, like everyone got it.
Like we can't put words to it because it's not something that's a logical idea.
It's something that's it's deep brain feeling like everyone here just gets it.
They get what we're about right?
15:00
And why do you have such a giving Community inside of the general Community?
Because that's what we believe, we believe in giving Right?
Like I had a speaker who came up, who's a rubber manufacture, right?
And I just tried to negotiate a discount for everyone.
Most times people get points, you know?
15:17
If you're like a an affiliate or something, you get points on how much you get sick, you get a kickback, right?
And I didn't I don't really want one because I just want to over deliver to you guys because that's a belief that I have.
It's a value that I stand for and so for me to get an extra 10% or 15% like I don't care.
It's not I mean business.
I just want everyone to get a better deal and I'm happy with that.
15:34
Right?
And that's like level 1, the In level would be, if I want to try and have a strong relationship with someone, like let's say, a rubber dealer does thousands of Jim's, right?
That might make sense for me.
Now I could ask him.
Hey man, can you send me gym owner?
So I can help them out, right, but what do you think the likelihood is that?
15:53
He's gonna start doing that?
Probably not not a lot, right?
But if I know that he's a really high quality business and I and then he stands behind he's been doing for 35 years, right?
What am I going to do?
I'm going to get to him first because it's a that's a value that I have and whether or not he gets back to me is kind of Relevant.
Because the value should be independent of what happens afterwards, right?
16:11
It should be independent and so it's the same reason.
When we go to war, we still pick up the enemies bodies and we draw them to our side even though it makes no logical sense for us to waste our resources on someone else who's our enemy, but it's because it's what we believe, that's what we're fighting for, right?
16:28
And so what are the things that you fight for?
The things that you died for a things, you believe?
If you articulate, those things to your employees first.
And then your clients, employees will also articulate those things to your clients by not only what they say, but how they say it and how they live and how they you so fossil everybody put your having an awesome day, happy Thursday and I will see you guys

Hey guys, welcome to the special collaboration between The Game Podcast and $100 million offers the audio book.
Today we're going to talk about offer enhancers, specifically scarcity and urgency.
First off, the difference between the two.
Second off, the ethical.
Ways of using them in business and the unethical ways of using it, which I highly don't recommend.
0:20
Long term you'll lose money, so definitely use it the right way and make more money.
That seems like the best thing to do.
Hope you guys enjoy.
And hey, if this podcast has been useful to you, share it with a friend.
You know, I took a year to write this book, and it took me two.
Days to record this audio book for you guys.
0:37
If if it takes you 15 seconds to click, share on this and send it to a friend or share it on your stories.
It would mean the world to me, and might even mean the world to someone else.
Section 4.
Enhancing Your offer.
Scarcity, urgency, bonuses, guarantees and naming.
0:55
But wait, there's more.
If you order today, every infomercial in the 90s May 2019, Arnold Schwarzenegger's Home after School All Stars fundraiser.
The line of cars outside Arnold's house was around the corner, and we were in one of them.
We were sitting in our Uber when a security guard with an earpiece, black suit and black sunglasses knocked on the driver's window.
1:16
It was like straight out of a movie.
The driver rolled down the window.
Name.
And Layla Mosey.
He scanned the list on his clipboard, nodded, then checked off our names.
Great, he said.
His demeanor transformed from stern to inviting.
Welcome to the fundraiser.
1:32
Stay in this line.
You'll make a left.
Then security was court you the rest of the way.
The security guard talked into his walkie-talkie to the next post down the road, signaling our car was approved.
Pulling in front of the estate was like entering a Bond movie, Lamborghinis, Bugattis, Ferraris and brands of cars that are too expensive to even speak of.
1:50
Old guys with young skinnily clad girls a list actors, celebrities with millions of followers were recording themselves as they arrived, talking to their iPhones to their audiences and us.
The fundraiser was 25,000 per ticket to attend, with an invalid list of only 100.
There was a red carpet in all every year.
2:07
The fundraiser culminated in a big auction for memorabilia and items some of the business owners in the audience gave away for charity.
We walked around looking at the entertainment stations purposely devised to get donors in the giving mode.
We saw $10,000 scotches, $500 cigars, prereleased items for major brands that wouldn't be available to public until months later, and of course, the most expensive cuisine you could imagine.
2:29
Lela and I were just soaking it all in.
It was a wonderful night.
We definitely felt like cool kids.
Then the CEO of the charity saw us looking lost and walked over.
He took me by the arm and introduced me to some of the other donors.
These were all men who were older than me, donating $100,000 and up without a second thought.
2:45
The man he introduced me to was one of the charity's biggest donors.
He had built an ultra high end jewelry and watch business.
I'm talking 100,502 million dollar plus rare status symbols that people buy only so other .001 percenters know they belong.
He had donated upwards of 700,000 in merchandise as prizes for the fundraiser that evening.
3:04
Alex and Layla meet George.
Ben said he's been very generous with his time and money to the cause.
George, this is Alex and Layla.
They're donating $1,000,000 tonight to after school.
Allstars, I figured you are both good people and wanted to connect you to.
Nice to meet you.
George said with calm and weathered eyes.
3:21
He was in his late 60s, tall and sturdily built.
He'd hear his Eastern block origins.
In his accent, he sounded like a man who had fought tooth and nail to be here, but had softened his demeanor for gathering such as these.
But the tiger with the teeth and claws remained under the surface, ready to be called upon at a moment's notice.
3:36
I felt like I understood this guy, then broke the ice.
So George was the one who got me to raise the price from 15,000 per ticket to $25,000.
We had more demand than ever this year, but I took his advice.
I cut the amount of tickets we sold and raised the prices.
That's right, George said, content that his stage business advice had been followed when demand increases cut supply.
3:56
He perked up slightly because we started talking about money.
This man had built his business from nothing and had found ways to sell things for extraordinary profits.
By understanding human psychology, I had long learned about supply and demand.
But this guy was using its psychological underpinnings to fuel a fundraising You could take the tiger out of the jungle, but not the jungle out of the Tiger.
4:15
People want what they can't have.
People want what other people want.
People want things only a select few have access to.
He was dead right.
They had raised an extra $1 million that night before the event had even started, by cutting the supply of tickets and raising the prices.
4:31
On top of that, all the people were more qualified than ever to be big donors.
The night ended being at the most successful night in the charity's history, raising nearly $5.4 million from only 100 people.
That's $5400 a head.
Each of the items was auctioned off as a one-of-a-kind item, and if you missed it, you'd never have a chance to buy it again.
4:49
Arnold even threw in some bonuses when two people would get high enough in the bidding, allowing the charity to get both donations.
It was a masterful display of human psychology at work in a setting where people knowingly overpaid for products.
The products remained unchanged.
Yet within this setting, an item that wouldn't sell at a different venue for $10,000 sold for $100,000.
5:08
That's how powerful scarcity urgency and bonuses are.
And breaking down how to use them to further increase demand for your offer without changing your offer is the purpose of this section.
Author note Other persuasion powers apply.
Scarcity Urgency, bonuses and guarantees were not the only persuasion tools being employed to get egregious prices at the fundraiser.
5:27
They also use commitment and consistency, status, peer pressure, goodwill, celebrity endorsements, competition, etcetera.
However, scarcity, urgency, bonuses and guarantees are the four that I'll be breaking down in this book, as I believe they're the ones that belong with the offer.
And less with the actual selling, which I will talk about more in depth.
In acquisition volume, $400 million sales.
5:45
The delicate dance of desire pictured in the book is the supply and demand curve.
Fundamentally, all marketing exists to influence the supply and demand curve.
We artificially increase the demand for our products and services through some sort of persuasive communication.
When we increase the demand, we can sell more units.
6:01
When we decrease the supply, we can sell those units for more money.
The perfect profit combination is lots of demand and very little supply or perceived supply.
The process of enhancing your offer is designed to both of these things, increase demand and decrease perceived supply so you can sell the same products for more money than you otherwise could and in higher volumes than you otherwise would over a long enough time horizon.
6:23
The new supply demand curve picture in the book is that has been shifted to the right by bonuses, scarcity, urgency guarantees and naming so that you can get more units sold at higher prices.
Author Note This assumes a regular business who is not trying to gain mass market penetration for some other strategic advantage.
6:42
Desire comes from not getting what you want.
In fact, I heard this quote that I love from Naval Ravikan desires a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.
It follows, therefore, that we only want things we do not have.
As soon as we have them, our desire for them disappears.
Therefore, if we seek to increase the demand or desire, we must decrease or delay, satisfying the desires of our prospect.
7:04
We must sell fewer units than we otherwise can.
Let that sit with you for a second.
Consider this example.
We promote some two day workshop that is upcoming.
First, we whisper that it's coming, then we tease it with some benefits.
Then we shout that it's launching in a week.
Then when we launch this amazing workshop, we have two supply demand scenarios.
7:23
Scenario one we sell 10 units at $500 each.
Sell the entire pyramid of demand at a price that everyone says yes to scenario 2.
We sell 2/1 day workshops, one O 1 for $5000 each.
We skim the top of that pyramid with 80% of people not being able to purchase or choosing not to.
7:40
It's worth noting that each of these prospects have different buying thresholds.
In my experience, demand for services is nonlinear.
Instead, I found a man to be fractal a KA8020IN other words, 1/5 of prospects are willing to pay five times the price or more.
In the example I might have 10 people willing to pay $500.00, but two of them willing to pay $5000.
8:00
That would make more have lower cost to a KA, more profits, provide more value and increase the demand in the remaining prospect base by selling fewer units.
Think about how exclusive scenario one versus scenario two would feel.
Think about all the people who would want to purchase but would not be able to with this increase or decrease their desire.
8:18
It would increase it.
Of course, on top of that, if people see that others who are able to get in or loving it, it would further increase their desire.
And the next time they would act with more urgency and be willing to pay more for the same thing than they originally did.
So now, in the aftermath of our second scenario, we would still have eight people who have unsatisfied desire.
8:37
This increases their desire further and to boot, we now have new prospects who weren't in the original pool, who now want what we have.
The next time we promote scenario two, we then open up three spots at the same price and sell them all, still leaving some prospects with pent up demand.
This is a continuous theme.
8:55
Conversely.
If we were to promote scenario one again the $500 price point, we would probably sell fewer slots the second time around.
Why?
We have no pent up demand.
All desire has been fulfilled when you quote pull the trigger too early.
Each successive instance we promote, we sell even fewer.
9:10
Eventually we run out of sufficient demand to even make a single sale.
This is the sad state many businesses find themselves in, always trying to generate more demand to make another quick sale or Mosey law.
The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make.
The longer the runway, the bigger the plane that can take off.
9:27
We must endeavor to keep our supply and satisfaction of desire under the demand that we are able to generate.
This maximizes profits and keeps desire ravenous in our customer base.
This is the real key to never going hungry Summary points.
The reason I titled this subsection Delicate Dance of Desire is that supply and demand are inversely correlated.
9:46
In theory, if you satisfy 0 desire, AKA provide zero supply, you will not make money and eventually people will leave feeling rejected.
No, it takes much longer than you think.
Conversely, if you satisfy all the demand, you will kill your golden goose and not know where your next meal will come from.
10:02
Mastering supply and demand comes from the elegant dance between the two.
If you sleep with your significant other everyday, they have less desire than if you haven't slept with them for a week.
We want the ravenous prospect, not merely the aroused.
Therefore, understanding the interplay between these variables is key to enhancing the offer in the amount of profits you will make over time.
10:21
Up to this point we have covered all the things inside of your offer that can make it immune to price comparison and transform regular services and products into things that people will find a way to pay for.
It would follow that the next variable that can make your offer more desirable is how it is presented.
In other words, the outside variables that position the product in your prospects.
10:38
Mind, these forces are often more powerful than your core offer.
In the next section, Enhancing Your Offer, I will show you how I one use scarcity to decrease supply to raise prices.
And indirectly increase demand through perceived exclusiveness. 2 Use Urgency to increase demand by decreasing the action threshold of a prospect 3.
10:59
Use bonuses to increase demand and increase perceived exclusivity 4.
Use guarantees to increase demand by reversing risk 5 Use names to restimulate demand and expand awareness of my offer To my target audience.
I will define each and give you examples on how to use them.
11:15
We will use all of these variables to enhance our offer and shift the demand curve in our favor, leaving our customers always wanting for more.
We will start by tactically stimulating fear of missing out a KA FOMO through scarcity.
Hey guys, real quick.
11:31
We have a physical copy and a Kindle version of this book.
It's on Amazon.
And that's for those of you who didn't know it's.
Available If you like consuming multiple formats like I do, I'd recommend picking it up.
I promise I'm not trying to break the bank account here.
I mean.
It's available already for free on my on my podcast, but unfortunately don't they don't print books for free.
11:50
So if, if, if that sounds good to you.
Go check it out on Amazon.
If not, keep it enjoyed.
Chapter 11 Enhancing the Offer Scarcity Sold Out Scarcity is one of the most powerful and least understood forces to unlock unlimited pricing power.
12:08
If you want to learn how to sell air for millions of dollars, then pay attention.
The reason for an authority like a doctor.
A celebrity like Oprah or celebrity authority like Doctor Oz or Doctor Phil can charge egregious rates is because of implied demand.
People assume that there's a lot of demand for their time and therefore not a big supply of it.
12:26
As a result, it must be expensive.
That being said, it's hard for most businesses to understand what it's really like to have an uneven supply demand curve until you've experienced it.
I'm going to try and walk you through what it felt like for me for the first time.
I experienced it in order to give you a taste of the power.
When I got in this world of acquisition, I saw mentors of mine selling days of time for $50,000 plus.
12:45
My mind was blown for two reasons.
First, because I didn't understand how they could make so much money for a single day.
Second, because I didn't understand who in the right mind was buying it.
Over time, I learned I'll start with the buyer.
If I have a rare problem and I must solve this problem for my own pursuit of happiness, it will consume all of my attention.
13:03
By the nature of my problem being specialized, there will be very few people who can solve it.
This means there is not a large supply of solvers.
In many cases, I will perceive only one possible solver, AKA supply, equals one.
Beyond that, if solving this problem speeds up my achievement of a goal by a year or two, or immediately results in me making hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars, that solution becomes far more valuable, does it not?
13:27
Of course it does.
And so it would follow if I can pay someone $50,000 for a day of their time and see an increase of $500,000 per month in revenue within three months because of the insights and strategies revealed.
That would be a hell of a return on investment, right?
So there are two components to value here.
13:44
First, how rare the sources are.
Second, the actual value being provided.
The value and rarity compound to create some truly breathtaking profits.
Specialized consultants are paid millions of dollars to solve problems worth 10s of millions to clients.
The client pays for all the experience and expertise the expert has and avoids the cost of errors, time and money.
14:04
In short, they skip the bad stuff and go straight to the good stuff more quickly and for less money than it will cost to figure it out on their own.
A beautiful economic exchange.
I personally experienced this for the first time when I had two different people offer me $50,000 for a day of my time after speaking at an event.
14:20
They were scaling an education business in a niche not too dissimilar from my own and could not get past the $1,000,000 per month mark as someone who was doing 1,000,000 per week in the same business type at the time.
I was a very specific type of person with the keys to their problem.
So what happened you ask?
14:36
Drumroll.
I didn't accept the offers.
Why?
Because I was making more than 50,000 a day in profit in my business and didn't want the distraction.
Author note It was years later that I started acquisition.com to help these very people, but instead of charging a day rate, I simply became an equity holder in the company to completely align interest for short and long term, and so I could see the implementations through.
14:56
And as my time is limited by the laws of physics for everyone else below the three to $10 million per year mark, I make all these materials for free.
After the event concluded and I was speaking with Leila, I realized how I had somehow become one of those people I'd always wondered about.
It was very surreal for me.
I finally understood how premium prices were truly made.
15:14
Simple supply and demand.
There's little that substitutes for incredible demand.
You can try and fake it, but there's a special type of 0 Fox given vibe that's hard to replicate when you truly don't need a person's money or even want it.
That's how these guys can charge so much because they don't need it.
The person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand.
15:32
I always try to remember that it's one of the negotiating and pricing principles that has best served me in my life.
But Alex, how are you going to show me how to use scarcity to increase the amount of people who want to buy my offer when currently no one does?
Great question.
Let's attack some real world in the trenches.
Strategies to reliably create scarcity, creating scarcity.
15:50
When there's a fixed supply or quantity of products or services that are available for purchase, it creates scarcity or a fear of missing out.
It increases the need to take action and by extension purchase your offer.
This is where you publicly share that you were only giving away X amount of products or can only take Y new clients.
16:06
For example, if a musician drops unlimited edition hoodie and says he only made 100 and they will never be made again, are you more or less likely to buy it than one that is always available?
More likely?
Naturally, the idea that you can never get it again makes it more desirable.
This is an example of scarcity.
16:22
It is the fear of missing out on something.
It pulls on our psychological fear of loss and gets us to take action.
Humans are far more motivated to take action to hoard a scarce resource than they are to act on something that could help them.
Fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain.
We will wield the psychological lever to get your clients to buy in a frenzy all at once until you are sold out.
16:42
Three types of scarcity 1.
Limited supply of seats or slots in general or over X period of time. 2 Limited supply of bonuses 3 Never available again But how do you use this properly without being phony?
I'll try and give you some real world examples.
16:58
Physical products having limited releases is a tried and true method of using psychological bias to your advantage.
You can have limited releases for flavors, colors, designs, sizes, etcetera.
This month we're releasing 100 boxes of mint chocolate cookie flavored protein bars.
Important point to properly utilize this method, you should always sell out.
17:17
Here's why.
It's better to sell out consistently than over order and fail at creating that scarcity.
This method stacks ineffectiveness if it is done repeatedly over time, just not too often.
Once a month seems to be the sweet spot for most of the companies that I know who do this with regularity.
17:33
Second important note, when using this tactic, you must also let everyone know that you are sold out.
That is part of what makes it work so well.
This way, even people who are on the fence when they see that it was sold out gives them social proof that other people thought it was worth it.
And now that the choice has been made for them, they desire it more because there's no way they can get it.
17:53
So the next time you make the offer, they will be far more likely to take you up on it.
Fun fact, Chanel, a brand that has maintained insane margins and pricing for over a century, is a master of scarcity.
They send only one to two of each piece to each store.
So every store has a different selection, and every item is the last or second or last item in stock.
18:12
This allows them to price far above market and turn buying impulses into purchases.
Services With services, especially if you want to consistently get customers, it can be a little trickier to use scarcity, but I will show a few very simple ways to employ scarcity ethically to increase your take rate on offers.
18:29
These all have similar elements with very slight tweaks.
I'm enumerating these because one of these might mentally fit your business model more than others #1 total business cap only accepting ex clients, Only accepting ex clients at this level of service ongoing.
18:46
This puts a cap on how many clients you service, but also keeps them in.
You create a waiting list for new prospects.
The moment your door opens they jump right in and price resistance disappears.
Periodically you can increase capacity by 10 to 20% then cap it again.
This works well for your highest tiers or service levels.
19:04
A This is like saying my agency only will service 25 customers total, period.
Over time, you can increase your prices and squeeze the lower performing accounts out and bring in new, more profitable accounts.
Or you can periodically open up slots as your capacity allows, always leaving some demand unmet 2 growth rate cap only.
19:24
Accepting X clients per week.
Ongoing, we only accept 5 new clients per week.
We already have the first three spots taken.
I have six more calls this week, so you can either take the spot or one of my next calls can and you can wait until we reopen.
I have used this method since the beginning of my business.
19:40
I always knew what my capacity per week was and simply chose to let our prospects know how many openings we had left.
This banks on the fact that you can only handle a certain amount of new customers anyways on a regular basis, so you might as well let them know 3 cohort cap only accepting ex clients per class or cohort.
19:58
Similar to the above except done on whatever cadence you desire.
Only accepting ex clients amounts per class or per cohort over a given period is another way of thinking about it.
Imagine you only start clients monthly or quarterly.
This helps you get some cadences in place in your business operationally while also lying your sales team some legitimate scarcity.
20:16
Example, we take on 100 clients 4 * a year.
We open the doors then close them, etcetera.
Pro tip provide limited access for higher ticket services.
These scarcity tactics work especially well for higher ticket upsells.
If you want to create oneoff workshops, trainings, events, seminars, consulting, etcetera, these are the things that by their nature take time and provide more access.
20:38
Pairing them with the clear scarcity or fixed amounts, seats or spots will rapidly drive up demand.
But always remember, have less spots available than you think you can sell so that when you want to do it again in the future, everyone will remember you sold out fast.
This is a compounding strategy that increases in effectiveness over time, one of the few in the marketing arsenal.
20:57
Let me give you a real world example of scarcity to enhance the value of a free lead magnet.
If I were to tell you right now that I have a checklist that you can download for free that has all these materials for you in this book in bulleted format, you might be inclined to put this book down and go there to download it now.
21:13
But if I told you I have it set so that every week the page only allows 20 new people to download it, you'd be far more likely to go and see if you can grab it.
And even more so if when you try you see that it has already run out for the week result, you join a list that notifies you the next time 20 or more checklists become available for download.
21:32
What happens next?
When you get that notification, you'll hit the link on your phone and you'll go to the page because you don't want to miss out again, By employing scarcity, we make what would otherwise be a neat free download into a desirable thing that not everyone has access to.
You also, by extension, would be far more likely to consume it when you do get your hands on it.
21:49
All because of how we control supply.
Cool, right?
Honest.
Scarcity.
The most ethical scarcity, The easiest scarcity strategy is honesty.
Wait, what?
Let me explain.
I'm sure right now you probably couldn't handle 1000 clients tomorrow, right?
22:05
But how many could you handle 5/10/25?
Well, you might as well define a number that you're willing to take on in a given period of time and then advertise it.
Simply letting people know that you are 3/4 the way to capacity this week will move people over the edge to buying from you, or letting people know that you're 81% of capacity and your total business will make more people likely to sign up with you quote before they lose the chance.
22:27
Scarcity also implies within it social proof.
If you are 81% of capacity, then a decent amount of people made the decision to work with you, and the closer you get to your arbitrary fullness, the fast the spots will disappear.
But only you get to draw where that line is.
Quote full neat, right summary points.
22:44
Employ one or multiple methods of scarcity in your business.
You will drive a faster purchasing decision from your prospects and at higher prices.
Just let them know your limits and let psychology do the rest.
Now that we've covered some of my favorite scarcity tactics that you can use right around, what else do you do to increase demand without changing anything about your offer?
23:03
Increase urgency.
We will cover that.
Next pro tip, extreme scarcity.
If you don't hate money, sell a very limited supply of one-on-one access.
You can do that via any of the mediums described in the delivery queue.
Direct message access, e-mail access, phone access, voice memo access, Zoom access, etcetera.
23:23
There are lots of ways you can do this, but I promise you this.
If you want to immediately make a lot of money, create a very exclusive service level based on access to you that you cap at a tiny number, Price it very high, then tell people you will make more money than you thought possible.
These also tend to be some of the best clients and limit your delivery to something that you don't hate.
23:44
For me, I hate emails and messages but don't mind zoom calls.
Make it work for your working style.
The cream of the crop, the 1% of the 1% will adjust and take action.
Pro Tip Once you're out, you can never come back.
You can create scarcity by also capping your service level and saying that if they leave they can never return.
24:02
This type of scarcity makes people think extra hard about leaving.
I started doing this with my gyms early on, then I was in a mastermind that employed this.
Then I started using it in my highest level at Gym Lords.
This works best with small groups like the above example.
As groups become much bigger, the tactic loses some of its teeth.
24:17
Speaking from experience.
Chapter 12 Enhancing the Offer Urgency Deadlines Dr. Decisions Scarcity is a function of quantity.
Urgency is a function of time.
24:34
This is where you only limit when people can sign up rather than how many.
Having a defined deadline or cut off or purchase or action to occur creates Urgency.
Frequently Scarcity and Urgency are used together, but I will separate them out for you to illustrate the concepts.
24:52
I'm going to show you four of my favorite ways of using urgency on a consistent basis.
Ethically, 1 rolling cohorts, 2 rolling seasonal urgency and three, promotional or pricing urgency for exploding opportunity.
They will employ urgency in your business without being phony.
25:10
My favorite way of doing this is having cohorts of clients start on a regular cadence.
This has the added operational benefit of helping you create a choreographed onboarding experience for new clients.
As you scale, this will become increasingly important #1 cohort based rolling urgency.
25:27
For example, if you start clients every week, even in unlimited amounts, you can say if you Sign up today, I can get you in with our next group that kicks off on Monday.
Otherwise, you'll have to wait until our next kickoff date.
If you wanted to juice it up a little bit, you could say I actually had a client who signed up a few weeks ago drop out.
25:43
So I have an opening for our next cohort that kicks off on Monday.
If you're pretty sure you're going to do this sooner or later, might as well get on it now so you can start reaping the benefits sooner.
Other than paying the same and waiting, those two tweaks above have pushed so many sales over the edge by just reminding a potential customer that if they sign up they will be starting on Monday, and if they do not, they will have to wait a week.
26:00
It's small things like this that nudge people to take the action that they know they should already take anyways.
Obviously the less frequently you kick off new customers, the more powerful this is.
For example, if you only start clients 2 * a year, people will be very inclined to sign up, especially as the date approaches.
26:18
Even starting new clients every other week can confer this urgency nudge.
What if I lose sales by turning business away?
Just like guarantees, there's always a fear that you will make less money by employing the strategy.
We are afraid that we will lose sales that we would otherwise have made.
Every experience marketer on the planet will tell you it is a fear and it is unfounded.
26:37
The biggest sales on a weeklong campaign or launch happen in the last four hours of the last day, up to 50 to 60%.
That means that the last 3% of the time allotted creates 50 to 60% of the sales.
That's completely illogical, but also unmistakably human.
So just like a guarantee, you will make more money from the many people who decided to take action than people who already missed out, because in reality, those people were never going to buy.
27:01
Heck, they didn't even buy when they had their feet to the fire, so why would they buy now?
Good to remember what to do.
If you just started a cohort and someone wants to buy, you have two options.
One, you can offer them a speedy personalized onboarding to get them up to speed as a bonus for signing up today and still get them in or my preference.
27:19
You can explain to them that since the next group starts in a little, they will have the advantage of having more time to review the materials, talk to their employees for a B to B product for example, or families for B to C product.
On top of that, they can have a more extended payment plan that you can only make available to them since the start date is so far out an advantage that most clients do not get in the end.
27:41
Remember, you always have the advantage because you are the one who calls the shots 2.
Rolling Seasonal Urgency.
In a digital setting, having actual signup date countdown is very useful, but make sure they are real.
If they aren't, you'll lose credibility and just look like every other wannabe marketer.
27:59
This is very common with Internet businesses that use launch models.
I personally love having the dates that I'm running a promotion throughout my landing pages and in my copy.
I want it to be visible everywhere.
The nice thing is that you can always fire up another ad campaign and a new landing page with new dates and be right as rain.
28:15
You will see your conversions go up through the roof and it takes maybe 5 minutes of editing.
Well worth the time investment.
Example, our New Year promotion ends January 30th next month.
Our Valentine's Day Lover promotion ends February 30th next month.
Our Sexy by Spring special ends March 31st next month.
28:34
Our Fools in Love April promo ends April 30th.
The actual promotion may be the same, but naming it something different by season gives you the real differentiator That gives you a start and a finish.
Headlines drive decisions by simply having these.
You can point to them and let human beings push themselves over the edge so as not to miss out.
28:54
Pro tip for local businesses This is my #1 strategy for local businesses, they must vary their marketing more frequently than national advertisers.
Putting a new wrapper with a date on the same core service gives you urgency and novelty that will consistently outperform the same old campaigns. 3 Pricing or bonus based urgency.
29:13
This is another way of creating urgency using your actual offer or promotion Slash pricing structure as the thing they could miss out on.
Kind of brilliant.
It allows businesses that sell clients year round to still use urgency.
For example, Yes, let's get you started today so you can take advantage of the discount you came in for.
29:30
I'm not sure how long we'll be running it as we change them every four weeks or so, and this is one of the better ones we've run in a while.
This creates some fear of missing out on the promotion or discount or bonuses rather than your actual service.
It would be a lot to say that if you own a roofing business, you won't service them if they buy after the date.
29:46
But if you talk specifically about the promotion, you can often elicit the same urgency on buying the prospect while maintaining your integrity.
Win, win.
You can interchange a pricing promotion discount or added bonuses like free install or free onboarding or an extra workshop valued at $1000 if they buy now.
30:04
These are all things you can swap around your core offer to create urgency.
Pro tip clean your pipeline with every price change.
If you ever really are planning on raising your prices, hopefully soon.
If you're reading this book right now, then you can always clean out your pipeline by letting people know the price is going up.
30:21
So get in now.
Never raise your prices without letting people know.
It shows a position of strength and will give you a nice little influx of cash from the people in the pipeline who are on the fence. 4 Exploding Opportunity On occasion you will be exposing the prospect to an arbitrage opportunity.
30:39
The opportunity itself has a ticking time clock, as all great opportunities do.
Every second someone delays, they miss out on disproportionate gains.
Example, if I were explaining an arbitrage opportunity between buying products on eBay and selling them on Amazon, this market efficiency would correct itself over time.
30:57
The sooner someone acts, the better it will be for them.
This could be true for selling someone on the opportunity of trading cryptocurrencies, buying a stock, getting into a new platform to advertise before competitors jump on the bandwagon, or anything else like that.
Highly competitive job environments often get job offers that are exploding offers.
31:14
Every day.
They wait to take the job, their pay or bonuses decrease.
This forces prospects to make fast decisions rather than try and wait it out to see if they get a better offer.
All of these examples show opportunities that decay with time, so if you find yourself in front of an opportunity like this, make sure to emphasize it.
31:32
Summary Points Adding a deadline and incorporating one or multiple forms of urgency will get more people to take action than otherwise.
I have employed all four of these methods with great effectiveness.
I suggest you do the same.

0:01
Hey guys, welcome to $100 Million Offers, the audio book special edition with the game podcast today we're going over 2 chapters, bonuses and guarantees.
Bonuses are the thing that you give on top of the thing you're already selling to get more people to want to buy it at the same price.
And this is the best thing to do that I've ever had.
0:18
When someone says, hey, can I have a discount?
Instead of offering a discount, add more value.
And that's where bonuses come in.
Guarantees are the single greatest way to overcome the number one obstacle.
In sales, which is risk.
And so if you have an intelligently structured original guarantee, you can unbelievably increase your sales.
0:35
It's staggering when you do it right, and I know for many of you this these next two chapters may be the ones that.
Really take you over the edge and really.
Change things for you.
So I hope you enjoy Chapter 13.
Enhancing the offer bonuses.
0:51
It's all gravy, baby.
Play on an old English thing.
I have to give special thanks to Jason Flatland for my renewed appreciation for bonuses.
They are so powerful that they earned an entire chapter.
In this chapter, I'm going to cover what to offer, how to pick them, how to value them, how to present them, and how to price them.
1:10
The main point I want you to take away from this is that a single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses, aka the entirety of the offer we came up with at the end of the last section.
This section is about how to present those pieces in what order.
1:26
For example, I may in fact do lots of things with my service, but until I enumerate them, they are unknown.
This is why every infomercial of all time continues with But wait, there's more.
They would not use these techniques unless they were effective, as every second of airtime cost money and must be justified with ROI.
1:43
You'll also notice that if you watch those old infomercials, they would sell one knife for $38.95 and then include 37 other knives, sharpeners, pans and guarantees to beat the prospect into submission.
They establish the price.
And then they expand upon it until you feel like it's such a good deal it would be stupid to pass it up.
2:00
The reason this works is that we are increasing the prospects price to value discrepancy by increasing the value delivered.
Instead of cutting the price, we anchor the price we tell them to the core offer.
Then, with each increasingly valuable bonus, that discrepancy grows wider and wider until it's too big to bear and we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their wallet in their pocket.
2:21
We are now going to present that stack of deliverables that we assembled earlier in a way that makes them irresistible.
Pro tip.
Add bonuses instead of discounting whenever possible on core offers whenever trying to close the deal.
Never discount the main offer.
It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable, which is terrible.
2:39
Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices.
It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness.
Presenting bonuses 101 versus group selling.
There are key differences between pitching to a group versus a single person.
Group selling is beyond the scope of this book, but I want to at least address when a bonus would be brought up in a 101 selling scenario.
3:00
When selling 101, you ask for the sale first before offering the bonuses.
If they say yes, then after they have signed up you let them know the additional bonuses they're going to get.
This creates a Wow experience and reinforces their decision to buy.
On the other hand, if the person does not buy after the first ask.
3:17
Then you present a bonus that matches their perceived obstacle, Then ask again.
Don't feel weird about asking again.
You simply agree with the prospect, add the bonus, and then ask.
If this consolation was fair enough, people have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to accommodate, then another, then another, and people feel almost obligated to buy from you.
3:36
If you recall from our Trim and Stack chapter, each of those deliverables is now being weaponized and presented at the perfect time.
We're going to provide all these bonuses to them anyways.
It increases the perception of our offers value by laying these bonuses one at a time.
Bonus bullets.
That being said, there are a few key things to remember when offering bonuses.
3:54
One, always offer them you can use the bulleted bundle we came up with at the end of section 32.
Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title. 3 Tell them a how it relates to their issue, B what it is, C how I discovered it, what you had to do to create it, D how it will specifically improve their lives.
4:14
Four make their experience faster, easier, or less effort and sacrifice just looking at the value equation. 4.
Provide some proof This can be a stat, a past client, or personal experience to prove that this thing is valuable. 5.
Paint a vivid mental image of what their life will be like, assuming they have already used it and are experiencing the benefits. 6.
4:37
Always describe a price tag to them and justify it.
Seven tools and checklists are better than additional trainings.
As the effort and time are lower with the former, so the value is higher, the value equation still reigns supreme.
Eight.
They should each address a specific concern or obstacle in the prospects mind about why they can't or won't be successful.
4:56
The bonus should prove their belief incorrect. 9 This can also be what they would logically realize they would need next.
You want to solve their next problem before they even encounter it. 10 The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer.
5:13
Psychologically, as you continue to add offers, it continues to expand the price to value discrepancy.
It also subconsciously communicates that the core offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than bonuses, right?
No, But you can use the psychological bias to make your offer seem wildly compelling. 11 You can further enhance the value of your bonuses by adding Scarcity and Urgency to the bonuses themselves, which takes this technique and puts it on steroids A bonuses with scarcity.
5:43
Version one only people who signed up for my XYZ program will have access to my bonus 123 that are never for sale or available anywhere else other than through this program.
Version two, I have three tickets left to my $5000 virtual event.
If you buy this program, you can get one of those last three tickets as a bonus B bonuses with urgency.
6:02
Version one if you buy today, I will add in XYZ bonus that normally costs $1000 for free, and I'll do that because I want to reward action takers C.
I hope you can see the subtle differences.
The 1st 2 examples aren't constrained by time.
They state that if you buy the program you will get the things you normally would not be able to.
6:21
The bonus with urgency is about them buying today and if they do not buy today they will lose the bonuses.
Minor difference, but worth noting.
Advanced level bonuses, other people's products and services.
You can get other businesses to give you their services and products as a part of your bonuses in exchange for exposure to your clients for free.
6:39
This is free marketing for them.
And high value products for you at no cost.
Businesses will do this because you're going to give their business exposure for free to the highest quality prospects.
Your customers.
As long as they're not direct competitors, you can get some brownie points, secure some future referral I/O U's and make your offer more valuable.
6:58
At the same time, if you secure enough of these relationships, you can literally justify your entire price in the savings and additional true to price bonuses.
For example, if I owned a pain clinic.
I might get a massage therapist to give me one to two free massages to incorporate into my offer.
7:14
On top of that I might get one.
A chiropractor to give me two free adjustments valued at $100.
A low inflammation food company to give me discounts for their products. $50 savings.
Discounts for braces and orthotics $150.00 of savings.
A local health club down the street to give me personal training session for free and a free month membership to their pool, $100 Value.
7:34
Discounts on all pharmaceutical drugs from the local pharmacist $100 per month in savings.
Repeat the above for multiple service providers.
So perhaps I get 10 chiropractors to give me a free adjustment.
Now I have 10 adjustments in my bundle, etcetera.
Now if my offer were $400.00, then the value of these free bonuses alone is worth more than the $400.00.
7:52
As if that weren't already awesome enough, if you really want to be a Jedi, negotiate a group discount and a Commission for yourself.
This is exactly what we did with our supplement company, our gym owner clients who use our sister company Prestige Labs.
Sponsored athletes get 30% discount on all our products and on top of that, the sponsored athlete gets 40% of all sales netted after the applied discount.
8:13
So it's a win win for everyone.
Their clients get it for 30% less than our main site, they get paid for giving way exclusive discounts and we get customers in exchange for a Commission paid.
Everyone wins.
If you're following along.
Each of these bonuses can become revenue streams for you indirectly by getting clients to say yes more easily and directly, because you can negotiate that each of these businesses can pay you for the people you send their way.
8:34
So let's say we negotiated the following affiliate Commission for making an introduction to these businesses.
The chiropractor gives you $100 per person who comes into their office.
The food company gives you free food.
Orthotics company gives you $100 per person referred.
The health club gives you a free membership or $50.00 per month.
8:50
Who signs up?
Pharmacy gives you $100 per person.
Now let's look at how much money we made.
Our $400.00 offer now has the possibility to make us an extra $350.00 of pure profit.
That's the beauty of these relationships.
The other businesses will pay you.
And you don't have to do anything but refer customers to them that you already have spent the money to acquire.
9:09
And if you really want to get crazy, come up with a Grand Slam offer with these partners Businesses by using the same concepts in this book so that each of the bonuses themselves become even more valuable than a simple commoditized service free gift #8 bonus on bonuses.
There are 1,000,000 and one ways to use bonuses in your offers.
9:26
You can get people to act faster.
You can price anchor and product anchor.
Little known, you can get more people to say yes than you otherwise would.
And if you want a live deep dive with me, you can go to acquisition.com/training/offers and select Bonus Creation to watch a short video tutorial.
I also have a free bonus checklist that I use when creating offers so you can swipe it and use it for your business. on the House summary.
9:48
We want to employ bonuses because they expand the price to value discrepancy and get people to purchase who otherwise wouldn't.
They massively increase the prospects perception of the value of our offer.
So here's what to do 1.
Create checklists, tools, swipe files, scripts, templates, and anything else that would take lots of time and effort to create on one's own, but it's easy to use.
10:08
Once created, anything that you can invest in one time that clearly costs time or money to create but can be given away endless time is a perfect fit for bonuses. 2.
Beyond that, make a habit to record every workshop, every webinar, every event, every interview, and use them as additional bonuses as needed to crush a perceived obstacle. 3 Proactively negotiate group discounts and a referral Commission with adjacent businesses that solve needs your customer will have as a result of beginning this process with you.
10:35
What's the next natural thing they might want?
Go to those businesses?
Get a deal for them they could never get for themselves because you were negotiating with the purchasing power of all your customers at once.
Very powerful, author note The longer you are in business, the more of these bonus assets you will have at your disposal.
10:51
All of these things are valuable.
Put them in a vault and keep them in your back pocket to sprinkle into an offer to get the deal closed.
Information products work very well here because they have high perceived value, low cost and 0 operational effort.
Besides an additional login, tickets to virtual experience or events work too.
11:07
Same goes for a higher level of service that has a fixed cost like giving someone a VIP service for a month, which also by the way double s as a way of up selling them into that level of service to keep them on it.
More on that in book 2.
Which should be a bonus versus part of the core offer, if I'm the one fulfilling it.
11:23
Short answer?
Wow factor.
In other words, something you wouldn't want someone to miss.
Many times you have so much cool stuff they'll be providing your customers, which is a good thing.
That valuable Nuggets can get lost in the mix.
You want to take the most distinct ones that can almost stand on their own and pull those out to highlight them.
11:39
This is especially true for things that are short in length, but high in quality or value.
Checklists or infographics can condense a lot of information into a small space.
Someone might not feel justified paying lots of money for a product launch map for example, but as a bonus will be perceived as very valuable.
11:54
Next up we have our core offer.
We are presenting it in a way to increase care scene urgency, to increase the likelihood that they want it even more.
We stack the bonuses of our offer to make the price to value discrepancy out of this world and break our prospects minds.
Next, on our magical journey, we'll be addressing the big elephant in the room, risk.
12:12
We will completely obliterate it using a combination of guarantees so they have no reason not to buy.
Hey, guys.
Real quick, if you've been enjoying the 100. $1,000,000 offers series on the podcast.
If you could share it with a friend or leave a review, either one would mean a lot to me and it would also make you an amazing.
12:31
Human being.
I took a year of my life to put into this, and that was just in the.
Actual writing process.
It took me years to put this information in a in a.
Succinct manner so that people could.
Understand it.
And so it would just mean a lot to me.
That's that's it.
It's.
Just an ask, it would mean a lot to me if you if you shared it.
12:47
So that's all I got.
Enjoy the rest.
Chapter 14 Enhancing the offer guarantees you're going to like the way you look.
I guarantee it.
Men's Wearhouse ad that ran forever.
Guarantees worth their weight in gold.
13:03
Single greatest objection for any product or service being sold is drumroll risk.
Risk that it doesn't do what it's supposed to do for them, therefore.
Reversing risk is an immediate way to make any offer more attractive.
You will want to spend a disproportionate amount of time figuring out how you want to reverse it.
13:21
That being said, how much more attractive can a guarantee make an offer?
Jason Flatland, who I referenced earlier, once stated that he had seen the conversion on an offer two to four X simply by changing the quality of the guarantee.
It's that important from an overarching perspective.
There are four types of guarantees, unconditional, conditional, anti guarantee, and implied guarantees.
13:41
You must always hit your guarantee hard, even if you don't have one.
Say it boldly and give the reason why.
But won't people take advantage of a crazy guarantee?
Sometimes, but not usually?
That being said, you must understand the math.
If you close 130% as many people and your refund percentage double s from 5% to 10%, you've still made 1.23 X the money or 23% more and that all goes to the bottom line.
14:05
Example 100 sales with five refunds which is 5% = 95 net sales.
The guarantee offer might get 130 sales, 13 refunds which would be 10% and net 117 sales.
So 117 / 95 is 1.23 X or a 23% increase.
14:26
Don't be emotional, just do the math.
For a guarantee to not be worth it, the increase in sales would have to be 100% offset by people who refund.
So an absolute increase in sales of 5% would need to be offset by an absolute increase in refunds of 5%.
That would be a doubling of refunds, which is unlikely.
14:42
So for the most part, the stronger the guarantee, the higher the net increase in total purchases, even if the refund rate increases alongside it.
Warning While guarantees can be effective sellers, people who buy because of guarantees can become very shitty customers.
A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may not be willing to put in the work necessary to see success with your product or service in a world where you want to reverse risk and get customers the best outcome.
15:08
Tying your guarantee to the things they need to do to be successful can help all parties pro tip high cost services.
Warning if you have a tremendous amount of costs associated with your product or service, you will likely want to employ a conditional guarantee or anti guarantee as you'll have to eat the cost of the refund and the cost of fulfilling types of guarantees.
15:28
If you don't achieve X in Y time, we will.
What makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement.
If you do not get X results in Y period of time, we will Z to give a guaranteed teeth.
You have to decide what you'll do if they don't get the result without the OR what portion of the guarantee.
15:47
It sounds weak and diluted.
Note this is what most marketers do.
Bad example, we will get you 20 clients guaranteed.
Better example, you will get 20 clients in your first 30 days or we will give your money back plus your advertising dollars you spent with us.
This is a simple but strong guarantee.
Here are the four types of guarantees.
16:04
I'll go over them in theory and we'll apply them.
One.
Unconditional guarantees.
As I stated earlier, there are unconditional, conditional and anti guarantees.
Unconditional are the strongest guarantees.
They're basically a trial where they pay 1st and see if they like it.
This gets a lot more people to buy, but you will have some people refund, especially as consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and 0.
16:26
Accountability. 2 Conditional guarantees.
Conditional guarantees include terms and conditions to the guarantee.
These are the ones that you can get very creative on.
In general, you want these to be, quote, better than money back guarantees because if they're going to make an investment, you want to match their investment psychologically with an equal or higher perceived commitment.
16:46
These also can have a very powerful effect on getting clients.
If you know the key action someone must take in order to be successful, make those part of the conditional guarantee.
In a perfect world, 100% of your customers would qualify for a conditional guarantee, but we'll have achieved their result and therefore would not want to take it.
17:04
That is an ideal we can all aspire towards.
And just FYI, if given the option of getting a refund or getting the outcome they were promised, the vast majority of people will take the outcome.
That's why they bought it in the 1st place.
Three anti guarantees.
Anti guarantees are when you explicitly state all sales are final, you will want to own this position.
17:24
You must come up with a creative quote reason why the sales are final.
Typically you want to show a massive exposure or vulnerability on your part that a consumer could immediately understand and think yes, that makes sense.
These types of guarantees are especially important with items that are consumable or massively diminishing value once given 4 implied guarantees.
17:43
Implied guarantees are any offer that is a performance based offer.
This comes in many different forms.
Would have share, profit, share triggers, ratchets, monetary bonuses, etcetera are all examples.
The end all concept is the same.
If I don't perform I don't get paid.
Unique to this particular structure is it also confers the upside of if I do a great job I will be very well compensated.
18:06
These only work in situations where you have transparency for measuring the outcome and trust or control that you will get compensated when you perform stacking guarantees.
An experienced salesman understands that like bonuses, you can actually stack guarantees, for example.
You could give an unconditional 30 day, no questions asked guarantee.
18:24
Then on top of that give a conditional triple your money back 90 day guarantee.
That would be an example of stacking unconditional with a conditional guarantee.
You can also stack 2 conditional guarantees around different or sequential outcomes.
For example, you'll make $10,000 by 60 days, $30,000 by 90 days as long as you do thing 1-2 and three.
18:43
This future paces the prospect into an outcome they now believe is far more likely, since you will be deliberately spelling it out in a conditional guarantee with a timeline for achievement.
Doing this shows the prospect you were serious about getting the results and convinced they will achieve what they want.
This shifts the burden of risk back from them onto us, a very powerful strategy.
19:00
Let's go through some different guarantee examples.
These are some of my favorites.
Guarantee If you don't achieve X&Y time, we will insert offer unconditional, no questions asked.
Guarantee what the client gets a a full refund.
B 50% refund.
19:15
C refund of ad spend or any ancillary cost.
D You Pay for competitors program.
You return their money plus any additional money on top of it, like an extra $1000.
My take?
This is about as simple as it gets.
It's also very risky.
You put yourself in a situation where someone does not achieve the results, whether because of your fault or not.
19:33
You will still be held accountable.
Obviously this is a strong but unoriginal guarantee.
You can add conditions, but the more conditions you add, the faster this guarantee loses teeth.
Wording.
I heard Jason Flatlin, who I referenced earlier, pitches unconditional guarantee on a webinar and I thought it was unbelievable.
These are 100% his words and not my own.
19:50
I take no credit for this, but have included it for completeness.
I'm not asking you to decide yes or no today, I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision.
That is all.
The only way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside.
So you get on the inside and see if everything we say on this webinar is true and valuable to you then.
20:09
If it is, that's when you decide to keep it.
If it's not for you, no hard feelings.
You will then, after signing up at XYZ URL, be able to make a fully informed decision that this isn't for you.
You can't make decision right now for the same reason you don't buy a house without first looking at the inside of it.
And know this whether it's 29 minutes or 29 days from now.
20:27
If you ain't happy, I ain't happy for any reason whatsoever.
If you want your money back, you can get it because I don't want to keep your money.
If you're happy, all you have to do is go to support@xyz.com and tell us give me your money and you got it.
And in short order, our response times to any support request average 61 minutes over a 24/7 time period.
20:46
You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident that what you have is the real deal.
And I'm fairly confident when you sign up at URL, you're going to get exactly what you need to benefit.
Right in surgery Malcolm.
Pretty crazy.
Guarantee.
Pro tip.
Name your guarantee something cool.
If you're going to give a guarantee, spice it up.
21:03
Instead of using satisfaction or some other vanilla word.
Describe it more strongly.
Generic.
Example bad. 30 day money.
Back.
Satisfaction guarantee.
Creative Imagery Example One good in 30 days if you wouldn't jump into shark infested waters to get our product back, we will return every dollar you pay.
21:19
Creative Imagery Example #2 Great.
You'll get our infamous Club of Baby Seal guarantee after 30 days of using our services.
If you wouldn't club a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don't have to pay a penny.
Unconditional Satisfaction based Refund guarantee expanded on from above what the client gets.
21:35
If at any time they're not satisfied with the level of service they're receiving from you, they can request a refund at any time for the program.
My take?
Believe it or not, this was my guarantee when I sold weight loss programs.
Beside being an irresistible offer, I guaranteed satisfaction.
I use the strength of my guarantee to close a lot of deals.
Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did?
21:54
Now, I'm not guaranteeing you're going to hit this goal in six weeks, after all, because I can't eat the food for you.
But I am guaranteeing that you will get $500.00 with the value and the service from us to support you.
If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I'll write you a check the day you tell me we suck.
It works perfectly with the best case, worst case, close.
22:13
Best case, you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your money towards staying with us to hit your long term goal.
Worst case, you tell me I suck.
I write you a check and you get 6 weeks of free training.
Both options are risk free, but the only thing guaranteed not to help you is walking out of here today.
If you're good at what you do, you can use a guarantee like this to push a lot of people over the edge.
22:33
That line that I just said made me a lot of money.
I had two people take me up on that refund out of 4000 sales in 3 1/2 years.
It's worth it.
Satisfaction slash no questions asked is the highest form of guarantee.
It means we could do everything right and you could still ask for your money back as long as you know the math.
22:50
You will typically make up for the refunds in spades with higher and faster closing on the sale side.
But you have to be good at fulfilling on your promises.
If not, steer clear.
I believe this offer works much better in lower ticket situations.
It becomes very risky as you go into higher ticket services with higher cost of fulfillment.
23:07
Pro tip unconditional versus conditional based on business type.
Bigger, broader guarantees work better with lower ticket B to C businesses.
Many people just won't bother taking the time.
The higher the ticket the more business oriented is, the more you will want to steer towards specific guarantees that may or may not include refunds and may or may not have conditions.
23:28
Conditional outsized refund guarantee, what the client gets double or triple their money back or a no strings attached payment of XXX or another amount that's far more than what they paid.
My take this is for when you sell something with high margins and this is a guarantee to add with a consumption condition that means that they must do a variety of things to qualify for this guarantee.
23:50
Jason Flatley, who I mentioned earlier, did 27,000,000 in a day, recently used an amazing guarantee for a course you sold.
He said if you buy this course and spend excellent advertising in your ecommerce store using the methods you're in and don't make money, I will buy your store from you for $25,000, no questions asked.
He claimed that an additional $3,000,000 in sales came from this crazy guarantee on a 2997 course.
24:11
What's more, he only gave ten of those $25,000 refunds out, so the refund generated 2.75 million in extra sales.
That's what a crazy guarantee does for you.
In general, a very strong guarantee like this will definitely drive more sales.
24:27
This really serves the purpose when you need a lot of stuff to be done by your prospect and assuming those things are done, there's a low chance of the result not being achieved.
Sometimes a guarantee like this can actually get clients better results on top.
This guarantee will typically outperform a traditional 30 day money back guarantee in terms of net conversions.
24:43
Sales minus refunds, conditional service guarantee, what the client gets you.
Keep working for them free of charge until X is achieved.
My take?
This is probably my personal favorite guarantee of all time.
It essentially guarantees that they will achieve their goal, but it eliminates the element of time you are never at risk for losing the money.
25:02
The guarantee is around the outcome.
To add further flavor to it, you can make this guarantee conditional on them doing key actions linked with the success, setting up a web page, attending calls, showing up to workouts, weighing in reporting data, etcetera.
Real talk.
Since I've been advising businesses to use this particular guarantee, I have yet to have a single person, say a client, took them up on it.
25:24
Realistically, if someone actually does everything, you ask them to do it and doesn't achieve the result by the time you said, one of two things usually happens.
One, senior clients commitment.
You happily keep working with them until they achieve the desired result 2 it gets dropped.
Your client is very likely close to the goal, which means they're satisfied.
25:41
Also, it's likely the sales conversation with the guarantee was months earlier.
What may have been important in the sales conversation is a distant memory, now replaced by their affection towards you and your business.
Conditional modified service guarantee what the client gets you?
Give them another why?
Long period of service or access to your product or services free of charge.
25:59
Generally, why should give them at least twice the duration?
My take this is like the service guarantee, but it ties a specific duration to your extended work or involvement.
So instead of being on the hook forever, you're only on the hook for the additional why period of time.
I've seen it work magically and keep the business on the hook for a finite period of time, which may be an easier place for you to start before doing an all out service guarantee like the above conditional credit based guarantee what the client gets you give them back what they paid, but in a credit towards any service you offer might take.
26:32
This is best used during an upsell process to seal the deal on a service they are unsure they will like.
They already like what they have and you're trying to sell them on more of that.
Worst case, they can apply to the thing they already like so it maintains goodwill with the customer.
Conditional personal service guarantee what the client gets you personally.
26:48
Work with them one-on-one free of charge until they reach X objective or result.
My take this is absolutely one of the strongest guarantees in existence.
It's like a service guarantee on crack.
You will definitely want to add conditions to this.
For example, they must respond back in 24 hours.
They must use the products you tell them to.
27:04
They must XYZ.
Only if they do that will you keep working with them one-on-one.
This is especially powerful as you scale and become more edified as a business owner.
Can you imagine for a moment if one of my sales people said Alex will personally work with you until your offer converts, right?
It would work.
27:20
It would also be a nightmare.
So I would probably put contingencies like provided you've already spent $10,000 on your existing offer using your offer structure.
The offer you ran is for lead generation and it was a free offer.
These are things that would make it unlikely to not succeed if for some reason they hadn't.
With those stipulations in place, I could probably fix the problem in 10 minutes.
27:37
Just looking at it, conditional hotel plus airfare perks guarantee what the client gets.
If you don't receive value, we will reimburse your product and your hotel and airfare.
My take?
This is technically a refund of ancillary costs from our first example.
I just love it a lot for workshops and in person experiences.
27:55
Normally the event would cost more than the hotel and airfare, so it's like adding an extra $1000 to a guarantee, but way more tangible.
It's original enough that people like it.
Conditional wage payment guarantees what the client gets you.
Offer to pay their hourly rate, whatever that may be, if they don't find your call or session with them valuable.
28:13
My take?
This is also an ancillary cost guarantee, just a very original one.
If someone ever actually asked for the wage payment, just ask them for their tax return and divide it by 1960, AKA the number of working hours at 40 hours a week per year.
But no one asking for a refund will actually do that, so you never actually have to give out one of these refunds, like ever.
28:35
Kind of cool.
Conditional release of service guarantee what the client gets you.
Let them out of their contract free of charge.
My take this voids A commitment or cancellation fee.
If you have a business that has enforceable commitments, contracts or clauses, this can be a powerful guarantee.
Better yet, if you're in a business that does not enforce your contracts, then you have nothing to lose by adding this guarantee.
28:55
Conditional delayed second payment guarantee what the client gets, you won't bill them again until after they make or get their first outcome.
Example, lose your first 5, make your first sale, get to your website live, etcetera.
My take.
I like this a lot, especially if you have a very systematized process for getting the 1st result.
29:13
It gets the prospect thinking in fact action terms and gets them moving.
It will also focus your team on activating your client.
This is a great one when you know what metric or action drives activation, aka a predicting indicator of long term retention of a client.
I've successfully used this guarantee loads of times.
29:30
Conditional first outcome guarantee what the client gets.
You continue to pay their ancillary cost, Aspen, hotel, etcetera until they reach their first outcome.
Example example, if you don't make your first sale in 14 days, we will pay for your Aspen until you do my take.
Just like the delayed second payment, just send it around a different cost.
29:47
I personally like this set up a lot.
It keeps everyone focused on getting that first dollar over the bridge.
Once that one comes across, the second comes soon after.
Anti guarantee all sales are final.
What the client gets access to.
Super exclusive, very valuable service or product.
30:04
Likely This is a very powerful thing that once seen cannot be unseen or once used cannot be taken away.
Example, a line of code to improve your checkout experience on a website.
Once someone received the code they could try and use it without paying you.
Or a series of opening messages for picking up girls or opening sentences for messaging called prospects.
30:22
These are things that are very valuable but incredibly easy to steal after they've been seen or understood.
My take?
This can enhance the persuasiveness of a sale and the value of the product or service.
It essentially implies that the client is going to use it and see an immense benefit, thereby exposing the business to vulnerability.
30:40
It acts as a damaging admission.
We have an all sales or final policy, but that is because our products is so exclusive and so powerful that once it's used it cannot be unused.
Since it is so standard to have some sort of guarantee, not having one is also attention worthy.
30:56
So instead of being wishy washy lean into the fact that this thing works so well and it's so easy to copy, you must make all sales final, They'll believe you even more if you take this position.
We're going to show you our proprietary process that we are using right now to generate leads in our business, our funnels, ads, metrics etcetera.
31:12
We're going to be exposing the inner workings of our business and as a result all sales are final.
Note strong reason why is needed here, just make one up that sounds compelling.
The more you can show real exposure, the more effective this will be.
Anti guarantees can also work very well with high ticket products and services that require a lot of work or customization.
31:30
If you're the type of customer who needs a guarantee before taking a jump, then you're not the type of person we want to work with.
We want motivated self starters who can follow instructions and not looking for a way out before they even begin.
If you're not serious, don't buy it, But if you are, boy are you going to make a killing.
From these examples you should get the idea.
31:48
Implied guarantees Performance models Rev shares and profit sharing performance A only pay me XXX per sale or YYY per show or XX per pound.
Lost Rev share A 10% of top line revenue. 20% profit share 25% of revenue growth from baseline profit share X percent of profit.
32:08
Y percent of gross profit ratchets. 10% if over X, 20% if over Y, 30% of over Z bonuses and triggers.
I get X when Y occurs.
What the client gets if you do not perform, they do not have to pay.
If you perform, your compensation has been determined based on an agreement decided upon before you begin working.
32:28
My take Performance, Rev share and profit share aren't guarantees per se, but for all intents and purposes they are.
This is an implied guarantee whenever you enter a Rev share or performance partnership.
If you don't make money, you don't have to pay me.
In my opinion this is one of, if not the most desirable setups.
32:47
First because it makes you accountable to your clients results.
Second, it weeds out low performers, Perfect alignment between client and service provider fosters collaboration and a long term relationship.
I'm a big fan.
The drawbacks are tracking and collection, so if you can find a way around that, you've hit a gold mine.
33:03
This is a part of the offer.
We teach our agencies to use our software.
We help them switch from retainer model to a performance model and wrap that into a Grand Slam offer.
The 1:00 I walked through earlier.
I've seen countless agencies go from 20K a month to 200K a month in a matter of a few months.
Using this guarantee you can also pair a Rep share or performance set up with a minimum.
33:22
It would be like saying we get the greater of $1000 or 10% of revenue generated.
So if the client doesn't generate money because of whatever reason, this at least covers your cost of services etcetera.
We're saying we get $1000 for the first three months then after that it switches to 100% performance.
This would be the ideal set up if it takes a long time to get going.
33:40
These types of offers work well when you have quantifiable outcomes.
The stronger of course is no payment without performance.
Create your own winning guarantee.
Reversing risk is the number one way to increase conversion of an offer.
Experienced marketers spend as much time crafting their guarantees as the deliverables themselves.
33:56
It's that important.
I have personally used all the guarantees listed above except for the hotel and phone call, one which I just liked and saw.
But you can come up with your own.
The key is to identify a client's biggest fear, pain, and perceived obstacle.
What do they not want to have happen if they pay you?
34:11
What are they most afraid of?
Reverse their fears into a guarantee.
Think of time, emotion, outside costs associated with any program.
The more specific and creative the guarantee is, the better.
That being said, guarantees are enhancers.
They can enhance the magnetism or attraction of any offer but they cannot make a business.
34:29
If a guarantee is used to cover up a poor sales team or poor product it will backfire to lots of refunds.
No bueno.
My advice, start selling service based guarantees or setting up some sort of performance partnerships.
This will make all sales final so you have No Fear from refunds and most importantly it will commit you to your customers results and keep you honest.
34:47
From there.
Either keep that guaranteeing scale, which is perfectly fine, or move up the food chain to less restrictive guarantees to increase volume.
