7:25
From the more compelling side that you can sell and can offer and can fulfill on.
I'm in a way that will get people better results.
So the example that I give for a lot of agencies because a lot of people who are starting out learn at our Facebook ads, it's a basic skill and then they try and sell those Services.
If I were starting over again, I would not try and do that.
7:44
What I would do is I would go find the Avatar that I like locally and say, okay, mister dry cleaner mr.
Chiropractor mr.
Whatever, I will run your ads for free, and I would like to own the entire process.
And so hey, you just cover the advertising, I'll work your leads.
I work the front desk.
8:00
I'll sell the people and which you could even do, is just negotiate a bulk rate.
Hey I got you a thousand customers tomorrow.
What's the lowest you could possibly do it for maybe says $200 for whatever the widget is, right?
You say cool and then you go ahead and sell for 800 and you make 600 on every one of these deals and you pay him as 200 to go fulfill and the rest of its margin, right?
8:18
The beauty is that you would learn every aspect of how to provide value to that Avatar, because I'll tell your story to drive this home.
I had an agency owner who is on our software platform.
And I have, you know, we have one call every month or something that I hop on and I've seen it's the same conversation every month.
8:38
Hey you know my customer side, no one wants to pay me Pablo and I you know, over and over again.
I was like, you're not good.
That's why they're not paying, you, you're not very good, you need to get better, right?
And so I've, every time I was like, dude, stop saying that they tell you that their systems bad.
8:54
You say it's good and they say it's bad.
Why don't you go?
And he was, he was, he was selling to Realtors.
So nice to research this houses and I said, go get your real estate license, go work, the leads that you're getting right now, go sell some houses for a year.
Then when people say that something's not working, you can help them because you've actually done it.
9:13
Everyone, so consumed with trying to sell something to never done that, they're surprised that they're not good at.
It's the business Guru who coaches on how to have a business.
You never had a business in his entire business was coaching on how to businesses, right?
Yeah.
That guy never gets big, you'll make some money.
You'll never get back.
9:29
Big true and Sonja is asking them, how long guarantee results on your relationship markets as dating from give my and how to transfer that same currency to those kind of markets, it's great.
So with those types of markets you just create the guarantee on the experience they want to have.
9:48
All right?
So this is this is what the beauty of being creative.
Is a marketer, a business owner.
I'm not saying the first guarantee is going to hit, but if you interview your customers, you say, describe to me, what you want your marriage to look like.
Don't tell me what you want to have happen.
For some of them might be.
We go and dates again, right?
10:04
We go and days together once a week, that might be what it looks like.
It might be.
We finally sleep together.
Again, after a long time, we haven't haven't been together, it might just be that, like, we wake up in the morning, we don't hate each other or we haven't had an argument in a week, right?
It could be any of those types of outcomes.
Depending on what type of marriages are solution.
10:20
I'm just using marriage is an example, right?
And so, it'll probably have to be around something, a little bit more intangible.
Right now, the key here is even if you have something that is intangible, you can still guarantee it because the Goodwill from customers, typically will still surpass the desire to refund.
10:40
What I mean by that is let's say you've got ten customers and normally if you sold your normal Services, you'd only have three.
But if you saw with a guarantee, maybe you get 10, all right, of the ten, maybe two of them.
Say I didn't experience the result you're looking for right now of the other eight, let's say you were promising.
10:57
They're going to sleep with her partner within 90 days.
I'm just throwing out.
Just as a crazy example, right?
And let's say at the end of 90 days, they didn't sleep with a partner.
But if their relationship is significantly better and they feel like they are making progress towards that goal.
They will not ask for a refund.
People want to see progress, right?
11:12
And so what's important is, and also in terms of the language, the messaging you use when you're talking to your audience, this is what I try and talk to you in terms of everyone here and it's talking off Corners is that.
We have this psychological bias towards binary thinking, which is yes or no good marriage bad mirror, right?
When it's much more to what extent or how good Good is my marriage, right?
11:31
So it's a rate, it's a scale, it's not yes or no.
And so, if you can teach your clients to think, you know, on a Continuum rather, than in the binary, you'll shift their thinking enough, that it won't even matter, because F of mad that made that frameshift, then you will have gotten them on a progression that they will be able to continue to improve over time.
11:47
And they will contribute that Improvement to the intervention that you provided for them.
So basically setting the experience to them on basically as right now to get progress along the joint.
Yeah.
So our just like to ask neck when it comes to qualifying the Avatar.
12:03
That deserves a grand, slam of our rights.
I mean, you were just put together a very good of argue to anyone because it might be cheaper together results because you have maybe have you broken system or something.
So, how do you, how did you make that process work?
I know you stay with jeans but, you know, in order verticals where it's difficult to predict certain things.
12:24
I would you do share and we have we have business opportunity, companies we have We have photography companies for children.
We have a company that does, like I said, we have a software that is lead working.
We have e-commerce company, we have the licensing company.
So we have a vast, you know, the vast array of different different companies that we have a certification company, vast array of different things.
12:43
I'll say.
Again, you can increase the quality of your product when you increase the quality of your prospects.
And so the easiest way to look at, this is look at the customers that you like the most, the ones we've had the most success, you, sing your Praises, writing your songs and look at them.
And then Are them to the people who you do not like who who haven't had a good experience.
13:02
And then what you do is you go backwards 90 days and see what was the experience to people who want to had in their first month.
What are the things they did?
That were different than the people who fail.
Once you can delineate.
One of those things were, it might be Milestones that are achieved in, might be a certain percentage of of material that was washed.
13:17
It could have been, it could have been coaching, calls attended, whatever type of solution, you're providing marriage but he lost business, whatever, right?
It could be any of those things, right?
And there's probably some Associated action.
It has to go with it.
If it was Lost might be logging food if it was business and might be sending emails for was if it was marriage, it might be, you know, filling out the checklist of things.
13:34
They love about their partner, whatever it is, right?
What are those Milestones that have to occur to activate the customer so that they're likely to experience the outcome that you were promising them.
And so what the metrics of your customer Journey should look like, and your customer success team should be driving towards this activation points.
13:51
There's Milestones.
So if we know that people who have both spouses, who fill out the checklist of the things they like about each, Other and their favorite memories of their relationship.
We know that if both people fill that out and they attend to calls in the first 14 days, the likelihood that they finish the program and experience great results is three times as high.
14:09
So then all of your effort goes towards pushing them through that Milestone so that they can change the color of their flag and then get you where you want to go.
So that's ultimately how you can change the and, and we were looking at reverse that's the experience, I that's the Fulfillment side.
But you might also note that this person, you know, has a business or is gainfully employed.
14:28
This person is unemployed and the stay-at-home mom.
Okay, well then these are the people.
Not only they did this experience, which I'm going to try and do on my back end, but on the front end I'm going to try and weed out these people and actively select for these people.
And then what's beautiful about that is that is an element of mission, right?
14:44
And so when you're making your messaging, you're making your creative in your marketing, you can speak more specifically to that Avatar rather than all marriage, you know, relationships that you're hoping you help stay-at-home moms with working husbands.
Achieve a better marriage who are between the ages of 30 and 50.
15:01
If you're that Avatar, you're like shit.
That's me or it's IHOP entrepreneurial men, you know, fall back in love with their wives ago, whatever, right?
Like whatever your outcome is, but you can be more specific about it and in so doing you can command higher prices because you can provide more tailored Solutions which in a very real way provides more value to that Avatar.
15:22
Even if the film, it looks the same.
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
It cast if you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
15:38
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, So basically, let's assume now this is a MySpace is basically cross-correlation.
I have course creators.
So if you, if I want to work with people who are more further along that question, a lot of made certain stores, right?
16:00
I basically have to, you know, it's tough.
It's I basically have selected on my and, you know, for me, I focus on cost graders who are like any business cost peace.
Who are trying to sell policies that give people a financial are right right so it's just basically neutral In your messaging to focus on those people and, you know, read out every other person with in other spaces contribution, so I'll give you an example.
16:24
And, for some reason it's harder for people.
But the thing is that they don't change the economics of their business, when they change the economics of the Avatar, and that's where you get into trouble.
So, for example, whatever your price point you're selling at right now, if you change your avatar, from anybody who's a coarse grater to people who have high business Roi, then you'll probably be providing far more value to those people one because your Will be more tailored to their approach but also because if they're selling business stuff and they're probably going to be able to charge higher premiums for it.
16:53
And so as a result, if they experience a transformation using your system etcetera, then they're going to make real money, right?
And so if you decide to be more selective with that Avatar, then that should be reflected in the pricing and the Fulfillment that goes along with that.
So the easy example is we made a decision very early on because I was in the gym space that we were helping Jim owners.
17:13
We were not helping personal trainers.
We're not helping online trainer.
As we're not helping health coaches, we're helping just microchip Motors.
And so by doing that half to two-thirds the volume that I would get every single day.
If people that that there were opting for stuff, we're not qualified.
But the people who try to compete with us and try to sell all of them wasted so much time because the LTV of those customers are so low, and the amount that they required was so high and the event that you'd have to go from 0 to 14.
17:40
So, many of these people, which is the heaviest lifting in all of business is getting someone to make their first dollar, I had, Interest in doing, how would it say, people are making half a million dollars a year and get them to a million.
A very simple outcome.
That's all I'm doing.
And I'd consistently.
We just do that.
We just do it.
Take you from half million two million, half a million to a million because that's something that I can repeatedly do over and over and over again.
18:00
I can demonstrate the value in a very, very high degree of success.
And so, if I do that, then I have a very demonstratable way to provide value and I can monetize that value accordingly.
And I can do with lots of operational efficiency since the process is so so clear.
Cut between each customer.
Awesome.
18:16
So, I'm supposed to be sivan's grew and I mean, that's one of your tenants in your company, that's how we.
Yeah, you talked about market efficiency, or basically, the market great, by certain percent every year.
And if you don't keep up your basic that, you know, going backwards.
18:32
So, how do you think you offers in your company's every single year or every single worst period of Time?
How do you, how do you walk around it?
It's more about embracing change in about being flexible.
In terms of like the goals that we said you would be Surprisingly bored by the types of goals that we set within our company.
18:50
You know, I can't tell you the last quarter's goals.
We always trickle back to the same things because it's either, if we're going to grow, we can only do two things.
We can either get more customers.
We can make them worth more.
That's it.
And so, we'll have two to three goals.
Tops.
You never have more than that for the company that will be like, okay, well we're going to take wherever we see the weakest Point within our within our pipeline which may be the pipeline's.
19:10
Great, it's like, okay well we just need a double front and volume but I wouldn't make the goal of doubling front of volume.
I would probably make the goal of beeping front and volume by 10 to 15 percent that would be the goal for the quarter.
And I would say, we need to Ascent, we need to take our customers attention from 40% to 50%.
That would be the backend upgrade, right?
19:27
That would be one is getting more customers.
The second is making them worth more and that would be literally the goal for the entire company.
And so then the directors would come up and say, okay, well I think in order for us to get a 50% boost in volume you know based on our total call volume right now we would need to add three more app development reps to the call team.
19:44
And that would mean we need to had One cell development specialist, which is our mid-level salesperson and one more closer.
Like, okay, so we need to hire five people and great.
That's what, that's what we're going to do.
And maybe we need to hire six or seven because we might not get the ones that we want to keep on the first go-round.
20:00
That's we're going to for the front end.
That is the tactics of how that's going to happen.
And then on the back end we're going to do is we're going to add, you know, these two touch points in, and we're going to make this process.
That's been a little bit difficult for them.
A little easier, so that hopefully, we can get another 10% of those people top.
20:16
Upgrade, that is how we improve the business.
We're not doing rocket science here.
We're just trying to implement incrementally improve these things.
And if I improve by, you know, 15% of both this metrics every quarter in 6/4, the numbers become crazy.
20:31
And so I think a lot of people they try to solve 100 problems at the same time and it's just it's it's impossible for your team.
You need focus focus is knowing what you're going to say no to not what you want to do, there's a hundred things, we all should do and for perspective for everyone.
We crossed 50 million in sales before we started doing email, follow-up, because I always felt like we had.
20:51
There were other opportunities that had more juice to squeeze than email follow-up for me and my business.
And so that whole time when we were 10 million at 21 and 30 million, we should have been doing email follow, but there were other things we should have done more, which is what we did.
And so, it's just about knowing what we're going to say, no to and the one or two things that we're going to say yes to.
21:11
Because I think most people wasley over estimate with, they can accomplish in a short period.
True.
So you said, that's the main problem starts, new business, or an individual, or a market feces.
And, you know, in your book you said, we should solve every single problem.
21:26
How does that?
Because when I try to introduce that, to some people, it feels like, I mean, it's a lot of work literally writes number here, 102 in Sumter programs, right, and trying to solve every one of them.
So, I mean, how does that affect yet?
So your markets were all.
21:44
So you have to solve?
L've every perceived problem, right, the way in which you saw that, that comes down to the delivery tube, which is in the book, right?
So I'll give an example I use weight loss because everyone understands it.
So if I had a girl and she needs to lose weight, there's a lot of things that she has to do that are different now than she was doing before.
22:03
So, she might now have to buy groceries differently than she did before.
She started working with me, right?
Just as a simple example.
Now, there is a zillion ways I can solve that problem so it's not that you have to go grocery shopping for every customer is Have to solve the problem around the difficulty of grocery shopping.
22:19
So for example, I can have a premade instacart for six sets of customers, a different weights that I could copy and paste to her and that you could click one, click, and she gets it ordered her house easy.
I could make custom lists, you know, I can make an Excel sheet that adjusts based on every customer.
Pick, they enter their weight in that, adjust the grocery list for the week.
22:36
That's the second one I can make premade list, not even a calculator, just pre-made PDFs for a hundred different, you know, weight scales.
And so that way, it's still tailored to them but I Do that work up front.
And then after that, it's just plug and play, right?
I could do a large group grocery shopping for so everyone meets there and then we go grocery shopping together.
22:54
If I want to do it virtually, I could do a virtual grocery store or I could do the live one record it and then make that the thing that I'm saying is the Fulfillment.
I could also do a 10-1 grocery, kind of like, I'll help them create it together as a one-on-one session, as a bonus for signing up for my weight loss program.
23:11
You see I'm saying here like there's all I did with there's one problem.
Yeah and we just looked at how many Or I could offer tech support.
So when you go to the grocery store, you can text me and I'll help you pick anything that if you have trouble with it.
I can have phone call support.
Like the list goes on.
And so it's really just limited by your creativity.
23:27
In terms of what you want to do, notice half of those things.
We're not creating anything was just being available and If I Had tech support compared to a PDF, most people would probably value the tech support higher.
I may or may not be willing to do that on a level of fulfillment.
Which again I would go back to my first tenet which is if you don't have that many customers be willing to do more So, you can over-deliver, learn more about them and then over time become more operationally efficient, but big picture?
23:52
Yes, we want to solve every problem in some way, and then over time.
What will improve your product in your business is how effectively you solve that problem relative to the cost to you.
That is fundamental like Amazon took tons of time to invest in building that infrastructure but now the marginal cost of a new custom on Amazon is nothing.
24:11
Right are very low, right?
It's so you can either put the workload on the Big brown the back end.
I prefer to do it on the front end and consistently improve on it and that's where you have customer surveys.
And as you're fulfilling, which is why I like more Hands-On approaches in the beginning because you're learning more about the customer.
24:28
I like that that data and the stories behind what you're going to discover there are so valuable.
It's silly not to do it.
Hope you guys enjoyed part. 1 of that podcast of the manual bolo next half of this podcast.
We actually go back in time.
I'll talk about how we gather testimonials Either reviews and and how do you can actively go get leads in the beginning of your business.
24:50
So you can go get sales, make money and do the stuff you need to do.
Don't want to miss it.
Either reviews and and how do you can actively go get leads in the beginning of your business.
So you can go get sales, make money and do the stuff you need to do.
Don't want to miss it.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however, you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur 99% of stuff.
I learned I learned from doing a lot of times, the masterminds will give you the context to learn where you are, deficient more than they will solve the deficiency.
0:36
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I get asked all the time and I want to address this because this is a misconception.
0:55
A lot of people think that I read books all day and I don't I've bought a lot of books, I don't read many books and I was actually kind of insecure about it because I get asked a lot because they're like, you must realize it books and honestly, I don't really.
And I feel like, you know, a lot about stuff which is I'm thinking, don't feel that way, but appreciate it.
1:13
It's because I will read and targeted manners around problems that I need to solve.
And so if I need to learn about copyright, I'll read four books on copywriting in a week but then I won't read anything for a very long time and then I'll be like oh I just encountered a problem that I really need to know more about and then I'll go really deep on the next topic which is that little missing brick on my bridge to get me to where I want to go.
1:34
And so what I don't actually like and this is going to probably be controversial is that I don't like the whole, like I read a book a week that's what I commit to because what happens is you create a really good vehicle for mental masturbation.
There's really no difference between that and watching TED talks every day and watching YouTube videos, like it's just another form of media that you're consuming.
1:50
Zooming.
And so like I can appreciate the intention behind it, but I don't think it serves.
Most people, the number of people that are like, I'm on book 36 for this year and they're in the exact same position.
They were four years ago, mind boggles me because I would so much.
Rather the person say I read four books and they were the only four books that I needed to read this year and I don't need to do anything else.
2:08
I just have to execute the stuff in this book and so when we're thinking about education in general, the one thing that you will need is the discernment to determine what thing you need to learn.
X, that is the one lever, on this whole equation of Education.
2:24
That makes some people move really slowly and some people really quickly is that you have to know what thing to learn next.
And so, I like I said earlier, think about it like a pipeline of sequence of, like, I gotta have something to sell.
I got to get people to find out about it.
I gotta learn how to sell.
Like, if you can do those three steps, you will be able to make money.
2:40
And if you don't know how to do, one of those three things then this probably why you're not making money.
The sides, the obvious of you're just not doing anything.
And so people ask me all the time like what things did you read to learn what you know, right can you Just give me a list of all the courses that you ever did.
All right?
So for me, I can tell you in sequence, every expensive thing that I bought coaching wise and I'ma be real with you.
3:03
It's not a lot and here's the real, here's the real and I love all the people about to share.
All right, homies, love them, all 99% of stuff.
I learned I learned from doing, all right?
And so, a lot of times, the masterminds will give you the context to learn where you are deficient More than they will solve the deficiency.
3:22
And so, what we are paying for and what we are buying is perspective, its context.
And that's what most people lack real talk.
So they might promise whatever.
That's fine.
I'm sure they'll have stuff and there's networking and things like that.
But the real thing that it gives you is the ability to identify your problems are.
3:39
And then it's up to you to solve them because basically no one's going to do the work for you.
It just it's just not going to happen and so you just have to get over that desire that someone's going to just like, you can pay money.
They're just gonna give you money back.
It's not going to happen.
All right, stop.
You're gonna have to do stuff but you want to just make sure that you're doing the stuff that's driving towards where you're going and is not, you just reinforcing a brick, that doesn't need more enforcing on that bridge, right?
4:00
If you already have copywriting break, you don't need to put six more bricks underneath of it.
You got that down, you have this big hole here, fill that hole, and you'll be able to get the dollar across the bridge and I see people who will spend years reinforcing one pillar on their bridge and never make the first dollar across because they don't have to perspective from which to choose where they are deficient, okay?
4:19
So in Order expensive stuff besides that, I read targeted books and read articles and I watch YouTube videos, which I would say is still the vast majority.
What I learned is the vast majority will got me started.
I learned from doing Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
4:37
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its hope free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
5:00
Because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast, so that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
I had, I was in a mastermind for Fitness from San back to our rest in peace.
I learned what this digital marketing space was not even know it existed.
And so I learned I learned what the term sales meant.
5:18
I didn't even know what this like, I didn't know what sales-wise just for context, like just it's no matter where you're starting, I didn't know what it was.
I didn't know what copywriting was, I didn't know what, like, an email list was.
I didn't know what affiliate stuff.
I learned that was like, my primer to the world, which you probably already know if you're watching this channel.
What these words mean?
5:34
I didn't?
And so I went to a mastermind YouTube like barely existed in any way.
Went to that Mastermind.
I learned some of that stuff and then I bought a three thousand dollar workshop on how to run Facebook ads for a weekend and that was a lot of money for me at the time.
There's a lot of money for me at the time.
I didn't make any money over the weekend and that's the thing is that I, you know, you can't expect a person to be a savior.
5:53
But I figured out enough to like understand how it worked conceptually.
And then I started running ads.
I started do it, right?
And then I learned how that worked and then click funnels came out years ago and I didn't know how to make landing page.
So I was paying a guy to make my pages.
I was like, I gotta learn how to do this.
And remember what I did was I sat down down on a Sunday.
6:09
I cleared my whole day and I had a page that I wanted to copy.
I was like, I'm not even try again, replicate before you iterate.
I was like, I'm just going to clone this page on this Builder, and I was like, it's probably going to take me the whole day or more.
I finished something in four hours.
And so I've been, I've been delaying confronting how to learn how to build a web page for at this point, almost three years.
6:30
I didn't want to learn how to build a web page.
Also, I'm not a tech guy, but I was like, I have to learn this and I sat down.
I thought it was going to take the whole week.
The whole day for sure.
And I was done by noon and I was like, oh my God.
And the thing is, is there's so many skills like that, that there's all this fear around it, but if you just start pulling the thread, you start pulling the corner, all of a sudden, your next step gets a lot clearer to you after you take the first step.
6:52
And so most people try and think that they have to figure out the first thousand cells before they take the first one.
When in reality think about yourself in the dark with a flashlight.
That's pointing a foot in front of you and you take one step and then the next step gets clear and it's much easier to just pull the thread and get started.
And take the first step then is to try and figure out.
7:08
Out every step because you're afraid of failing, right?
So I did, I did The Mastermind.
Also, with that one, I work for the guy for free, for three months and you're like, Alex, I'll work for you for three months.
The difference was the skill set that I had applied there.
7:25
I already was really in shape, already knew a lot about nutrition.
I learned a lot of my training and I worked for him at his gym, all right?
And so, for me for him, I had value to provide, right?
I get asked all the time, like, dude, I'll get your coffee.
I'll do whatever.
I'm like, Pay someone who's not going to ask me questions, to go get me coffee and be real with you because you want to just suck up two hours of my day every day and do it for free.
7:46
You're free is too expensive.
It's overpriced and so that's by the way exactly what Ben Graham said.
To Warren Buffett when Warren Buffett asked to work for Ben, Graham for free.
Ben Graham said your overpriced context.
So I did The Mastermind.
I did the workshop, I worked for him and I showed up.
8:04
When he showed up, I showed up at the gym at 4:00 a.m. because that's when he showed up and he worked till 4:00.
So you worked L've hours a day, and I worked with him.
And then after four, I still kept working at the gym and I did that.
And then from there, I learned how to start a gym.
And that's how I started my first gym.
I'm trying to think I went to traffic and conversion Summit.
8:20
That's what I learned about clickfunnels.
And that's when I learned about the webpage thing, I was like, 20, something years later.
And then, from there, that was kind of what got me into the drum, start marketing world.
And then I started, I read almost all of those.
You know, this free books, people give away I read all of them like all of the guys books which is why I'm so passionate about books for me.
8:41
Because books like as much as I said, I don't read on a regular basis.
I read targeted during seasons of my life.
If I'm trying to get contacts on an industry, I'm only reading in a very specific segment.
I'm not reading like a book on the one thing and then like how to make friends and influence people which if you're 18 you should totally read that.
8:59
Cause you need to figure out how to talk to people but like I need to learn about direct response and so I learned I swallowed all that.
And then I think, the next thing I did was I paid a guy one-on-one $750 an hour to teach me how to run Facebook ads.
And so I learned that in more depth because I learned like a basic understanding, but he learned I taught he taught me how to do like pixels and retargeting and audiences and all that.
9:18
And I didn't have to do any that stuff.
And then from there, I joined Russell's Mastermind and I didn't even have an online business and that's when I learned about like the online world.
So I learned about like the direct response world and then I learned about like the online marketing world and like digital products and information and education stuff like learn I learned about that.
9:35
At World there and just for contacts.
Like, I never logged into any of the stuff that I was given access to.
I got exposed to people who brought in by thinking and got me to thinking bigger increments, and that was the biggest gift.
And that's hopefully the biggest gift I can.
Hopefully, give anybody on these channels, just thinking and larger increments.
9:53
If you can do that, you can change your life because you stopped paying attention to stuff.
That's small, potatoes.
And like the biggest ever seen Rich.
Dad's import ads, is that rich dad's teach the kids to thinking bigger increments?
They're like, hey man, I got this thing on the Going to make me like 100 bucks.
It's like Rich, Dad kids, don't do it because they're going to like I'm gonna wait till I find the thing that makes me 10 grand.
10:14
It's a choice, it's the decision-making.
Like that's the biggest gift of being raised around.
Rich people is that they just don't waste their time on things that aren't worth it.
That's the gift, right?
It's not, it's not like some good old boys club.
It's the perspective which they see opportunity and leverage their like dude.
10:32
I'm not going to open a dry-cleaning store.
Nothing wrong with that.
Am I gonna do that?
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get into real estate, I'm gonna I'm gonna get into into sales, I'm gonna get into Finance because those are bigger, leverage opportunities.
So that was a misconception wanted to clarify.
I said, I have not bought a tremendous amount of information things that were high ticket, but the ones that I did by and that was I think the last thing I really thought that was because I mean and then I bought and then I'll buy Ours from people, I do that all the time.
10:57
If I can buy time from somebody, I'll pay whatever.
I probably paid ten different, people 10,000 hour or more, and Every single one of them is worth, so recommend.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, we have multiple Transformations.
Have to occur, we can solve the acute problem of what they're coming for today.
But once we solve that problem, they're going to leave.
Unless we have a broader Journey that they're going to be on and some of the best.
These are the journeys of becoming because they never had.
0:32
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to Burger business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
If I were to build a physical product brand, I probably would do a nose strip and the reason I would do another strip is for a couple reasons, one is that no strip cost, pennies to manufacture, can sell them for a hundred times that price.
0:59
If it cost you to sense and you can solve for a buck you're making huge margins on the actual thing.
The second thing is that it's sticky quite literally, but also from recurring standpoint, if you can improve, how someone breathes there are going to buy it again and again and again right over and over and over again, they're going to use it every day and it's also something that doesn't require willpower to use.
1:16
You have to remember to do it like the problem.
Elements that people have to remember to take them.
They also have to associate it with being healthy, which most people struggle with, whereas most people always sleep.
They don't most people sleep every day.
Those Bill don't work out every day.
And so, I'd rather associate a product that's something that people are doing on a regular basis.
1:32
Without willpower, it's the reason beauty products to me are more interesting than finished products by and large, because every girl wants to look pretty and not have to work out versus having to get the willpower to work out etcetera, right?
Flip side, you can have Fitness apparel, which you We're even if you don't work out because you feel like, you're somebody who works out.
1:51
So you actually get the status without having to do the work.
And so, whenever I have things like that, like those like little arbitrageurs like, status arbitrageurs or things that are interesting to me.
And so I would probably do know straight because I use them all the time.
And so I have D product knowledge on like the goods and the bads of different brands that I've used.
2:07
I don't promote any brain because I'm not thrilled about any brand.
Just if anyone's curious, if I were to do it, then that would probably be a product out build.
And then I could have auto ship built into it, which would be It makes it convenient for people.
You can also explain to people how to use it which is like you want one in your suitcase.
2:24
So that when you travel is there, you don't think about it.
You want one next to your bed, you want spares in the rooms that you ever ever sleep extra and you want one in your backpack if you're like traveling as well.
So you have them in different places.
So then we also get more purchases and then the things that I would probably do to make a difference.
As I'd focus a lot on the product obviously because like in these types of things, the reason that I don't pimp any brand out is because like I don't really like any of the brands they have like all got big things.
2:48
That I'm not a fan of, but I would also probably try and tie in some sort of branding element, which is like I would put, like, volume or persist or inder across the bridge of the nose.
And I would have it spelled backwards.
So that in the mirror, someone could see it and they could see it every day and it would remind people of like a word that they're trying to focus on for a season.
3:07
And so I like having those constant daily subconscious reminders around things, they actually found in sales rooms that having a single word on the wall affected performance from the team.
Even if it was just Huge.
So if you just have like one more, you know, mean on the wall, then everyone sees that as a daily reminder, that they need to keep going.
3:25
They need to keep going to do one more.
And so I would want my face to be the walking billboard for my eyes.
So every time I looked in the mirror, I would be reminded of this thing and I would want that to be like the different, the different flavors of the nose strips would be the words that people are working on.
3:41
So might be patients, might be weight might be volume, it might be, you know, kindness whatever it, whatever that whatever.
Thing you're working on right now.
So I'd probably do something like that.
And so yeah, if anybody has the logistical capabilities to recreate that and I prefer disposables because I've seen the ones that are like, I've used the ones that are like pieces that go with it.
4:03
Not a huge fan because I lose them.
And I walk around with, in the morning, I take it and I put in my pocket that I wash it, or I leave it on my kitchen table and then it goes somewhere else.
Then I'm in bed.
And oh my gosh, and I need to go get out of bed to go get the thing.
Like, I don't like that.
I like the disposable ones and I'd like to have one.
That was Your that had the word.
4:19
So the only thing you see is the word which I think would be really cool.
And by far, the biggest thing I would have to work is it has to stick.
It has to stick all the way through.
So it has to work on non-oily surfaces and oily Services alike because people have different nose, you know, whatever's.
4:35
And so, anyways, that would be the product that I would probably sell if I were going to get into physical products.
And so that's the kind of the reasoning behind it.
I really high gross margins.
It's really sticky out.
Have a unique brand that was built around it and I would have answered Larry benefits like the words that are beneficial to the person outside of just the strip.
4:52
And so when every time they put that on, not only do they have the immediate benefit of breathing better, but they also have the long-term mental benefit of the thing that they are trying to work on being remind being reminded of that every day.
Every moment, hundreds of times a day, which are very few things that you can get reminded of many times a day, subconsciously like that that will make a difference in your life and I think that's one of them.
5:11
And so I'll give you a basic estimate of what I think would end up happening money-wise.
So they currently sell for about 30 cents of strip.
They Only cost a penny or less to make especially at scale.
Alright.
So that means retail is probably I would want to be a little bit premium so I'd probably be at 1999 would probably be a price point that I would look at maybe 2499.
5:33
I would see you know, we'd split test the price points there but it'd probably be in that range that I would sell the products.
My cost of goods would almost be entirely based on the shipping cost that's associated.
So if I put 30 days of strips in and I'd probably sell 30 60 90 packs, because text, you one of Things that I hate is that I have my upsells would probably be like 13 and then probably 612 I probably have five options on my upsell with you know all the way down to maybe 15 percent off, if they buy, you know, 12 months worth and then cascading upwards in terms of smaller percentages off.
6:04
But let's do the math on how much money is so big.
So if I just did my own promotion, if I get let's say let's say ten thousand people a month would go to a page if I said, hey, check this out right now.
If I didn't consistently, it probably about ten thousand people a month just clicks.
Right?
So I got 10,000 people month to a page and then we converted five percent of traffic on that page.
6:24
Then we would have 500 buyers.
So 500 buyers and let's just keep it at the monthly rather than getting in the average bundles.
And so, let's just say, you know, we have very low turn because a product like this probably would have low turn.
So I'll let you say, like, 10% turn four, and it's not very low for physical, just leave it at that. 10% churn that means that every month I would sign up, 500, and that I lose 10%.
6:48
And so this business would keep growing with that level of traffic until we reached 5,000 users because it's 500 divided by 10%, which is the churn, which is the number of maxed out.
Users at a hypothetical Max for your equilibrium between number of signups and number of cancellations.
And so I'd be at 5,000 users a month and if my price point was $20, then I would be making a hundred thousand dollars a month from the nose strips my cost to ship the nose, drips would probably be in the neighborhood of like Four dollars, maybe less, maybe like two and a half.
7:21
It depends on like the three people that we would use.
So I'd probably make, like, let's just say safely even after the cost of the all the no strips which is minimal.
Let's just say we make $16 gross margin on a twenty dollar product is really good for physical products so I would be making eighty thousand dollars a month.
7:40
So million dollars a year in profit from the nose strips.
And so that's a breakdown of how that would work if I were to launch it and then I would probably send no strips that had the word.
And so, what I would really want to do is build the capacity to make the words easy to print on there.
7:57
So we could have people put their own custom word in.
So it's a, you can choose from one of my five words, but if you want to put your own word in its $30 and I get this huge premium, but it's worth it for a lot of people to have their own custom word.
So that would be like a unique competitive mode for talk about like, what kind of modes can you build if you just white label a glue thing from another country?
8:15
Someone else can do that, too.
But if you The manufacturing capacity that can like on-demand create the word that someone wants you can literally 2x 3x sometimes the price of the thing because it's a unique thing that other people have and the value is there for people.
And so if people could pick the word that they could put on their as whatever word, they wanted to work on that month or something like that and they would get a text.
8:37
I would say, hey, what, where do you want to work on this month?
A text back, it automatically goes to the system and then ships it right out.
So them then that would be a really interesting business model that would have huge Enterprise Value.
You.
So if you're curious a business like that and I would probably ship the no strips with two or three, variations of influencers that I thought were words that their communities Doug.
8:58
So someone sends me Mo Z Nation or someone sends me, you know, Mosey mobiles or you know, SME 500.
Right.
Someone sends me those terms on a strip then it's going to be something.
I'm going to be like, dude this is dope and then because I have such high gross margins, I could say, hey man, I'll give you 40 percent of everything and you don't have to build the business so you can make 40.
9:18
Send Top Line on on all the revenue of this thing, which by the way, if you're taking making your own business, if you ran 40% margins on your own on your own audience, it's a great business anyways.
And so they'd be like, it makes more sense.
Readers work for me because all the commits that capacity I built, and that would be the influence your campaign.
9:35
And so, you think for me, I was able to add a million dollars to business and then you add 100 influencers.
Maybe they're not as big or they're not as no strip Centric.
Like, I am but maybe if they did, I do a tenth of the volume that I could do on average.
Edge.
Then it's 10 times what I'm doing which is 10 million dollars and there's only 40 percent margin to me, right?
9:56
Because I had to give them 40 and there's 20 that was cost mind.
You stop the run the business but let's just keep it simple for now.
So let's cut it that in half again.
So I get another 20% from the 10x volume that I got from them.
So now we're probably looking at a three or four million dollar even a business that is recurring, that is not dependent on one single face that has, very high gross margin so that they can go into new channels.
10:18
Channels that has a unique and competitive mode that allows it to have a premium pricing which I didn't even factor in.
Like if we sold it for 40 rather than 20 and then the final piece is that what would this business to be worth?
So if we're doing four million in ibadah for physical products, business like this on 10 million, top line, or sorry would be more than that Top Line.
10:35
This business would probably be worth somewhere in the 40 to 60 million dollar range.
And so that is a Mosey money business breakdown.
If I were to get into physical products, what I would make and how I would make it to be a cool business.
Amos an Asian quick break.
10:50
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
11:09
And if I was focusing on like a branding perspective of like, what is this going to Encompass?
I would probably go after the entrepreneur Community First because it's obviously community that I have access to, and I think could afford or would be willing to pay a premium price for better nose strips that had the words on them.
But I think the brand would actually be more of a personal development, brand of like, becoming the person you want to be with the daily actions and reminders of who you want to become.
11:33
And so, it's like, you're literally tattooing this thing between your eyes to remind yourself of the person trying to become the Character traits, you're trying to embody.
And so I think that it would really be a very inspirational brand.
And I would probably, cause I want it to be Mass Market.
I would show different walks of life and I would have them working on different problems.
11:52
All right, so I start thinking entrepreneurially because that's me, right?
But also, like, if you have moms and their word is patients, right?
Patients can apply to anyone.
But like, or if you have a prisoner in the prison system, who just gets out is an ex-con, it might be like, forgiveness, you don't have mean.
12:08
And so I think it's It could be a much wider brand, if you focus on the deficiencies that people want to fail.
And then I have to think of some kind of sexy word for the, for the brand name.
But I mean, I don't know, I feel like it'd be something around like better, you know what I mean?
Like, better know, strips or like, be better, be better, nose strips.
12:26
And then something that would that's like short and simple that people could understand and share.
And I think that that could be something that people would get behind because you don't want it to be about Mosey, right?
You don't want it to be about.
Bout you.
You don't want it to be about the founder, you want it to be about the Prospect and more specifically about the problem that were solving and the person that we want to be that they want to become and the promises that were fulfilling.
12:52
And so if you can help someone feel better about who they are, people will pay anything for that feeling.
And so the wedge product, is the idea that we are helping people breathe better but the brand and the promise is About, we're helping people be better, they bias for the breathing.
13:13
They stay for the betterment, they stay for the person.
They're going to become.
And so that's kind of the the two-sided angle that a lot of Brands can accomplish.
And if you're thinking about building your own brand, it's like the fitness space is obviously space.
I have a lot of experience in but like people come for the bikini they say for the community, right?
13:30
I remember a buddy of mine was in the dating space.
He said they come to get laid but they stay for the confidence.
And just for anyone who's feeling their troll Vibes, come the point is not the space.
In focusing on the point is that people come for one thing and they stay for something else.
And I'll tell you a story that changed my life.
13:47
So I had a mentor and he told me this story is called The Garlic and the ham.
He said, there's just a little boy, and he really wants a dog.
So he begs his dad to get him a dog.
So the, you know, after lots and lots of making the dad says, hey if I get you a dog, you're going to be responsible for anything.
14:03
No, I understand.
I'll walk.
Walk it off, he told everything.
So the guy gets the kid a dog.
And so dad's gone on work, whatever rights the kids at home, with his abuela, his grandma.
And he sees one day that the dog has ticks and he's like, oh my God, I'm having to take care of the dog.
14:22
I should have been taken care of this, like, and he goes through Square, when they're freaks out.
He's like, what do I do?
What do I do?
And the grandmother calmly Smiles.
She's like, go feed the dog, some garlic, like, you know, the smell will drive the ticks away and they'll go away.
So she breaks up piece of garlic.
14:37
She hands it to the kid.
He goes in the other room, he tries to feed the dog, the garlic, the dogs, like move it, you know, moving his face around, he doesn't want to eat it right.
If you ever tried to feed a dog, something they don't want.
She goes back to the groomers really obsess.
Like there's even more tips now than there were before like what do I do?
Like she's not eating the garlic.
14:53
She's like did you just try and feed him the garlic?
He was like yeah you told me if you in the college's mijo it's like you don't feed the dog the garlic he's like you got to wrap it in the ham and so she gives him ham and he wraps it in the ham and he goes back to the dog.
The dog eats the garlic few hours later the texture gone.
And so the moral of the story is that you have to give people what they want in order to give them what they need thing.
15:13
They come for is necessarily the thing they stay for.
And if you're thinking about the customer journey and the customer experience, you're trying to bring someone on, we have multiple Transformations, have to occur, we can solve the acute problem of what they're coming for today.
But once we solve that problem, they're going to leave.
Unless we have a broader Journey that they're going to be on, and then some of the best Journeys are the journeys of becoming because they never end.
15:32
And so, if you can take someone under journey of today, I'm going to solve this thing.
But tomorrow, we're going to become something else.
Then they can stay with you again, and again, and again, and people will vote for brands that they believe in because it tells them the things that they want to believe about themselves.
And so, when they pay for the products that they have, they're really buying into the identity, they want to associate with, and want to be.
15:54
And so when they do that, they can continue to pay over and over and over again because it reminds them but who they are.
And so when we're building Brands, if I'm thinking through that applying to physical product finding service etcetera, that's what we want to build.

0:18
What's going on everybody?
Happy Monday.
Because the one thing that I do not like about my neighborhood is that the reception sucks.
So sometimes I feel so alive is get messed up and that's what happened.
So we're going to get right back into it.
So what?
It is the number one reason that people don't buy.
Well, there are a lot of reasons people don't buy, but God.
0:37
Sorry, I get frustrated.
So a lot of people don't because the reports off the energies off they didn't get greeted.
Right?
There's no pre-frame.
There's a lot of reasons they didn't buy, but if we're getting down to the actual sale itself, like why did this person not purchase?
And usually, it's because there was not a gap that was established between where they're trying to go and what they've done, what they've done the past, right?
0:57
The biggest Advantage every single marketer has.
Every single sales person has, is that the person signed up, the person walked through the door, right?
And so, Ever someone's like, like, if someone walks into your door and say, they say, they signed up for a specific solution, there's really no reason for you, not to close them, right?
1:16
Like, like you need to lose weight.
I sell weight loss, like let's bridge.
This Gap here, right?
You're like, so, so like, it's should be really common sense, but a lot of times we get so excited like I gotta close the sale, I got, you know, like we forget some of the basics of persuasion, right?
1:33
And so, the first thing you do is you have to clarify where they're trying to go, which is like Why'd you come in today, right?
Like, Why'd You Come In like, well, I'm trying to lose weight.
You're like cool.
How much like 30 pounds like?
Okay, cool.
So you're trying least, 30 pounds.
Where you at?
Right now?
I'm at 200 pounds like, okay?
So you're at 200 winnings 170.
1:49
Got it would have done in the past, right?
Then they're going to go through the things you do in the past.
Now the reason we do the past thing, there's a couple reasons one is because you're trying to elicit emotion, right?
You're trying to get them to think about all the things they've done and how much investment they put into it.
2:04
Because when you do that stuff, then they The past, pains the suffering.
And they're like, man, I don't want to do that anymore, right, that's the first reason.
But the second reason is because we need to establish a gap, right?
Of what they have done, right?
2:20
And where they're trying to go.
Because if someone comes in and they say, like, what I have to establish is that if they, if they had the method or our secret sauce, the biggest way to nail them with this, the Gap wise is that you wouldn't have signed.
2:37
It up today, right?
And so that means it kind of nails them to the table, if that makes sense.
So here's a, here's a gym, owner example, then I'll give away loss example, so I'll give you two.
So if a gym owner signs up for something like, our thing, I would be like, okay well, it's clear, right?
2:53
Because they're like what, you know maybe I could run Facebook ads my own or like you know I you know we've been doing word-of-mouth and that's when working okay for us, you know, we do a certain amount of Revenue and we don't need to do whatever, whatever that reason is.
Right be like well why'd you sign up then?
Well, you know, I was kind of interesting like no, why'd you sign up right?
3:09
We have to establish the Gap like well you know you know I'd like to have more, I'm like, okay.
So you're not content with where you're at.
Well, I mean I'm okay.
You're like, no, no.
But there's a reason that you signed up what's the reason right?
Like, well, I'd like to make more.
I'm like why aren't you marketing on your own right now?
Well yeah Mike well why isn't that working?
3:25
And then they're like well it's not as it's not as working as well as it could be like.
Okay so it's like you got to keep drilling until you get to okay.
Got it because would it be safe to say If you had a really effective marketing method that was like printing, you cash, you would have walked in today, right?
3:41
Right.
Okay, so now we're establishing that Gap or anchoring them down.
So within a weight loss conversation, right now you can do like I'm going really high level, like there's more tactics here but I'm trying to like keep it high levels around gets what I'm talking about.
So the weight loss conversation, it might go something like, okay.
3:57
So you know, you've you did, you didn't LA Fitness membership.
Okay, why didn't that work?
Well, I mean I was working out but I couldn't stick with it.
I don't know.
It's I couldn't say consistent, right?
And so you'd be like, okay so you didn't follow a diet, no one helped you out with your food and no one was calling to check in with you to make sure that you worked out.
4:14
And then when you're working out rework, not alone.
They're like, yeah, I'm like gosh, girl.
My well, of course she didn't succeed, right?
And so, like, I'm starting to do, it's like break the beliefs of like explain why they lost right explain why they lost it.
It's like, hey, it's not your fault, you just didn't know what it takes to get the goal that you want.
4:31
That's number one.
And then, number two, this a between the Gap is that That if someone comes in cause that's those are easier sales, someone comes in who's gonna like fight you a little bit more?
It's like, well, you know, I could do it on my own.
Like, I've lost weight in the past like, you know, I don't know why this is so different, right?
Like, so if you have one of those types of people, then you're like, we'll listen.
4:49
I mean, you came in today, because you're trying to lose weight, right, right.
Okay.
And your is it safe to say that you're not happy with where you're at?
That's why you signed up.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
And, you know I'm not happy where I'm at.
Okay, cool.
Well to be fair, you said you've done this a couple times, right?
5:06
Okay, cool.
So you haven't figured out a way to make it sustainable, right?
You have any will stick with it, right, right.
Because no matter what it is there's a reason they walked in the door.
There is a reason they walked in the door and it's because they don't have what they want and you just need to get them to say that you need to get them to admit it.
5:24
And as soon as they own that that it means you have something that you can nail them to that you can solve, right?
So this is like for a harder sale.
Like some people are lay down sales and that's obvious but I'm saying for those for those 50% that you have to fight for not to 30.
Percentage is give you money because it's just they already made the decision before they walked in the door for those 50%, some of them you got to fight form a little bit and it's just because people have pride, they have egos, right?
5:47
As I don't want to admit that they failed, right?
And so you have to bring it out of them, like okay, so you didn't lose, weight are so you've been able to lose weight or you've had trainers in the past.
You want to other gyms, right?
Okay.
Why didn't those things work, right?
And so you're trying to tease it out of them and it's like there's no matter what the biggest Advantage you have.
6:05
Have, is that they walked in today and here's the word that you can say to them, to make sure that they understand that point, you say, because if you did have everything, you would have needed.
You'd already have the body you want.
You wouldn't walked in today.
Done.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
6:29
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
6:47
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
Right, like if you already had the marketing, maximum sales, tactics or whatever to get people to like to acquire customers at will and make as much money as you needed, you wouldn't have applied new and me on the phone with me right now, right?
7:06
The point is that no matter what sales conversation, you're having, there's a reason that they applied, that's why Cold selling sucks because like somebody like, dude, I don't need your shit, like, I don't need it, right.
But if someone applies, which is my marketing is nice.
If someone applies, then it means they raised their hand.
They said, I really would like that solution which gives you the ultimate upper.
7:23
In the sale because they already admitted that they don't have, they have a problem and they don't have the solution and you have that upper hand in the conversation.
Because if you had what I'm talking about, if you already had a solution that you could walk away from this table from right now, then you wouldn't have walked in because you already have the body you want and like you wouldn't have applied, right?
7:43
So you always have that upper hand.
So, have that in the conversation.
When you're talking to these people is like, well, you know, I'm going to think about like what you have to sell against the alternative.
What were you going to do?
Like, we already know that.
That you came in here and you try.
The only finished thing I didn't work right.
Look.
So you can't go back to that, right?
And so we use the pain stuff so that we can block the exit, right?
8:03
Like well we've done all these other things.
What you gonna do you said you want to lose weight, right?
Right.
Then what you going to do and like I say this like with this hardcore attitude because I'm like if you really believe that you're trying to help this person, which is why selling is serving like you need to help them.
See what they can't see.
8:19
A lot of people really confused by people like super emotional about it and they can make Visions.
It's like you have to, you have to learn this conversation so that you can help people.
And so you have to get them to see what they've been trying not to see, right?
Because they don't want to see the fact they need help because it makes them feel small, right?
8:36
So you're like, listen, you've done all these things.
It has not worked, right?
Eat this thing.
Didn't work.
This thing to this were.
Okay, cool.
So would it be fair to say that you have like right now you have yet to figure out what the contract is that makes it work?
Yes, okay.
Well here's why our contract is better than those things, right?
And you go belief breaking, I'm not gonna get into that right now.
8:52
Super If break on the pitch right and then you close and this is really kind of more of an obstacle overcome for people who at that close say well you know what, I'm not really sure.
You're like what?
You're not sure about.
You need to lose weight, you haven't done anything else.
That's worked and the reason you walked in today because you're trying to solve this problem, right?
9:11
And you haven't done it.
Otherwise, you would've walked in.
You'd already have the body you want.
If you knew what I was talking about, if you had our system, you don't have the body one.
If you had our system, your gym would be paying for itself.
Like if you had our system, you'd be making.
Which one is you want to?
How do I know and then proof Like how do I do what I believe you proof, right?
9:30
That's why the first thing I'm telling you guys like even if you're not a just like your mother works with us, have an entire wall of before and after pictures have an entire wall of five-star reviews because y'all got it, you don't even use it.
Use it, right?
We have two hundred billion.
Testimonials, that gym owners that we've turned the gyms around seven-figure run rates like actual real seven-figure run rates, not just the name and because they were at, like, 15K.
9:55
Now, they're at a hundred, right?
I can show you a bazillion of them because we process it works, right?
But you wouldn't be in this group right now if your gym was making what you want it to make.
So anyways, I'm not gonna lie.
I can undergo you.
I'm just getting but if you're in this group or not, you're totally should opt in somewhere.
10:14
I think I don't hate money.com.
You can go there and you can sign up for for a call and we'll explain to you and we'll go through this whole process, do it as a learning experience, if you want.
But anyway, guys, hope you guys have an awesome day.
Make sure that you Establish the Gap.
Remind them that they would not have walked in.
10:30
If they had the solution that you already have.
It's the biggest upper hand you have in the sale because they raise their hand first.
All right.
You need to lose weight, I sell weight loss.
Like, all you gotta do is bridge that Gap.
Alright guys have an amazing day and I'll catch you guys on the flip side.

But once we solve that problem, they're going to leave.
Unless we have a broader Journey that they're going to be on and some of the best.
These are the journeys of becoming because they never had.
0:32
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to Burger business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
If I were to build a physical product brand, I probably would do a nose strip and the reason I would do another strip is for a couple reasons, one is that no strip cost, pennies to manufacture, can sell them for a hundred times that price.
0:59
If it cost you to sense and you can solve for a buck you're making huge margins on the actual thing.
The second thing is that it's sticky quite literally, but also from recurring standpoint, if you can improve, how someone breathes there are going to buy it again and again and again right over and over and over again, they're going to use it every day and it's also something that doesn't require willpower to use.
1:16
You have to remember to do it like the problem.
Elements that people have to remember to take them.
They also have to associate it with being healthy, which most people struggle with, whereas most people always sleep.
They don't most people sleep every day.
Those Bill don't work out every day.
And so, I'd rather associate a product that's something that people are doing on a regular basis.
1:32
Without willpower, it's the reason beauty products to me are more interesting than finished products by and large, because every girl wants to look pretty and not have to work out versus having to get the willpower to work out etcetera, right?
Flip side, you can have Fitness apparel, which you We're even if you don't work out because you feel like, you're somebody who works out.
1:51
So you actually get the status without having to do the work.
And so, whenever I have things like that, like those like little arbitrageurs like, status arbitrageurs or things that are interesting to me.
And so I would probably do know straight because I use them all the time.
And so I have D product knowledge on like the goods and the bads of different brands that I've used.
2:07
I don't promote any brain because I'm not thrilled about any brand.
Just if anyone's curious, if I were to do it, then that would probably be a product out build.
And then I could have auto ship built into it, which would be It makes it convenient for people.
You can also explain to people how to use it which is like you want one in your suitcase.
2:24
So that when you travel is there, you don't think about it.
You want one next to your bed, you want spares in the rooms that you ever ever sleep extra and you want one in your backpack if you're like traveling as well.
So you have them in different places.
So then we also get more purchases and then the things that I would probably do to make a difference.
As I'd focus a lot on the product obviously because like in these types of things, the reason that I don't pimp any brand out is because like I don't really like any of the brands they have like all got big things.
2:48
That I'm not a fan of, but I would also probably try and tie in some sort of branding element, which is like I would put, like, volume or persist or inder across the bridge of the nose.
And I would have it spelled backwards.
So that in the mirror, someone could see it and they could see it every day and it would remind people of like a word that they're trying to focus on for a season.
3:07
And so I like having those constant daily subconscious reminders around things, they actually found in sales rooms that having a single word on the wall affected performance from the team.
Even if it was just Huge.
So if you just have like one more, you know, mean on the wall, then everyone sees that as a daily reminder, that they need to keep going.
3:25
They need to keep going to do one more.
And so I would want my face to be the walking billboard for my eyes.
So every time I looked in the mirror, I would be reminded of this thing and I would want that to be like the different, the different flavors of the nose strips would be the words that people are working on.
3:41
So might be patients, might be weight might be volume, it might be, you know, kindness whatever it, whatever that whatever.
Thing you're working on right now.
So I'd probably do something like that.
And so yeah, if anybody has the logistical capabilities to recreate that and I prefer disposables because I've seen the ones that are like, I've used the ones that are like pieces that go with it.
4:03
Not a huge fan because I lose them.
And I walk around with, in the morning, I take it and I put in my pocket that I wash it, or I leave it on my kitchen table and then it goes somewhere else.
Then I'm in bed.
And oh my gosh, and I need to go get out of bed to go get the thing.
Like, I don't like that.
I like the disposable ones and I'd like to have one.
That was Your that had the word.
4:19
So the only thing you see is the word which I think would be really cool.
And by far, the biggest thing I would have to work is it has to stick.
It has to stick all the way through.
So it has to work on non-oily surfaces and oily Services alike because people have different nose, you know, whatever's.
4:35
And so, anyways, that would be the product that I would probably sell if I were going to get into physical products.
And so that's the kind of the reasoning behind it.
I really high gross margins.
It's really sticky out.
Have a unique brand that was built around it and I would have answered Larry benefits like the words that are beneficial to the person outside of just the strip.
4:52
And so when every time they put that on, not only do they have the immediate benefit of breathing better, but they also have the long-term mental benefit of the thing that they are trying to work on being remind being reminded of that every day.
Every moment, hundreds of times a day, which are very few things that you can get reminded of many times a day, subconsciously like that that will make a difference in your life and I think that's one of them.
5:11
And so I'll give you a basic estimate of what I think would end up happening money-wise.
So they currently sell for about 30 cents of strip.
They Only cost a penny or less to make especially at scale.
Alright.
So that means retail is probably I would want to be a little bit premium so I'd probably be at 1999 would probably be a price point that I would look at maybe 2499.
5:33
I would see you know, we'd split test the price points there but it'd probably be in that range that I would sell the products.
My cost of goods would almost be entirely based on the shipping cost that's associated.
So if I put 30 days of strips in and I'd probably sell 30 60 90 packs, because text, you one of Things that I hate is that I have my upsells would probably be like 13 and then probably 612 I probably have five options on my upsell with you know all the way down to maybe 15 percent off, if they buy, you know, 12 months worth and then cascading upwards in terms of smaller percentages off.
6:04
But let's do the math on how much money is so big.
So if I just did my own promotion, if I get let's say let's say ten thousand people a month would go to a page if I said, hey, check this out right now.
If I didn't consistently, it probably about ten thousand people a month just clicks.
Right?
So I got 10,000 people month to a page and then we converted five percent of traffic on that page.
6:24
Then we would have 500 buyers.
So 500 buyers and let's just keep it at the monthly rather than getting in the average bundles.
And so, let's just say, you know, we have very low turn because a product like this probably would have low turn.
So I'll let you say, like, 10% turn four, and it's not very low for physical, just leave it at that. 10% churn that means that every month I would sign up, 500, and that I lose 10%.
6:48
And so this business would keep growing with that level of traffic until we reached 5,000 users because it's 500 divided by 10%, which is the churn, which is the number of maxed out.
Users at a hypothetical Max for your equilibrium between number of signups and number of cancellations.
And so I'd be at 5,000 users a month and if my price point was $20, then I would be making a hundred thousand dollars a month from the nose strips my cost to ship the nose, drips would probably be in the neighborhood of like Four dollars, maybe less, maybe like two and a half.
7:21
It depends on like the three people that we would use.
So I'd probably make, like, let's just say safely even after the cost of the all the no strips which is minimal.
Let's just say we make $16 gross margin on a twenty dollar product is really good for physical products so I would be making eighty thousand dollars a month.
7:40
So million dollars a year in profit from the nose strips.
And so that's a breakdown of how that would work if I were to launch it and then I would probably send no strips that had the word.
And so, what I would really want to do is build the capacity to make the words easy to print on there.
7:57
So we could have people put their own custom word in.
So it's a, you can choose from one of my five words, but if you want to put your own word in its $30 and I get this huge premium, but it's worth it for a lot of people to have their own custom word.
So that would be like a unique competitive mode for talk about like, what kind of modes can you build if you just white label a glue thing from another country?
8:15
Someone else can do that, too.
But if you The manufacturing capacity that can like on-demand create the word that someone wants you can literally 2x 3x sometimes the price of the thing because it's a unique thing that other people have and the value is there for people.
And so if people could pick the word that they could put on their as whatever word, they wanted to work on that month or something like that and they would get a text.
8:37
I would say, hey, what, where do you want to work on this month?
A text back, it automatically goes to the system and then ships it right out.
So them then that would be a really interesting business model that would have huge Enterprise Value.
You.
So if you're curious a business like that and I would probably ship the no strips with two or three, variations of influencers that I thought were words that their communities Doug.
8:58
So someone sends me Mo Z Nation or someone sends me, you know, Mosey mobiles or you know, SME 500.
Right.
Someone sends me those terms on a strip then it's going to be something.
I'm going to be like, dude this is dope and then because I have such high gross margins, I could say, hey man, I'll give you 40 percent of everything and you don't have to build the business so you can make 40.
9:18
Send Top Line on on all the revenue of this thing, which by the way, if you're taking making your own business, if you ran 40% margins on your own on your own audience, it's a great business anyways.
And so they'd be like, it makes more sense.
Readers work for me because all the commits that capacity I built, and that would be the influence your campaign.
9:35
And so, you think for me, I was able to add a million dollars to business and then you add 100 influencers.
Maybe they're not as big or they're not as no strip Centric.
Like, I am but maybe if they did, I do a tenth of the volume that I could do on average.
Edge.
Then it's 10 times what I'm doing which is 10 million dollars and there's only 40 percent margin to me, right?
9:56
Because I had to give them 40 and there's 20 that was cost mind.
You stop the run the business but let's just keep it simple for now.
So let's cut it that in half again.
So I get another 20% from the 10x volume that I got from them.
So now we're probably looking at a three or four million dollar even a business that is recurring, that is not dependent on one single face that has, very high gross margin so that they can go into new channels.
10:18
Channels that has a unique and competitive mode that allows it to have a premium pricing which I didn't even factor in.
Like if we sold it for 40 rather than 20 and then the final piece is that what would this business to be worth?
So if we're doing four million in ibadah for physical products, business like this on 10 million, top line, or sorry would be more than that Top Line.
10:35
This business would probably be worth somewhere in the 40 to 60 million dollar range.
And so that is a Mosey money business breakdown.
If I were to get into physical products, what I would make and how I would make it to be a cool business.
Amos an Asian quick break.
10:50
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
11:09
And if I was focusing on like a branding perspective of like, what is this going to Encompass?
I would probably go after the entrepreneur Community First because it's obviously community that I have access to, and I think could afford or would be willing to pay a premium price for better nose strips that had the words on them.
But I think the brand would actually be more of a personal development, brand of like, becoming the person you want to be with the daily actions and reminders of who you want to become.
11:33
And so, it's like, you're literally tattooing this thing between your eyes to remind yourself of the person trying to become the Character traits, you're trying to embody.
And so I think that it would really be a very inspirational brand.
And I would probably, cause I want it to be Mass Market.
I would show different walks of life and I would have them working on different problems.
11:52
All right, so I start thinking entrepreneurially because that's me, right?
But also, like, if you have moms and their word is patients, right?
Patients can apply to anyone.
But like, or if you have a prisoner in the prison system, who just gets out is an ex-con, it might be like, forgiveness, you don't have mean.
12:08
And so I think it's It could be a much wider brand, if you focus on the deficiencies that people want to fail.
And then I have to think of some kind of sexy word for the, for the brand name.
But I mean, I don't know, I feel like it'd be something around like better, you know what I mean?
Like, better know, strips or like, be better, be better, nose strips.
12:26
And then something that would that's like short and simple that people could understand and share.
And I think that that could be something that people would get behind because you don't want it to be about Mosey, right?
You don't want it to be about.
Bout you.
You don't want it to be about the founder, you want it to be about the Prospect and more specifically about the problem that were solving and the person that we want to be that they want to become and the promises that were fulfilling.
12:52
And so if you can help someone feel better about who they are, people will pay anything for that feeling.
And so the wedge product, is the idea that we are helping people breathe better but the brand and the promise is About, we're helping people be better, they bias for the breathing.
13:13
They stay for the betterment, they stay for the person.
They're going to become.
And so that's kind of the the two-sided angle that a lot of Brands can accomplish.
And if you're thinking about building your own brand, it's like the fitness space is obviously space.
I have a lot of experience in but like people come for the bikini they say for the community, right?
13:30
I remember a buddy of mine was in the dating space.
He said they come to get laid but they stay for the confidence.
And just for anyone who's feeling their troll Vibes, come the point is not the space.
In focusing on the point is that people come for one thing and they stay for something else.
And I'll tell you a story that changed my life.
13:47
So I had a mentor and he told me this story is called The Garlic and the ham.
He said, there's just a little boy, and he really wants a dog.
So he begs his dad to get him a dog.
So the, you know, after lots and lots of making the dad says, hey if I get you a dog, you're going to be responsible for anything.
14:03
No, I understand.
I'll walk.
Walk it off, he told everything.
So the guy gets the kid a dog.
And so dad's gone on work, whatever rights the kids at home, with his abuela, his grandma.
And he sees one day that the dog has ticks and he's like, oh my God, I'm having to take care of the dog.
14:22
I should have been taken care of this, like, and he goes through Square, when they're freaks out.
He's like, what do I do?
What do I do?
And the grandmother calmly Smiles.
She's like, go feed the dog, some garlic, like, you know, the smell will drive the ticks away and they'll go away.
So she breaks up piece of garlic.
14:37
She hands it to the kid.
He goes in the other room, he tries to feed the dog, the garlic, the dogs, like move it, you know, moving his face around, he doesn't want to eat it right.
If you ever tried to feed a dog, something they don't want.
She goes back to the groomers really obsess.
Like there's even more tips now than there were before like what do I do?
Like she's not eating the garlic.
14:53
She's like did you just try and feed him the garlic?
He was like yeah you told me if you in the college's mijo it's like you don't feed the dog the garlic he's like you got to wrap it in the ham and so she gives him ham and he wraps it in the ham and he goes back to the dog.
The dog eats the garlic few hours later the texture gone.
And so the moral of the story is that you have to give people what they want in order to give them what they need thing.
15:13
They come for is necessarily the thing they stay for.
And if you're thinking about the customer journey and the customer experience, you're trying to bring someone on, we have multiple Transformations, have to occur, we can solve the acute problem of what they're coming for today.
But once we solve that problem, they're going to leave.
Unless we have a broader Journey that they're going to be on, and then some of the best Journeys are the journeys of becoming because they never end.
15:32
And so, if you can take someone under journey of today, I'm going to solve this thing.
But tomorrow, we're going to become something else.
Then they can stay with you again, and again, and again, and people will vote for brands that they believe in because it tells them the things that they want to believe about themselves.
And so, when they pay for the products that they have, they're really buying into the identity, they want to associate with, and want to be.
15:54
And so when they do that, they can continue to pay over and over and over again because it reminds them but who they are.
And so when we're building Brands, if I'm thinking through that applying to physical product finding service etcetera, that's what we want to build.








Company0:00
What's going on, guys?
This is second half of very good podcast that I had with Emmanuel Ebola.
And we he asked me really good question, which is if I went back in time and I had all the resources I had today.
What would I tell myself then to fast-track my success?
And I think it was an interesting answer that a lot of people got good stuff out of we transition to talking about reviews and testimonials and how to stack those to get more.
0:20
People want to buy your stuff.
And then finally, how to leverage those things into getting tons and tons of leads for your business, especially if you are starting out.
And so if you're in any of those positions, hope you enjoy.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:40
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So I mean when now comes to setting these off our rights, you have puts in August.
So far as you know, usually when we say we're on sales calls you basically out once or five since we just wanted to double around 325 since you won't stay on this court, how then do you include all these do just wait for them to get to the point of your objection and then you just did you say I can't No I can't do this then you tell them oh yeah I have a disco ball.
1:07
So is that how you think?
I don't care if you're on a one-on-one selling situation you want to include those bonuses because you want to over deliver.
So if I didn't promise you something and then when you buy it, you get more than I promise to you.
You're happy.
That's the point.
We want, Happy customers.
1:24
If, when we get on the sales call, they there they say, you know, I got to think about it and we would ask the simplest question in all of sales, which is what's your main concern.
What are you afraid of having happened?
If this one poorly, what would that look like?
And what they'll do is they'll tell you what their fears are and then it's up to us to stay totally understand every customer.
1:41
I have is the exact same fears and here's how we make.
Sure that's not going to happen.
Fair enough and we go for the sale, right?
And if they say no, it's like what else is your main concern?
What else you concerned about, right?
And then I'll tell you something else and you're like, totally understand.
So, we did to make sure you do that little quick, anecdote about how we made it and that's how you won't have to struggle with that issue.
1:59
Fair enough and we just keep going back.
Over and over and over again about how we solve the problem and then we present the offer again.
Yeah, and when you are shopping for juice, I just thought.
So if you're doing you are helping them get more customers.
They also working on the outer thighs and how did you call their offers?
2:15
Yellow Jello fires burning them.
Yeah, so for them, I already knew what the offer was open so I already had the best converting offer and I already had all the bonuses made.
So I white labeled all the bonuses that I had spent all my time providing.
So you're like, how am I going to do this work?
I already did the work for you.
I made the grocery list I made the food prep.
2:31
Start.
So it may be the now.
Got it made the, the liquor fingers lunches, The Delectable dinners.
The the banging breakfast, the the Shake died.
I mean, all of those things and I made them for four different weight classes so they had 40 different deliverables that they could just slap their logo on.
And then I made I showed the video on how to slap your logo on this thing so that they can make it easier for them.
2:52
Right.
I provided all that stuff and then I spent my own money, I work the lease myself, I sold them myself and then I taught them how to fulfill those customers in person and I did that for almost two years.
Years.
And this is like, they do it one time and they're like, why am I not Guru?
Well, you have to be really good.
3:08
I think that's probably the reason why ancient in is really important straight really Niche into an avatar that you can really like, you have physically everything laid out for me, I can just program, it makes a lot of sense.
So, basically when you come surprise, okay, I think I've said this already.
3:26
Yeah.
When you said at the beginning of your journey and your business giving out of disgust, yes, The reason your businesses and disgusting because you wanted to make money.
Now, if you have to go back in time was quite a number of years and probably adjust possibly didn't need to make money.
And now you are basically giving you starting with, would you still be put on up with giving it all away to bring back a day.
3:48
With your mind, says, Grant where you are in terms of beauty of business and starting out more.
How would you approach?
It's a great question.
I think that I would more Oakley pivot to where I'm at now?
They probably instead of taking so long to do it.
4:06
But I mean I was so satisfied, my immediate needs.
You don't mean like if I if I need to go make money, I would go make sure that I was that I was making money but I might do it differently and so that's one of the difficulties.
Is that like I have context and skills now that I didn't have when I started, so if I were to start over again, I would probably be able to do things that I didn't know how to do when I started.
4:25
So I would see opportunities in a very different way.
I would know how to build the business so much faster than I did that.
And so, I mean, If you're operating out of scarcity, I completely understand.
I tend to just lean towards stop trying to be cute.
It's not be trying to be fancy and just find, you know, find an avatar that you like and do everything you can to solve their problem, right?
4:44
Everyone just gets so obsessed with the revenue metrics in there.
The other thing that they forget about the customer, so, like, just go crazy on the customer.
And if you can do that, you'll make the money and then the longer you give, before you ask the more money you'll make.
And I'll tell you A big wealth secret if you give enough.
5:01
You don't ever have to ask people just come to you and they'll give to you without you ever asking is to method on the jab.
Jab jab.
Right?
Right.
I mean dirty talk about too, so it's not just me, like, he talks about it as he's mentioned this.
So it's not, it's not me saying anything else in the name, but if you just give more.
5:19
And so, the real real is, if you can satisfy your immediate needs, right?
You can satisfy your meeting needs for food and shelter, if you can take a longer-term perspective, you will win much better much faster because Goodwill.
Multiplies faster than revenue.
And so you want to hold back that ask as long as humanly possible and if you do hold it back as long as humanly possible, you'll be surprised that you will monetize without even needing to try.
5:42
This is just my first-hand experience with this and you might be like Alex, sure.
You can say that now because you've XYZ and sure, right.
I can't have a long-term perspective because I don't need, I don't need any of that stuff, but I'm telling you it is a better business strategy, like it is.
And that's why you look at the biggest companies, the world to give it gives so much value for free, and they find otherwise monetizing.
6:01
I like good Gmail.
It's free.
Like, how crazy is that?
It's free.
They made Gmail for free, right?
Google.
We could use it for free.
We get to use YouTube for free.
It's nuts, right?
They find other ways to monetize it.
6:17
So, that's kind of the idea here is.
I like, and a lot of times when people are starting out, they're afraid of giving their secret sauce away and the answer is, you should always just give away as much as humanly can and I know that I'm giving away the quote, right amount when I'm afraid of how much value.
Like if you're not afraid of how much you're giving away, it's not like you should have anxiety.
6:38
Awesome.
Someone is asking that.
I think I'll just take these to the, you know, passive letter that my shipment said how do you hundred clients on cost asking for testimonial or references for a new sofa?
And you know, basically I think that's basically trying to convince them that the likelihood of results.
6:56
Hi.
But this time is a new of our.
So how do you usually do frame with that howdy?
In this business, you run a beta group.
I mean, it seems to me that's the bike.
If you've never done it before, the don't promise something, go take 20 people and say I'll do it for free as long as you give me a testimonial and you give me Fair feedback, so I can help you throughout this process.
7:15
I mean, I spent two years to going from gym to gym for no money so I can, like I lived this people do it for a month.
I did it for two years, you know?
I'm just I'm just putting perspective on this like The Wider, the base of the pyramid, which is the foundation that you decide to lay in terms of the depth of your scale.
7:31
Well the taller the peak is for fear of sounding trite.
There's no there's no shortcut like the height of your pyramid will be determined by your skill set the depth of your skilled, the depth of your roots that you've planted.
And the depths comes from repetition, it comes from volume that comes from scale, it comes from time, rise time under the bar, a lot of people start willing to do that and that's why most people won't achieve level success.
7:53
They do that.
They want it so bad, they're not willing to wait.
But the only way to get it is to wait long enough that it becomes inevitable.
Yeah.
I mean sometimes I still have my reasons.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Used to hearts with us as strong as of times because I mean you really have to cover the views are no rules.
8:13
Just because the comparison though, it's not actually hard to wait.
You know, my dad said this to me and I think there's, there's some waste a minute.
He said, you know what, no matter how much money you make.
He said, chicken tastes like chicken and rice.
Tastes like rice, nothing changes.
It's just, it's just people feel like they're cool falling behind from some dude, on Instagram is probably lying right now.
8:31
Like in my stuff, some people compared to their numbers to my numbers and like how many years have you been in business right now?
My current advice to you is Jason three years, right?
So for context my third year in business, they going to be fifty thousand dollars.
8:47
My fourth year business.
I made fifty thousand dollars and so EI.
Like there we see what we're doing now and they're like oh my God like let's put almost a decade, you know, and like we're now just receiving some level of notoriety and candidly The other part of it is that we made our money doing the thing, rather than teaching, how to do this.
9:06
And I think that's lost a lot of people ever get to 10,000 a month and immediately makes the course into how to make 10,000 a month, rather than why don't you go to 100,000 a month?
I don't go to a million about why don't you just keep doing the thing that you're doing, Russians?
I think I'll just probably take this one as a last question.
9:22
So and says how I said virtual assistants, how do you position agencies will high-paying clients?
So you have any specific unique answer to that.
That.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, share it on Instagram or something like that.
9:41
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
10:01
Well, I think that would be a business model question too.
So you know there's a number of different models you can do there, you could specialize in creating one specific type of service provider.
So let's say you were like I will train people on how to run ads and so you say, hey I'll give you a media buyer for, you know, ten thousand dollars one-time, it'll be fully trained and after that it's only, you know, two hundred bucks a month or whatever you know, whatever.
10:22
That the income of the VA is right.
That would be one model.
You know, another model could be the same concept in terms of what you do.
But you might monetize by saying hey you can pay me Thousand dollars a month and I'll assign you a full-time wrap.
And you pay $200 a month of the person the whole time.
And as long as they stay an employee of that of that company, that becomes a staffing play from like you're becoming a staffing company, for payroll.
10:41
That has very, very good.
Enterprise Value as really good stick rates for the most part as long as the people are good.
So again, if you have a high level of skill, you can teach people the high level skill, which means that you can sell the high level skill on their behalf to other people for more money, if you are not that skilled, you will not be able to teach a high level of skill and so they won't be able to sell a high level.
11:00
Vo.
Skill on their behalf so it all comes still back.
Like what's the value that we can provide and the better you can get at both acquiring the skill for yourself and teaching the skill in a replicable way.
Then if you do that, then you're always be provide value, right?
Because you're helping this person who's the VA get probably better income, they would normally be able to get, you're going to help the business owner, get labor for lower than they normally would be able to.
11:22
And there's this nights Delta of room and that's where you can extract the value that you want for yourself for connecting the tip.
Also just I've heard you say this bicycle phone right away recently about the five different channels of degeneration and talk about one media and media.
11:39
Six straight up six.
Yeah, when we that Nvidia, paid traffic, you know, Outreach and referrals and talk about five of them in via, won't be quadratic.
No Sonya is asking about organic markets and how you feel about.
11:55
So I feel that maybe you could just elaborate on that loosens sure.
So, like you may notice that there's a lot of ways to acquire customers, right?
And he's the strategies is pros and cons.
If you're at zero to a million you just need to pick one.
You have to pick one and become a master at it because that's you, when you're starting out, you have no leverage once you get higher up, you'll still probably need to learn a second, one or scale that one even higher 2, maybe 3 million a year.
12:21
And then, at that point, you have enough leverage from a monetary perspective that you can find someone who's good at another Channel.
Bring them in, and then have them build out a second Channel.
And then, find someone else who's good at it and build out another Channel.
You can't try and pay someone to learn it.
That's a dumb idea.
Find someone has already done it for a business that similar to yours to then have the build out that team on that channel.
12:39
So in terms of what am I feeling is an organic marketing.
I mean I'm a huge fan if you're very good Kylie Jenner its work great for Kim, Kardashian's were great for Rihanna is for great for, right?
So if you have, if you have star power, you're good on camera or you look amazing or you have your amazing a delivering content and the way that you define that as if you make stuff and people share it and subscribe.
13:00
Your Channel or follow you or download your podcast, then you're good at it, if you do it, and none of that happens.
Then you're not that good at it.
And so, I think that the lesson, at least for the organic stuff is, you can start investing in that stuff now, because in time, you'll get better at it, it'll be a hockey stick for 2 years, 3 years, nothing will happen.
13:18
And then all of a sudden you'll get good enough.
After you make a hundred videos or 200 videos, 300 videos, you'll learn your voice, learn how to speak.
You'll learn your key is, and you'll start to really develop something that becomes more interesting to an audience, right?
It's okay to suck.
I think everybody does.
Of themselves mr.
Stark but in terms of Speed, The Money Paid traffic is the fastest.
13:36
It also requires the most skill and requires Capital, so not everyone's in that situation.
So if you're looking for the cheapest fastest, then you're pretty much left with three channels, right?
Which is going to be your owned media, which is all the contacts.
You already have in your cell phone, your followers on Instagram, your friends on Facebook, all those people have given you permission to access them.
13:57
So that's the fastest and cheapest and probably highest likely to success.
For most people who are starting out, you probably have between all those at least 2,000 people who between all the sources.
I just said that doesn't even include a customer list just just that.
So it's 2,000 people can reach out to.
If you reach out to a hundred people a day, it would take you 20 days just to get through the list once.
14:15
So you can have multiple runs at that list and you probably have enough cash flow to experience to then go to either cold outbound because you learn enough from the warm to extrapolate it to cold which would be a second way which is fast in terms of like you can, you can make some money and it costs you very little because it's Your time but scaling, it requires people.
14:33
So you have two people doing that five people doing that. 20 people doing outbound on your behalf.
The next way is Affiliates and that's probably like if I had to start over tomorrow and I had to make a ton of money, he would be, how do I find partners that already have my client base that I can tap into and create some sort of value proposition to them, to make it away.
14:52
And so my last two companies were off that strategy your I mean, so my supplement companies based on affiliate Network.
It's not, it's not only direct response.
So how do I feel about organic?
If you're good at it, it's worth it takes time and if you need to feed yourself today, I would do that.
So that eventually you'll get the dividends but I would still like your money is going to be like, make sure you don't get obsessed with that.
15:12
I would say, take the two hours a week, do the do the two or three videos or podcasts, or whatever it is you want to do.
And then the remainder of your week is focus on making money, ask about Facebook, Bruce, Facebook, groups are fine.
It's just if it's a version of poner earned media, and also, on you next, we'll call me nosy. 100 under a lot of situation or, which of them is that the general?
15:34
Yeah, I think it'll be a leader.
I think we generate should be number two and then the third would be money models, which is kind of the original is called monetization structures.
But I have a feeling that doesn't sound as sexy as many models, so I'll call it money models but it's basically all the different ways that you can structure offers to monetize off promotions.
15:50
And so there's 19 different offer structures that I have in the book.
It's one of the ones that are actually the most afraid of publishing.
It was the first book I wrote Because I say it's like the stuff that I got the most about, but I'm I'm not sure if it's going to be too dense, so I might have to figure out how to make it really readable for people because it's offer accommodations how to sell continuity downstairs upstairs.
16:11
Like all the different kind of like metrics and things like that, that you need to look at, but I'm not sure if it's going to be too boring.
So I'm trying to make it really interesting.
All right yeah, I'm pissed about six more.
So he sends in 90 put out.
I think I think I was 10 in total.
16:27
I know the first six and I'm sure that At once I write the 6, I'll probably have three or four more that I'll come out of it, but it'll be.
So we have offers first, we'll have lead generation second.
I think money models will be third, sales will be fourth sales, teams will be fifth, increasing lifetime, gross profit per customer will be six, I'll probably come up with a sex, your name for that, but that's what it is.
16:48
Is making more per customer and then I'll probably end up making some sort of one around money just money in general money, beliefs wealth stuff.
I'll probably make something around buying and selling businesses and so, Let it evolve over time.
But the first, the first six are pretty, pretty clearly defined already have those wire framed out in the first.
17:06
The next two books are already pretty much written.
I just have to go back over them and re-edit them and try and simplify them and make them easier to read and put more pictures than all that stuff.
So I would just like to know what's next for you.
Maybe next, you know, after you're done with all of these, you know, books, I know what's next well it'll probably take me a few years.
17:30
I mean, Acquisition.com and the courses and books that are going to come out for free from there.
That's kind of just a passion work.
I'll probably continue to do that as I acquire more skills.
And as beliefs change, I'll probably also update some of them in re-release, a few of them.
It's like they change substantially or My Views develop on them.
17:46
But the face that I'm entering is, I'm trying to just deploy Capital into small businesses.
So, you know, three five, ten, twenty million dollar businesses and you know, invest in them in the entrepreneurs and then also, you know, use the resources that I have, the connections that I have And then, you know, whatever strategic insights, I can provide to help them grow.
18:04
So, that's pretty much what I think my foreseeable future is going to be, is that?
And then there's crime.
I'll probably layer in a strong element of philanthropy beyond the obvious of just giving away everything for free for everyone who's not a company that I own.
So that's just kind of.
So, that's, that's where it's at.
18:21
And I think that, you know, Layla and I have the goal of giving away more than as being a couple that gave the most.
And so that's, that's, you know, I don't know if we'll ever achieve that, but that is the That is go.
We have because the end of the day, like there's one thing to hold it all.
And then donate a bigger numbers, I think will be better at allocating Capital than maybe a charity would be.
18:38
But, you know, in some ways it's like, what's the point of accumulating at all?
Then dying giving it away.
It's like, I almost rather, I'd rather give Less in an absolute amount of and enjoy the benefit.
But then I think is that me being selfish.
So, I go through all of these different different versions of the same thing.
Then I'm like, what does it matter if I'm being selfish?
18:53
Because it won't matter.
Anyways, so anyway, that's where I where I head off into thanks so much.
Thank you.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The reason that like a lot of the wealth in the world, World sits with financiers just because they can say hey man just give me a billion dollars and I'll just make you ten percent a year on it and they know how to make 15% a year and they make that extra five on a billion and they take home 50 million a year and they're like works for me.
0:45
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to Burger business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond if you share and enjoy, So I was at dinner the other night with a business owner, who's doing five million dollars a year, Top Line about two million dollars a year in profit and she was talking about how she was think about moving to Puerto Rico.
1:10
She went there, it sucked.
And now she was living in a higher tax state and she's like, I would live in California but like I just want to pay the taxes and I was like why not to say that?
I think you should pay taxes.
I mean you should pay your taxes boy big.
I was like why?
1:25
And she's like well I want to I want to hit this net worth goal.
I was like okay, how do You think that happens?
And so she walked through, she's like, well, you know, I'm going to take the money out of the, you know, the business that two million dollars that I made in profit and, you know, pay my taxes.
So I'll have one point to left and then I'll, you know, invest that in like real estate and stocks and crypto and things like that.
1:45
And that's how I'll build my wealth.
And I got this big creepy grin on my face because I was like, all right, we're about to have a discussion right now and I thought you guys would find this valuable and so I'm calling this how to make a billion dollars and I want to call it that because I didn't.
2:00
And how to make a billion dollars for a very, very long time.
And so, if you see billionaires like I did, I was like, man.
I want to be a billionaire someday.
Most people, myself included.
Don't even know how to make a billion dollars.
And so I want to walk you through how to actually make a billion dollars.
And the first misunderstanding is that you don't make a billion dollars to become a billionaire.
2:19
You own stuff that's worth a billion dollars to become a billionaire.
And so let me walk you through how I used to think this worked.
All right?
So phase one, high school, Alex, I was like, okay, in order to be a billionaire, I have to make a billion dollars every year.
2:36
That was in my mind what I thought being a billionaire met, I think you make a billion dollars every year which is ridiculous.
But that's what I thought and so that's maybe it's you you're not ridiculous this gay.
I thought the same thing.
The second phase I was like oh silly High School Alex.
That's not how you make a billion dollars.
All you have to do is take home to billion dollars before taxes over, you know, your lifetime.
2:56
And then you'd have, you know, half that after taxes or two billion dollars after taxes.
If saved up would be a billion dollars, right now that didn't account for anything that you would invest in or any kind of compounding.
But I just figured if I make two billion, even if I suck at investing, I would have a billion dollars left over and that was honestly what I thought for years like as a small business owner.
3:17
Even and so then enter the kind of the third season, which is where I'm at right now in terms of how to make a billion dollars and you don't make it you own it and so here's how.
So I'm going to give a simple example and then we'll expand it out.
So it makes more Or sense.
So let's say you own a business that is making ten million dollars a year, Top Line.
3:36
All right now, half of that, is your profits.
This is what I get to take home is the five million dollars.
Now, if this company is worth ten times its earnings and I'll explain why the, the why a company like, this might be worth ten times its earnings, but let's just say it's worth ten times its earnings.
It means that this business is a 50 million dollar business maybe for you.
3:53
It's 50.
There you go.
Is it 50 million dollar business?
Okay, now let's say after taxes, I got my five million after As I take home, you know, three like okay, cool.
Alex has three million dollars that he can go in crypto mine and and by airbnb's and stocks and real estate all the stuff, right?
4:10
So I get 3 million dollars richer good for me next year because up cuz im a I'm in Mosey nation and we focus on the main asset that we have our business and not all the side hustles and I've really focused on my business and I go from five million dollars a year in profit 26 million dollars a year in profit doesn't sound like a huge win rhymes like hey I did a million bucks the bottom line.
4:26
Cool, this is great.
Well, if we have a 10x multiple Then something I own went from being worth, 50 million to being worth 60 million because 10x on the extra one added 10 million dollars.
Now, I own 100 percent of that thing and I just got something that appreciated by ten million dollars that I didn't pay tax on, wait a second.
4:47
But what I got out of the business only went from three to three and a half million after taxes, right?
Six at 40%, you get three and a half to take home and so I only made an extra five hundred thousand dollars after taxes this year.
Now You made an extra ten million dollars after taxes because the thing that you own appreciated by ten million dollars and that's the thing that I didn't understand for very long time.
5:11
And so now, let's zoom out.
You want to be a billionaire again, it's not by me.
Side hustling my way to a billion like Zuckerberg didn't have airbnb's.
He was flipping on the side while he's building Facebook.
What did you do?
Become a billionaire, he built Facebook.
All right, so if you have the opportunity to spend And half of your time.
5:31
Obsessing about your passive income rather than saying, huh, I wonder if I could take my five million dollar profit, business focus, all my attention on it, and make it into a six million dollar profit business.
And then all of a sudden I just added 10 million dollars, my net worth, how much would you have had to do with that?
5:48
Three million dollars, they took on last year, in order to get 10 million.
After taxes, in the appreciation that you're going to have over there.
You'd have to be a remake or you'd have to do it full time.
Oh wait, you already have?
An asset that you have that you're working on full-time.
And so this is how billion dollars actually is made.
6:05
Which is realistically owned?
You have something that makes between 80 and 100 million dollars in ibadah or fancy word for profit?
Just leave it at that that you get a multiple Lon, all right?
And usually companies have that size tend to treat it 15 times earnings.
6:21
Like if you look at the S&P 500 companies that that size traded 15 times, all right?
So you really only need somewhere in, they have like 70 million dollars in ibadah.
To be a billionaire because you own the company.
And so let's break it down.
So it means that you have to make a little bit more than 1.3 million dollars, 1.5 million dollars per week and take home as we see.
6:42
Like that's it which I know that.
That sounds crazy but like you have to think in increments like there's probably a time if you're listening to this right now five years ago like imagine how much you made five years ago as an entrepreneur number that number is, how crazy small is that feel to you now?
6:58
Right?
We're like, oh my God, I could do that.
In two seconds because you've leveled up.
And so as much as whatever number, I just said to, you might sound like a lot, five years from now.
You might be in shooting distance, right?
And so it's really just about understanding.
Like how do I reverse engineer?
What has to happen and if you want to be a billionaire, it's like okay well how to make a million dollars, 1.5 million dollars a week in profit.
7:17
Well, if I'm running a 30% margin business, I got to make six million dollars a week.
There's 52 weeks I got make 300 million dollars, Top Line.
Okay, so, $300, Top Line.
So how does so then you can start actually putting tangible goals to this?
Idea.
That used to be amorphous to you about.
I want to become a billionaire, you become a billionaire by owning something, worth a billion dollars.
7:38
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
7:54
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
If you really want to be smart about it, you don't shoot for billion.
8:11
Here's why you want to shoot for 10 billion or 50 billion.
And I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I get asked every day.
Hey, if I want to make six figures, what do I do?
And I gave this answer on a podcast and I think that I probably pissed off half the audience, but I hope that you can take something from it because the guy said, how do you, how do you make a hundred grand a year?
8:36
And my literal first, it was wide, sell something worth 100 Grand and then figure out what I would do with the rest of my ear, right?
But realistically, I would never imagine trying to pursue an opportunity that was capped at a hundred million dollars a year because it's so much easier to try and make a 10 million dollar per your business.
8:54
And then and what happens is you think in different orders of magnitude you think, in bigger measuring units because if you have to think about that, then you're rounding error.
Was your goal.
And so if you want to become a billionaire, what happens is, you were Engineer, like I just did.
9:10
How did you have to do three?
Three hundred million dollars in top-line revenue and you'll take home 70ish million at a 15 x, multiple, and now you're a billionaire, right?
But if you were to think, how do I do three billion dollars a year in Revenue in order to make seven hundred million dollars a year?
9:27
You would have to think about opportunities.
That one we're not limited by your time to could serve a very big Marketplace.
Three had very high, gross, margins, that would allow you to scale, and for you'd think probably in a very, very long time, right?
Aizen and then all of a sudden you're thinking, like, a billionaire.
And so the reason that the goals we have matter matter more because of how we measure them and the increments in which we used to build them more than what the actual goal itself is.
9:52
And so when someone tells me they have a goal to make six figures, what happens is they're going to think that six figures is the cap and they're going to break it down in a tiny itty-bitty units.
And they're going to basically say 100% of my effort equals one hundred thousand dollars and they're going to measure in tiny units.
And then they're going to do what hundred percent effort and they're going to be like I was at 94 this year because they weren't 100 out of 100 to get that hundred K.
10:13
But if you thinking about making ten million dollars you'll thinking like okay for me to make 10 million dollars, I got to sell.
Let's say a ten thousand dollar thing and I got to solve thousand of them.
Okay.
That means three ten thousand other things today.
Okay, wait, three, ten thousand other things today that if I close one out of three calls, that means I have to take nine calls a day.
10:33
Okay.
Well, how much do I have to spend to get a call for this thing?
All of a sudden, you start, In a much bigger increment and if you're like I don't know what I could sell for ten thousand dollars.
Well then you got to figure out something that makes someone else a hundred thousand dollars and you can sell something that's worth 10 and so their end of the day, the reason I make enough money is because you don't know how to provide enough value.
10:52
If you can make somebody a million dollars to pay, you 100 Grand all day, right?
And then how many of those things that you just sold for 100k?
Do you need to add up to make your ten million dollars to make your fifty million dollars?
The reason that like a lot of the wealth in the world sits with financiers just because they know how to take someone, Passively and they can say hey man just give me a billion dollars and I'll just make you ten percent a year on it and they know how to make 15% a year and they make that extra five on a billion and they take home 50 million a year and they're like works for me, right?
11:22
So they know how to provide that value.
And so, if you can approach the problem that way, you'll start thinking more along the lines of the people that I think you're trying to emulate.
And so, I wanted to break this down about how to make a billion dollars, because there were so many Two misconceptions around it, you don't make it.
11:39
You own it you get paid for what you do you get Returns on what you own.
Right?
And the only reason that this even makes sense and I'll round this off for for anybody who's curious about the math behind this that 50 million dollar business that we talked about before ten million 5 million profit 10x.
11:55
Why would someone pay 10x or something?
You're like, I wouldn't pay fifty million dollars for business.
It's making five.
Let me tell you why you what?
So if that base is went from 5 to 6 and then when 20% again because I was a 20% growth with 27 points And then 20% again would be eight point six and twenty percent again would be nine point, whatever, whatever it is 10.2 you and keep going, right?
12:20
And then 12 12 .48 in earnings right now.
If you add it all those things up, you'd be at 40-ish million in earnings over the next five years.
Alright so 40 million got taken out of the business.
Remember we bought it for 50 but wait.
Now we still own the thing and it's making 12 and a half million in profit.
12:37
Wait, if we just apply 10x and realistically, at this point is probably closer to 12 x but let's just do apply 10x for this.
Now, we have 125 million dollar thing that we paid 50 for that already paid us 40 back.
That now is worth 125, and this is where it gets even juice here to buy that 50 million dollar thing.
12:58
I don't write a check for 50.
I wrote a check for 15 and I took a loan for 35, huh?
And so then, at the end of this whole thing, I put my 15 million down.
I pay back my loan for the 35, which by the way, I could pay it back just from the 40 million that got made.
13:15
So I actually was 55 up on my on my original 15, right?
So only have 10 million dollars left over that.
I gotta I gotta pay back and now I get 100% of that 125 million that that got made - my original 10 because I covered five of it from, from the cash flow.
13:33
Oh, I just made a hundred and twenty million dollars off of 15 million dollar original investment.
That's why people do it.
So even at that kind of valuation, that's why it still, makes sense for people to buy those levels.
And the thing is, is that the smart money if you want to sell to institutional investors, they think that way.
13:49
And so you have to think that way about the assets that you own in the assets that you're building.
So that that is like, ultimately how you can make huge leaps in wealth, right.
And so, anyways, I had a lot of misconceptions about how billion dollars was made.
And because it's owned and you become the person who owns the thing and setting the goals in such a way that you're not even, just trying to hit a billion, you're trying to hit 10 billion or try to hit 50 billion.
14:11
Because then you think in increments that will more than likely not take 100% of your effort to get 100% of your goal.
But 100% of your effort, far, surpasses your goal and you hit it, 20% of the way up.
So most Nation, love you all see you next bit.

I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
This is for every 17 year-old 16 year old 18 years old, 19 year old.
0:54
Who's considering going to college or quitting college right now?
Either?
They're going to do it, they're thinking about doing there in it and they want to leave, or you're somebody who knows somebody who's in that situation or you're the parent of someone who's facing that decision.
All right, I want to give you context for the decision so that you can make one that's less emotional and less for the wrong reasons, and ideally for the right reasons, okay?
1:14
So the reason I wanted to make this as because there is an 18 year old neighbor of mine, who, after going through his first semester of college, And I had some rapport with them came back.
Home was like, I don't know if I like this.
I don't know if this is for me, we went on a one-hour walk that I think changed his life.
All right, and he went from going to Pepperdine was really expensive School in San Diego to dropping out.
1:32
All right, his friends, his family, his friends parents started looking at him different.
He was like the troubled child.
He's like the I don't know about him, right?
Kid, two years later, he now has two hundred fifty thousand dollars saved up as a 20 year old.
Okay, he makes just under two hundred thousand dollars a year makes two hundred thousand dollars a year right now as a sales guy All right, and what I want to do is break down the split in the road of two different lives that he could have lived or that you could live or that somebody that you know who's facing the decision.
2:04
Could go through.
All right.
And I'll tell you how the conversation I had with him went.
Okay, so I said, listen, you're at a crossroads right now and there's we have Crossroads everyday in our lives.
I was like, what some Crossroads are bigger than others.
And when you're trying to make a decision, you have to think how reversible is this decision, right?
2:20
And how much?
In fact, his death, if I'm choosing between Chinese and Mexican for lunch, it's a split in the road but it's not really irreversible.
In terms of the calories, I got to eat and it's really not going to affect much for me down the road.
So I don't need to put resources towards it but like choosing to go and commit four years of my life between 50 and 200 thousand dollars of money and the lost income that I would have made during that period of time.
2:44
Those are very big, very irreversible decisions and they need to be treated with the same amount of respect and a lot of people.
Don't because they make that decision because their parents are telling them to, which seems like the overused one, but realistically, because they just, they don't want to be the kid who did it wrong, right?
3:00
Who didn't do what they were supposed to do, and didn't do the next natural step for the same reason.
People have kids.
Same reason, people get married.
Same reason people buy houses because they think it's the next natural thing to get there.
Like, I guess this is what I do.
Now, that's a terrible reason to go to college.
All right, what I want you to do, I don't care what you do, but in terms of, I would like you to approach it with a decision making framework.
3:20
That makes sense, okay.
So it starts with this is me telling him this.
I was like what problem are you solving, right?
Whenever you make a big decision and I think what problem by solving he's like well I want to make mine was like okay.
So the question is for years from now if you have a degree and you and that's what you have and you lost the money and you lost the earning potential you had during those four years, I was like, is that you more able to generate income, then I will turn it in view because we have to analyze is not the cost of college, but the opportunity cost of going to college, I'll Define it for you.
3:51
The opportunity to cost is the loss of potential gain from other Alternatives, when one alternative is chosen.
So, when we choose to go to college, There's an opportunity cost that exists.
It's the cost of not doing of what you could have done in the meantime and it is the single greatest cost of people do not take into consideration.
4:08
If you spend four years versus starting a business and then four years later, the opportunity cost is the business.
You could have started and what you would have for years later.
Okay, that makes sense.
All right, I'll give you more details.
So I'm walking with him and this is like a one-hour, really in-depth.
Like this is Like deeper than he.
And I have been, because I'm still this neighbor from across the street that, like, makes money on the internet, right?
4:26
But his parents like, trusted me enough to be like, you know, I know that you have a lot of influence over our son and like we just want you to know that like we know you do.
And so like, please be careful and I was like, I'm aware.
He's in good hands.
Don't be afraid for what I'm going to tell your son and so I said, listen, if you want to make money then you need income generating skills, okay.
4:45
And do you think your Philosophy degree your sociology degree your psychology degree?
Your Your economics degree even which is still a little more useful is going to give you actual skills to make money.
He was like I don't know and so I'm here to tell you what actually makes money and so if Alex were redoing the education system, the majors would be in accordance to the Department's of a business.
5:09
You'd have marketing and it would have the actual ways to Market which is creating the materials of marketing.
And then how to distribute it, you'd have sales, which is how to get people to how to get strangers to give you money.
You'd have the delivery portion, which would be the Either physical products delivery or Services delivery, which would be customer experience.
5:25
Customer success, customer support, like all around that or it be technical specific is in like electrician plumber, lawn mower, whatever it is.
And the amount of time that it takes to train it like to teach someone to be an amazing like Lawn Care person probably takes only four weeks and if that if you're like really offended by that, I'm sorry.
5:44
But that's also why the marketplace pays what it pays for that that skill, right?
It doesn't take a long time to learn it, but if people deliberately learned it before, we could probably be much better than people that they're hiring off the straight.
Interesting, right.
So then you have the actual technical component of the services delivered, and then you have the supporting services which are like, Finance HR, legal, banking, Etc.
6:02
So, all of these things would be supporting right, those business functions.
And in my opinion, those would be the things that people should major in because those are things that you're going to get hired to do, right?
So if you're like, well, Alex, there's a big disconnect between what they're teaching and what I actually need to do to make money.
Great observation if you like, but there are things that like if I'm a doctor or a lawyer, you need a degree.
6:21
Sure, but for the 99% of people who don't fall into the six, fucking careers that you have to have one, right?
Get over it.
Google stopped, requiring a college degree.
All the major big Tech corporations, have stopped it because they realized the to that it's not value additive.
All right.
So zooming, back out.
I'm walking the street, we're talking together and like, okay, so we know what this path looks like.
6:42
And I told him this line, I said the world doesn't need another 31 business degree from Pepperdine like another be student who graduates because he didn't really give a shit, right?
He would just do good enough that he would get through and at this is what he brought up.
He's like.
But what about like the social experience of college I was like so, do you think that if you don't go to college you're not going to be able to party with people who are your age.
7:03
I was like real talk and he was like well like kind of like bro.
I fucking promise you if you want to go to Europe for four years, you know what I mean?
Like if that's the if the problem to be solved is to socialize you.
There are way more efficient ways to socialize you than spending two hundred thousand dollars and not making income.
7:20
You can work All day.
And then make my objective for this period of time to have fun, then fucking work all day and then literally go out every single night and you'll end up debt-free with savings and have a hell of a crazy for stories and that's fine if that's what you want to do.
Those things that what you want to do is like know.
7:37
And I think at some point in the conversation is like I kind of want to do what you do and I was like, dude, I fucking ate shit.
You know what I mean?
And the thing is, and here's the, there's a crush of people like, Alex, went to Vanderbilt, I graduated a year early so I try to get out as fast as I possibly could.
And one of the regrets that I have right, is that I could have started sooner, right?
7:56
I wish I could have done that but I can't write, I can't go back and so like you don't need to live the mistakes in order to like you don't need the scars, you just need the story, right?
If I give you the story, you don't need this car.
You can learn the lesson without having the experience.
All right?
And so when I see the guys who are starting at 18, I'm like man, I wish I had started then rather than 23.
8:15
I would have five more years.
I've been five years ahead at where I am right now, right?
And so he said why can't I want to do what you do?
And it's like, well, then you gotta learn this.
That it took that I had to start fucking five years older than you to start learning.
Right.
And the first thing was you to learn how to sell.
And so I was like, let's just point let's just go down that path and if you're like well I don't like sales.
8:32
I told you all the other departments that you could you could you could focus on feel like, you know I like being behind a camera then cool.
What do you think behind a camera means in a business behind?
A camera means you're making content.
You're making commercials pick one.
That's it.
Like that's what you're doing.
You're either making content or you making commercials that interrupts content.
8:48
That's what video is used for, right?
If you're like I like right.
In words.
What do you think writing words are used for in business?
They're used to sell shit or deliver ship.
That's it or legal to protect people from selling and delivering, shh.
It's what it is right?
And like, well, I don't know.
I like dealing with people.
It's like, well, it depends.
9:04
Are you little bit more aggressive?
You might like sales if you're a little bit more passive ish, and I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
You might like more of like the HR we might like, recruiting right?
My like that side of HR which is the route that Talent side rather than the sale side of like the business.
You might, like selling people rather than selling products, different ways to thinking about it, right?
9:21
And so you can take your skills and then bucket them into which of these departments, make more sense and then that's what I'm going to focus on.
Okay, zooming back out.
So I said now we need to look at your 31 degree two hundred thousand dollars of debt for years later verses four years from now, you're going to have saved money this whole period of time.
9:40
So he's living with four guys because I was like dude you're living cheap that's how this works and so he saves everything over two thousand dollars a month that he makes.
All right, and home, he's now making 200,000 a year so he saves a lot.
Of money, which is why he is 250,000 are saved up at 20.
Like that's not from Alex, do anything.
9:56
Like he works for it.
He worked for and he saved every dollar that he made.
He's got more money than some of the adults in that business.
A lot of the adults that business, why?
Because he saves everything and what do you think he's gonna be able to do in four years as you people start his own thing with a ton of capital and skills.
Okay.
10:11
So as we're walking through these four years, what we think happens now, right?
So he's like, I really like sales now, he had now he happened to have Like sales and the blessing that he got was he had a mentor, which obviously was me.
10:28
Who I could see his personality.
I was like, dude, I think you do well here.
I thought, like, I think this is where you should start looking.
I think you'll like it and he did like he did well.
But if he was that camera guy and he really liked more of that stuff, or if he was really techie out to be like, dude, go go start coding.
Like, if you use spending, you know all night like, you know, on GitHub learning different, you know, little little hacks and coding things like I'm clearly, not that guy, whatever, that is right, then I'd be like, all right, well, you've got two directions here.
10:54
You can either go on like the weaponized marketing side of town.
Tech or you go on the products out of tech which is developing apps and developing story or soft or a big company.
Like those are your paths.
So, pick the one you like or you go again defense, cyber security Etc.
And so all of like you have this base skill.
It's like, where do I want to apply for?
11:10
Like, I don't know.
You're never going to know because how would, you know, you know, by starting and then you'll gain context to make the decision later.
Right?
And the thing is, people think that it's the fallacy of the right path.
There's no such thing because you can't go backwards and so, all, you know, is the experiences you have.
11:27
And so all you have to do is just always look around every so often be like, have I learned everything that I'm going to learn from this path from this branch and if you've learned everything you're going to learn then at that point you can make the pivot, right?
But if you're like, dude, there's still a lot for me to learn.
Okay.
Do I want to learn that?
11:43
Is it the direction I want to keep going?
I more when I did my first years of Consulting, I look down the road, 25 years.
I was, like, I don't want that life.
And so, I pivot and I was like, okay, I'm going to go to Business School.
But I was a little bit a little bit wiser.
At this point I was like okay business school is like 180 Grand in opportunity cost in terms of just money that I wouldn't make plus the money that it cost.
12:01
And so my reasoning at that time, the reason I started a business was that I looked at that two years was like man for 180 Grand.
I know that two years from now.
If I took that 180 and I started a business again, I didn't have the 180 to be clear.
I would have had to take a loan out to do it.
I was like, if I had that same 182 years from now I'd probably have a business that was working and I'd still have the money.
12:22
And so to me, I was like, you know, I make no money, I'll be less than 180 thousand dollars in debt and I'll have learned probably the same amount.
So this was the conversation.
I was having with him and so ultimately this is this is a hack that I will give you four.
Very big decisions is that you want to keep thinking on it, keep chewing on it, keep digesting it until you can get into a single statement which is for him.
12:43
Do I think that for years from now path?
A will get me to a place where I will be able to have more income generation than I have.
From path, B.
That is it, that is the decision for years, from now, given the cost, which of these two paths will give me the most potential for my future and he was like, well, I think the other one I was like, the what you gonna do?
13:06
So you decided to drop out in the end going to sales and he was terrified and again, in the beginning, he sucked it sales because he had never done it before.
Of course you would suck and of course you will suck too, because you haven't done it.
But how do you think you could good?
You start by sucking and then you suck less.
13:22
That's how it works right?
Till eventually you look back after hundreds and hundreds and thousands of repetitions and you're like I'm actually pretty good at this and it's reasonable that you good be good because you've done it a thousand fucking times, right?
And so, anyways, he's going down that path, he likes sales, it's probably going to be the direction that he takes directionally his life.
13:37
Now what are the adjacent skills he needs?
Because you asked me this question now he's two years.
Then you got two and three thousand saved up, he's like, what do I need to learn now?
So it's like, okay, how do you move up?
So I can start a business.
I was like, yeah, I was like, what are you what skills do you need to start a business?
He's like, well, I got to know how to Market.
I was like, we already Of cold calls.
13:53
Like that's your first acquisition channels.
We got that handle which is why I put them their rights because I knew that's where he was going.
It's like.
Okay, so I have that so I can get customers.
All right.
And I know how to sell, so I got that.
I was like, we're going to deliver.
It's like, well, I really do like teaching sales.
I was like, well, who the fuck have you taught sales to?
He's like, I guess I haven't.
14:08
I was like hmm.
Sounds like a skill.
You need to have.
I was like how do you think you could learn that skill within the current opportunity?
Pause.
It's like, well, I guess I could I could like train the other sales guys.
I was like, that's away.
I was like, but they might not like, they're all older than you.
You are all adults with kids is like, so maybe not as I what else you got?
14:26
It's like, how do you think you could do right by the company that helped you get to this point?
I was like go recruit other sales guys, go train them on your own time, and then bring them in pre-trained to that business to replace your output.
That's how you leave on good terms.
14:42
You find your replacement, you train them up and by the way, if you're in any business, if you do that, I promise you, you will have the best recommendations, you will not burn a bridge.
You will strengthen a bridge because that owner and the people who worked on, Were like he did it right?
Or she did it right, right?
And so now he's learning how to teach, right?
14:59
Because by the way, if you're in business you're teaching half the time and so he had to learn and he's current there's currently do it.
He's got to learn the skill of how to transfer a skill from himself to somebody else.
Because once he has that skill, then he will know how to get customers.
You will know how to sell and then he will know how to deliver what are the other seals?
15:16
He's gonna have to learn.
He's gonna have to learn how to fight its as right as you learn how to like get negotiate processing in place.
Can have to get contracts set up so you can have Services agreements, things like that.
But again, these are all google-able things that you can do.
You figure those things out, you know, a couple days.
It's not a big deal and if you're like, what do you mean?
15:31
It's not a big job.
Mike, you'll learn and you'll fuck it up.
Of course you will, but you're not going to do anything illegal.
And if you do, you're so small that no one actually cares.
So don't worry about it.
All right, so the big zoom out here, do you why I think that for years from now with fifty to two hundred thousand dollars in absolute costs and probably higher than that in opportunity cost of the cost of the path not taken.
15:52
Which of these two paths will lead me closer to where I want to go.
And if the goal is to make income, then you have to look at that two hundred thousand dollars and all the things you could buy with that 200,000 dollars and four years of time and think is there another way that I could reverse engineer for years to get me to where I want to go?
16:09
And if you think like that and you think within a departmental context of all the things that are required to run a business?
If that's the goal you want or if you just really like the technical expertise that you have, you go super deep on the technical expertise and then you bolt on On one additional skill.
This is the ones go.
I will give you that you need to bolt on to instantly.
16:26
Give yourself the lift in whatever career you have.
You got to learn how to deal with people.
Don't learn how to manage, gotta learn how to lead your like.
That sounds like the soft top and it is but it's also how you can get promoted.
It's how you get respect, is how you gain influence.
And so if you're a really good video guy, there's upward trajectory but there's a cap there because even if you're like going to start a video business, guess what you're not doing.
16:44
We have a video business fucking video, you're running business and you got people who do video for you, probably on bottom of that.
Sorry, that's probably me.
But like going people think two steps ahead they're like, oh I love mowing grass.
I want to go.
I start a lawn.
Mowing business will guess what?
You don't do.
Very quickly, mow Lawns, right?
So like, whatever the businesses that you're going to start, usually has nothing to do with the thing that you're actually doing every day anymore.
17:03
I love Fitness.
So I started to Jim, guess what?
I stopped loving once I got in the gym fitness because I stopped even able to work out that much because I was so busy with the business, right?
And so I was more in shape before I had a business, right?
Anyways, and so, the thing is, is that if you really love the thing, then go deep on the thing.
17:19
And bolt on one scale, which is Jingle leading because then, you'll also learn how to teach other people that skill to, right?
And so then when you're in that position, you can teach others the skill and that makes you more valuable because you are no longer a video guy.
You're a person who creates video, guys, see the difference.
17:35
How much more valuable is that?
Scale?
Significantly more value, probably two to three times more value, right?
And so, we think about that for your career, you have to decide how you want your life to go.
If you're like I really love the business stuff, then you have to become a jack of all trades in the beginning.
So you can understand just how to get the first dollar across the bridge.
And you also realize that the Thing that you really good at, it's probably not the thing.
17:53
You're going to be doing in the business.
Just got to know well enough to teach it to somebody else, right?
And so zooming to my, to my buddy here, you still in the game, you still in the ground, you still figured, I still has his job, right?
You still saving every dollar, you guys because, you know, is that, when you start the next thing, it's probably take time and you might have to live on that realistically for a little bit to get it going.
18:11
And that's okay.
Right.
And so to the parents, his parents came to me after like I talked to him and they're like Alex and you please just tell me again on why he should be you're like telling him to quit college.
Ajay was like I'm not telling me to quit college.
I'm telling you to make the best decision for he wants to be in four years based on him.
18:26
I was like do you think he's into college?
They were like no I was like to think he's going to magically get into college you're like probably not like what does he want to do?
Well, he wants to like start his own business one day I was like, what do you think the best way to learn how to start a business has Going in Academia literally the least business-oriented thing of all time or being in a business like I mean, I guess being a business.
18:45
Those are also bonus points which one costs less.
That one is like, which one do you think I'll have money to buy like Deploy on his own behalf later for?
She's like the other one is like to be clear.
I'm not telling you not to get educated.
I'm telling him to get super educated in the thing that he wants to do.
19:02
That's all I'm saying and guess what?
Let's say a year from now he doesn't like that.
He still has three more years to learn other shit but He would have started that point four years from now, in two hundred thousand dollars of that, he's making money while he's learning, right?
And the best part is that, when he has that money, he can go on the offensive and he can spend money in ways that actually generate income.
19:23
Like if he wants to just like learn video on a whim, You Gonna Learn video at school?
Probably, not.
Most of videographers, that I know learned it online, there self-taught and I'll tell you the last piece which is that the people who are the best in the world at anything, if that's what your goal is.
And I hope it is, if your Artemisia Nation.
19:39
I hope you want to be the best, right?
The best people in the world at anything, learn for themselves.
They are self-taught, and if you can adopt a mentality than the world, is your oyster because you realize that you can learn whatever you want whenever you want, you don't need a certification or permission to do that.
All you have to have to do that is the desire to figure it out and use your fingers on Google.
19:58
For example, yesterday, I was like, oh, I want to get better tracking on our video, watch time on our website.
I could have paid our dude, but I was like, I want to figure this out and so I had to get all the videos off of YouTube that we have unlisted on my website, at acquisition not calm, their free by the way, and then I do figure out which video platform made sense.
20:20
I decided to use wistia.
So we went on wistia and then once I was on, Wistia.
I was like, how do I integrate wistia with the analytics that we use on our CRM?
So Google how to integrate wish to do with the analytics and it was like, oh, you have to paste this embed code in.
So, I went to the thing and then I was and then I went to that.
20:36
So you're almost like, how do you paste the embed code in?
And then it was like, here's how you paste in that code in.
I paste the embed code in.
I transferred, all the videos over re uploaded them had the embed code on all the videos and then I started getting real-time directrix on all the people who are watching, where do you learn that in school?
You don't you just have to Layla loves using this?
20:54
You got to work your fitful muscle which is the figure the fuck out and how do you figure it out?
You Google like all the skills worth learning are available right now on the internet all of them are available for free to anyone who wants it and so all you have to do is start.
So if you're somebody who's facing this decision, that is my recommendation in terms of how to approach it which of these paths for years from now, given the opportunity cost is going to give me farthest towards my goal.
21:20
Look, guys.
You guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
21:44
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
So if you want to get a job, here's the easiest way to do it.
One is you expect to apply to a thousand places 1000?
Not 100 not 10 1000.
22:00
Okay, number one, number two, you personalize all thousand when you're like, what do you mean?
I personalize all thousand.
It means you take the time to read the actual description and you make a personal response when you submit your resume and you give reasons for why they should pick you you say hey.
So and so I want to be a salesperson.
22:18
It's what I would say.
What I think that I'm better, Suited for I know I'm out of high school.
What I lack in experience, I will make up and work ethic what?
I don't have kids, I'm not married.
I don't have any other obligations besides getting better at the skill and I promise you, like, if you just give me the opportunity to just give me the shot, I will outwork the other people, and I'm not even asking for the job.
22:35
I'm just asking for a chance to get the job which is, can you just get me on the interview?
That's my only, my only request.
The person is reading this, all right?
And so these are the things that are relevant, like I was Captain of my whatever team, like anything.
You get into.
Like and I know this sounds like kid stuff, but it's the only thing I can Pull from since I'm 18.
22:51
All right, when you are real with people and you're like, hey and I did research on your on your business.
And I think that this is don't try and give them advice from the business, you're 18, you probably no fucking idea but what you can say is I did research on it.
I think the products really cool from everything that I could comment for everything I see online.
So don't pretend like, you know, more about it but just like it looks really cool.
23:09
And I would love to be able to like help you guys promote it to more people, right?
Put their needs first and then explain why you're qualified to do it.
If you personalize and you apply to a thousand positions, I King promised you a, you will get interviews.
All right, now if you're like, well how do I get interviews?
23:24
You can Google it and you can find it out of how, to how to handle an interview but that will get you your foot in the door, all right?
Also, reaching out through multiple channels if you really want to like a this up, don't just apply with the personalized, kind of cover letter.
You also reach out to two or three people in the business and say, hey I don't want to seem creepy.
23:42
I just want it.
Like, I know that you guys probably cause you guys are a great business.
Probably get hundreds of applications.
I just wanted to see if there's anything I could do to just, like, at least lift my to the top of I also that could get an interview that's all I'm asking.
Otherwise I hope I didn't bother you like keeping awesome.
If you do that and every one of these jobs, I promise you, you will get replies.
23:58
People will always, like, I've said this in the past.
The number one currency respect is work ethic across, cultures across age groups, everyone respects hustle, everyone.
It's a few show.
Hustle, that is what you need to demonstrate.
If you want the job you demonstrate, hustle, you don't have experience, you don't have skills if you demonstrate the one thing, you can demonstrate.
24:17
So I think the biggest thing is it's not Even as much for the courses because the information is available online, what courses and communities do?
Is they organize, the information for you in a way that's faster to get through.
That is what it's when people are, like, you can find this information online.
No shit.
You find how to do anything online?
24:33
The question is the cost of time of consuming information.
That's not relevant.
And the cost of sifting through the stuff that's out there to find something that is right the right thing for you to learn right now.
All right?
So it's sequence and sifting, that's what you pay for, you pay for time when you buy courses and programs.
24:49
All right.
To be very clear.
That's why you do it.
Not doing it because you think the information is not anywhere else, it's everywhere else.
Alright?
So understand the problem that's being solved.
A community gives you insight into your future.
You can see what other people who are just like you have been able to accomplish.
25:05
It will break your beliefs about what is possible.
Number one, if you were raised around people who everybody knows poor guess who shouldn't hang out with other poor people like how to stay poor.
Get advice on being rich from poor people.
Don't do that get it right from.
Of get rich from people who are rich and if you don't deserve access to them because you haven't done shit yet, you buy access to them and you buy access to the person who owns the community and the other people in the community.
25:31
So you'll get some advisor mentor-mentee relationship.
But you also get people who are rubbing shoulders who at least have the same desire is you, right?
So if you feel alone right now, like you're the only one in your your pack or your group that like wants more a, that's normal.
Because the majority of people go through life, wanting nothing and just being lost.
25:48
And so, if you feel like you've got the That special something extra.
They get around other people who are walking in that direction and those people you will be able to see in them.
The deficiencies in yourself, cause a lot of times it's easier to see another people in yourself and they will also be able to see it in you and so you guys can feed each other and that's ultimately how you'll be able to compound your skills, faster the mentorship.
26:07
And the the selection of information that might exist in a coaching program or course, is there to just give you the basics of what is required to get this job done and you're like well, which one do I choose?
I think a lot of times it's good to go for All all in Opportunity where it's like, I want to figure out, you know, real estate wholesaling.
26:25
I want to figure out e-commerce.
I want to figure out sales jobs or I want to figure out how to run a marketing agency.
Not because that's what you're going to be doing forever.
But because all of those are self-contained businesses and you will learn a ton about all the components of a business, even if it's not, the ultimate opportunity end up getting into.
26:40
Because, if you are an entrepreneur, look at every big entrepreneur that's out there.
What do they all have in common a ton of failures and a ton of first businesses that didn't matter.
Right?
And so you've got to get those businesses that don't matter out of the way.
You got to get the failures out of the way so you gotta start feeling quickly.
26:56
So right now, if you're not failing you're not moving forward.
So you got to start failing feel quickly, fail as much as you can because if you make the goal to fail quickly, you will start succeeding.
But the goal is to get those apps out of the way.
All right?
It's just like in sales, you got to get the nose out of the way, so you're like, I'm afraid of getting know.
27:11
Why would you be afraid of getting?
No means you're closer to.
Yeah.
So like you got to get the nose out of the way so you can start getting the esses.
All right, so get the shitty business out of the way, just buy whatever one you want.
In a different video talk about this.
I am all by as many as you can, especially if they're all around the same Niche, it'll give you different perspectives on how to pursue it a single opportunity and I promise you.
27:30
When you do that and you make the intention not to become super rich but do to learn more and you compare it to the other thing you could have spent money on which is 40 degree.
It'll make a hell of a lot more sense and learning Spanish or Aztec literature.
So the eating ship here it is just you're not you're spending all of your time and all of your money on investing in yourself.
27:50
South and nothing.
So, the shift between consumption and investment is 100% investment.
So, as you get older, when you're sixty eight, you're probably not spending 100% of your time and money on investing in yourself.
You're probably consuming a little bit, your maybe taking vacations, you're seeing your wife, your kids, whatever.
28:05
And so the single most difficult decision in Life or even entrepreneurship is where do you want?
Where do I fall on that?
Spectrum of how much I'm going to invest in myself versus how much I'm going to consume.
Most people consume 100 percent every day.
They live hand-to-mouth, right?
They live paycheck to paycheck both.
Really and metaphorically speaking.
28:21
They don't invest in themselves.
Whatever they do, they eat immediately right now, the flip side is you go 100% on everything I make.
I save as much as I can.
And invest that back into me, right?
You're compounding yourself, rather than just spending money on cars, on a slightly nicer, rent place, whatever.
28:38
Like I promise you, if you can, if you can give up and sacrifice 10 years, you can live the rest of your life however you want.
And the cutest girls, this is for the guys, usually date older, guys.
Anyways, so like be that guy, you know?
I mean, like, rather than wasting all your time, trying to like, impress them with stuff, like you're not going to compete with, like you're not going to be with me, I'm married, but like, you're not going to compete with the guys got 20 years of experience on you in terms of success, don't try.
29:01
But what you can do is show that you're on the path to success which is through investment because they actually did a study on this women prefer men who are resourceful over men, who have resources.
So if you imagine guy who inherited a lot of money, sure, he'll be able to get a girl, but the best girls will go to the guys who can make it again.
29:19
That's the difference will be that guy.
Which by the way is why the Silver Spoon, guys don't actually have the advantage.
So for every was like, you know, I want to buy nice cars.
I like it.
I swatches.
I like Nice Clothing.
I want to go on vacations and whatnot.
That's totally cool.
I mean, a city, most people, but it's just a question of what you want more.
29:35
I think Abraham Lincoln said the quote but it's it's basically what you want now versus what you want more.
And so thing is, which one you want more?
Do you want the cars to watch is the vacations more than you want?
The earning potential of the business, the outcome later.
If you do then, Do that stuff but just then don't complain that you don't have it.
29:52
That's the only piece is like, if you love all that stuff and you love your life then like why are you watching this?
Like keep being happy, right?
But for everyone else, how do you break that habit?
I've never been good at understanding that part.
So I don't want to speak on something that I'm not great at like I've just so desperately.
30:08
Wanted it that it was never a question for me.
So maybe it might be like really getting into the future state of what it looks like.
The life will look like when you have that.
At and then whenever you are struggling with that sacrifice in the moment, it's always envisioning that but that's a gain way of doing it.
30:26
For me, I was just so wildly insecure of being a failure that it just wasn't even a question because I felt so terrible about myself that I would do anything to get out of my current circumstance.
But that's me.
So Jacob was lucky as hell?
That he just happened to have been my neighbor first off.
I've met a lot of 18 year olds and I have had no desire to talk to most of them.
30:43
I could just tell that he was incredibly hungry that he just, I knew that he had this Really deep desire to prove himself.
And when I see something like that, I'm like, cool.
Like, and of the way I tested that I was like shut up after school everyday will work out and I wanted to see if he would show up and, like clockwork, no matter what every day he would text me was like me having to text him or remind him.
31:08
So, I knew that he had that desire and he would take as much as I was willing to give.
I was like, okay.
And you know what's crazy?
Some of you fucking idiots, don't do that.
All right, like when you have the opportunity, you're like, you Don't you don't reach out.
You forget you get busy, whatever like if he had missed one day out as he doesn't want that much.
31:26
And that would have been it and it would have been fizzled and you probably don't even know the opportunities that you have squandered because you just didn't show you how to it.
Now, that being said, if you're like, well, you know, he had access to you whatever whatever sure.
But you can also create access because you get that by being hungry and the way that you do that is you start working and a lot of times when you start working there are people around you.
31:45
Like you're not going to get.
I've said this before.
Like Jacob was very fortunate in that.
Get somebody who's a hundred steps ahead of him.
Who was who's willing to speak into his life?
You're not going to usually have that.
I was to be really, really probably not going to have that.
I don't think I've had that but I have had people who've been a few steps out of me.
And the problem with people a few steps ahead of use that they can only see a few steps ahead of you.
32:04
And so you have to understand that then you're going to have some imperfect advice.
I've gotten advice in my life from people who are mentors, that was bad advice.
But more their advice was better than what I had.
And so it's more not about having the perfect path.
That there's one thing you take from this video, it's not about having the perfect path.
It's Being on the right direction.
32:21
All right?
And like if you're going, north ish, right?
You're going this way.
And then, you'll course correct.
Along the way, there's not a perfect path.
It's a perfect Direction, which is that way, right?
And the only way you start going there, start move.
So two people, you want to look at you, want to look at people who are further ahead in the organization, just as high up, as you can get access to.
32:39
And the second is going to look at the people are the best at the individual role.
So if you're like on a sales team for example, look at the best sales guy, learn the skills from him and then learn the strategy from the guys above.
So that's why you got to think about.
Who am I getting?
What advice from like you might have the sales guys amazing itself.
I'm not going to start again asking for marriage advice, right?
32:55
So just cause you looked up to, somebody doesn't mean that all their advice is relevant.
This is actually one of the hardest things to do as a human being is that you respect someone in a capacity, that's why people get investment advice from the hairdresser.
Like just cause you love them.
Doesn't mean it's good advice.
All right, so you want to make sure that where you're getting.
The advice from is specific to the school.
33:10
You're trying to learn from that person that they've demonstrated success in that thing.
So on the organizational side I would be you know messaging the people who are higher ER up and say like is it in any way possible for me to get like 15 minutes a month and you might not even want to ask for 15 minutes a month to be like would it be okay if I occasionally check in with you just to see if my career is on the right?
33:28
Trajectory because I'll tell you this, as I was saying, I was like, I would want anyone and ask me for 15 minutes a month, but if someone said, would it be okay if I checked in with you?
Occasionally people are like yeah you can check with me because you let your like life Direction because it also gives them status.
And so when you're doing that, you want to edify them, give them status.
Like, hey, you're further along in your life than I am.
33:45
I really want to learn from people were ahead of me and we're not, everyone's going to say yes but People will and you only need them.
So don't worry about the ones who say no.
And also don't take it personally for the people who say no, like they got wise, they got kids, they got family and they got their own aspirations.
So like you're asking for someone to give you something and basically it nothing back.
34:02
So don't be upset that not everyone's willing to do that but for the people who are willing to do that try and give them something back which you're not going to give them skills, but you're going to give them a feeling back which is you want them to feel like what they're doing to help you matters.
You want to tell them how what they're helping you do is impacting your life in a positive way.
34:19
You want to edify them and give them status saying, like how they are meant, or how they've changed your life and how they're helping you, you do those things.
People continue to do it.
And the reason why I didn't drop out of college is because I was too shit-scared to disappoint my father.
And it just took me two and a half more years to learn how to disappoint my father and be okay with myself, I would like to help you.
34:37
Not have to wait, four and a half years to do that because here's the thing.
If you're going to do it eventually might as well do it now like really think about that if you think that you're going to follow what your parents say for the rest of, Of your life.
Like really like take this in.
Do you think that you're going to be 45 and listening to your mom and your dad for your life advice?
34:57
Maybe?
But hopefully, not honestly because they're human and you'll realize that as you get them, right?
So if you know that you're going to eventually take their advice with a grain of salt and probably not, let them run your lives eventually that you might as well start doing that now.
So when I made the jump to disappoint, my my parents, and then also the same dump that Jacob did to disappoint his parents and mind you.
35:19
His parents actually really supportive.
They're awesome, but mine were not.
And so if you're in that position, all I thought of was one.
I have to be willing to die to them or I have to be willing to die to myself and I said, I would rather, I'm choosing me.
I'd rather die to them.
And if they're disappointed me for the rest of my life, I'm good with that.
35:37
And I had to get good with that, which is if they choose not to support me, Ever again, I'm good with it.
And so like I had to be real with myself about that.
And then in terms of like the fear, my reasoning was, I will never have a better time to do it, because the younger you are, the less you have to lose, all right?
35:53
Because you have a more time, be you have fewer responsibilities, like, you don't have the kids, you don't have the marriage, you don't have the mortgage.
And that being said, if you are that guy Colonel Sanders started KFC, when he was like 64, like there's still time, right?
But if you're younger especially and if you're older, what you have that they don't have, is that you don't probably only A that much anymore.
36:12
So like they're struggling with different things to just don't be a ninny, all right?
But if you're a young guy or gal like isolate, the parents death to me death to them, hopefully don't die to yourself.
Alright, because you'll feel bad for the rest, your life and then in terms of fear, it's just the circumstances.
Like think about another time where you will have less risk than now just think about it.
36:32
So if you if you want to do this eventually then think of a time where it will be easier than it is now to do it from a circumstance to a point and if you can't they went time that it's easier to do it than now.
And you want to do it eventually.
Then yesterday was the best day to do it because it's only getting more risky with time as you get older and as you acquire more responsibilities and more assets and more fixed costs Etc.
36:52
And that was for me.
What made me take the jump?
I was like, I guess if I mean, I have no dependence, its litter.
I know.
I want to start a business, I guess now, I like it feels risky now, it's only an affair with your later when I have a wife and kids.
So for him, how to find his replacement.
So you're thinking about this again, think about, this is a skill, stacking perspective, right?
37:09
So, you know, there's the skill of actually Going to get a role 12 is, you have the skill of working, those applications, to get them to an interview. 23 is how you actually do the interview for how you assess the other personally interview and great, who I think has higher likelihood versus not 5, is I now on board, these people and train them.
37:27
And then six is I have to manage them and continue to increase their performance, all right?
Seven would be that, you would send them, but that's not his responsibility, all right?
And so, if you think about that as a broken down version of the skills, he has to acquire.
That's what he has to learn.
If you're like, well, how do I figure that out?
You figure it.
Out.
That's the point is that there are a lot of nuance skills that it takes doing to learn, right?
37:46
And so you can you can read sales books, recruiting books, Etc.
And it's a good place to start, but like, think about this way, if I want to have a terrible salesperson, what would they have?
They probably be really shy.
Really self-centered, not.
Listen at all.
Be probably really aggressive talk over you and be dumb as shit and have no work ethic and be unethical.
38:06
This is what makes terrible salesperson just flip those.
They probably listen, they're probably the Talk, they care about other people, they're ethical, they work hard, like you have this all of a sudden, you're like, okay, now if you want to take it a step further, how do I test for that?
Well, you ask questions of situations where you want to see what the response is.
38:25
I'll tell you when, how I would test for like, humility, right?
Or accountability.
I would say, tell me about the biggest failure that you've had in your life or career, right?
And so, here's the thing, a smart interviewer is not asking the question because it gives a shit about your answer.
They give a shit about how you answer.
38:41
All right, and I didn't get this one.
I was when I was coming up, like I thought that they actually were grading me on my answers in interviews which is complete horseshit.
They cares about how you think.
And so someone like you, you can say the biggest mess up, it's not happening to them, it happened to you.
They don't care a humble person in that instance would say something like I had this mess up.
39:00
I should have communicated more, I didn't and I honestly I under prepared for this thing and it was on me and I should have done explains you better.
Write, this is what I would have done different next time.
The loser or the victim would be like I didn't get any support.
No one helped me out, they didn't give me the stuff that I needed to be successful, right?
39:18
And so if I'm interviewing, I'm gonna ask what's the failure and then the follow-up is, why do you think you failed?
And you say it that way.
Why do you think you failed?
Because the person whose ego is like I didn't fail.
I was great, blah, blah blah.
The person who stumbles like this is like I should have done this, I should have done that and so if you want to test the traits you ask questions that would illuminate the And make that first insecure about whatever trait were looking for.
39:39
And make that first insecure about whatever trait were looking for.

Most Nation welcome back.
This is podcasted it with Vince Del Monte.
We talk about three major topics in this first part, the first was about how to segment for cohorts to figure out which customers are most valuable to you.
So you can also make more money by doing less work.
Highly recommend how to tactically employee scarcity in a business where you sell customers every single day.
0:17
And some of the tactics that we have seen that, really, really Drive conversions, and decrease action threshold, so that people want to buy the moment, you give them the offer and how to stack guarantees in a way that reverses all the risk.
Such that they would be stupid to say yet.
Your offer enjoy.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:44
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I love free just to kind of touch on the cohort method.
I found that to be one of our most effective strategies I know Precision Nutrition did it for a while.
To I know you just have Ben pakulski or I think you guys are doing something together but that's what we did with our hypertrophy.
1:00
Max program opened it closed.
It opened and closed it and we just happens.
Massive surge has every six months New customers.
And we lived off that for a long time.
I'm applying it now, to even how we enroll members down to how many we have available for the day, based on how many we can enroll per week.
1:18
Maybe just expand on what this cohort method looks like, because I feel it's very effective, the probably a lot of people listening right now.
We're doing High ticket coaching.
So for everyone after you create the ultimate high value deliverable, right?
So we just, we just expounded on one problem.
The next problem going to be cooking the food.
1:34
The next time is going to be meal prepping the food, and how do you store it?
The next time after that to me.
Eating it and learning how to eat out with friends and not messed up, right?
The next problem F, that is worrying, that you're gonna hurt yourself.
The next pot.
Like there's all these problems that we can solve and if that sounds tiring to you, that's okay.
The point is that if we solve more problems, we will provide more value.
1:52
That's it, like, on Twitter supposed to solve problems, that's what we're doing.
And so we want to take as many of these things and make it so seamless.
And so, lubricated of a process.
And as an aside here, what do you think is more valuable, right?
If I say, you can go to the grocery store and text me or I mean this entire Your training that has 100 videos in it that you can watch and it's a full training.
2:12
Bargain shop obviously.
The first one, right?
Because the actual thing in and of itself, the time delay, the effort and sacrifice associated with the actual deliverable of the bonus.
Read them delivering is so high is not worthy, the dream outcome.
People don't want to well, obviously, if I spent 100 hours, of course, I'll be better, bargain shopping.
2:30
Can you give me the shortcut, right?
And so with each iteration of our products we use, we tend to make them shorter.
He gets shorter.
This book was the fourth version of this book.
When I like this is the fourth version full rewrite that I made and every book out shorter was less not more, right?
2:47
So a lot of people like time is still the most valuable thing.
So once we have the ultimate the core offer the value of deliverable the other things that we're doing are used to enhance the desirability of that core offer.
So that's going to be reversing risk through guarantees.
It's going at which I talk about four different categories of guarantees that you can give the second is going to be adding bonuses.
3:07
Going to solve, you know, minor perceived problems that will overcome obstacles in the sale.
You don't need a present.
All these things, when you're sewing someone, you present, the the bonus, when the obstacle occurs, and then you ask again, right?
The the third is scarcity, which is a function of quantity.
3:24
People say, scarcely an urgency is of the same thing.
Scarcity is a function of quantity, how many, how many units do we have and then urgency is a function of time, what do I need to buy?
If you have to do x, y, z by this date, there's urgency in there going to be any lip, right?
I could say, hey I only have five of these and I have no urgency, but there's only five, right?
3:41
And as soon as they're sold out, there is done, right?
That's a limited edition.
Now if you did both of those things which is I only have five and I'm closing it this Friday.
Then you have both of those things layered on top.
And So within the book we break down each of those things and within urgency and scarcity of people like, well, how do I do that without sounding scammy?
3:58
There's tons of without sadness.
Kim me because for every one is listening because I'm assuming most of people losing this, our coaches of some sort, right?
Then, if I were to say, hey, I'm gonna send you a thousand clients tomorrow.
You Hanna what's up, right.
But probably not.
It's be unlikely that you can handle it for most people especially if you have an accountability based business or 101 component, right?
4:19
So if you can't even handle an unlimited amount of customers, why are we pretending?
Like we can.
So we should be at least advertising what our limits.
So you could probably hit like think about what you're realistic.
Limited.
Realistically might be like five new clients a week, right?
And so if you know your limit is five new clients, we just actually cap.
4:36
It's a we only take five.
New clients a week.
And now when you're on the phone with someone, you can say, hey, I have two clients already this week.
We only have three more spots this week, right?
And it's completely doing because you can't handle more.
Anyways, you already decided that for your own operational drag within your business, because that's what your operations can handle.
4:52
Now later, you can revisit that and pump it, once you, you know, increase your on, whatever.
Right.
And so that is a way you can add scarcity legitimately without being unethical.
And so, the three that I like to use here is number one.
You have a total business cap.
This works really well for high ticket, right?
5:09
So if you're saying hey I'm only going to take 100 total customers and once my rosters at 100, I'm capping it right.
You have implied scarcity.
There's also social proof because if you're, if you're full, then people already know that other people value this to.
You can also tell these people if they leave the can never come back.
That that also creates a fear of missing out, right?
5:26
It's all these things drive.
Stick Drive, lifetime value and decrease.
The purchasing, professional people will buy more readily because they don't want to miss out.
It's much stronger to get people on fomo than it is on desire for.
A game.
All right, people, people always like to hoard scarce resources.
And if your squat is a scarce resource, which is our goal and positioning it that way, then you get more people to buy at higher prices, right?
5:46
Yeah.
So number one is, you can have a total business cap and over time, you can every quarter you can bump it if you want to create a waiting list that I guarantee you.
So I'm out like, I mean, you just did it.
You did it with diapers for thing, right?
Like you had like, this is it, and then we open the doors were closed, right?
So that's number one.
6:02
Number two is a growth rate cap.
So this is a cap on rate.
It's a cap on.
Right.
Which is what I was referencing earlier, which is, instead of having a cap on the total business, we have a cap on how many we can take per week.
Great, we're per month or per whatever, right?
That's the second way you can add in the scarcity.
6:18
The third way that you can add the scarcity in is having cohorts in and of themselves.
So you can make the argument that the five-week is a cohort but most people don't think about it that way.
So it's more like we're going to do a class of 40 people and we're going to start them all at the same time and it actually tends to make operations easier to because you can take them all through the same experience.
6:35
It tends to be easier that nature.
And then, you'll still see your sales ramp up, right as as the, as the deadline starts approaching, right?
And so those are the three ways that you can add, that you can ethically, add scarcity, it to a business that you're not planning on capping, right?
6:51
Besides the first one.
The second two that I mentioned are things that you don't need to cap.
You can still have scarcity, right?
Yeah out.
We just launched a new YouTube show called our road to 275, and it's our journey to 275 members in the 7 figure Mastermind.
And I'm thinking to myself, I got the Best results in Fitness when I documented my journey and post photos.
7:10
So I'm like, why don't I do that in my business?
And I was always scared and like put out how we're actually doing and I'm like, why would I be scared of that?
That's just extra accountability for me.
That's the exact reason that will make that will make us even more successful.
So you know, we're using effective marketing.
7:26
We can literally bring on 25 a month that is our capacity.
So each week, we are literally saying, this is how many spots we have or you do have to get on the waiting list for next week and it's A simple message.
It's just it's a truth.
So, I love this.
This is is true.
7:42
And like I said, if I sense, you know, some of your clients, 100, customers more.
They can't take them.
Like, then why are we just telling people, we can't hit, like, it's just, we're just expressing something that was already there.
So, the next one is urgency, right?
And so in urgency, there's cohort-based rolling urgency right.
7:59
Which is you can say that if we ran, this is how we like to do it.
We do this a lot, right?
Which is we always start people and Mondays.
And so if you have today, you can start in the next group.
But if you don't, then you have to wait until the next one.
It's a different way of saying the same thing because now we're not saying it's based on a limit.
8:16
We're saying, it's based on time.
Like, I want to sign up by Thursday because otherwise you're going to miss the cutoff for starting on Monday, right?
And so, by doing that now, obviously next we think it's not but then they're gonna have to wait and some people time to lie, they don't want to wait, and so they would rather it's going to do it either way.
It might as well start now, so you can start getting the benefits.
8:31
Right?
I love it.
Yeah, so we came I came up with, you know, I was out for my walk.
Listen to your podcast.
I'm just trying to think about how to streamline the operations and I will talk about that a bit later, but I'm like, so our coaches can have our coaches have capacity for 40 points for Coach.
So I'm like, alright.
8:47
So right now, our capacities, 25 members a month, but if we can continue to tighten up our delivery, we can onboard 40 members a month.
That makes Not only just onboarding 40 months simpler, but it's not every month.
I now have to bring our one new coach when new coach, and I can systematize that now with when we start promoting process of on board, And then boom.
9:08
So it just makes everything easier when you're operating from a clear structure.
Totally 100%.
The second of the urgencies is rolling seasonal urgency.
This is especially valuable for Fitness space, right?
So you can run a promotion of some sort, right?
9:24
It could be New Year's.
It could be Valentine's Day.
Could be sexy by Springs.
That's the first three months of the year, right?
It could be, you know, love, you know, special for April Wright, doesn't matter.
The point is that you can make up, you know, holiday hangover Lean by Halloween.
Big booty booty.
It doesn't really matter with the thing, it's right.
But as soon as you have a promotion, you can use the arbitrary end date as the end of the promotion.
9:45
Now, that end of promotion, right?
You might change the flavor of whatever the promotion is.
It may be identical in nature, but it has a different name because now it's the Valentine's Day promotion and so you can have urgent see to end to bookend your months, which I highly recommend, which is why every single gigantic Fitness chain, that's private Equity own does this, they always have end of month, you know, sales and specials.
10:06
So they Their gold.
They use last week of the month.
They always do the most sales deadlines right decisions.
Right?
That's one of my websites, right?
So then life decision.
So if we do this and we can say that the promotion is ending on the phone or in person, we can say that, and that's completely true.
Now there's gonna be another promotion but this promotion is ending.
10:25
And so it's real genuine, urgency that we are, that we are introducing the sales process to drive more decisions.
Let me hear you touch on scarcity.
Urgency for recites when people are coming up to there, 16 weeks, you know first phase first. 12 weeks first, 12 months of their program.
10:42
That's a question or members are you ask a lot of how do you maximize maybe even ship that might even be how your business is structured.
But you know how, we how we going to maximize people?
Renewing upgrading.
So first things first, you just never want to re-sign people at the end of their country.
10:57
That's like 101.
You re-signed people halfway to two-thirds of the way through you never wait to see it because you want them to already be in and they not imagine it ending if you're doing Trying to the end, they have already ended it and now you have to resell them.
Whereas, if they're in the middle or half to two-thirds of the way through, they're still in the game.
11:14
It's still an open loop and you just extend the opening of the loop rather than Loop closes.
Now, reopen it.
So that's 101.
I've never done re signs actually near the end of the of the contract.
I'm right.
Number one, Alex, is that just say hey is it starting to play anticipation for second phase third?
11:31
Phase for phase.
It's just continuing on letting them know.
This is where you're out of the customer Journey based on it.
Asking for your journey.
Yeah this is where you're at this what we've accomplished this will be planned to do.
Let's be real.
You want to do more because everybody wants to do more.
It doesn't matter what business you're in.
People want more of whatever it is that you delivered and then you add bonuses, scarcity, urgency.
11:53
And you can add scarcity to the bonuses, you can add urgency to the bonuses, to get them to re-sign.
You can add urgency around the deal.
They'll get if they sign early right rather than waiting.
So, all of those things we can introduce and then in terms of attacked, super Tactical.
If they like the coach, they have fun with Coach, Vince, and Vince has booked up.
12:10
I'll be like, Vince is waiting list if you don't re-sign now.
I can't get by the end of the contract that you're going to get.
Oh, wow!
That's freaking brilliant.
I just want to tell you.
Thank you.
That's like that is genius.
Never even thought of like doing renewals weight earlier in the process, that's genius but it makes sense because this one, their emotion and yeah, that's, that's just beautiful.
12:32
So, and then we can make them all.
Sorts of offers.
We've done this before rather than teaching. 25 is crazy nuts.
I'm the guy saying, oh my gosh, how come?
I didn't think of that but it's brilliant.
So with let's just sit on that because I see some other members asking questions about that.
12:48
I think a lot of people I know you're really hard on that screwing around with the prices.
But how do you do these re signs up cells?
Without these 50 credit card core about, my pricing pricing is not negotiable.
The pricing is decided upon ahead of time, but if I'm going to give a discount, it is already been predetermined.
13:07
There's a difference.
Like, we will absolutely get discounts for getting for someone to re-sign or get some sort of incentive to sign early signing bonus that kind of thing, right?
We'll do the incentive, but it's not that it's negotiable.
It's this is what the early signing incentive is.
Do you want to do it, or do you want to pay more later and maybe not get the coach you want?
13:26
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
13:45
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Gotcha.
So it's just you're controlling the narrative on animals.
So it's like you sign up today, right?
We have this exclusive thing that we only give to people do early bird, right?
14:03
You're going to get this, urgency based pricing discount, right?
And on top of that, I'm going to credit you an extra two months on the back.
End of your contract for free, for taking the take the promotion, which is how I give you, your 20% off.
I'm not even giving a discount said, two months or tacked on the end.
And if they see all the payments and that's contingent on you doing, all your payments on time.
14:21
If you're, if you have any Contracting issues or A payment things.
The bonus is gone.
I love it.
That's brilliant.
We have different levels.
Other coaches here.
Have different levels.
To what are some techniques for ascending people to the next level and creating a culture of Ascension?
14:37
So one thing that we're doing now, in seven figure Mastermind is we have a an elite program of 50,000 50,000 dollar program with just coach Cory and I and we now something called the kick in the ass reward.
So for people that graduate from Seven figure Mastermind to meet one-on-one In the first 90 days, I love to hear your thoughts.
14:56
You can put me in the hot seat here, we put that towards their original 50k so that they're going to do something.
They're already planning on doing but we're now going to collect an extra 35 30k sort of sort of thing in the first 90 days.
15:12
How do I think you, you have a term for that?
Is it up, sell the downside or down south the upsell.
So it's called downtown, the upsell because in this goes, for any kind of contract you guys are selling.
So, if You're selling term human beings in general.
Understand priced decently well, don't understand shit about terms, right?
15:30
And so, this is a, this is a really interesting one.
Like, when buying a business, I'll be like, what's more important?
Your price returns right, there is a price and then I'm gonna be like, well, cool, I could do a zillion things on terms, right?
So it's like if so, here's a funny fun.
I just just to illustrate the example, if I say, hey this, I want to buy your house real estate market.
15:46
You know, what do you want for?
What's more important?
You might say price just play along, right?
So let's say that you're like, well, okay, cool.
Well, what is the price you want?
Maybe you 10% above market, right?
I'm like cool.
I guarantee you I'll pay that price as long as we could do my terms fair enough.
Cool cool.
I'm going to finance it over 30 years and you're going to seller, financed it right?
16:04
And then I'm going to take ownership of your house and then going to rent it out and I never even put money in the deal.
So I'm just saying that is an illustration that terms matter and so it's up selling the down cell or dialing, the upsells whatever right?
Is that I like to have higher ticket contract.
16:23
That's It's extended over a longer term of time, because if your current let's say front end Pro.
I don't know the pricing of but just play with me.
So let's say 12 k for 12 weeks, right?
So it's 12K for 12 weeks, which means people are paying $1000 a week, is what they're currently paying.
And so, if I say, hey, this thing is a year, right?
16:39
And you're going to pay half as much as you are now, and you're gonna get more than you're currently getting.
Do you want to do it?
They're going to say, sure, but the term is now, four times the duration.
So if they pay the price, they're still paying twice as much.
So you've got them signed up for say, you know, 16 week program or something they're paying a certain amount and then you cut in half.
16:59
But instead of renew them for 12 months, for two or three years or something, we do.
Yeah.
And just like if we did, if the first thing was 12 months then you have the next thing would be 12 or 24 months or or whatever.
Let's freaking beautiful.
Why we i-i'm just touch on guarantees.
17:15
So I want to make sure we've tried this in the past.
I don't sometimes you can get into some Muddy Waters here.
So maybe just like your breasts practices on guarantees especially when Or, you know, you know, offering a 2X guarantee on selling the coaches, you're making money, just kind of ways to do the guarantee to not get yourself in muddy waters, where you're trying also tracking really low quality, beads.
17:35
I don't like selling broke people.
I don't like, now I was broke.
When I hired my first business coach, if they didn't have, you know, terms, I wouldn't have been able to start.
So I do like offering credit and some form of incentive.
But just, let's talk about.
I see some people putting out guarantees, I'm like, that's going to be a nightmare.
17:53
So some best practices on that.
All right, we'll go for top down.
So from the Top, If I were to say, you're going to lose 100 pounds, right?
Your lose 100 pounds and I guarantee that you do that or I'll give you all your money back or just a, I'll help you get your goal or I'll give you your money back, right?
18:10
Doesn't matter how many places get there?
You probably have no problem, right?
And the other side is pay me and we'll see what happens.
Right there is a space between these two extremes that you can pick.
It's just that most people are here.
So it's like listening to cop.
Let's take a handful of steps are Stark here and then just peel back a few pieces as we can to stay as close to this total risk reversal as possible.
18:33
So if we were just to do that, you'd have a more compelling are if you be able to sell for more money, if I were to set a program that I have, no guarantee versus the program that we do have a guarantee.
You can sell that for more money because it's guaranteed, the perceive.
Like, Liberace me goes up some more viable.
Truly more about.
We change, nothing?
Yeah.
18:49
Except the aren T.
How we wrapped and position it, right?
So one, We can raise the price.
Number two, we're gonna have way more people buy it.
We're going more buyers at higher prices.
That's a double Force multiplier in terms of how much money you make and you from not getting Legion because when you make that offer everyone from right, so that's the extreme over here.
19:08
So, underneath of that, there's four types of guarantees that you can give.
All right.
The first type of guarantee is an unconditional guarantee.
It's good old-fashioned.
What I, what I just said, which is no questions.
Asked, you ask for money back.
It's yours.
Now you can also attach a different term to that, so I'm trying to get to In The Weeds because I V chapter on this, but you can say I'm going to give you a 30 day unconditional on a six-month program.
19:32
So it's like, hey by it.
So you say, hey, I'm not asking to make a decision today.
What I am asking to do is make an informed decision, which you can only do on the inside of the program, just like you wouldn't buy a car without test driving.
You wouldn't buy a house without walking it, right, so, I'm not asking to buy this program without actually having done it.
So, all I want to do is get a shot, which is start and then if the end of the 30 days for any reason whatsoever, you don't like this.
19:53
My my breath, even though we're virtual, you don't like the small my breath virtually.
I'll give you your money back.
All right, that's how confident I am.
And the only reason I can make guarantees like that is because we're a legitimate business, and I know that we're gonna be able to buy the results far in excess of what you experienced in the past.
All right?
That's a 30 day, it might be a 12-month program, but once they pass 30 days, it's done, you're going to sell way more people like that, and at higher prices, right?
20:17
So that's one, you can do it for the whole program or you could do it for the shorter term.
It's up to you.
So that's type of Guarantee number one, type of guarantee.
Number two is a conditional guarantee which is and with conditional guarantees, I prefer to make them way more like grandiose, right?
20:34
So if it's, you know, I'll help you lose whatever the poundage is right by X period of time, and then a guarantee has two pieces to it which is you will get X by y or else, right?
So you're going to have this outcome by this time or I will.
20:52
So what You I will is the thing that gives guarantee teeth but most people don't have good guarantees like no teeth on the gear to see.
And this is honestly what so Vince when you were saying, a lot of people are putting guarantees out there, most of them have guarantees that have no teeth.
So I can say, hey Fitz, I guarantee I'll get you a hundred million dollars, right?
21:11
If you pay me and then you be like, or what, right?
I'll be like, or you'll continue to have access to my materials.
I mean, it's something it'll get a lot of clicks on the headline, but from a actual like teeth on the, on the, on the guarantee.
It's not as compelling, right?
Yeah.
But if they didn't get results in the first place, why wouldn't he want to keep it anyways.
21:33
So it doesn't actually reverse the risk, so that the strength of a guarantee is proportional to the amount of risk of reverses.
So you getting continued access.
I can use the headline of the guarantee, which has some value, right?
But the, the soup and nuts have it is has no teeth.
The more teeth you give to it.
21:49
The more value will be so conditional guarantees.
You can stack.
Guarantees, you have an unconditional for this and then a conditional for a longer period of time.
All right?
And then you can guarantee around the outcome which is I want to help you lose excess weight or maybe that you're going to establish XZ, have it.
Or it's that you're going to, you know, whatever the thing that you're selling, right.
22:06
And then I'll do that and I'll give you twice your money back if you don't lose this amount of weight, if right?
And this is what they have to do as long as far as long as you attend all of the things and you send me pictures of your food and you check into the gym every day that, you know, whatever the thing is, right?
22:26
And so all these little dials here because on the conditions, the more you have the less it reverses risk for them.
So really want to be as selective as possible and really Pare down to like, what are the absolute Necessities that someone has to do?
22:41
Now, if you want to be a smart cookie about it, we can do is look at the customers that you have right now who are successful, who ascended in bought your next thing in renewed and resign and say, what did these people?
Is in their first 90 days, what did they have happened?
22:57
Or even their first 30 days that they have happened?
That were indicators or leading indicators that they would Ascend and stick.
And so then you build your conditions around the things that create ideal clients.
I know if someone sends me their meals every day for 30 days, the likely that the person who sends is 90%, then my conditional guarantee is going to be that I will guarantee this or twice your money back.
23:21
As long as you send me this for the first Today, because I know that if I get you that happen, the first three days are going to be doing.
Yeah, 100%.
Yeah.
So you need to know your Milestone.
Yeah.
Yeah, I love it.
Goes back.
It goes back to the offer now and having you know, we talk about our last podcast One Way play.
23:37
You know.
Having all right.
Step one.
You need to post this Step 2, you know, your blood post, step 3, 25 messages a day.
Step, if you don't do that.
The only next thing I need to do is take in the gym.
Now, I just need to sleep, right?
23:53
I just have to look at your conversation now I just have to look at the post but I know the steps are right so I love it.
You can use analogies are so like you know parallel with how you lift in the gym.
Like okay, you're doing deadlifts and your body is not changing.
All right, now we have to look at your techniques.
Oh oh!
Oh that's fixed.
Now, the body is going to change.
24:09
Same thing with the business, which is why, when you can reverse-engineer those steps, you can make those guarantees, because you've simplified your your process, your method.
So it is my opinion that you should guarantee that.
There's you more than the customers there.
24:26
Yeah.
And then figure out what's wrong with your business model, and your fulfillment, that makes you scared.
That's been difficult, use the guarantee as the fear driver to get you to fix your business.
So that the service is on par so that you can fulfill this guarantees.
So unconditional conditional.
24:44
You can stack the two together.
You can also add multiple conditional guarantees.
You can say, I'm going to guarantee that you had 10 pounds by, by 60 days, and I guarantee you had 20 pounds, by 90 days, Were, you know that first period is great.
I'll credit back to you.
You can say yeah, no credit.
Like and just very, very here you can give a guarantee and not have to get money back and give money as credit or extended time.
25:03
Like there's other things you can give besides money when he's just the least creative thinking, hope you guys enjoyed us going.
Deep on cohort, adding scarcity tactically into an everyday business and adding guarantee so that people buy without feeling risk.
So you ultimately make more money's part, two of this podcast we're going to talk about Out, utilizing Investments reinforcing, behaviors and how to scale teams.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else so I started at zero when I started my first Jim's with new knowledge.
I started my TurnKey sales company with zero and with new knowledge after that I started the licensing business at zero once again each time learning from the mistakes of my past.
0:43
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
When I had my job and I had a pretty decent job was making fifty sixty thousand dollars a year and I was 22 ish as a consultant and it was a good stable job and look good on the resume and you know my Dad could brag about it at parties and he wouldn't like a now, his son is doing the right thing.
1:14
He's going to do this.
He's going to go to business school and blah, blah, blah and leaving.
That took me a lot of pain mentally to get through.
And I've talked about that before, so I won't go into it.
But one of the things that I had to do was figure out what my plan B was right and Arnold Schwarzenegger talks.
Not having a plan B, Because if you have a plan B, that means you're not committed to plan a.
1:33
I don't agree with that.
I like having contingencies and knowing what I'm actually going to do because sometimes there are unknowns that can mess up your planet.
Now, you might say, oh, you should commit even more to it, teaches them.
That being said, when I quit my job, my actual plan because I had no skills was that, I would strip at night now Drive, Uber during the day, and I figured I could drive Uber and make probably 70 to 90 thousand a year driving, Uber during the day and I my strip six nights a week.
2:00
I can make another three hundred to four hundred thousand dollars a year.
And that's based on the strippers that I know who work three days a week.
Five hours, that's 15 hours a week.
They make about 120.
So if I did that 45 hours a week, I would make 360 from stripping.
And assuming that I would be at least as awesome as stripping as they are minimum, then I'd be looking at 400 ish 450 between both of them and I can save that in a year and then start the next thing, right?
2:24
So that was my plan B.
If my Fitness career Fitness Gym didn't work, And going into it, knowing that.
Now obviously, I had to make make peace with the fact that my dad didn't approve.
My mom didn't approve of what I was currently doing this.
I was like, well, if they don't improve gym owner their death, I'm not going to prove stripper but YOLO, right.
2:40
And so I got over it.
But that was my plan B.
And this may sound silly to many of you and purple like ah, I don't have the morals for that then cool.
I'm telling you how I thought through these things because for me showing an elbow showing, it doesn't matter.
So the next thing was candidly, if you look at the thongs, a lot of the girls wear today compared to what They thought was pouring like 40 years ago, it is pouring so subjective, whatever.
3:03
So, plan, B next right?
Was that I started learning how to sell at my gym, so I learned that skill and I figured if for some reason, the gym doesn't work out.
I now have this skill.
That's in my pocket for the rest of my life, and I learned that from selling memberships, which by the way, I think, is one of the best ways to learn how to sell.
Because I think like, if you learn how to sell car dealerships, you don't have cell car washes, you know, how self Fitness some of the best or cold calling, some of the best ones because you get so many reps in so fast, right?
3:27
Like if you want to start learning how to sell any, You gotta like a software company and you have to sell a six month sales cycle to close one deal.
I don't think you really learn how to sell.
Like, you have to learn how to get people to make decisions on the spot over and over and over again.
Have immediate reinforcement which is why High rep sales.
Give you such a fast feedback cycle.
3:43
You get really good.
Really faster you get out.
And so for me learning that skill, which I was taking 1015.
Console today for years, I learned that's go pretty quickly.
I learned how to talk through things.
And so I knew that I had that skill and so I could either make my gym work as a business owner, or Plan B.
If it didn't work, what I had that skill, Cool was, I could go and start selling cars.
4:01
Start selling mortgages for me, cars is what I was going to go into because it just made sense to me.
It's just like very straightforward and it was one of those jobs that I knew, I could outwork somebody on.
So I didn't have to be better.
I didn't have to be more skilled.
I just knew that if I worked from 9 to 9 every day at the car dealership 6 days a week that I would be able to make 400,000 year plus, and I wouldn't have to take my clothes off, which didn't matter as much to me but more, so that, like, I can keep my clothes on and maybe look a little better for people who do care about it later.
4:25
So, that became my new plan B.
Now, as I got more Because then I started learning how to Market our, certainly learning how to run ads.
I learned how to fill Jim's up and that became a more valuable skill than just selling.
Now, this is important.
So after I had my six Jim's, I got to actually live this.
4:42
So people ask me the question Alex.
If you lost it all, what would you do again?
I've lost it all twice.
So I will tell you exactly what I did when I lost it all step by fucking step.
So I lost it all and I had a thousand dollars left in my bank account because I done a hundred thousand dollar launch of a gym the payment.
4:58
Processor wouldn't pay us the money and so I had to pay 22-thousand dollars in commissions from sales that ever got.
So took me from 23 2008, that's how much money I had left.
The only thing I had left was a credit card at that point.
So I had a credit card with a limit that I knew that I could spend.
And I was going to spend it on advertising and sales, guys, going out in the field and using my system that I had developed because I had skills to start over again in the next 30 days.
5:23
We made 100 gray, right?
From them.
I also had 100,000 or credit card bill, but I broke even Now the next month we did like two hundred thousand dollars because we had payment plans, they started stacking, we start making new sales is to the started going up, and was like, oh this might work.
And then for those, you know, the story, Jim started refunding people at the end of their programs, some gyms didn't do the coolest thing and said, hey, hey, sign up for me, refund through them, because I'll just do the same thing that you already doing with me, for half the price, which really screwed me.
5:51
I didn't understand how controlling the flow of money.
What kind of risk that was exposing me to?
Because I was young, I was 26, whatever.
And so I learned that lesson, right?
Right.
And so I lost everything again and this time even more because I like 150,000 dollars in basically debt that I had to cover in the next 30 days, not in Revenue in profit and I had never even made a hundred fifty thousand dollars in profit ever.
6:13
The biggest launch ever done was probably about eighty to ninety thousand dollars in profit in a month and that was just me, but I already said all this overhead.
So I knew I needed to do way more than that to make 150 with the cover, the overhead and have twice as much profit.
And so that's where desperation a lot of times leads to innovation.
6:29
And so for me at the time, I got on the phone with guys that I had done these launches for with our sales team and sold them on me, just teaching them how to do this whole sale system, right?
And so, the key there was that I didn't have a gym anymore because I'll, I sold my gyms and then I took the money and had lost the money from the sale, my gym.
6:46
So I basically had nothing, I lost everything.
And so, rather than start from scratch, I wasn't like, oh, I'm gonna start a gym again.
I said, let me call people who have gyms, I have this skill and then I'll plug into them.
And I I will give them the money that I know that my system can make them and get a percentage of it.
7:04
And so the average in that used our sale system would make thirty thousand dollars in their first 30 days in new cash collected.
And so, I charged half of that.
Now, mind you, they can keep that system for the rest of their lives.
But for me, I charged half.
And when I started doing that, people started making thirty thousand dollars and telling their friends and because we're like how the hell you making all this money, they're like, oh, this kid from the internet and so then they would call me up and I did it again.
7:25
And because of that, this is the second time I lost everything.
I The point of Leverage and up the power of media because I was able to license the whole system rather than actually flying out and doing it and incurring the operational overhead.
And so I have lost everything twice.
The first time I switch to just doing marketing and sales, and plugging everyone else's network, but then I added in workers to do it.
7:47
And the second time, I lost everything, I switched instead of having workers, doing the sales, I taught someone on location to the sale.
So I didn't have the airfare, I didn't have the hotel, I didn't have the commission's, I didn't have.
The ads meant I had to pay for.
I don't have any of those costs.
I still got to take a percentage of the upside to that business because if you think about the upside that I was able to ride in my original model when I would fly out somebody to the gym, I took most of the economics up front and then they would get a small portion of the people who converted on the backend now, they had no risk.
8:17
I took on all the risk there but they were also not motivated to do a good job because I was one who made the money, I was going to hold the bag.
And so this way, it flip, the dynamic where I was helping them, make tons of money and then they loved me rather than hating me.
For being the person who ripped all this cash out of their business.
And so I have lost it multiple times and these were my plan B's as I went.
8:36
Now, once I got to that point, if I were to lose it all again, I would be going to businesses that were similar to one that I built and say I can help you add x amount of money.
And if you really want to think about it, even though I didn't lose everything.
When I sold Jim launch and sold Prestige Labs, I did start at zero again.
8:52
Now the only way that I'm not actually starting at 0 is that I have money but I haven't used Any of the money in Act was not calm.
So, every business that I have started has been profitable since day one.
I have a different way of doing business.
There are plenty of business, you start a software company, a lot of times you need capital investment and started manufacturing business.
9:09
You got to have Capital Best Buy Equipment but the businesses that I have started have been ones that were built on skills which is why I'm such a big advocate in general.
If I could be known as an advocate for scales, that's what I'll be known for because I have lost everything twice and the biggest realization of my life was that I didn't lose everything.
9:25
Not only did I not lose everything, I lost a fraction of what I thought.
I lost because I still kept under the thing that no one could ever take from me, which is the skills and the experiences in the lessons that I had learned through the path that I had walked.
And so unless you have a mental disorder, you keep the lessons with you for life and in different videos.
9:43
I've said I would pay any amount of money to make an obvious truth, real, for me.
And so, the most valuable thing that I had our lessons, that I had paid to learn Blood Sweat, tears and money to learn so that I could apply them to a new reality.
Yeah, and so when I have zero multiple times, I applied My New Reality which was not the reality that I had when I started my gyms because technically when I started my first gym, I also had zero.
10:09
So I started at zero when I started my first gyms with new knowledge, I started my TurnKey sales company with zero and with new knowledge.
After that I started the licensing business at zero once again each time learning from the mistakes of my past and if you want to go fourth time, I started at quote 0, which is acquisition.com because I sold a majority interest.
10:28
Companies, the only reason this wouldn't be 0 is if I taken a lot of money to to inject into the business, which I have it, but I will say one thing is that I no longer have fear around money and so it allows you to play the game differently.
And so, for example, at this point if it had been 3.0 Alex.
10:47
So like last cycle ago, I might not be as heavily investing in the people in the infrastructure that building with acquisition.com because I would want to have a healthier margin to take out of the bank and every month.
But since I don't need the money from the business and I know where I'm trying to go in 20 years.
11:03
I'm willing to actually play a higher risk game.
So the way I play the game is different.
And so if we go back to the definition of learning which is similar condition, different Behavior, right?
So I'm the same conditions.
I'd that each of the times before this excitement behaviors different, rather than trying to strip as much money out of the business as I can.
11:20
Because this is my fourth Go Round And I don't need the cash.
And what I want is the equity value.
I will reinvest into the people that will build this thing into the behemoth.
If that I wanted to become and so going all the way back to.
What do you do?
If you start with nothing, you start working.
11:35
You start taking action, you take doing steps.
And realizing that the thing that you are earning above everything else, is the learning, not the income.
Because that is the thing that you will take with you.
That is the most valuable thing is the ignorance tax and the debt of not knowing that you were paying down with the actions you take.
And so when you do that you do for an unreasonable amount of time you will get to where you're trying to go.
11:57
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, So when I started Jim launch, I put no money into the business, because I had no money.
12:23
The money that I had in my bank account was like food, and so that business had to make money in order for it to have any money to work with, right?
People like what was the capital injection?
I was like, sweat.
That was a gavel injection, right?
And so I was able to trade my time for money and I did that trade as many times I could to get money.
12:39
So that later, I could trade it for more money.
Now, the prestige Labs business which is the business that we started after Jim Lunch, you know, I had to iterate your Twice before it actually really started working.
But once demonstrator really scaling up, I had tons of cash from that business and so either I could put it into indexes or I could put it into a supplement company.
12:57
So the supplement company cost me about 4 million bucks to start you're like, well, that's crazy.
Well, I can either have put that four million dollars two years ago or three years ago into the S&P 500, which right now would be about the same.
Give me everything's at or I took that four million dollars.
Put into Prestige labs and later was able to sell that for probably 25 million.
13:16
Three years later.
So I Put the money in the form of inventory and Tech because I had to build a custom point of sale for gyms and inventory system, like it into it and so that 4 million dollar investment.
I ended up five exiting in three years, great deal, Jim launch cost me nothing.
And I probably sold that for another twenty five ish, because they didn't parse out, which was worth what it was.
13:35
So those two specific were sold as a bundle and so that cost me nothing like you know, my return on that was basically infinite the acquisition not calm business.
If you call it that the hold Co I've acquisition.com.
Didn't cost money to start because I had already had acquired 20 to 30 percent of three different businesses before I really started acquisition outcomes.
13:57
I wanted to see if I liked working with other entrepreneurs as a minority partner because I've only been majority up to that point in my career I've always been number one and so it's a different Dynamic for me too.
How can I influence somebody to see the world that I see the way I see it.
14:12
So they'll make the same decisions I would so that I can maximize the likelihood of success without forcing them to do it.
And so, Different position for me now but I tested that theory out for a year while I still had gym which pursues lives in a land before.
Selling them Alan side note, I put I think one and a half million dollars in to start and that was sold for an all-stock deal.
14:30
Not allowed to say what the price wise, but we're doing 12 million and top-line trailing 12 months before we sold it.
So it's all I can really tell you so the return on that was also good but just in a different format because I didn't want the taxable event.
So I worked out fine.
The language is not how business business hold cow their companies in That hold Co already cash flowed to me.
14:50
And so, all of the money that act was not calm.
Has been built off of has been built off, cash flow from businesses.
So it's been cash flow positive day one and I tend to build things that way when I'm starting at 0.
So if you think about it, Jim won't start at 0 is cash flow.
Positive basically day one, my gyms started zero or cash flow positive day, one acquisition started a 0 in that I didn't put money into them or cash flow positive.
15:12
They want now Prestige labs in the the software they were businesses that Could put Capital into and get a return on the capital and so I felt like with in my bucket in my audience in the needs that I already had access to.
I could make a significantly higher return by starting those sub corpse within kind of like the larger bubble of gym launch Etc and so it's the same kind of concept here in terms of what we're going to do later with acquisition.com.
15:38
But for now that's always been the game for me.
Is when I start, when I start fresh I don't like putting money in because I think it makes you lazy as an entrepreneur because I think that you will always solve The problems that you asked for yourself, you will answer the questions that you asked, which is why I think you can, you can tell so much more about how someone think about the questions are asking then, even the questions they answer.
15:57
So when someone says hey Alex, how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year, I can already tell that there are so far away from making lots of money because throwing question, right, rather than like how do I how do I get somebody to give me 10 million dollars?
Much more interesting question, right.
And you can answer that question and I'll tell you a quick story on this because it's so important.
16:12
Good friend of mine makes 40 to 50 million dollars a year, 50 percent margins.
Single person business works.
Three days a week half days, that's the business that she's built.
She just so, you know, for the ladies in the audience, she asked me to sit down with her and she said I want to do a Consulting project with you and I want to answer one question.
16:30
She said, how do I make five million dollars more and do no more work in my business.
I want no time for me and I'll make five million dollars profit extra since we sat down and within 90 minutes I was like I think you should do this.
And she did that Jimmy five million dollars extra and her business.
And so the questions you ask dictate the problems, you'll Oh solve, right?
16:48
And so for me, the reason I've I tend to have cash flow positive businesses day one is, because that's the question.
I choose to solve was I how do I build a ten billion dollar thing with no Capital upfront?
How would I do it?
And so, acquisition.com is the answer that question, by the way Assurance, create tremendous Goodwill in the marketplace building an incredibly strong brand, have a brand that.
17:06
So strong, that the moment you gain access to something, it in of itself becomes more valuable through association with you.
So then you can't lose and I'm just telling you, that's the strategy.
That's what we're trying to do.
And so I do think that There's a little bit of entrepreneurially laziness.
I've seen software guys, who raised, lots of funding and I asked them, why are you raising funding?
17:23
And they're like, cuz I think it's what I'm supposed to do and they spend money because they have money to spend, rather than because it is solving a specific problem, the business.
And so I think, and this is just like, Alex was spiritual standpoint.
Like, I feel like, if you really were creative enough, you could figure out how to start anything for nothing like Nikes founder, Phil Knight.
17:41
There was a moment where he ran out of money and he couldn't pay payroll and he needed to or he was going to go to business and he maxed out all the red lines.
And so he went to his vendors, the people who actually manufactured issues for him and said, I need you to pay my payroll this month and they're like what he's like because if you don't pay my payroll then I won't be able to buy from you next month and he got him to do it and so necessity is the mother of invention another way of saying that his desperation is another of invention when you feel like there's no way out you ask different questions and so when I started with zero and not even zero when I started it - hundred fifty thousand dollars a month in profit the I was trying to answer is how do I make a hundred fifty thousand dollars in profit in 30 days with nothing?
18:21
It was a very different question that.
How do I build a big business?
Because up to that point, the questions that I was answer, I was asking for myself and then answering was, how do I build a big company, right?
Rather than how do I make a business of making shitloads of money?
And sometimes we ask you four questions, you get different answers and you act differently.
And so when I'm thinking through the zero question, which gets asked all the time, I think if you improve the quality of your question of how you want to do the thing, you will answer it.
18:44
Much better than you probably currently are when you set your goals.
All for a hundred thousand dollars a year because then you're only going to think in vehicles that will get you a hundred thousand dollars a year.
And then once you do that you can only maybe double or triple your effort get to 300.
Whereas if you say how do I get to 100 million?
You think differently?
All right motivation.
Keeping awesome bot.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Hard work, will not make you rich which is why I get driven.
Nuts by the amount of gurus and influencers and whatever who want to brag and say, no one can outwork me.
I'm the best in the world, Bubba, Bubba blah.
0:36
When it's objectively, a false be so many people work, 16 hours a day and just sleep, and then work again.
And so then, how are we to finding hard work?
Is it just that you work in general?
Congratulations.
But if that's the metric that we're trying to use to say that you're good at working.
Well, then there has to be another metric because every single person on the planet Works, fucking 16 hours a day unless you start eating into sleep, which I think we can.
0:57
All agree is probably not a good idea.
So so many people Are working 16 hours a day.
There has to be something else.
Welcome to the game where we talked about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
1:14
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
All right.
So one of the things that grinds my gears about a lot of the people that I see on Instagram that you probably see to is this whole like known can outwork me Mantra and a lot of the people that even espouse that are people that I like, but I really don't It like negating objective reality and it's the same thing when someone's like I'm the best and you have to say you're the best because if you don't think you're the best then like it shows that you're not confident to me.
1:45
I don't take that at all as if someone's like I'm the best then I would say then why aren't you on fucking Billboards?
If you're the best that's what the best would look like, you know what I mean?
And so if no one can outwork you Mike you haven't met everyone and to be fair.
I've met fucking 20 people that can outwork you and Aunt why Bragging about work because work has nothing to do with very little to do with the highest levels of the game, right?
2:10
Like Warren Buffett talks about if you mix two good decisions a year he's had a good year, right?
And so how is it, that one of the best investors?
One of the best business people in terms of measuring it by money.
Which is how you measure business talks about how he does, basically nothing reads five or six hours a day, eats McDonald's and makes a couple good decisions a year.
2:27
How is it that, that guy is making so much more money than the people who are bragging about the fact that they work so hard, huh?
Now you can either say Say, oh, well, Warren works by just consuming information.
Okay.
Or we think about like what creates output what creates effect so you have volume of activity, right?
2:46
Number of times, you do a thing, and then you have the leverage of the activity that you're doing.
That's what creates the total output, right.
And so in order to do anything, you must do something right.
There has to be some level of energy, that gets input into the system.
Now, the leverage that we have on that activity Is going to dictate how much we get out of it.
3:05
And if we do a low leverage activity, many, many, many times we might get more than a high leverage activity that gets done once, but with enough leverage, one move can do more than thousands of low leverage activity moves.
So for example, if Kim Kardashian gets up there or the rock makes it post and says, hey guys I just started this new X, he will get more leverage from that.
3:29
One activity that one post van somebody.
Jihu DM's, a thousand people or 10,000 people, right?
And so was it that you can make the argument that the, the rock, you know, worked harder, maybe in building the audience again.
3:46
Maybe.
But I think the point of why I hate the concept of knowing cannot work me, is that?
There are many ways to win the game and this is like the heart of why I want to make this video because if you were to think about an amazing goal as a dragon to be slain, all right?
4:03
Think about that way, even though it's a process and not a destination, just bear with me.
If you are familiar with video games in any way when you create like a war party, you have a group of people that are gonna go go on a quest or mission, right?
You don't just have 10 Paladin's or guys who just have Shields and swords, you don't do that.
4:20
Why?
Because a good fighting strategy uses different tactics and different advantages.
So you've got a Healer, you've got a mage that's really going to damage but can't take a lot of damage.
Then you've got a Paladin, who's not as who can't hit us hard, but you can take a lot of, a lot of, you know, a lot of shots right.
4:39
You've got, you know, a bow and arrow person, who does whatever, X, Y and Z, right?
And so each of these characters has a role to play and it's because the sum of the parts is greater than an individual player, right?
And so, having five Paladin's is not as good as having a paladin, A Healer, a direct damage caster, and whatever.
4:59
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, the point is that if you're playing football, Don't have 10 running backs when you're playing baseball.
You don't have 10 people of the exact same skillset.
You find people who have complementary skills, let that sink.
And so for a moment, if you were to think like the entrepreneur really should be the coach of the team that is the role of the CEO is organizing the team to win the game, right on the micro, and the macro level the season.
5:30
And then making a dynasty, long term, whatever it is, right.
And so the The reason no one can outwork me is first off that, it's objectively, false because many people a at work.
You today be at work, you have in the past.
See, you haven't met everyone and D, it doesn't fucking matter, anyways.
Alright, that's why I don't like it.
5:46
So many people outwork me.
I still make more money than them.
Why are we talking about this?
Like what's the point, right?
And so, what this realization has brought to me is that it's about organizing the pieces of the players on the field, and how the well, they play together, that He determines how good the team is like, how many times have you seen the team with the All-Star?
6:07
That has the poor Supporting Cast?
Get beat by the overall better team?
It happens all the time, right?
And so a lot of entrepreneurs is I see them are trying to play the game like they're the star player and they want to score all the points, but they lose to Apple because apples got a team, right?
6:26
They've got team players and they build a championship team that way by having complementary skill sets.
And so, this is the point I wanted to make Make we celebrate a specific action like work when it's really just saying oh look, there's a paladin who can take a lot of hits.
6:41
Cool, that's not the only thing that's required to win.
There's other things that are required to win.
And so, I think what is more valuable is to know what are each of the roles that exist within the business.
A be on the micro level?
Is there.
6:56
One of these that you map to based on your characteristics and skill sets and then see what is my eventual?
Through entrepreneurship.
So we'll start at the beginning, which is what are the players on the field?
So, if you think about it by function, right, you've got somebody who has to promote, who's got to be a good marketer.
7:13
They have to understand how to make things known across different platforms.
Somebody's got to be good at that, telling stories, building a brand providing value to an audience.
That's what marketing is sales is being able to convert that wrong attention, and interest into a sale, right?
7:30
And it depends on the type of business, but that monetization could be go through direct response ads sales Pages video sales letters Etc or it could be through, which is pretty much anything that's physical products or software-based.
That's low ticket or it's higher ticket and you have people-to-people hand-to-hand combat who know how to end the beginning cell and then later trained how to sell.
7:53
And then later later lead, people who trained how to sell, that's how you build the sales function.
So you have to have somebody who's good at that.
These are not necessarily the same people.
Oftentimes, they're not at all the same people.
And most times marketing and sales seem similar because people were getting marketing, sometimes it goes out, but I've met really Brian Marquis who suck in sales and we're really good sales.
8:10
People sucking marketing, right?
If you have both, that's awesome.
But it's not, it's not required.
Then you've got somebody who understands product.
How do we make something?
Beautiful, the guy who started Shopify, he's not CEO Shopify, he's had a product because that's his skill set.
He's he's a mage, right?
8:27
He knows how to cast spells, that's his thing, or he's a running back and he's just really good at running these routes, but he still needs blockers.
He still needs a quarterback to him the ball, right?
He still needs you know, offensive, lineman, whatever he has people who are in place to create room for him to grow and succeed.
8:45
And so, you've got the product guys, right?
And you've got the experience people who are managing everything outside of the actual product itself.
Like, how do customers engage with us?
How can provide more value?
How could an amazing experience?
How do we make sure they're hitting these Milestones?
How do we make sure they're successful etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
9:00
Right.
What sport can we offer them?
And Person?
Who knows customers experience.
A customer success is not the same person who understands product and ux and design and whatever it is that, you know, depending on the technical expertise that's required for whether it's a service or product.
That's a different game, right?
9:17
Which is different than going to, is that a close is definitely knows how to promote.
And so the bigger the Enterprise gets, the more specialized, the skill becomes in the deeper, The Well of experience that people need to be.
They have to be more specialized in the beginning.
Small business owners have to learn a little bit of everything because you are everything, but that Mantra will kill you.
9:35
And so when people are like I can't be outworked.
You're bragging about the wrong thing.
It should be like, I can't be out recruited your.
I mean, I can't be out managed like that's that would be like no one can build a culture like me.
That's that's super high.
9:51
Leverage across the organization.
No one can lead like me super high leverage across the organization but no one can outwork me.
It's just an irrelevant activity metric, right?
You have to do some work.
Sure.
And I'm not believing You guys know me.
I love working at work all the time, but I would never claim that.
10:08
That no one works harder than me, right?
There is a business owner that want to deal with us recently, big business, and he followed up with me, four times in one day.
And then we set the the time that we were going to talk.
You thought of me two or three more times before the call, and then after the call, he's followed up with me for five times since then and like we're talking like repeated times and the first time you try he's like hey you free right now?
10:30
It's like no I'm sure I know and he texts me and I was like you Get your free right now and I was like, no not for you right now and you're like, all right.
Can we talk later today?
I was like no but we can Tech we talk tomorrow at this time.
It was like okay that work and this guy is absolutely Relentless and the reason he wanted to work with us Atticus is not calm is because we have things that he does it but I'm telling you right now if I had his level with relentlessness and perspicacity, we'd be 10 times bigger than we are right now.
10:55
That's just not my vibe but I tend to have very good leverage with the activities that I do.
I spend tons of time writing a book and that book princess copies forever, you know.
And so it's a different way to play the game.
And so my main point here is that there are players on the field, right?
11:11
Whether you're talking sports with, you're talking video game, people who are in the arena and they have different skills.
And so level 2 of this, one was knowing what the skills are Level. 2 is knowing which player you are.
And so in the Middle Run of this, you end up segregating yourself to a portion of the business that you're a tax for that or that you're best at.
11:30
And so then you go deep on that skill because you become essentially.
ECMO or chief sales officer Chief product officer or some people.
I've got a buddy of mine who CEO of as business, but he's really like CEO CFO.
He's really just a very good Financial guy, and he tends to run a business.
It's very complex financially, so he has to be really good at that stuff.
11:47
And it's such it's very core to the business, right?
And so with each of these Dynamics, the players look different.
It's not about one player like being the champion here.
It's about how the team works together, which then gets to the third level of this.
Or if you want to flip it, third level would be up here.
12:03
That is just about being the coach, which is do I know how to recruit players my team.
Like, that's what the best thing about the best coaches do.
They're literally trying to headhunt the best players and they're trying to recruit the best people from college, right?
Like that's what the best coaches do.
So you're looking at the best young, young talent.
12:20
Look at what Google does.
Think about the recruiting efforts, they've huge influxes and resources dedicated to getting the best and smartest people out of college, right?
And they have another ring for the best and smartest people come out of business school.
And then another one is Is there very high level recruiting at the top of the executive level?
12:37
And so, if you think about the parallels between sports and business, they are almost the same in that way.
Now mind you, you can only have, you know, 10 or 11 people on the field.
You might have 10,000 but if each of those players represents a function or Department of the business, it makes more sense.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
12:59
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
13:16
Its fo free in exchange for emails that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight.
Eight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
When we move up the levels of Entrepreneurship, we need to make sure that we're playing the right game and that we're using the right metric to measure our success.
13:40
And so our activity, in terms of number of activities that we are doing is a very new be measure of success in the beginning.
Warren Buffett doesn't say I said 1,000 emails today, he doesn't talk like that because he's he's playing a different game and so if we want to think like billionaires we have to act like millionaires or rather, we want to Like lawyers, we have to think like theaters, right?
14:02
And they're not thinking about, yeah.
Jeff Bezos don't like woke up at 4 a.m. today.
Now, mind you, I'm saying, this is somebody who likes waking up early, but I also understand it's not required.
I like it.
Some of you guys Vibe with that, and that's cool.
But we can't be a superstitious about what matters.
14:20
We can't early doesn't matter.
Go to bed late, doesn't matter?
Not sleeping, a lot, doesn't matter, like none of those things matter.
The few things that matter are the inputs that go into the system that have the most Leverage.
To create the most Alpha that's it.
And so the final level of this is being, the coach is recruiting the top-level executives, and creating a farm system underneath feed into the company that you have.
14:41
So you can have a sustained competitive advantage and create a dynasty for the team.
So you can create the best winning team every year and have the soft skills of create a culture of high performance.
So that you get the most out of every individual player.
And the difference between amazing coaching and mediocre or poor coaching is what would players If they had no coach, we're leader.
15:02
And then what would they do?
If they had the best coach in best leader?
The Delta between those two, is the value of the coach, the value of the CEO.
And if Co can come in and turn a business around, even behemoths around in 23 years, behemoths one person can do that based on the standard that they set, and the values that they stand for that Delta between Minimum level of Effectiveness to keep my job and discretionary work which is the amount of work that I would do if I was maximally engaged as an employee that Delta across the entire organization is your greatest leverage.
15:40
And so if we want to build big businesses we have to talk like big business owners and know what that path looks like until in the beginning.
Sure there's activity, but the goal should be to get out of those activities as quickly as you can, so that you can go recruit the players on the field and then from there Rise Above It creates the culture on the team and you may know a lot about being an offensive Wing.
16:03
Are you may know a lot about being a defensive tackle because that was what you came up with writer came up on, but if you look at even the trajectory of I like football because it's simple example, you've got a defensive tackle, who's amazing?
And then what does he do?
He comes back as a defensive lineman coach and then it becomes a defensive coordinator and then he becomes the head coach, right?
16:24
So that in the head coach has to understand the whole game mmmmm.
And so if you think about that trajectory the small business owner is the defensive tackle that also has to run the ball and figured out and it doesn't look good when he runs the ball.
You just have to run the ball long enough to win a couple games at the lowest levels of minor leagues right enough that people like this guy's pretty good.
16:43
I think I could help him out and then you recruit some better players and then you run plays against better teams, right?
Then eventually you do such a good job that you can retire and then you move up the ranks in that way.
Right?
And so I wanted to make this because as I grow frustrated with people touting the wrong things to the masses about what matters.
17:04
Absolutely.
You need to do the work, you need to put volume.
It is the only way you get better.
That is not my point, but if you start claiming that you are the best you are, you cannot be outworked.
You are, you are making statements that, you know, are not true, you know, they're not true.
17:20
And I am not a big believer in saying false claims Because then I lose trust in myself because then I feel like I'm lying and I am delusional because I have no evidence to support the fact that I am the hardest-working and that I am the best.
I don't think I'm the best.
17:36
I don't think I'm the hardest working.
I think we're pretty good.
They were pretty hard.
I shouldn't say, we're the best and so I think that if we can shift the monitor around this and then refocus it on the things that matter which are we have to get domain, expertise, we have to get sufficient domain, expertise to get over certain level, then we have to bring people on the team that can help us out.
17:53
Whether it's the slay the dragon or with The game and then we work our way up the coaching ladder, once we're off the field, because you're no longer an individual contributor in your business anymore.
You're managing people were doing the individual contributing and you work your way up until then sure your head coach or if you're a smart smart cookie, you might have enough money that you own the team and then you hire a coach.
18:12
That's exactly what a business is from a large picture perspective.
Apple is owned by shareholders and then the shareholders hire a board to oversee the head coach head, coach CEO, same thing.
The way you spend your time is the only thing that is controllable and the question is, whether you were doing activities?
18:34
Are we to how we defined work?
Is the most is the important part of this.
If we Define work as the amount of time, allocated to activities that make us money directly or indirectly, then yes, people who work more in general will make more money in general but everyone only has the same hours a day and I can promise you that many, many, many people like Like so if that's the case, then anybody who only sleeps eight hours or only sleep seven hours and works the remaining of hours of the day, all of them would be tied for hardest-working.
19:06
So then there has to be something else.
So once you max out your hours worked there has to be another variable.
Which is the leverage, your gate on the activities in the time you spend and that is in my opinion where people should focus their attention.
Now if you're a newbie and you can't get your ass off the couch, then by all means figure out how to Actually get your ass off the couch and do stuff.
19:27
But once you have tap that out because that's a very easy Hammer to hit, once you figure it out, I got to work, more got to work more sure.
But then there's only so many hours and so, boom.
And then very quickly, you hit your capacity of work.
And so in order to increase your capacity, you must increase the leverage, you have on the activities, you do.
That is why I get so annoyed about no-account work me because might be all have the same hours and if the only argument you make is that you sleep, last.
19:49
Which I don't think anyone would argue is a good idea, long term for decision making.
So you really just have your Of maximum of how many hours per day.
Can I work relative to the amount of sleep that I can have to recover and okay, great, you've maximized that now one, because then it comes.
Okay, well, I've maximized every hour that I'm awake.
20:06
Well, I can do other activities, they have higher Leverage.
What if some in activity has 100 times higher leverage?
Do I still need to work?
16 hours a day?
What if I work 12 hours a day?
I get four hours back and we're doing a hundred times The Leverage because it doesn't matter as much.
So then the reality is that you just need to figure out the activities that have the most leverage and do those once you know how to do.
20:25
The you will give out the activities in reverse order of your efficacy if you want to be in terms of, if the goal we have is to maximize the amount of money we make in the shortest time Horizon.
And when I say short, I mean long but over a long time Horizon you want to give away the stuff you suck at first not necessarily the stuff that you enjoy the least the first.
20:46
Because sometimes there are things that you are good at that.
You don't like doing that are required for you during this season of the business.
Believe me, there are many things that I do right now that are not my, my favorite things in the entire world that are required for me right now and we will do what is required?
I think about them in terms of what is my return on time for the activity?
21:03
And so the the lowest leverage activities are things that are done one time and are never repeated again and do not create more output.
That's why fulfilling for customers, especially in a service-based.
Business is almost always the lowest leverage activity.
Now, you can gain, leverage on the activity, if you're able to like record it and create media from it because now same time gets Right.
21:26
The question for leverage of any activity, is what do I get back for?
What I put in, that's the core question and so if I can get multiple things back for the same time, then I have more leverage on on the activity, but as a rule of thumb the thing that provides the least value which you can also in a back of napkin we figure out by what can I replace from the marketplace at the cheapest price of the time that I spend?
21:49
And so if you're and this is the actual thing that we do with the portfolio companies who are coming in a CEO, who's going to work with acquisitions?
Cam Works virtually every hour of every day when they come in, almost everybody does.
And so that's why, again, the whole out working thing is just silly to me.
So everyone works the same as ours to sometimes they ask the like, well am I going to be working more like it's impossible for you to work more, but you are going to be changing what you work on.
22:09
Because that's the only leverage we have is we have to change the nature of the activity.
You have there's only 24 hours, so you're taking 16 hours, we're going to switch these nine out and we're going to pop these in with higher leverage activities.
That's the change that we're going to do.
And so the way that we do that, as we look at their calendars, Look at their org chart, you were like, what are they talking about?
22:27
Like, this is how you fucking grow business, you look at what they spend their time on and you see, which of these activities are low leverage and he say, look at the org chart, you say, is there anyone else in this org chart that we can hand these activities to and if a large percentage of these activities are a certain type of thing and they don't exist anymore chart, then it's a role that we need a higher so it's our the delegation thing that we can do in spread throughout the org and then it creates frees up the entrepreneur to do more High leverage things or if they have figured out that the next hole in the business is that they really need to focus on the product.

T'.
Then if a disproportion amount of time is focused on one thing that would fit cleanly in one role and we hire that role and that is how the buying back of time happens in the business.
And the idea is the entrepreneur or the CEO needs to have the highest return on time out of anyone in the organization.
23:13
So, here we have.
The CEO needs to have the highest return on time.
Out of anyone, the organization because they need to always be solving the next problem.
So, as long as when they replace their time, the activities, do they do with the news.
Stuff.
Once they freed up that nine hours, builds the business even more.
23:29
Then that trade will always work.
Where people get into trouble, is where they trade the time, they pay the person, and then they don't refill their time clock up with stuff that's high, leverage or higher leverage than what they just Outsource.
And so the idea is you do want to always get your time back, but you want to get the time back so that you can do high-leverage activities that ultimately grow the business.

Most Nation welcome back to this Days episode of the game.
We talked about three topics on just Vince Del Monte's podcast from March of twenty two, we talk about Investments.
We talk about reinforcing Behavior.
We talk about scaling teams so that other people can do the work for you, so that you can also print that money's without doing all of the works.
0:19
I think you guys will enjoy it, and I'll see you in there.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:35
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Yes.
Is might be a question in the weeds here but you know, if we're going to ask you reinforcement of this, I guess this is, you know, of course you need to reinforce that this is probably a dedicated role to you know, if somebody's saying hand and get results, I mean, the whole idea is to put this stuff in motion and then to find out issues as it shows up.
0:56
What would you say to somebody who's afraid?
And like me kind of a trust it, you need a better program.
You probably need somebody dedicated to helping these red light clients, Etc.
But I can, I can hear people's thoughts.
They're fearful of, okay, I'm going to put this in motion, but what if this creates a customer service nightmare?
1:13
It's kind of like the point, though.
It's a, then you go fix those problems too.
Yeah.
And then you have this crazy front end and then you fix the problems in the back and you have a business you're making 10:00.
I love it.
Alright, with some time we have left here Anything else you want to talk about on offer that you get asked their, maybe I missed asking you that just will make this the mafia offer.
1:36
Well, the other two types of guarantees you have anti guarantees, which is it?
We're looking for the type of like worth.
Then you can do this, which is all sales are final, which is, we're looking at the type of people that don't want guarantees, we're looking really want to do this type of work and we're going to be testing a tremendous amount of time and you and if that's if that's sounds scaredy then you can definitely go buy an e-book for 9 bucks.
1:52
So many times I see salesman, I'm sure you have to they fasted close right there, like.
Oh yeah.
I mean, If there's any issues, you know, like either fucking have a guarantee or don't it own it right along.
And then the fourth one is a performance offer, which is based on some sort of thing that's supposed to happen and it's proportional.
2:11
So it's like, hey, here's the deal, you pay me a hundred bucks every pound, you that's it.
That's an interesting WowWee.
There's so many different creative ways to do.
I'll just love what you're saying.
This is all different back, my first business coach got me on the ante guarantee, by the way, I remember when I was 25, 7,500 dollars, six months.
2:30
It was actually with Corey rudel's internet, marketing Center, I bought his DVDs, 300 bucks.
They called me up on the phone, they asked me how I was doing.
I said, I know what I want to do the rest of my life, but I'm overwhelmed and he said, all right, we want some help as a sure.
So I had to put it onto credit cards and I actually get to follow up with me and I said, when I go on the road follow up call I got him.
2:51
I'm going to tell him if you can.
Guarantee me an extra Alex.
Get this my grand ambition.
When I started was an extra three to four.
Thousand dollars a month.
So I said, if you could help me do that, I'm in.
So when I said that to him, he laughed.
And I said, what are you laughing at?
3:06
You know, if you can guarantee this I'm in and he said, Vince, we don't do guarantees over here.
I said, you know, what do you mean?
He's like, well, we're guaranteeing our time, but we don't know what you're doing with your time, so there's no guarantees.
And that was my first introduction to the whole concept that success is your responsibility and your duty.
3:25
I wasn't doing him a favor by becoming a client.
He was doing me a You're offering his services to help me so I love that Auntie guarantee.
So I wanted to share that.
Yeah, the book goes into a ton of detail on all these things, but yeah, big picture of those elements KOC urgency.
3:41
We even talked about bonuses, but excuse you urgency, guarantees bonuses.
Each of them has depth and then the actual buffer itself and then which things should be bonuses, which things should be Corps offers and how you position and how you should play that with the numbers of people, how you should add in the rolling cohorts, all that kind of stuff, so that you can ultimately sell more people at higher price.
3:58
Has awesome.
Well, hey maybe just for a few final minutes out, you know, now this is what's going to break the business, maybe just start giving some insights on how to build your first team.
There's that shows up for a lot of entrepreneurs, business owners, whatever they call themselves.
These days, first person you're going to hire like, what does that first team of 45 people look like, in just your process of letting go of control, delegating responsibility setting standards of performance in order to, you know, free up your time to keep scaling.
4:28
Yeah, so they're just they're miniature, big businesses internet main.
So most entrepreneur when you're when you're starting the because you have to learn 100 rolls and do them all fractionally and then over time as the business grows you have almost enough work for a full-time person, right?
4:44
And it might scare you because you're like, well I was running this business on my own, so if I have one person that I should be able to have, they should be able to do the same as me, except it doesn't work that way.
So you probably need to have a fire people do the same amount with you because we're going to do one fraction of the thing that you're doing.
And so I always outsourced in.
Reverse order of market.
5:00
So if I think that right now, if you look at so the easiest way to do this is Doing Time study so you get a sheet of paper and put it in 15 minute blocks and then you look at what you're doing with your time.
So most people are massively disorganized and if you're like, that sounds like it'll take time.
I promise you.
You'll triple your productivity when you measure what you're actually doing, right?
5:18
Because you want to brag to yourself and like you're really productive and then by doing that, you'll actually get a lot more done.
So you'll never waste time when you do time States.
So you do a Time study and then what you do is you block it in.
You like what type of work it is and then you can describe the value to replace that job.
5:34
So if you're doing administrative work, that's 15 bucks an hour.
If you're doing, you know, customer success which should be responding to.
Is this the right brand of food and pay?
I'm stuck with my wait.
What do I do again?
Probably 15 bucks an hour.
Like not a lot of skill is required there right sales higher value, marketing, higher value, CEO, making big decisions, strategy, decisions, higher value, A product, so making all the higher value.
6:01
So, what we're doing is first, it'd probably be from line support or fulfillment, right.
Next might be administrative.
You can swap those through relatively equivalent.
I think you're on would be better, make some sort of operations person.
6:16
So some sort of administrative help kind of like an ex office manager is a great one to look at who you know, somebody who ran to dentists offices and then they want to work remote.
Like those are great options for because their Swiss Army knives, they're used to doing Took a little things so that would probably be because it'll, that person will give you a lot of time back.
6:33
They can also help you with your personal life, which still takes very real time for you, right?
So that probably be number one.
Number two would be customer success, and then number three would probably be something around product.
Number four would be sales, and then I might have to hire a probably, I probably get a vendor for bookkeeping and finances and things like that.
6:54
So some of these things can be vendors that probably the first core, you know, 45.
You're still be running, you're still gonna probably be running marketing, and running the ads and and making the videos and making the pages because that's going to be your thing.
What's your thoughts on going?
You know, building an internal team where you know what roles like you know, we just recently discontinue services with our sales agencies, great guys.
7:16
But you know I needed a result more profits and wanted to have more control have more of a dynamic sales team you know making offers in that.
So one of you really, you know, I guess you know if there's a right way.
We but what are you?
Definitely your thoughts and best practices around.
7:32
Internalizing your team and just kind of keeping a lean mean, like a high-functioning team that can coordinate action and it doesn't get too fat, where your profits are bigger.
Just I think that would be some great advice because I see some guys, they hire this team and then they hire this agency.
Then they hire this agency.
7:47
But now there's a sudden they're just they're losing a lot of control and they've not they're kind of like may be delegated way too early some of these things.
Yep, I hesitate to make a broad.
Sweeping generalization because sometimes an HD is a good fit, sometimes a sales agency is a good fit when you sacrifice control for Speed, often times winding, it vendors is, you know, just as hard as finding good employees.
8:11
Like there's a lot of them and not a lot more good.
So it just takes time and effort.
I think most people, I think the biggest problem is that people just really impatient and so, yeah, you should people really patient and patient.
Yeah.
Because they're impatient because they just want to hire the, you know, they had the interview five people and just hire one and they're like, well, like I said, say it's a Did this person who blow you away?
8:30
Well, I didn't blow you away, then why are we hiring?
There's just a body and then how you're gonna have to spend more time getting them on board, you have to continue to spend your time getting them to do stuff.
It's just, it's just like the first million is learning how to promote, right, you know, 1 to 10 is product 10 to 100 is people.
8:47
Yeah, once you cross a million bucks ish, it's going to be the lights and gross profit per customer, which is going to be directly related to the quality of product in molestation system behind, which is, you mean series of offers up sales price.
Etcetera.
Right, skinny.
The machine is the second part, right?
And then after that, once you hit, you know, million bucks a month.
9:04
Then it's all people in the people who need to be taught a low-quality, their raw potential, they're not realized, right?
So if someone's like, smart and hardworking, that's raw potential, but they don't have experience, right?
And I can tell you that very first, you know, 100,000 or employee.
It's different, you hire for 250,000 employee.
9:22
It's different when you hire first million-dollar Egyptian different game and so Tell you having done all of these things.
It's a different level of Acumen.
Different level of Delegation, that you can have different level of freedom.
And what's ironic is that people, entrepreneurs, want, freedom and control.
9:38
And you have to pick, you can't have absolute control and then try and have freedom.
Because if you control it, you are not free.
And that's the entrepreneurial journey is that you go from having no control to complete control and you just your life giving away control.
Again, I love it.
9:53
Oh, man, that's still great.
I mean, ask everybody what their biggest take away is the stuff.
About offering the renewals earlier on was, was this really for me?
I want to thank you for that, Alex, thank you for sharing that so generously.
It's one, our young guys, on the rise, it's just speak to just last question.
I promise, just on the desk.
10:09
See, I've never asked you.
I don't even think about asking you on the best thing, but since you touch on, I think what's a good use of like, you know, how you're utilizing your money and I've heard, you know, card own kind of summarizing, you know, invest in yourself invest in your brand and investing to ask is, can you have a little tear?
I would just kind of like a simplified version of your investing strategy, I think, A pretty good, I think this nation.
10:30
I mean overall, it's like you invest in yourself because you get one, you get skills, you invest in your brand because it's matter what you do, your brand is still be there and it will jumpstart anything, right?
And then you have a set success.
I think biggest issue.
Most people have, is they start trying to invest way too early.
I mean, I didn't actually make my first investment decision and so I think I had 14 million after taxes in my bank account.
10:52
Like, I didn't even make that, and some people were like, that's crazy.
That's ridiculous.
But it's at the same time, like that's kind of what they say.
Something, Ryan nesting, all this money but the broken.
Like, what are you?
What are you investing?
A mic broke.
The only people who would criticize that are poorer than you, right?
11:08
I'm just so, number one tip of advice.
Don't listen to people poorer than you second piece of advice.
Don't listen people poorer than you want to be.
If you're an employee then the it's a totally different equation for an employee and you know what your, what Your fixed income, you know?
I mean like what your income is going to be more or less than I would still invest in skills.
11:26
So I could get a better job that pays That's me unless you're like, I'm a teacher.
I love being a teacher in.
This is only wonder if there's my life.
Cool, if that's what you're doing, then, you've already won because you love what you're doing.
And then you're, you know, you're putting a certain percentage your paycheck away.
If you're like, I, I want to make more money, then you should be investing in the skills that are going to take you to the next level of your job.
11:45
Because trying to save on sixty thousand dollars a year.
When if you just invest in yourself, you can get to 250,000.
You're in a better position.
Like, like 12 months later, then why would we waste time trying?
To invest the excess 10 grand to get the SP return when you can 4X your income, right?
12:04
It's just it's it doesn't make sense, right?
And I'll tell you, this last point is like a passion about this is that like every super rich person you see and people ask me for investing advice.
This isn't a shaky.
I'm just saying, in general people ask me for investing advice because now I have money to invest a most a nation quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you, alright?
12:27
So, Send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
I got money by making money, not by investing every single wealthy super, you see, you know, mr.
12:48
Wonderful yeah. 400 million dollar exit.
Mark Cuban billion dollar exit.
So people see this and like, oh, you must be a good investor was like, well, he just received all this cash and then he had to allocate it, right?
And so then at that point then yeah it's then the fundamentals come in buy stuff for less than it's worth so far more than it is.
13:04
Right.
Like I mean that the stuff doesn't have to be overly complex but most people do it way out of sequence had an 18 year old message.
Me after saying hey I invested too two thousand dollars on getting $100 a month quote passively for my two thousand dollars.
What should I do?
And I'm like, you should take the two grand and by course on how to make more money, that's also because what we're dealing with no flow.
13:23
So thank you really for an employee or an entrepreneur then I think the thresholds even higher or an employee.
It's a lower threshold and because there's there's less variability.
You can you can always Park certain amount with entrepreneurs.
Like I spent every dollar I had on more education, more skills, more.
13:42
A small Network, more, whatever.
This who I couldn't find places to put the excess money.
Thank you so much, man.
You guys all go out and buy out his book.
It is like by far the best book on marketing, some of our top students, one of our guys, in our group Frank, I get Frank, it'll shut out.
14:00
He does over 40K on a bad day and he's on one of her top guys and he said to me I just listened to outscore moseys book called A I talk to Tanner to he said oh I'm going to make a few extra million off that Look, so Guys, these are like these are exceptional marketers, who already doing incredible things, and Alex is here, sharing and giving you guys.
14:22
I know he's got loads and loads more.
This is the best stuff on this subject matter that we're talking about today, to help you guys grow.
And we also hear a story.
I really appreciated.
You, Alex are sharing your story under podcast, serial humanizes himself.
I think that's really crucial to help people break out of that survival and scarcity mindset.
14:40
When they're first starting, and I was really Spire just to hear those are first few years in your journey so thank you for sharing all that how awesome it was to not make my first million dollars for so your six you know and most people don't hear that and they think that they're the only person struggling out there, right?
14:57
Yeah.
The person going through this right now.
I'm the only person that's you know, having all this, you know, rejection like no that's pretty normal.
Hopefully this looks to just in the fitness space.
It's it's by its nature, very aesthetic, you know, status.
Even space over.
15:13
All right, everyone's posting on Instagram, literally, right.
Sure, you know, looking cool.
I'll just tell you the story to maybe drive this point home, but like, there is a guy that I know who's right reach out to me multiple times for help.
He's going most lost everything multiple times in the last couple years.
Season them how to make money on Internet space.
15:30
And I saw little really put up and it was like how to be a millionaire before third I texted him and I said, are you a millionaire?
He's like, well I mean I've done a million dollars in sales and I was like, do you need Define.
What millionaire is is like well okay well no I'm not a millionaire.
15:46
I was like then stop fucking pretending to be ones so that you stop feeling like a piece of shit all the time because you text me about how you feel like a fraud and like it's because you are so stop and so I think it's like it's so much it's so much better and I'll just say this from experience.
It's so much easier to have influence.
16:03
Once you the thing then to try and get influence to make money, make money and then you'll have the influence and then you won't feel like a fraud because you can In point back to evidence, most people have no evidence.
So you have to rely on your own pump up and stories and emotions, which are fleeting.
16:20
And I think the only way to stay in the game for a long period of time is to have Bedrock a foundation upon, which to build your own church, right?
And so the business is your church, then you have to build on a strong Foundation.
Like I love Gary these things.
Like the first video I made was I was 34.
He's like we'd already done 60 million, you know, in annual revenue before I even start talking about this stuff, right?
16:40
And so I would say there's a common theme Throughout like the little trajectory and I'm going over, but it's all good.
You nuts.
Well, like I had one Jim and that Jim was very profitable.
I didn't start selling how to make money with your gym for my one.
16:56
Jim, I didn't start it after to Jim's, I did started after five Jim's.
I didn't start at.
I just heard after six years, right?
But even when I had six gems, I wasn't sure if I was going to be good enough yet.
So I started doing turnarounds and I did almost a year of turn around before I got rid of my chips.
And then from there after doing the 33 turnarounds at that point for almost two years was when I was like, you know, I feel like maybe I'd be able to do this now, right?
17:20
And then we did 30 million in our second year.
People are like, dude your business coaching and I'm like I think I'm just going to keep doing this thing that I'm doing.
You know what?
Dude you should use for Cairo.
You should do this for so long and I was like, I think I'm just going to keep doing them do it.
And if another two years, right, 120 million in sales and I'm like, okay, you know, I'll write a 99-cent book and just see how How that goes yeah, it s up.
17:41
Yeah, after he wins a gold medal, he doesn't start coaching on how to create gold medals.
He's he goes up to then he's got his already thinking about the next Olympics.
The next Super Bowl the next championship?
Yeah.
I get, you know, I mean, I'm not anywhere near where, you know, that level but I totally appreciate, you know, wanting to respect the process of seeing how far you can take it.
18:01
The process, I think that the longer you, wait, the higher.
The peak of the pyramid is the reason so much stuff everyone sees on the Internet is so So, useless is because it's regurgitated, it's not first knowledge.
People are teaching stuff.
They've never done which means they're not good at teaching it because they don't actually understand it, which is why you should never fear a competitor, who copies you very nature.
18:25
They won't be better than you.
They require you to exist.
You do not require them.
You really do know.
So your value creation, someone else, they didn't give you credit me to that location, the team after the lawsuit.
Yeah, exactly.
18:41
Exactly.
Because they're trailing right there.
If you're innovating and they're always Trail, they're always a couple steps behind its never is known owns truth.
This is true, right?
And so anyways, the reason people sound better than other people is because they have depth of knowledge and you create of knowledge through executing the same patterns in different stimuli in different environments.
19:03
So you see different outcomes.
And so then you see this huge pattern, huge array, and you're able to have deeper inferences around the things that actually matter.
Right talked about the you know, the early early selling thing we talked about earlier in terms of recites, right?
Yeah, that comes because I've done it.
Yeah, I'll serve been on here and had not done it.
19:21
They would have made something up and it wouldn't have worked.
Now you're saying I t.d. t.d.
Bishop Jake's past.
He says a lot of people use language To cover up lifestyle and it's this, we live in the Twitter Nation, right?
And yet everybody kind of skimmed the surface, nobody can really scuba dive with their subject matter.
19:38
And I think, you know, that's why I'm ever going to write a parenting book outs, it sound like kids are about 45 years old than maybe other and they're out of the house securely married.
Then maybe I'll write a parenting book but that's why.
Yeah, my dad always says, don't export things that aren't working inside.
The homes exist.
19:54
Don't go.
Preach on social media.
How your marriage is when you and flabby are still fighting.
It said Like, get your own ship in order, right?
And I think that's just what a great standard to hold to, and to just say, hey, I'm going to get my for start preaching up.
I got to be living this out.
20:10
I love it.
Like, get your own ship in order, right?
And I think that's just what a great standard to hold to, and to just say, hey, I'm going to get my for start preaching up.
I got to be living this out.
I love it.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, business is not hard in that.
That it is not complicated.
It is hard because people cannot stay focused on the same thing for a long period of time.
It's also, because once people make a certain amount of money, if they only did it for the income, they're trying to find the next index and make more income rather than the mission of the business.
0:45
The wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
This podcast, the game, my attempt at documenting the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
Growing businesses is hard because it's different than people expect it to be.
1:04
And I continue to get more nuanced and more detailed in my understanding of growing businesses to more businesses.
I've ground.
And the more I'm doing this, the more the, the singularity of focus is so important, my team knows that we get presented opportunities.
Every single day that could distract us and thing is the bigger.
1:21
You get the bigger, the opportunity presented to you.
So the harder it is to say no.
And so on to tell a quick story about the woman in the red dress and I'm going to I'm going to relate it to be. - so in The Matrix, one of my favorite movies, there's the woman in the red dress and so it's one of the training programs that Morpheus takes Neo on the main character to teach him one simple lesson.
1:40
And so they're walking through a crowd, it's normal, New York, lots of people, everyone looks different.
And then there's this woman in this red dress walking towards inches like stands out from the crowd and NEOS head turns and Morpheus is still talking to him trying to teach him a lesson, right?
And then he looks back and more feels like we're listening.
1:56
It was like why do you like we're looking at one of the red dress and he says look again.
It looks back at the woman and it's agent Smith putting a gun to his head.
And the thing is, is I see distractions and New Opportunities shiny object as the woman in the red dress and at every level of business, the woman in the red dress becomes more and more attractive, right?
2:14
Because at first, you have to say no to a thousand opportunities than 10,000 and 100,000 you have to learn how to say no again.
And every level was I thought the once I learned how to say no to the one in the red dress, I'd be done forever, but that's not true.
She comes back hotter, you know, whatever, whatever ways you want to like with makeup and hair.
2:29
Who know your plastic surgery and every level she just gets hotter and hotter and hotter because you get better and better and better.
And so the quality of the red woman in the red dress that you can attract is higher the higher up in the game you go.
And so, when I look at the businesses that we have, I used to think that like Innovation was everything and I think Innovation is important to very, very small degree but the vast majority of the business success is actually doing all the stuff that, you know, you should be doing but you aren't.
2:55
So A friend of mine has a wife who's really popular.
He runs all over.
Their businesses and they have literally 60 businesses.
He's an Excel sheet to keep track of all the businesses he has.
And I think they make about total between everything, maybe eight figures a year maybe, and that might and to somebody like, oh, that's amazing.
3:12
But hear me out.
So, we're having this long conversation and I just said, you know, if there were a magic wand and you could snap your fingers and eliminate all businesses.
But one how easy do you think it be to grow that business?
He was like, oh my God, it'd be so easy to grow that to like 30 or 50 million was like, then why don't you do that?
3:28
And he said that that question.
Ian has messed with him for an entire year and he has since that conversation shut down business after business after business after business.
So he could focus on the one that he thought was the biggest opportunity because Mark Zuckerberg didn't have side hustles.
Right?
If you do one thing and you do it, right?
3:45
And do it all the way you can get as big as you want, you can have a lawn mowing business that cover the entire United States, you could do that.
You could have a Cosmetics business that covers the entire United States.
You could have whatever type of business, you want that covers everyone.
You could do.
If you waited for a long enough, your time and didn't get distracted, it's one of my favorite quotes is by Neil Strauss.
4:04
He said, success comes down to doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing yourself.
You're smarter than you are.
It's one of my favorite quotes about business because it's the details that pay the dividends.
It's the depth and the Nuance of understanding how to do something.
4:21
And so, for example, right now like there's a obviously lots of opportunities that we have.
But the thing is is that I still don't feel like we're doing the basics.
He's right, like, if we're not on every platform, why are we think about starting your business?
If we're not hardcore email marketing regularly in providing value or why are we gonna start their business?
4:41
If we're not even building the SEO out on our site?
Why are we doing something else?
If we haven't completely, built out the sales training for our sales, team, to keep their their execution.
Hi, why are we think about doing other things?
And so, so many entrepreneurs that I see, we're talking about how they want to grow their business and do this next new thing or this exciting add-on aren't even doing I think the basics and the thing and I've said this before, but being Advanced means that you never don't do the basics.
5:07
And if you're like, well Alex that's going to take so much time for me to do each of those things.
Welcome to building a big business because big businesses do the same things, little businesses do, but they do them better and they fill the holes in the bucket.
And so if you were to think about a business as a bucket and you've got water pouring in the top, which is the traffic or the eyeballs or whatever, and then the bucket is what you're keeping, right?
5:29
So, So the first thing that you're going to do, right, if you want to grow the amount of watch, having the bucket is, you don't have multiple buckets, right?
What you're going to do is probably fix the holes in the bucket.
You got right?
Number one, fix the bucket.
Number two, once you fix the bucket, increase the flow to the bucket, once you've done that and you've completely maximize that then you add new flows, but most people have never done that.
5:53
And so the moniker that I remember about this is better more new and so whenever I'm thinking Our business or our businesses in the portfolio.
I think have we maxed out better yet?
If we have not matched better yet, there's no point in incurring, the risk of more new because more is riskier than better.
6:12
Better is the lowest risk opportunity that everyone has do what you're currently doing.
Do it better right?
Followed faster, follow-up more make better copy, make better creative optimize your site, hire better people, train them, better have better Management Systems better incentive systems be like, but I know it sounds so boring.
6:28
Welcome to growing Big shit.
How you do it?
You literally fill all the holes in the bucket that, you know, you should be doing but aren't and so right now hear me out, if you were to make a list of the top 25 things that you could do in your business that you are not doing right.
6:45
The obvious things that you know, would make you more money if I emailed more out of me more, if I did more reach out something more money.
If I if I made more contact make more money, right?
If I train my sales team or if I did more call reviews, I make more money if I reorganized our customer onboarding process.
If I created a better case, Our training for our customer support team or customer success.
7:01
Team we'd make more money, put out every single of the obvious bullets that you have that, you know, where your business, instead of doing the new thing, do those first.
And once you finish that list, what you will see happen, and this is why it's spiritually difficult as an entrepreneur because we like to do new shit.
7:17
It's why we started the business.
Begin with, we stopped doing the old thing, we started the new thing and we got reinforced, nap behavior, and so we learned the wrong lesson.
We learned that when we start a new things, good things happen.
And so we think we Start new things, but this is where it's difficult.
We have to learn at each level is that you started the new thing and you got rewarded, but now if you start another thing, you will get punished and some people never unlearn that first lesson.
7:42
And so you have to switch from new to better because the Innovation already happened.
We got the product Market fit.
As soon as people start buying the thing you're selling, that's when the new needs to end for a while because now you just need to do better and more.
So you fill the holes in the bucket with all the better and then you do more, then you go from.
7:59
One piece of content a day, 25 pieces, of content a day from one sales guy to five sales guys, right?
From one video editor, 25 video, editors from one.
I mean, I can keep going with this, right?
You get the idea.
It's about doing more once you fix the first one and make it better.
Hey guys, real quick.
8:17
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
8:45
Businesses will grow by default and they will beat their competition if they do everything their competition does.
But better, because what happens is most controversial divert resources from their core thick.
So, think about the two paths.
You've got boring entrepreneur number one who finally finds product Market fit people like the stuff that they're selling and then they say I'm not going to do anything new for next 5 years, I'm going to do is do this better and do more of it.
9:08
So I'm going to do and then you think about the other guy who says oh we got some product Market, fit, fantastic.
Now I'm going to do something else.
And I get to get my rocks off, get my jollies over here, thinking about all this new stuff, all this new market all this new product.
While the other business starts to wither away a little bit because atrophy starts happening because the things that were there, when you're overseeing aren't happening anymore anyways, and not only that, it's never improving and cost of media goes up cost of talent.
9:33
Goes up in the business is literally getting worse relative, the market over time if you're not improving it.
And so you got these two entrepreneurs in this guy's diverting resources, that would have been allocated back to the same bucket, to fill the holes as instead taking some of that and trying to Build another Bucket over here.
Trying to build another Bucket over here.
And meanwhile, the holes are getting bigger in the first bucket because it's getting worse and worse and worse.
9:53
And so, then they find themselves with five buckets that are all tons of holes in them.
They don't have the bandwidth to actually go to the one bucket and fix it.
And that's when I asked the magic one question.
So right now, if you have multiple things going on, how easy would it be to grow your business?
If I could wave a magic wand, snap my fingers and everything ended except for one, Pretty easy, right?
10:14
So why not stack the chips in your favor?
The thing that makes it hard is the discipline.
You have to have not the concept, right?
And so, one of the things I like saying, is that strategy is easy execution, is hard, right?
It's the execution risk.
That is the much bigger risk for most businesses like conceptually, if you deliver dry cleaning, that is always clean, always right?
10:36
And always on time, you'll have an exceptional business.
Like, think about that from like the strategy isn't?
Kitt.
It's the execution is where everyone fails, but this is the thing is that the strategy is the new and exciting thing.
And so people allocate tons of attention, tons of time to new strategies, new ideas, new, everything rather than making the obvious truth of.
10:59
If I deliver everyone, their clothes on time and they are always perfectly clean.
This business will work.
And so, one of the things that we do when we're growing the business, after understanding better more new, when we think about anything that we're growing is what are the need to believes what?
Do we need to believe for this to grow?
We need to believe that people will always want things fast do.
11:17
Is that something I want to bet on?
Yes, people always want a good product, so that we clean their clothes perfectly every time.
Well, do I believe that that's something that people want the future as much?
They want to date were more.
Yes, people will always want good service.
Do I believe that this Improvement on the future or in the day?
11:33
Yes, it's one of the Beautiful Things is that when you enter a market, like something is boring is dry cleaner.
Boring is Lawn Care, boring is whatever is that, oftentimes, you're actually not competing is the smartest.
The world because most people are on Silicon Valley all trying to make the next platform.
But there's tons of other businesses that you can absolutely demolish.
11:50
Who are making lots of money just by doing the basics.
Well and what makes them Basics is how hard they are to understand but what makes you advance is how well you execute them.
That's the thing.
Like it's not hard to conceptualize that you take 10 guys and each guy makes two hundred calls a day.
12:05
It's 2,000 calls me.
It's not hard to conceptualize that but it's how well did you train them?
How.
Well did you recruit them?
What is there inside?
Of structure.
Do you listen to calls on a regular basis?
Is there a leader board?
Because you're thinking yourself, when you have that big list of, we need to do competition for the sales team.
I need to get that leaderboard, set up.
Oh yeah, I need to be, we're doing more call reviews.
12:22
That is the stuff that grows the business.
It's not the big idea.
As long as the need to believe makes sense, then the foundational tenets of the business end unless you're in high tech and you're trying to create something that the market doesn't know it once yet, which is basically what big Tech bets are, is that you're creating something that the market is even know it wants, right?
12:42
But I'm telling you, I've never made money in that.
I've made money.
Going to things that I know the market wants and doing it better.
People always want leads promise you you know how to get leads, you know how to get a better you will make tons of money.
People always need a place to live.
You have better buildings that are cleaner and things run, right?
12:57
And you treat your residence while you have successful buildings, if you have lawn care where everyone communicates well and is you know cost-effective and the grass always looks great and the hedges are clean lines and you do it at the Cadence that's perfect for most people.
13:13
You will have a good business.
And the thing is you might be competing as people who don't even think that way.
And so you can absolutely take their lunch money but you have to not get fancy right?
And so I'll end with a little story that was a huge meaningful story to me.
So when I was going through the sale process for two of our companies, the bankers introduced me to a couple of other CEOs that they had done deals with because I was like, I wanted to know what it was like after.
13:37
It's things like that they're not.
We can just connect with these guys.
So I talked to one of them and the conversation changed, my life.
I was telling about what, you know, the dreams.
I wanted to do and all this stuff etcetera and he was a mercenary.
So he was a third time, CEO that private Equity by company, Place him in heat, grow it, and then they'd sell it and he'd done that three times.
13:54
Already.
Super season guy, who's a Long Island guy, really thick accent and he's like, you know, backyard football was like yeah, it's like everybody wants the super fancy trick plays.
You know?
It's like okay hike and then I you know, fix to the left and then we go, right?
And then it's actually going to be a reverse, you know, whatever.
14:10
And then and then we toss it.
And then what do you know what happens?
He catches it.
Then fumbles it, and the other team takes down for Touchdown.
He's like, no.
We're doing Simple backyard football.
He's like two fat guys.
In the middle, run to the right consistent yardage.
He's like don't be cute and he said that and it really changed the way I saw business.
14:31
He's like you don't need to have any fancy play to be successful.
You just have to be willing to get the consistent yardage and when you do consistent yardage on a thesis that makes sense.
People want, clean clothes people want them fast.
People want good service and if you execute on that for ten, Years and you fill every hole in the bucket.
14:50
Your business Grows by default because your competitors won't do that.
Business is not hard in that, it is not complicated.
It is hard because people cannot stay focused on the same thing for a long period of time.
It's also, because once people make a certain amount of money, if they only did it for the income, they're trying to find the next index and make more income rather than the mission of the business.
15:10
Because if you believe in the mission of the business, you will be willing to do it for an extraordinary long period of time.
And I can tell you right now from all different that I Have that make shitloads of money, they've all been doing the same thing for a long period of time.
So as much as the world wants to tell you, you should have 17 majors in college and you should taste everything.
15:27
I think there's value to that, it will not fight against the reality.
That been Francis started Jim shark, when he was whatever 17, and now he's 28 or 29, he's got a billion dollar thing.
So could he have tasted more stuff.
Sure, he tasted from, like 14 to 17, right.
15:43
But then, when he started that, he's been doing it for ten or eleven years now.
And now, he's a billion-dollar thing.
And so the work needs doing and you just need to decide when you want to start the compound and clock in your favor which means how long can I commit to this thing?
And so, I would say, once you've had a little bit of your entrepreneurial licks as fast as you can to learn those lessons.
16:01
If you think what need to believe is there that I do not think will change over an extended time Horizon and then serve that and then every day all you do is you look at how to do better and how to do more of it, how to do it better, how to do more of it and it's going to kill you inside because you like doing new shit.
16:17
It.
And that's what was positively reinforced, your entire life as an entrepreneur in the beginning and then you have to unlearn that lesson because that's what it takes to get big.
As you do the same thing and you just do it that much better than everyone else and that takes time.
And that's why big businesses take time.
It is arrogant to believe that you were going to out-compete other people who are fully focused on one thing when you were split on 5.
16:40
And the thing is plenty people arrogant.
So many of you will still do this but you also still be poor.
So whatever some dude is he's got a lawn care business.
All he does is longer all day every day.
That's all he does, is mow Lawns and Britt built this business because he want he believes that everybody deserves amazing long because he's got a story when he's a kid and that was the only thing that is parents could do was cut the lawn to even though they were poor.
16:59
It was like something that give them status neighborhood.
And he remember his dad crime because you can, somebody get me a compliment on and he hadn't gotten compound forever, whatever.
That reason is, he's driven to make that company, right?
And he got the other guy who's like, oh yeah, doing Drop Shipping.
And I'm doing some long hair stuff and I'm doing some Consulting gigs on the side for marketing and I'm, you know, I'm doing, you know, And FTS whatever right?
17:19
He's got all these things going on, who is going to win at long hair?
It's obvious.
And yet we still live like this other guy.
And so my hope is that you recognize that if that's you stop and I'm only saying this from place to place because I had nine businesses before Jim wants took off and before you think, oh well what I'm going to do because I hear this all the time, I'm going to do them all and we'll see which one takes off.
17:44
None of them will take off because any of them could take off.
If you just focus on one of them, it's conflating sequence.
It's saying I think that because what it is, is its thinking that the outside Market is somehow going to make you successful.
Like you're going to pick the right bet, right?
18:02
When you can force any of them to be successful by providing not selling newspapers.
Write like as long as you have something, that's not obviously a stupid idea, right?
And you have normal businesses that you're trying to build an acquaintance of mine from high school.
We haven't like stayed in touch but he saw the stuff that we know the success we had, he said, Hey, can we talk sometimes?
18:18
So I got on the phone with them and he said, hey I've got a roofing business, you know?
It's awesome.
I said, oh, that's great.
He said, oh yeah we also do real estate flipping.
I was like, all right, is it?
Oh, and we also do General Contracting, those like okay.
So we do window stuff to that's actually glass and windows.
18:34
We do that stuff too because it's like, you want to be vertically integrated for Real Estate.
I was like, did you do it like 4 million bucks a year?
Like, you're not vertically integrated, you're just distracted.
Like, if you look at the biggest roofing companies in the world, their billion dollar companies, Billion, multi-billion dollar companies the richest woman in the u.s. is built off of roofing business.
18:53
So like you can do one thing to scale and make all the money you want.
And you will only get there with the scale from the details from the depth, right?
That's how you get these compounding returns from doing the same thing over and over.
Again, you get better, better better better addict, right?
19:09
Whereas the other guy who's got four things, he's never going to get good at any of them, he's just going to be barely good enough.
He's going to make barely good enough money, right?
And so if you're not Not making money in any of the things is because you don't understand any of them.
Well enough, because if you can see anybody in your industry, who's doing the thing that you're doing and making 100 times more money than you because they know it better than you.
19:26
So how quickly you're going to pay down the ignorance?
You're going to try and divide it by 4.
You can try and pay down the ignorance that have one of them as fast as you can.
So you can start the compounding.
And that's one of the big mistakes has

Some ways, a nation van podcast with Ryan, Denny Moran of capitalism.com, we broke down marketing promises and delivering on high ticket offers.

We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good evening, friends and neighbors and hormoz.
He's tonight special.
0:58
We brought out the good stuff tonight, Alex.
And I go deep.
When Ryan has whiskey, we want a lie about the last time.
We had whiskey together.
It got a little bit out of hand.
Alex, I'm so pumped for tonight.
I had this weird energy.
Me like no one wants to be around me.
1:14
Children are afraid of me.
I'm so pumped to talk to you.
Dude, you're, you're blowing up for anybody who doesn't know Alex at the thing.
That is amazing to me about him is he and God have a contract where God is like, look Alex, whatever you want, just don't hurt me.
1:38
That's what happens.
That's what happens is.
Alex is just like, listen, I want to be the world's most Jack billionaire that if you could throw a million YouTube subscribers my way it wouldn't hurt you and God is like.
All right, why?
And then Alex, just like it just had just happens and he's like, volume volume.
1:59
So, dude, you have you have the number one book in its category and you haven't even announced it yet.
You're getting like three thousand Subs a day on YouTube.
You have one and a half percent body fat What's up like 12-inch personality, it's great being friends with you.
2:23
You always make me feel great about myself.
Well, give it a minute forever.
Any of you who saw my email recently, or as I said, I have friends to make me feel like the fat kid.
I was talking about Alex?
Yeah, because I would just go to be a pastor.
2:42
God does not listen to me like he listens to Alex.
So we're just kind of go ahead and jump in guys, I have a a total blatant pitch and ask tonight and it's gonna cost you ladies and gentlemen, let me let me tell you Alex, we all know the secret reason that you really put out a ton of content on the internet and it's because you need to get rich selling 99-cent books, right?
3:05
And I know you get like 35% of that from Kindle so you're like, I know that's the real reason selfish.
Why you're doing all this?
So look the man's got to eat.
He's got to feed these biceps and we have a book, it caused a whole 99 Cents and you're going to have to go all the way to Amazon to get it.
3:25
But this is what I'm going to ask all of you to do but by the end of tonight, in fact you should start doing it.
Now you should go to amazon.com search for Alex whore.
Mozi hit the buy button and review the book once you've read it.
3:42
It like review the book, we all know how this works, you are most of your Amazon sellers.
You're going to leave a review.
A good one for Alex's book because I can guarantee you that it's going to be the best book that you read all year best book I've read in a decade.
3:59
So unless you're ten times better than me, it's gonna be the best book you read all here.
So Alex, I've told you this privately, but the thing that I admire about you, And the thing that is so impressive about the fact that you have their you're tolerant, your total revenue is like a hundred million dollars on your main businesses.
4:22
You have businesses that give you 10% of top-line just to be an advisor and this book is going to go nuts.
They all have the thing in common of your emphasis is on really quality product and that's not how most Internet entrepreneurs approach things could you comment on your approach going on in like into any new business?
4:52
So I thought it would be appropriate for a book that was about the product to be a good product in and of itself.
And so what I'd have to spend a new inordinate amount of time on the book to make sure that it was really good so that I could be.
So I could hold up to the standard that I was trying to tell people that matters.
5:09
Yeah so if I'm looking at a business, the First thing that we usually do is look at, like, what is the value that you are providing, right?
Like what, what is the amount of value that's being provided, the end user?
And is there a way that we can repackage that value to enhance it?
And the repackaging can happen in a variety of ways and I go through that in the book, terms of like, can you do more?
5:29
Can we make things happen faster than we making this happen easier when you do it with less sacrifice?
Can we do, you know those types of things that we can recombine it and that's in a real way?
But then on top of each of those things, we think, like, can we do that in just a perceptual shift?
Like, is there a way that we can change the way they're perceiving the value that they are getting from the product?
5:47
And a lot of times, those are almost more valuable in a real way than even changing things.
About the product itself.
Would you would you comment a little bit?
What do you mean that the perception can be more valuable?
So I'll give you.
I'll give everybody here like a simple example.
So there are things besides the actual thing, you're delivering that create value around it.
6:07
And so if I were to say, hey we have two surgeons and you want to get plastic surgery for whatever reason.
And for one search, and it's their first order they've ever done.
And another surgeon, it's their 10,000th surgery, which of these would you value more?
Now, mind you.
It might take the first guy twice as long to do the surgery.
6:24
Compared to the said guys, you're going to get half the time of the 10,000 rep guy, compared to the one, the first time rough guy.
Are you still even though this guy is going to take half as much time with you, you still probably be willing to pay the ten thousand guy more.
And that is because perceived likelihood of achievement, is one of the things that creates value in a product and so if we can Big these different lenses or layers into the value that we're providing.
6:46
Then we can without actually changing our product itself.
Make it more valuable.
Yeah, I have an old Mentor.
He used to describe this as the magician versus The Mule.
The mule is paid to go out and work all the time.
7:02
Gets kicked when it stops and the magician goes field is plowed and and we overemphasize the effort or the time going.
Into it.
Sometimes when were the provider, but in the users eyes, they just want field.
Plowed, and one of the things that reading your book reframed for me was, like, I get intellectually.
7:25
The idea of developing a product that is customer-centric.
But in reality, my actions have always mapped that of a marketer.
It's been.
Okay, how do I make this dance on the page?
Rather than how do I create the absolute best fulfillment possible.
7:45
And when that's the foundation, of what you are asking, then marketing and sales is still important.
But it's really easy to do.
You don't like one of the things that I really love about the way you advertise is your headlines.
8:03
You don't have to make them sexy because they're already sexy because they're what the person wants.
So yeah, big Believers in marketing.
The actual, you know, the product itself rather than the promise and letting that kind of take care of it.
So like we're big on like for everyone who's listening right now.
8:19
Like we're really big on tracking the data of client success, you know on average has like you probably don't see a lot of like internet, marketers, for example, saying our average client make sex in why period of time like no one says that because most people's average Clank is zero right already in I'd say the meeting clay would be 0, right?
8:38
And so Frost Actually a kpi that we track within the business.
And that's one of the apis that we we drive towards it.
Just like how can we get the average revenue collected, you know, per client up within the first few days.
The first 30 days for 60 days.
And so we track all those things because we know that the more money we make our customers, the more everything else happens.
8:56
And one of the, you know, some of the truths like there are certain truths that things that you discover early said.
I feel like I've discovered as we've been on this journey, it's like the more money that we make other people, the more money we make period.
And I think that just putting that hat on has been, is I'm That's what this book is like.
I know that giving away the book for 99 cents at a course that accompanies it.
9:14
Like, I'm sure I could sell it and I could sell out a coaching program and I could do all that.
But like, I don't want to do that and I enjoyed making it.
And so that's kind of the point of doing it.
One of the things that you say in the just the description of the book is that you are out earning, you know, the CEO, is it publicly traded companies without having upsell flows that were dialed in without my goodness without sending.
9:39
To your list, you know, with, with without doing a bunch of complicated marketing.
Would you would you comment a little bit about that because like you're you're in our world and like entrepreneur?
Well, your most famous and like the funnel hacking, one click upsell like that, that world, but you use that as a tool, it's not your business.
10:02
You haven't had a lot of that dialed in and you've still made tens of millions of dollars.
So would you would you comment on that?
Yeah, we're embarrassingly bad at most things.
I just I think I think most people at least when I when I talk to a lot of entrepreneurs, I think one of the biggest skills that's important as learning how to discern priority like what is important, like there's so much information, right?
10:25
So, it's like, all the stuff is coming out at us, like, what is most important?
And we have such limit.
Like, we have such limited resources, like as entrepreneurs, such limited resources capital, and the biggest one, just being attention, right?
We have such limited attention for ourselves but just as importantly or more Only our teams and so it's like I might only be able to move one or two rocks board this year, you know?
10:45
I mean, like really like big important things and you kind of have to commit to whatever that rock is.
And if you can't pick the rock, then you move zero rocks for, right?
It's people like remove nine things where it's like, yeah, but you got, you didn't actually get any of them done correctly.
So it's like you have to really and I think developing the software companies with taught me a lot about this, but it's like you only have and we have to commit that this is the one thing that we're going to do and we're actually going to do it well.
11:08
And I think picking that That is one of the hardest things, but if you pick, well, then a lot of other things, kind of, take care of themselves.
And so, like, coming from the marketer world.
The reason a lot of people care about is because they have zero word of mouth.
If anything, they have - order, mmm, like literally Word of Mouth works against them.
11:26
Like, I mean, we even talked about in the marketing world is like fighting refunds.
You know, you're just like, you do all the mark, like, all the sails on the front end.
You like, hoping people don't refund and you and I You're saying I mean like or if you're just really good your customers, you get a ton of word-of-mouth and no one refunds anyway.
11:46
Yeah, I mean, we do a lot of stuff that's kind of unheard of, you know, we do we run free trials, like anybody can sign up for a program for free.
Like, you don't have to sound like, you don't have to pay today, and yet we still get 45% of our clients.
Prepay the entire thing within the first 30 days.
12:02
They'd shoot, you don't have to.
And so, it's like, you have somebody who can try something, they can choose, not to buy it.
And not only that they choose to prepay the entire, Thing, you know, within the first month when they had the option not to and I think that's just it just speaks to like, how can we how can we on board customers the way, how can we activate them?
12:17
You know, what are the leading indicators?
We know that are going to create a successful customer and how can we reverse engineer that?
And how do we know that with that looks a tad 8:30 and what it was all about day 60, it was okay, a 90 and then when we focus on those things, we can drive up our lifetime, gross profit per customer so far beyond what anyone else in our space can do.
12:33
It makes the marketing as ugly as mine is still wildly profitable.
And so, I mean, one of the claims in the book You that you heard is that, you know, we have a 36 to one lifetime return to advertising and right now it's actually little higher than that.
And so for every dollar we spend we, you know, almost $40 back and that's been over my entire career.
12:50
So it's not like this one campaign that we talk about because I like scented DM to someone that you know, about always I made a four thousand dollar sale that's every dollar that we spent.
And so I think it's because we focus on the back end and really seeing how can we deliver this thing faster?
13:06
How can we make it more convenient for them?
How can we deliver Were in the channel or medium that they want to consume it in, how can we help me do this so that we can decrease the effort and sacrifice on their behalf?
So the stress that they have to go through?
What are the what are the Hoops that they normally would have to jump through?
13:22
How many of those hips?
Can we jump through ourselves?
How can we increase their perception of of likely of achievement?
Because we can get somebody who's more convicted that.
What we're going to do is going to work then they're actually in a very real way going to receive more value.
That's right.
That's right and I want to point out something Alex.
13:37
What does before one of Target clients meets you.
What is their average income?
2943 dollars a month.
That's that was very specific.
I just know the average.
So it's like, 36 or so like.
13:54
All right, so everybody listen, Alex is average client, but when they, when they sign up with Alex, his customer makes on average.
Thirty six thousand dollars per year.
Alex, what is your least expensive product?
14:09
It cost.
However well actually actually for those of you who are watching live, what in the comments, what you think?
Alex is lowest his self.
Liquidating offer his front.
14:25
End offer a trip wire.
Yeah, what is it?
What is his lowest least expensive product cost?
I want to see, tell me our average client earns 36,000. oh, All right, we got thousand dollars, ten thousand dollars, nine dollars, forty seven dollars a free book. $99 a dollar 999.
14:54
For thousands.
All right.
Alex what what is your front end offer?
Cost is 20 20 dollars twenty twenty Grand yeah twenty thousand dollars is your is his low end.
15:14
Listen this is an important Point here.
First of all, we just shattered a bunch of beliefs I can't sell a Nike.
I can't sell my candle for 40 bucks.
Now, Alex is client.
15:34
Makes 36,000 his lowest price product cost, 16 Grand.
And you just heard him say that.
After they join, they love Alan tearily pay it off early, why?
Because the entire product is focused on getting wins and results for the customer.
15:54
And what's your highest tier program, Alex?
It's 42,000 42,000.
Yeah, and you have quite the take rate, if I remember correctly.
Yeah, I think we were at 60 percent.
I get sixty percent.
16:10
Yeah.
And these people are strong armed and wrestled into upgrading or they choose voluntarily.
The two bones.
Charlie.
And we let them try it out before they can choose to pay for it.
Okay?
You guys seeing this.
That the entire structure of how Alex thinks is, how do we remove all of the barriers for the client for the customer to get the results that they want?
16:37
And if we do that really well by removing as much friction as possible, then they will voluntarily line up to give us money.
It's kind of how business works and that's why I Alex can spend money on Advertising to put people into his Pipeline and win and beat everybody else.
16:56
You might not remember it correctly that nobody was doing this when you started.
And now, everybody is trying to go after the same Market.
Am I remembering that right?
Yeah, I don't think there were many Jim gurus at the time, when we came into the marketplace.
I think the one guy who was selling a high-ticket course, was selling it for 5,000 dollars.
17:14
That was like the highwomen.
Peter at the time and most guys are selling five hundred dollar-a-month, Facebook ads like that for you stuff foot, like for gym owners.
Yeah.
And you just use came in totally owned the marketplace and then a bunch of people copy you.
There's people out there who are teaching it and claiming to be successful at it and then you look at their books and they're not so successful at it and you're you're winning because your clients are getting results more than anything else.
17:41
That my friends is how you put together a hundred million dollar offer.
Which is the name of Alex's book which you should go buy on Amazon right now for 99 cents.
Alex obviously needs the money, obviously, needs you to go buy this book and I need you to go leave a review on Amazon because, you know how this game works.
18:07
Look wise, you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have, if you guys that you help me spread the words, we get out more.
Entrepreneurs, make more money feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
18:31
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
Alex, I was hoping we could spend a minute or two, talking about the ethics of charging 20,000 dollars to someone who makes 36 Grand.
18:49
Because you lay this out, I love the story.
You tell about your dad.
Would you tell that story and explain how you think about going high ticket?
Yeah, so I guess I can try and tell it half as well as I do in the book when I had lots of practice and got the words, right?
19:06
Right.
But I had just posted a picture of our gym, Lords events, pretty covid.
And I think we had 800, sorry. 700 ish people in attendance and I posted it.
And I sent a picture of my dad or keep message me.
I can remember happened.
And he was like, Hey, I thought this was supposed to be the meeting of like you're, you're really highest level Group which is the forty two thousand dollars a year group and I was like, yeah, it is and all of a sudden, he like calls me up and he's extremely concerned.
19:34
He's like Do they know that you're that?
They're getting build that much that I was like, yes, they're aware.
I'm not magically siphoning money from their accounts, like, yes, they're aware.
He's and then he asked, is that legal to which I responded?
Yes, it's legal.
19:50
And he was like, well II and I could tell that there was this pause of like major concern and I was like, all right, if I could make you two hundred thirty nine thousand dollars actually, this year Pops, I was like, would you pay me forty two thousand dollars if you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that you would do that?
Like would you pay me?
Forty-two thousand dollars.
20:06
She's like, well, what would I have to do was like, you'd have to work 15 hours a week for it?
It was like, okay well how long would it take?
And I was like, you would take 11 months to make the entire power money back.
He's like, okay, what I have to pay for it upfront and I was like, no, you could pay for it as you started making it.
20:23
He was like, then, yeah, I would do it.
That was like, and that's why they do it too.
And so for perspective, like as much as Ryan talks about like the numbers, and a lot of, a lot of people have talked about our numbers out of context.
And explained our success without actually being in any way associated with our company.
20:40
As it's the funnel, it's the marketing.
If the whatever quiet that we work with makes an extra two hundred and thirty nine thousand dollars, top line revenue.
They on average, triple their profits 3.1 X, their profit.
They take their take-home income including our fees, none of our fees from 2950 a month to eighty, nine hundred dollars a month.
20:58
And so you're taking something from thirty six dollars or two hundred thousand dollars a year on average, meaning half the people make more money than that.
And so yes.
We Charge 42 thousand dollars a year in order to help someone go from thirty six thousand dollars to a hundred thousand dollars on average, but I think that that's more than reasonable considering what we you know, are efficacy at doing that and you know we purposely Niche down because we understand its pricing and we know that we can provide a better solution than anyone else can for a specific Avatar.
21:24
So it's like, if you are this specific type of person, you run this specific type of facility and you have this specific problem, we can solve it and we've done it four thousand times.
So it's very unlikely that it's been chance at this point.
To, you know, hit the how everyone is, it's possible, it's possible, it's possible, it's not it's not probable.
21:43
And so that's kind of the the overarching scheme which is like everyone always looks like.
What's the trick it selling this more but like there isn't a trick because at a certain point, most people on here are probably have some level of conscious, right?
Like you have some morality of some level of Ethics, not me, not Ryan, but most people, right?
22:02
And so, you have this level of ethics.
And so, what ends up happening, though, is that If you don't actually deliver to the vast majority of the customers that you have, you will self-sabotage, you will stop selling you.
Will, you will give yourself reasons or your sales team will give you reasons or your customer support.
Team will give you reasons as to why we shouldn't continue this business and so like, you have to sell yourself first and the only way to do that is to truly be convicted.
22:25
Unlike the thing is, you can tell people, you're convicted but like only, you know, if you're putting a hundred percent of the effort that you could possibly put in to making the product better than it currently is, Again, Alex is speaking for himself, not all of us have Consciousness Here.
I Am A Johnson & Johnson shil.
22:42
There's this live is brought to you by Johnson & Johnson.
They sponsored this for me to Shell out.
Everybody getting the vaccine out.
I wanted you to comment on, for those of you who do have a conscience, I wanted you to comment about the, the actual ethics of charging High ticket because in your book, you talk about Don't remember if you said this or if this is my own words.
23:08
But charging a lot of money is the most loving thing that you could do for your customer or client.
Yeah.
Would you speak a little bit to that?
So I've always been a premium service guy, so, even when I owned my chain of gyms way back in the day, before I switched to do what we do now, and now we have our portfolio companies because I want yourself from a place of certainty.
23:27
I want to sell from place, a conviction and the certainty that I want to have is not that I am certain that the person will achieve the result because I cannot be certain that someone He's going to eat the food that I tell them that I'm not certain that someone can go to the gym but I can be certain that I'm the best chance they have at being successful.
23:43
And so that's the pivot that you have to make internal.
He's am I truly am I certain?
Because that's where the certainly will come from.
Because anybody who says they're certain that someone's going to get a result is lined themselves.
If there's anything that the client has to do and most people are in a coaching space or education space.
Whatever is the client has to do something.
They have to do something.
23:59
I could teach Spanish and some people are not going to learn Spanish.
I could be the best French teacher in the world, right?
It's going to happen.
And so the question is, Spanish the scam or they're bad students, they're also Bad Teachers.
I talked at length about price in the first third of the book but I'll give you a couple of examples that I think my drive this home.
24:17
So, first off from a value perspective, people will value things in and of itself.
Like, I talked about there's different layers of value, right?
Like things that you can change outside of the product that won't hardly make it more valuable.
So they did a blind taste test with a three, wines a cheap wine, and middle one and expensive wine.
24:34
And the taste testers ask People break the wines and they concurrently rated the wines, you know, better, you know, bad middle good.
According to price from poor, you know, from Chief expensive, whatever, right.
But what ended up being the truth is that we revealed to the people that all three wines were the same.
24:50
And so in a very real way, price provides value to a prospect and that was on a consumer good.
Now, when you can put that on steroids, when it comes to an educational product or something that has to do with training, there is more ler.
And expensive things people want to buy things.
25:08
People will become more convicted the more.
They invested they become so people pay who pay attention right in the more they pay, the more they pay attention, right?
That's right.
The idea around this is that it is more ethical, if I say that, I am trying to best serve my clients and I'm claiming that this is the best chance that they have at being successful.
25:29
Then I must use every lever in my Arsenal to get them invested in their own success.
And so, Called this The Virtuous cycle of price but the more someone pays the more invested they are.
The more invested.
They are the better the results they get the better results, they get the more convicted your sales team is, the more people they sell at higher prices, the more profit you have to reinvest in the Fulfillment to get more clients results and around and around you go and then on top of that for you as the business owner you become more convicted your self-worth.
26:04
Improves the impact You feel like you're making increases and you continue to have this virtuous cycle on the flip side and 0.
And as a final one people who pay the most for also, the lowest maintenance easiest ones to do with.
But if you flip that entire equation it's like why you price your book so high at $0.99 not want annoying readers?
26:23
Yeah, yeah.
I just don't want her doing greeters at all.
The flip side of this is like if you cut your prices, all of a sudden, you have less money for fulfillment people who are less emotionally invested, you attract the worst quality customers.
Action of your sales team drops, you have less profit left over provide, a better product Etc, right?
26:41
And so, it's a virtuous or vicious cycle of price and you, if we are claiming to be ethical individuals and we were claiming that we're going to create a product and of the best chance of getting someone successful.
Then we must anchor in such a way that we're going to get them the most invested so that they are successful.
My favorite thing about all this is you having the conviction and the certainty to be able to sell something well or to sell something at all like And and when you have conviction, you can look at Donald Trump.
27:12
You can say words that don't make sense and people will buy into the conviction that you have for the outcome that you want to create.
And so many entrepreneurs in our space, the internet online business world are trying to find the system that creates money because they are not certain rather than about doing what they are selling.
27:33
What they are certain and that is what creates the results in the success and the thing that shifted from me in your book was that if you put in the required time and commitment to making the product that you have conviction is right for the client in the customer, you win, because you naturally out, sell out market and charge higher prices, get higher profits can more, can have more convicted sales people All over and over, and over again.
28:07
And you said something.
Then we hung out last week about having these levers, that, you know, that you can pull.
Like, I know that when I spend more on Advertising, I make more money when I hire more sales, people, I make more money because you have the foundational pieces, they're in place, and if you don't have that, then those levers to make you broke.
28:30
But when you have that core foundational piece, you can pull all these levers and everything starts to grow.
Is that a fair summary?
Yeah.
What a Zone and would you would you talk a little bit about those levers?
The more advertising, more sales people?
Yeah.
Well, it looks back at like, business issues and over time that have like consistently concurred with, with making more money, hiring more sales people.
28:53
In general makes me more money spending more dollars on Advertising as a whole when I spend more money on Advertising, we make more money.
When I raise prices in general, we make more money.
And so these are these are just been recurring themes that have happened throughout our business career and so we try and do them, you know?
29:12
As I don't know, say as frequently as possible especially made sales team and something like that for sure as frequently as we can't.
Yeah those are.
I mean those so we've done it.
So Alex, there's a question that has come up sit, you know we had it.
We posted the podcast that we did together just a few days ago and I've had this conversation come up quite a few times and I was hoping you could speak to it and it's the question about how Your mindset and your mythology, or methodology applies to physical products.
29:40
So a lot of my audience is Amazon sellers Amazon is kind of naturally incentivized to have the lowest price.
That's what they want to drive up.
They want to have a lot of volume.
It's, it tends to reward, people have the lowest price and so in the e-commerce World, we're definitely skewed to to the Walmart model.
30:03
Yeah, and it Completely flies in the face of what we're talking about, how would you reverse that Trend as an e-commerce entrepreneur?
And, and by the way, everyone Alex is not busy enough.
So he also runs like a 15 to 20 million.
30:19
Dollar-a-year, physical products brand as well.
My under estimating you.
Are you over that?
No, a like 16.
Okay, 16 million.
Awesome.
No he nuts but he's done it.
So would you please comment on how you would reverse that trend?
So the first question is just do I have to sell on Amazon?
30:38
If I do then I look like I can answer that way but if I don't have this let's go.
Let's our guy, we're talking to you're talking to an e-commerce entrepreneur, who sells a million dollars a year across three to four products on Amazon exclusively, okay?
But they're getting squeezed by Price Wars and competing on reviews.
30:57
How do you reverse that Trend with that person?
On Amazon.
Yes.
All right so if I'm on Amazon so there's a section in the book where I talk it's called the delivery Cube.
But basically there's ways that you can peel apart your product and it's a cute because there's six sides to it.
31:14
But this is like when I'm thinking about ideating for a product, this is the process that I kind of go through.
And if we have a physical product it's how can we add any kind of premiums that cost us, nothing that are still going to be valuable?
And so I'm going to just give you a hypothetical example, just drive it, drive this home.
31:30
All right, so let's say Adam is not like I'm going to tie it back to physical products in a second but just bear with me.
So if I had a massage parlor for example and I were and I had a massage and membership or whatever that I was trying to sell.
If I were trying to sell that membership, I could go to Every chiropractor in the area.
31:48
I could go to Every physical therapist in the area.
I could go to Every Orthotics dealer in the area, I could go to Every scented candle person in the area.
I could go to Every Yoga Studio in the area and asked each of them to give me one to two free things of sir.
Services that cost me nothing and put all of those things are single offer.
32:07
All right, love gold.
If I just had, let's say I just give you six examples for one business, right?
So it's six different input like Industries and let's say we had 10 of each of them.
So got 60 free goodies.
Now all of a sudden when I say, hey, if you get a massage, it Alex's massage parlor.
32:22
You also become a VIP member, all right?
In the VIP member means that you're going to get 10 free chiropractor, adjustments.
Going to get 10 free Orthotics.
Pieces, you're going to get 10 free whatever, right.
And so with that I took my thing and made it more valuable by using other people's things on top of it, all right?
32:39
And so I just wanted to use that as a mental reframe for what I'm talking about.
There's a lot of things outside of the product that we can use to make the core product itself more valuable because the customer has a lot of needs.
And the good news is that when somebody has a lot of desires, I mean they have Alex, I'm sorry to interrupt you but how many of you just have the biggest brain yasm of your life?
32:57
Like you can see where this is going you're like, holy fuck.
Fuck.
I thought I think I just saw a piece of the Matrix and put in the comments right now.
If you hashtag brain gasm lift, if you just if you just got a business Boehner like the think like I'm sitting here like, oh my God, this is the greatest thing ever.
33:18
And every page of Alex is book is like, oh my God, like I need a cigarette, I need to step away away from this, that that the hashtag brain.
Guy's arms are starting to are starting to happen.
We've got multiple brain, guys them too.
Happening in the comments, Alex.
All right.
Now, please, please keep going.
33:35
I'm ready.
Sorry, we both blew some lines of on switch before we got back.
Yes, we did proud sponsor and responsibly on switch and Johnson, & Johnson, and Johnson goes.
So the delivery cube is, is basically what I walk through, mentally to think, how am I going to deliver the things?
33:55
So first is, what's the outcome?
All right.
The outcome is what are the other problems there ancillary problems that this customer is going to have ever experienced before or after the using products?
Immediately before and immediately after the use my product and there's problems are going to be super with.
34:16
These are couple of things, how can I solve them?
Now that I've identified what the problems are associated with product?
Then I can pull these problems out and take, okay.
Now I'm going to splay them out and take how many different ways can I solve this, right?
And so let's say we've got somebody in your in the in your in the supplements based.
34:33
I'll just say for example, right?
So if you're in the cell phone spacer, nutraceutical space, whatever then this person might want to lose weight.
What other things can I do that?
Might that somebody who's trying to lose weight and buying my fat burner, right?
What, what else might they want?
Well, they might want to be eating out guide.
34:49
They might want a grocery list, they might want a cooking guy.
They might want a lick, your fingers.
Wuntch has a delectable dinners, a shake guide a breakfast guide.
They might also want to a calculator that's for on budget so they can have stuff that's cheap so that they can lose weight.
35:05
You know on a budget they might want to also have family friendly meals, they can make for themselves and their family, right?
They I want to have something they can do for work, right?
You might also want to have the workout guide that they can do at a real gym or they can do it at home, right?
These are all things that take one time Time Investments that you can add into the core product for no added cost and then sell that product at a premium because of the ancillary values, we stacked onto it.
35:27
Now that's just one example of the six.
On the delivery Cube.
It would probably take more time to get through.
But like, each of these things are layers of value.
If you can look at like, you can also add premium support.
On text as a with you can sport customers that no one else has right?
35:45
You could do it via phone.
You can do it via Zoom.
You can do it via chat.
You can do it like that.
That's just one of the things.
It's like that is a medium which is what if it's one of and then speed and convenience being another one of the layers that you can add onto it, I stopped.
But before you go, there, all of you, who ask questions, like, how do I get my Amazon data?
36:05
I don't like, get my customers email addresses from Amazon Amazon.
Hides it from you, give them great shit.
That's how you you call attention to all of the other ways that you help them accomplish their goals and overcome their challenges.
36:22
And and then you get them on text lists and emails.
And they come to zoom calls and they join your Facebook group and they join your Discord and your slack Channel and any other place that you actually serve them.
You actually treat them like VIPs.
36:40
That's how you build a VIP list.
You actually overcome their challenges, rather than just slapping together a free ebook that you put on the inserts in your packaging.
You actually over-deliver for the goals that they are trying to accomplish, and then they voluntarily find you in by everything that you put out.
36:57
And then you build launch, that's how you build a launch list, where you don't need to do a bunch of giveaways, and rebates and use rebate, key and break terms.
Service in order to get reviews, you don't need to.
You're too busy winning.
You're too busy waiting to have to try and copy everybody else's strategies that your customers.
37:16
Go to bat for you.
That's how you win.
That's how you actually build the list and the response of customers to buy from you over and over and over again.
And by the way, the rant that Alex just went on was if you just had one product and you made a list of all the other things that they needed and you didn't create the products around them, you just create Partnerships with all these Oil.
37:38
And that becomes part of the stack.
Imagine you started asking the question.
Okay.
Well, we have this Challenge and now we're going to release this product that actually solves this.
And now you have The Virtuous cycle of price working in your favor.
Did you just say that was one of the six?
Cubes?
Yeah, one of them.
Was one of the ways that you can do this.
37:54
Yeah.
I need a cigarette and once it's also kind of cool about this is like we just talked about all those Partnerships, right?
So if you're trying to increase your average order value, if those people redeem 10 of Those things that you just gave them and those partners that you made a partnership with paid you for free customers, then you're increasing in all of, that's true.
38:17
Bottom line to you.
So you could give away your product for free and then make all of your money on the Partnerships on the back end if you really want it to.
So like Layla and I make a couple million dollars a year just in affiliate partnership, rebates coming back to us because we already, you know, we're Dino we want to enhance the value of the products that we have.
38:33
We were going to make the introduction.
Anyways, we might as well get paid for it.
By gathering in aggregating, the Solutions in one place because that's what our customers want anyways.
But as a mental mental fun exercise.
I want to run 33, fun mental tests for everyone that I've gotten good feedback on.
The first is, if you were selling your product for a hundred thousand dollars, what would you include to make that product worth a hundred thousand dollars?
38:58
Like think about it, like if someone paid you for the same outcome because fundamentally everyone's always paying for this the outcome, right?
The girl who buys a five-dollar ebook in the Grove eyes, liposuction or bye.
And the same outcome, the other variables of value are different, right?
Which either enhance or detract the price that you're able to charge.
39:14
All right.
And so if we have 100,000 or thing for a dream outcome versus a, five-dollar thing for G, Malcolm, what would I deliver at 100,000?
That's, that's thought.
Process.
Number one thought process.
Number two is whatever the price of your current thing.
If you had to get them the same outcome for a tenth of the price.
39:33
What would you have to build or do to get them there?
That's the second.
And the third one and this is probably my favorite of them is, if everyone here had no rebates, you had no advertising dollars and all you had was one guaranteed customer who is going to buy the product and the only way for your business to grow, was for that person to tell someone else about the product, what would you have to do to make that happen?
40:02
To guarantee.
But when you, when you say one person, do you mean one type of person or one individual, you get one purchase and you have to deliver such an experience.
That one purchase that is what kicks off your business.
I love that question because I think if you think if we ask the right questions we get much better answers.
40:18
A lot of people like well how do I make more money?
It's like how do you get every single customer?
You have to send you five.
Customers will take.
Even that question.
Maybe it's been overly hurt.
So it's like what if you only have one fucking customer?
Sorry, I like that there's one shot because it's like you have to make it.
40:36
So over the top that you can't say, well, we know, 20% are going to refer.
It's like what if we only had one shot one opportunity, it's everything we've ever wanted.

A happy hump day, happy Wednesday.
0:32
This is Alex coming from downtown Austin and I had something on my mind this morning when I woke up and I was thinking about it, I figured I would share with you and it's kind of about the future of the industry.
So it's a little bit more pie in the sky, but I think it's something that when you think about it, it'll kind of give you.
0:50
So, this is something that I actually give you some like piece, right?
And so with the future of Automation, in terms of like Robotics and AI, And, you know, like Amazon coming in and being a behemoth in retail, you know, it makes sense to ask yourself, especially if you're trying to do this for a while, make a career out of owning a gym in my going to be is like, is this industry going to be here in 10 years or 20 years, or four years or whatever, right?
1:18
And the good news is, I think that it will be and if you're kind of my argument around that.
So I think we're in the right business because we're in a service business and if like if you if you if you look at the future of like, little So many malls and shopping malls.
And where retail looks like all retail stores are going to go like they're going to disappear because you're going to have an online Source that's going to have more variety, a better pricing because they have economies of scale here.
1:42
You like there's nothing you can do about like that's going to happen, right?
And so that's going to free up a lot of space, right?
And so when everyone's like man there's no there's no space for my huge, a always stays promise you because all these other place you're going to have business because Jeff Bezos, right.
But what is the future of those minimums?
1:58
What are they actually going to look right?
And so it means that the things that people actually to do in person still are going to be related to two things really through Food Services experiences, right?
Those are the things that people actually have to go and take their body to the store to get their experience.
2:18
Write a movie theater.
For example, is an experience going to a restaurant is food and experience together or getting their hair cut or going to the chiropractor or going to the dentist.
Those are things.
You actually have to take the bus.
Body into the store to go to write like this if you want other people to see it.
2:33
Anyways.
Um, so how do you how do you compete in survive, the wind in that new environment, right?
And so the first thing is, you have to have high value Services.
Because the, if you're trying to do a cheap model like a cheap, gin model, finally model those again are going to consolidate and they have to the great extent like a lot of business have Consolidated.
2:54
It's a race to the bottom who can have the nicest facility in the cheapest present.
And that's not a game that we want to play.
We don't want To get into that, right?
Because we are service providers, okay?
So just remember that whenever you're like, we're about to take bikes made all this money.
Using outs program will go buy more equipment.
It does not matter.
3:09
That equipment is irrelevant to your bottom line because you're not competing on that scale.
That's not where you compete.
You compete on the service.
That's why people come to us is because they want more service, right?
So, just remember that.
Okay?
Now, when I talk about high value of talking about actual real high value, but also Value in terms of dollars and cents.
3:29
Which means that if you were a high ticket, sir, if you are a local business and you are showing service, you need to be high-tech period, you have to be, this is the only way to survive because, hey, we can't sell widgets because Amazon got you, right?
Period, widgets are going away.
You can't sell high volume because the guys who have 10 million dollar gyms are selling them for 30 bucks a month, you're not going to win it that, right?
3:51
And so like I said, the only thing you got is service and time value service.
And so if you're going to do that, it's the same thing you can trace.
At the bottom, you got to go all the way up top.
Now, everyone always knows.
I like now, we've got the reputation of being the high ticket.
I like where the height subjects with whatever, right?
That's what you know Russell called is at this event in like, that's, that's our fifth, but the reality of high ticket is that the only way to be high ticket is to be the highest value.
4:15
So yeah, absolutely.
We are by far the most expensive.
If you're new to this group, any stuff that you get from us is expensive.
Like if I fart three, four ten times as expensive as anyone else about space but it's because we're the best.
And because what we sell you for 20 grand will make you 200, right?
4:33
And that's the issue.
And so if you were, if you're like, man, I want to suck.
I take it.
You got to get into that space of like, how can I prevent like a bonus?
Elf, 3000, our package, how can I provide 30,000 old value?
And if you got to think like that, you start thinking differently, all right?
We start thinking about making services that are high value.
4:50
You'll automatically be thinking from a different space than all the people who are in your face, trying to do a $99, all right?
And that's how you win.
Because then, when your average lifetime value goes up, you can park us much more easily, they stay more easily.
They're the best customers.
5:05
They're happy with you because now you have proper to reinvest back into the service to getting that amazing exhaust.
Amazing experience.
Just like I said for service and experience his wife, who's weird?
The new economy is going right for Brick and Mortar.
So, and from an itching standpoint, I'm just going to touch on this.
5:21
There are, there are like, if you were vegan powerlifter, you can find some, you know, line who's a vegan power.
You're acting like you're a 22 year.
Old mom who's, you know, Asian and a server.
But like there is a person for that and that person is a niche that they can expand on because they have ultimate scale on the internet and there's only going to be one.
5:41
Winner in those categories you can if there's only one winner right which means if you are a brick and mortar, most of the time you're going to be focusing on general population in your area and then providing an experience that Superior than everyone else is providing results that are superior than everyone else can.
5:58
And then by so doing that getting people at stake for longer refer their friends have an amazing period.
You can outspend up want to do it and keep longer because now you have profit that you can reinvest in it.
All the people were with us.
They take it because I have a full American red-blooded tech support him.
6:13
I got 11 people full time, we have a five-minute promise.
You have any question?
You can't like get your pixel working.
You can't figure out anything.
We get back to less than five minutes.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
6:30
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
6:53
Of course not because no one else has the has the margin to do it but it's a knee that was there to satisfy.
That's why instead of having ten percent of our customers succeed, we have ninety percent of our customers who succeed is because we had a margin in order to make a service that was Superior.
So anyways, hope that makes sense to you guys in terms of what the future looks like for Brick.
7:10
And Mortar for what that new shopping mall is going to look like in the future.
The good news is one of the right business.
People will always pay another human being to hold them accountable.
Like if there was a robot I like it.
Those even if there was a robot personal trainer, who's literally at the gym and start seeing you, you just don't care.
7:29
If you stay in that robot, you just, don't because it doesn't matter, right?
But people are driven by status, and if they feel like their status gets decreased by them, not showing up, but And that's so all in all and I don't think we're going to have like personal trading Robots coming anytime soon.
Something you worry about that too much today, relationship, going to build it and that's what's going to bring people in.
7:49
That's when you get in, that's what's going to solidify us in the future.
So I'm not worried about it.
But if you are in this low margin, trying to get high volume game, you're in the wrong game and you will lose eventually.
So, might as well start playing a different way.
And Hop aboard the water's warm and we get them serious possible guys had a happy hump day and I will talk to you guys soon.

The Ocean between Ween.
0:30
Good work and great.
Work is vast.
It's 5 times, 10 times the work to go from something good to something great.
Which is why you have to be really selective about the few things.
You choose to do that are worth doing and in being worth doing worth doing well, the wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
0:47
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy. 13 lessons.
I learned after graduating college from The Real World that I wish I had learned earlier.
1:06
The first is that you make better decisions and you learn more by assuming that you're dumber than everyone else.
And the reason this was something that took me a long time to learn.
Is that when I was in college, it was all about showing how smart you are.
It was about talking more in the group meetings, about raising your hand more in the classroom and proving how smart you are in every way that you possibly could.
1:28
And so, I took that and started translating in the real world and I realized that I didn't learn very much because I was the one talking all the time and it only took a few times of me getting introduced to somebody because I wish I could tell you was once, but it wasn't, or I get introduced to someone someone would introduce us, and I would basically spend the whole time blabbering on about how great I was.
1:49
And how much I knew only to find out later that this person was way above me in business, and whatever things that I was pursuing at the time.
And then I felt tons of Shame and embarrassment.
Been about how stupid I was for doing that.
And so I had to shift the way that I talk to new people and the way that I answered rooms and I'll be real.
2:07
I still talk to probably too much but at least being aware of that lesson as early as I as it could.
I wish I had learned it earlier but fundamentally you can't learn if you're talking obvious this is it.
And so if you're trying to learn, then not talking is the first requisite for doing that and if your want to make better decisions than you, need to learn.
2:27
And so if you talk less Less and listen, more, which is why this is somewhat of a platitude, it's easy to understand and hard to do and tactically.
When you're in situations, when you're meeting new people, this was a big Epiphany.
I had was that I got introduced once to somebody and I was walking peripherally after I left and somebody else went up to them and was like, do you know who that guy is?
2:52
And in that moment, I realized that my positioning was now Sky High because I didn't have to be the one to say it.
And so the idea that I realized was how can I get other people to edify me?
Because what I had to allow people to do, was to make the same mistake that I used to make, which is that someone young someone in experienced, someone less aware whatever would come up.
3:13
And then start posturing themselves, and blathering on about everything that they're doing.
And me, I might be way ahead of them, but I would listen and see if there's anything interesting.
It.
And so on that conversation, I learned more than they did.
I learned what type of person they are?
I learned where they're at with their career.
3:29
If they had anything interesting, that would be worth, you know, following up with they learned nothing.
They felt good about themselves and then later would feel bad about themselves when that other person went over and told them.
And so I was like of these two scenarios which would I rather do, but I rather have someone have a conversation with me and then not know who I was and they never knew who I was, but be able to learn No, because that's that's the worst-case scenario, right?
3:55
Or would I rather blather on learn nothing?
And either either, I am above them and then they're like, well fuck that guy.
He brags or on below them and I'm the moron.
So those are the only two Alternatives in the scenario where you blather on about yourself and try and position, try to sound smart.
4:13
So I stopped doing that because the scenarios of me not saying is much and listening more.
I got I learned more and if the person find out who I was later, I was positioned.
And if they never did, I still just learned so those are the upsides and downsides versus both and that shifted my behavior so that was lesson.
4:31
Number one lesson number two was at the hardest respect to earn as one's own and so what I realized this was something that was really hard for me is that I had a pretty bad reputation in the very beginning of my college career and all of my high school career and it was because I drank too much, I was irresponsible, I'd slept around a lot and it just ultimately I wasn't representing the type of person that I want.
4:50
Today.
And so I felt ashamed of the behaviors that I did, but I didn't change them, right?
And so it was only through a conversation.
I had with my father, where I said, how do I change my reputation?
How do I get these people to stop saying this stuff?
And I thought there was some, like, PR marketing angle that I could take that I could control the narrative.
5:07
And he said, why don't you stop being a piece of shit?
And he said that in his own, you know, in his own words.
And I was like that, can't be it.
I'll figure out a way but only, you know, as when parents talk to kids, they're listening, but they're not listening.
That really stuck with me and I start thinking about it and I said, like, well, if I wanted to be somebody who's respectable, what I do and so then I tried to start acting in that way, to be someone whose respect my own, I would earn.
5:30
And so when I started doing that, nothing changed externally people still treated me like I was a piece of shit and they were probably right?
But my behavior began to change and then slowly.
So did my reputation but it started with me trying to respect myself, first, and then others.
5:46
Begin to respect me as a result.
And so that was a huge shift that happened for me.
That I wish I had learned earlier.
If you want to control people, think control what they say.
This is the third lesson I learned and this is more of a business / marketing lesson, but if you want to talk about products and services, you have to equip people with the words to describe what you have.
6:06
Because otherwise you're asking them to solve the problem of how to describe your business.
And if right now, you can't even figure out how you're going to describe your business and you own the darn thing, how do you expect them to do it in a half second when they're telling their friend?
And so this is really about giving equipping people with simple.
Language.
So they can communicate what you do.
So, for example, at acquisition not calm.
6:23
Like this happens all the time, so I just want to be really real with you the mission when I started the business was to document and share the best practices building world-class companies.
I have now realized that most people don't know what that means.
And so I have now and we probably will shift the language to to make real business education available to everyone.
6:39
They functionally mean the same thing but giving people the words to describe it in a way that they understand allows me to give them more so they can explain to somebody else.
It's like what's out?
You know what's that guy Alex Rose to do or what's acquisition not comments?
Like oh they just try to make real business education for everybody.
Thank you too easy to remember but documents show the best practice protocols company it's too hard but what's Best Practices?
6:59
What's documenting?
Like there's all these things that people don't conceptualize it sound like sound bites in words but people can't describe.
And so when I stop trying to sound smart and try to get my prospects to feel smart is when things changed, I've seen that that pattern happen over and over and over again, which when I came out of college, all I did was want to sound smart rather than have my prospects in the be posting too.
7:19
Feel smart.
Number four, you get more out of reading one book, that's great, five times.
Then out of reading five mediocre bucks.
And so I don't read many books and what I mean by that is I buy lots of books.
I skim most of them and quickly realized that it's not worth reading.
7:36
And so then I toss them aside because just because someone wrote a book, doesn't mean you need to finish, it has nothing to do with.
You means that they didn't organize it well, so there you go.
But every once in a while you do get a book and I have found that books that are older in general tend to be better because because the reason the person wrote it was a different intention.
They wrote it because they wanted to transmit knowledge to the Next Generation whereas people who write books now are either writing for money writing for notoriety or writing them to sell or the ship right?
7:58
And that's the vast majority of books so if you find books for the author is actually writing because they want you convey knowledge to the Next Generation.
Those tend to be better books in my experience because the intent is to actually teach not to persuade note, the slight difference.
So when you do find those gems, I have realized that if I read something once and to end I still don't know.
8:18
Yeah, and so, I will read a book, two times three times, four times, five times until I can teach the book when I feel like it is worth learning.
And then once I have like, squeeze the book for everything that it has to the point where I can convey the message to somebody else.
Like I can teach the concepts of the book, which is something I've done many times rocks, you make a presentation on the book so that I can wrap my own Frameworks around how I can remember it.
8:41
That's where a lot of these Farmers come from is because it's me trying to make sense of the world in a way that I can remember because otherwise, I reached up and then I would just discard them and it's It's just like a waste of time, where if you, if your behavior doesn't change as a result of reading a book, and it means you've learned nothing, which means it was a waste of time.
And many people who read books are just wasting their time, because their behavior doesn't change.
9:00
And so, I consolidate what I find something, that's good.
I plug everything I possibly can into it, and suck the juice out of it so that I can change my behavior as a result which comes from the Frameworks and how I think about it.
So, I read one thing that's very good, many times, rather than trying to brag about the fact that I read a book a week because I'm like, what was the book last week?
9:16
Not that good, that it wasn't worth reading.
Right.
That's how my thinking of change when I was younger.
It was all about.
Like, how many books can you read?
There's like a contest like a pissing contest.
Instead it's like How Deeply do you understand the knowledge of the book?
Because if you just did how to make friends and influence people and you put it into your DNA, you would be successful, right?
9:32
There's many there's a handful of books that if you just did them for the rest of your life, you'd win.
And so, rather than read another book that's on the airport bookshelf, that was just well, marketed that's a crap product from a Ghost Rider instead of that, you can just read the few that are Timeless Classics written by the author to convey a message.
9:48
The Next Generation number five, is that most Champions do not have something that you do not, they lack something that you have.
And so, it's a different thought process.
Because if all of us have the exact same hours per day, it means that they're allocating their time differently and many times.
They eliminate things that you are still doing, they have sacrificed more.
10:07
They've given up things that you have continued to have on your tree as branches, that are distracting from growing up, right?
And so many times Champions, when I look at the people who are further ahead of me there, even more ruthless This with their time, their even have lower tolerance for friends family, people around them that are not at the bar that they hold themselves to and for me, going through college or, you know, when I was younger, I always thought it was about adding to your plate saying, yes, to everything saying yes to Opportunities.
10:33
Say yes, say yes, yes.
When all I did was I just completely got distracted and spread super thin.
And so what most Champions have is singular focus, and they're willing to say, no to everything else and that for me, it took me too long to learn.
Six is that Goodwill compounds faster than money?
10:51
And the reason for that is like, if you actually think about what good will is, it's that you have positive sentiment and you have a degree of influence over a person's Behavior.
That's what Goodwill his.
And so, if one person has good will with you, and then shares your stuff with somebody else and you create Goodwill in that next person, you can double your Goodwill or 10x, your Good Will in a matter of 12 weeks 10x in your money, in a matter of 12 weeks is very, very unlikely.
11:18
So Goodwill because it's based on audiences in humans can compound significantly faster than money camp and when I realized that that Goodwill could be translated into money if I so desired at a future date, then I realized and rather than focusing on the money that I'm trying to make today.
Why don't I focus on the compounding vehicle that compounds at a much faster rate than money?
11:35
Does that compounds tax-free by the way, building the audience is tax-free and then when you choose to have the conversion event you can do that at your own choosing but if you focus on the audience, you focus on the good will that will grow significantly faster than any.
Of monetary move.
But you can still translate that later in the money when you want.
11:52
That was a big Epiphany for me.
I thought it was all about the money when I was coming up.
Seven is that you're going to die and two weeks after you die.
Most people have forgotten about you and six months after you die.
No one will talk about you.
And if they're not caring enough then then it certainly doesn't matter what they think about your life.
12:10
Now because if that's the most significant event that's going to happen in your life which is that you stop living, then how much credibility or wait, should we give to other people's opinions on what we should do with our lives?
My opinion very little and so unless the person A vested interest in seeing you succeed comma and the context to provide the advice most of the times, it's just worth ignoring, because they're trying to live their own life in, they're projecting their own beliefs and experiences on you.
12:36
And you spent all this time, trying to improve your own view of reality through the beliefs that you've shed and shifted that they have not.
And so what they believe to be true is what they're casting on to you and if you don't like the life they have, and I don't think it's worth listening to.
Hate extraordinary accomplishments.
12:52
Come from doing ordinary things for Extraordinary periods of time.
This is just me speaking about me, but when I was younger, my action showed that I was more impatient.
I always was willing to sacrifice what I had today to get the quick Bach, you know, I was always a Shifty like that because I just thought, that, that was how it worked.
13:09
I thought there was some Shortcut, I didn't know about, and I would see the guys on stage as being like, this is what we do, do the basics and we do a lot of it.
I was like, they're just trying to hold the secrets back and I'm here to Tell you that that is not true.
Like I wish I could go and shake my college self.
And be like, if you do one thing for a very long period of time, you will get very good at it and it will compound onto itself.
13:30
And maybe I would listen to me if, I mean, a future self showed up in my living room.
Now, I would totally listen to him.
But yeah, I mean and so I can't do that.
So the next best thing I can do is try and Shake You by the collar and say that if you like the thing that makes the action extraordinary is the commitment to it.
13:45
Not the nature of the action itself working out and doing reps is not Near.
If you saw one set of a workout for me at the gym, you wouldn't think, oh this guy is amazing.
It's the fact that you do it for 20 straight years that is what compounds on itself.
14:01
If you listen to one guy, make one phone call, you listen to one major league baseball player.
One at bat, nothing about that is extraordinary.
It's the dedication to doing it over and over and over and over again, despite feeling like there's better opportunities, despite people approaching you with new and exciting things.
14:16
But saying that you're committed to the original Vision you had and that reality has not Changed in such a way that you believe that you are need to believes are no longer true.
You said, I believe that XY and Z is true and as long as that remains to be true, that I will continue on this path for an extraordinary period of time and that not the action itself.
14:32
But your commitment to the action is what makes someone extraordinary, not the thing itself, 9, if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well, this is a really great small saying that.
Like, I sure cut it so much stuff when I was younger.
14:47
I just wanted to like, get it done.
Get it done, get it done.
Rather than doing it.
Well and there's kind of two ways you can take the saying which is why I like it so much.
Is that if it's worth doing it's worth doing well because many times I was doing things that were not worth doing and so I didn't have the time to do things well because I was doing so many things that were not worth doing.
15:06
And so the first criteria is what problem are we solving?
What am I hoping to accomplish?
Is this worth doing at all?
Because if it is worth doing that, I have to understand that to do it comma right to do it.
Well, Well, it's going to take this much time now, given that is it still worth doing.
15:24
And if it passes that test of a being worth doing in the Long Haul and because it is worth doing worth doing well, then it gives us this lens through which to see the activities.
We do so that we can prioritize.
The things that will make us the most money or get us closer to the goals we have, right?
15:39
And so for me, I spent so much of my energy fun fact.
When you're younger, you have more energy than when you're older.
So whatever your energy is now it's literally the highest it's ever going to be from this point.
Going forward, kind of kind of crazy to think about it.
So younger me.
Energy than me does.
Now I make way more money than younger.
Be did.
It is because I do fewer things.
15:56
And I do different things than I did then.
And now, if I write a book, I'll take a year on writing the book.
Because if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well because I understand that taking one year today will mean that that book might sit and sell and distribute itself to millions of people over the next 50 years or 100 years or after I'm dead.
16:17
Compared to me just putting words on a page that are pretty good.
And then shipping it.
And I think the vast majority of people don't get the difference between good and great.
The Ocean between good work and great.
Work is vast, it's 5 times, 10 times the work to go from something, good to something great and I did not get that which is why you have to be really selective about the few things.
16:37
You choose to do that are worth doing and in being worth doing worth doing well.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
16:56
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Ten, be willing to negotiate everything except for your values.
17:15
And so, there were so many things when I was coming up that like, in college, even right after college is jobs, like, I always just took things at face value.
So prices, terms relationships, everything I took it face value.
17:30
So, whatever someone presented?
I said, yes or no to write very straightforward.
I have now realized that virtually everything is negotiable.
Right?
Because People present with basically their best bad guess and they're hoping that someone takes them by the hand and says you know that makes no sense.
17:46
What if we did it this way?
What problem are you solving the problem by solving?
And then having the ability to clearly communicate someone ask the right questions, you get someone else's true desires and wants and then knowing what your own true desires and wants and what you're willing to give up, allows you to make better deals.
And so I used to think of negotiating as a zero-sum game and it's not at all, you can find a way, we're both parties, get better than they were before, which is the entire point, right?
18:10
Like that is how negotiating works if you're doing it.
Well and so I didn't understand that.
I thought everything was an armrest, I thought everything was like this for that tit-for-tat like no give.
And I also thought really short about it, I was like, I was trying to get one over.
I was ruthless with vendors, you know?
I mean, just like all that kind of stuff as like I swung the other direction.
18:28
So first I didn't negotiate anything and then I found out you could negotiate and then try to get everyone to give me their last last penny.
But then I realized that this long-term doesn't create good relationships and they will not be loyal to you at all.
Tall, which long term has, a more negative impact than giving them the extra 10% and having an amicable relationship, right?
18:46
And so I found kind of like my middle ground of you, negotiate everything except for your values because the thing is, if you really think about it.
I negotiated everything in that second example, including my values because I was doing business in a way that was contrary to the values that I wanted to espouse to wanted to embody, right?
19:06
And so now in like because the deals we do with a quiz is not con for example, like I Probably ask for significantly more than I do.
And I have had many times we like, I want to give you this and I'm like, I don't want that because I don't think, you know what that means.
And so this is what I think is fair today and in 10 years and so it's balancing both your need today.
19:25
Your need in 10 years and they're need today and they're needed 10 years.
And you have those four points and you try and find the closest point, given your reality.
And you can explain that, this is how you're thinking through it with them and I think they will appreciate all four.
Data points on the map to come to the best solution for today.
19:42
And tomorrow 11 humility.
This is a big one because I want to, I want to be a different voice on this because I have heard all over the Internet.
Recently, people saying humility is stupid.
If you looked up with the word means, you wouldn't want to be it because if you look it up on Google, it says thinking less of oneself.
19:59
All right, this is why I looking into finding terms is important.
Because if you look at Merriam-Webster, for example, its lack of Pride or arrogance, I don't think people would say you wouldn't want that.
I'm like, no, I think I think people are.
Okay.
Not.
Prideful arrogant.
I think that's okay.
But even more.
So and the definition that I have taken on is actually the exact opposite of that which is it is not decreasing your regard for self but increasing your regard for others, that's from Clayton.
20:22
Christensen, who's a Harvard?
Professor, go to the human.
I thought that posturing when I was younger was the thing that would get people to like me.
But what I realized later was that you gain status by giving more to the group than you get and so this is especially true for guy.
20:40
Guys, it's probably true for girls, but I can't speak to that.
But in a group especially an all-male group, if you want to gain status the way you do it is by sacrificing more for the group than everyone else does.
If you want to gain status in a company, you give more to the company than anyone else.
Does more than the company gives you back because what do they do?
20:57
They reward that behavior the group rewards, the person who gives to the group, it's how it works.
The people who take from the group and only one get status.
The only going to get status from the group end up getting banished by the group and batted down, because everyone wants to keep that.
No, cause they don't serve anyone else and so it was only by realizing that I had to give my life in order to get it.
21:17
I had to give status, I had to serve, because when you serve someone, you're giving them status, you're increasing your Godfather's.
When I gave status, I got it back when I gave respect first, I would get respect back rather than demanding respect at the onset because then they wanted to disrespect me to level where I was at, whereas if I raise them up, they would raise Mia.
21:40
It was understanding that group dynamic which is what made me president of the fraternity that I was in.
It made like all of these things started compounding when I realized that truth is that humility is not thinking less of yourself.
It's thinking more about other people and increasing your regard for their needs.
And if you do that, I promise you, you will have all the status you want 12.
22:01
The happy man has a thousand Wishes.
The sad man has won.
This is a little bit more of a heartfelt.
One for me.
Because when I was younger, I was definitely angrier.
Darker in general.
And a lot of that came because I had expectations that were fictitious, real or otherwise from other people in my mind that existed who are constantly judging the behaviors and actions, I was doing every day and we're telling me that I was not enough.
22:24
And so, in some ways that created and reinforce behaviors that, I still continue this day in terms of the actions, I take, but the way that I feel and think about them has shifted.
And so when you are sad, you want to not be sad.
That's the main focus.
22:40
Yes, you want to feel better and many times.
People will take the short term way of getting out of that, which is alcohol drugs Etc.
Because in the moment, they can feel better, they just want to feel better.
And I remember I had a coach who said that to me, she said everyone just wants to feel better and so, when I think about things that I used to think people were wrong in me right now, get all angry and I just put myself out, I use a different frame now which is they just wanted to feel better.
23:06
Do you think it had nothing to do with me and they just wanted to feel better about themselves?
And that's given me a lot of Peace about many of the things that used to anger me.
And so, I think that, at least for me being able to quiet the hundreds of non-existent voices in my head, that we're constantly judging the activities that I was doing and labeling them, good or bad or good enough or not.
23:25
Good enough etcetera, took up a tremendous amount of my attention and because of that all of my focus was on feeling better and so I couldn't actually have any energy left over to do stuff because all I was focused on was feeling better and all I was spending all my day.
Is in my head trying to not feel like shit, right?
23:42
And doing both short and long-term things to do that.
And so it was only when I came up with a mantra, which I have said before.
But fuck happiness, which sounds ironic because I said the person with a thousand who's happy as a thousand wishes, but in choosing not to admit the deficiency between my current state and the future state of what I desire to be, I was able to accept where I was and then the deficiency of not being good enough, not being happy enough, disintegrated in my mind.
24:09
And then I was able to Focus on just doing things and then when I started doing things, I started making progress.
When I started making progress, I started looking back and feeling proud of how far I'd come because it wasn't about the many voices outside was about the only one that mattered.
And so that shift is what I think genuinely from a spiritual standpoint is the thing that was able to give me the strength to do.
24:31
Some of the things we have done.
I'm not saying that we've done is amazing.
We're hopefully, live long time do epic shit, but I wouldn't have been able to ever start on this path because I was, Relies for years because I was paralyzed about what I thought other people think about me, only to realize that they weren't think about me at all.
24:47
Thirteen failure leads to learning, learning leads to success, success leads, to complacency, complacency leads to failure.
And so a lot of times I'm really thinking that like there was a destination, but I think the actual entrepreneurial cycle is its I'm going to give it away, it's not a destination, it's not linear, it's cyclical.
25:07
And so that's why I talk about entrepreneurship in terms of season.
Because there are Cycles where you learn a lot, right?
I used to say this a lot where I'd say either the business is growing where I am.
So either I have learned lessons and I am applying those lessons to the business and the business is growing, or the business is not growing.
25:24
It has problems.
And now I am the one receiving the lessons from the business in until I learned the lesson that I'm supposed to learn the business will cease to grow, until I have learned this lesson until I beat this boss at this level, right?
And the difference between video games and real life, is that sometimes in order to beat that boss, you're not you're not doing it.
25:40
In 10 minutes, I might take you ten years and that's, there's an entrepreneurship, and a video game, and so recognizing that you were not above the cycle, but that, that cycle is inevitable because you have failure, learning success.
Complacency the goal is, if you can identify that, how quickly can you get back to learning success?
25:58
Learning success.
And try and skip the complacency step altogether.
It still happens to a degree, but if you can recognize that, at least, at least for me, seeing, what it's when I can start feeling the feelings and it's rearing its head.
I'm aware of it.
And that allows me to speed through it faster and to the same degree, I stop labeling.
26:14
Things is good or bad because if I'm failing, it means I'm about to go through learning and I see learning is good and on the flip side.
If I'm succeeding, I succeeding is good.
And so either way they lead to my success and framing it that way took a lot of the Judgment in the label and the depression around not achievement away from me.
26:31
And also, when things are good, it allowed me to not be so high on my Supply because I knew that whenever things were good, everything is good.
Good is followed by something that is not as good and so you always have a regression to the mean, right?
You have regression to the mean and so things are amazing.
That it means they can only go down from here.
26:48
If things are terrible, it means it can only go up.
And so having that thought process, at least to recognize patterns over and over again, that happen to my entrepreneurial career have given me a lot more piece about the journey.
Overall, 14 is that I would pay any amount of money to make obvious truths real for me.
27:04
And I remember when I was, when I was starting out, I so funny I went to Bally's gym Right.
After I graduated college and the membership there, it was $29 a month.
And I remember imma spit out my gum when they told me.
It's $29 a month because I thought it was so expensive.
27:20
It was so crazy.
That someone would dare ask for one.
I expected to be able to be less like, Fitness is a right.
Like I was such a piece of shit and so there is a reality that no one can see right now true reality and no one can see it because we are shaped by the many things that we've been told throughout our lives.
27:43
And many of those things were not true and so much of the path of Entrepreneurship in my opinion is shedding these, these false truths City.
You can see the world more.
Clearly if you see these business, people were super far ahead and all of a sudden it's like they can lose it and they can get it all back again and things seem so seamless for them.
28:00
It's because they have a more accurate view of reality and you do.
And so imagine trying to hit it, hit a target with a blindfold on, you're just going to keep missing and Hissing and keep missing.
Now, imagine there's a guy next to you is got a blindfold on to, but it's clear and he's just nailing it and you're like, what the hell, I'm doing the same thing with my wrist.
28:19
I've got all this technique down, it's simply because he sees the Target and he sees all the environment around it more clearly than you do.
And for me the whole concept of ignorance tax and ignorance debt has been one that I've taken with me for life.
And I actually heard this a speaker said this on stage and he's actually using it as a close for the audience.
28:40
But It's like I just it just it changed my life.
So I've probably had that another video.
He said how much is not making a million dollars, a year, costing you he's like well if you make fifty thousand dollars a year right now said it cost, you nine hundred fifty thousand dollars a year to not know how to make a million dollars.
28:57
And I thought about that, and I was like, shit.
So, right now, the concept of paying down the ignorance tax paying down, The Debt Service that we are all paying to reality, right?
We are paying a Debt Service to a false reality in order to get the real one.
29:14
And so for me, I will pay any amount of money to speed that process up to see the world more clearly in a way that is true.
And if the views that I have, do not serve me in someone else is further ahead of me in the game.
Then they are better at the game of business than me in some way.
29:29
And in that way, I can learn of them.
Doesn't matter what they're doing.
So we were like, oh, this guy's own ethical, this guy's you can learn from everyone if they're making more money than you can learn from them.
And so taking that and taking my ego hat off for, I take it my ego hat off and saying like, I'm the student here.
29:46
This guy's better in some way.
What does he believe to be true about the world?
I don't, or what do I believe to be true?
That isn't and simply trying to observe to see those realities is something that I will always pay for.
And so that's why I pay.
I mean, I made a video the other week about conversations that have changed my life.
30:05
Eight of the ten conversations that I, that I did to change my life.
I paid for eight of the tent.
So I know that there's plenty of really successful business.
People who just, you know, the network and they do whatever I didn't do that.
I paid for access to everything because I didn't know and I didn't know anybody who did know, and so just observing them and having them speak into my lives and it wasn't always direct sum.
30:27
Just interrupts just watching what someone's doing and saying they're doing something different than me.
I don't believe that what they're doing makes sense, but they're making more money than me.
So maybe they're right.
And I'm wrong and consistently trying to speed up that process because right now, I know if I went back in time just with the views of the world that I have compared to what I had, then I could recreate what I have now in two years and so thinking about my future self, if it could take me 30 years to learn the lesson because I'm going to learn the lesson either way.
30:57
I'm either going to pay and timer, going to pay in money.
I'd rather pay money and drag my future closer to the present because then I get to get to that future and drag another future to the present and short cut it.
And so, I will always pay any money for an obvious truth to be real for me.
31:12
Because for me, it wasn't obvious.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The reason I'm specifically saying this to this audience, is that y'all get fooled all the fucking time by passive income.
It's not passive, it's less active, but it is not binary.
It is not active or passive, how active is it?
0:43
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
What's up?
1:00
Thank you eyes.
I am very honored and stoked to be here.
Maximum level stuck out of from a scale of one to stoke.
I'm stuck.
I'm really excited.
I think it was last night.
Who here saw me at Yogurtland last night.
I get some hands.
All right.
1:15
Couple you guys.
Yeah.
Things like 10 or 11 of you.
So I was that you over land and I had last two days before this kind of prepared a presentation for today.
And after talking to just a few people that I did for about 60 Minutes, I woke up this morning And rewrote the entire presentation.
1:31
So this is brand-new.
It's just for you guys and so it's going to be fun money time with Alex now, work that cool.
All right, so our mission Leyland, I acquisition dot-coms to make real business education available to everyone.
1:46
That's our goal.
That's why we're trying to do.
That's how you do the speaking stuff that's, we started recording the videos, the podcast, all that stuff is because there are too many problems in the world for one person to solve them.
And so, rather than afford the stuff that has been, It's really painful for us to learn, I would like to distribute it to you guys.
It's very meaningful for me to do this and so I will be as light hard as I can to this, but it's from the heart.
2:07
I just want everyone here.
Just make epic shit and helped lots of people doing it.
And I think we're the only thing that's going to like help the government's.
Not going to save us, other people are going to save you.
Handouts are going to save you like entrepreneurs are the only things that solve problems and so anyways, big big fan of capitalism and so let's rock and roll.
2:28
So that is why I have nothing to sell you, those Nation anybody here.
Awesome.
All right.
So you guys are here, something completely insane?
Yes.
Okay.
You're gonna have to hear it, anyways.
So I was able to take home more in a year than the CEOs of McDonald's.
2:44
Ikea Ford Motorola and Yahoo combined as a kid in his 20s.
For over half a decade, there you go.
Which, which resulted in 200 million dollars in portfolio Revenue as of today across a hundred dollars, uh, 33.
3:06
And to be honest, no one's more surprised than I am about this Alcove.
And so me, expressing this will create Envy in some people, it will create anger and others skepticism in most confusion and old people and Inspire select few.
3:24
And so the select few, you are, who I'm making this for everyone else, you can tell, but you are the people that I'm making this for.
So who wants to you about some stuff that can shortcut their path to material success?
So they can ponder the purpose of achieving it to begin with.
All right, so we're going to cover three things today.
3:43
It's just fresh from this morning, right off the press.
Number 1, how make you money, really works.
Number two, why new stuff is making you poor number three, why better is the way.
You're like that doesn't make sense.
Yeah, it will.
Said simply who wants to make lots of money?
4:02
Who believes that you have to work hard to make money who believes that known can outwork them?
You're gonna see where we're going with this.
Well, I'm going to attempt to prove you wrong.
The reason this is so important is that all of us claim?
Or I have hurt, who here has seen a guru on the internet saying, no one can outwork me.
4:21
Who's heard people say that on podcast?
Make Instagram post about it.
Whatever It actually drives me fucking bananas.
It drives me bananas because it teaches the wrong lesson.
So how can we claim that we work every day and yet we can't even Define the word.
4:39
So how do you define work?
The size definition is work equals force times, distance problem with that is, it's not very useful for knowledge workers.
Most of us are not actually doing manual labor, not useful.
The second way is that you can think about in terms of inputs of time, right?
4:55
Like, is that how hard you work?
No one can outwork me.
I work longer hours Do you think you're the only person who works, 16, 18 hours every day like go to China?
I'm like, I don't even know if anyone in America can say, it being dead like dead serious.
5:13
So that's why, when I see these things, just drive me fucking nuts. so, the problem with that is that Many people work all the hours, they're awake.
And if you suggest working more hours than your sleeping less and I don't think that's a good idea for knowledge workers.
So why can do not work you again, right?
5:31
So everyone's working those hours.
So then the next one is like effort.
That's how known cannot work Me.
No One's Gonna try harder than me.
So you want participation trophies Is this how you want your employees to think that they're working hard?
5:49
I mean not me.
I wouldn't want that.
So if it's not force times distance to Define what work is and it's not the amount of time you're putting into the work that we do.
And it's not the effort that we are expanding our, how hard we try, then what's work?
We have to get clear on it because if that's what we have to do to make money, we got to know, we're actually trying to fucking do.
6:13
So here's Alex's definition, work equals outputs, fancy, image outputs, equal volume times, leverage in, plain speak, number of times.
You do something times how much you get out of each time, you do it.
6:29
How do we work faster?
Work rate equals.
That same thing / time playing speak output per minute of time.
That is how you work faster, which means that the hardest working man in the world can be objectively measured.
6:46
That guy is the hardest guy working in the world in 2022.
At 140 billion dollars in net.
Worth for context, that's more than Bill Gates.
Did his entire career in one year Think about that for a second and then next year he did the exact same amount again.
7:04
FYI.
That's two billion a week, so output divided by time.
There's the time one year, there's the output, he's the hardest-working guy.
So who's going to be a 20:27 champ point of me doing this is I hope it's somebody here.
7:22
Who did, who would like to be the 2077 champ?
All right, let's rock.
So if you want to be it, then please pay attention.
This will help you.
So how can we get more output, which in the game of business is Enterprise Value.
It's how much should is worth outputs, right?
7:37
We have this one and I've got a nice flexi.
Our volume is the number of times, we move the leather, I literally made all these images this morning.
All right.
Very, very proud of them.
All right.
Volume is the number of times you move the lever.
The Leverage is the length of the lever itself that you're using.
The outputs is how much you can lift on the other side.
7:54
So let's look at a couple examples, you guys can just shout it.
When I say, just say high or low, so high or low, low high, or low, high high, or low.
Very high.
8:11
The reason I put this one in here.
Is that at a certain point, it's not about how strong the person is.
It all depends on how much leverage you have, that's the point of the slide now.
Higher low volume times 1000, the things just as long as the other one highest.
8:27
Yes.
So now that we understand what work is, you can either do more activity or you can do it with more leverage to get more output. doing more is capped by time and physical ability, how much you get AKA Leverage is uncapped No Cap.
8:46
I learned that gen Z.
There we go.
Now, fun fact, Warren Buffett took home 500 million in dividends last year from Coca-Cola as an owner.
The CEO took home 50, he spent less time, working on Coca-Cola.
Then the co did So is you working Harder by the definition that we did?
9:05
Yes, more output.
We've been playing the game wrong if you want to outwork your competition.
But you really should be doing, is out leveraging them.
So, who gets more done?
We got one person, does a hundred calls a day.
Another person who just hundred calls a day.
9:23
The guy who has more skill.
Well guy makes under Clause.
Other guy make Center calls the guy's been on the phone gets more output, okay?
Let's say they're equal skill, they're working 8 hours a day making calls after out this question who gets more work done?
There's the answer the guy that has the automated dialer that keeps his talk time the highest okay.
9:42
Same skill, same number of hours, and same automated dialer to maximize talk time now who gets more work done, the guy who is the best list?
Okay, they've got the same list, the same skill, same dollar 8 hours a day.
The guy who's calling to the right season, the right time of day, who wants to be calling selling shit.
10:03
During December.
If you're selling physical products who wants to celebrate Friday, Of course or leverage, same work more output.
Okay?
Let's say all this stuff sequel.
What else do we have?
Nice.
He actually called the guy calling with the better offer.
10:21
Now we've got the same time, same time of year, same with same, offer, same, Tyler equal, skill 8 hours a day now.
Who's going to do it?
It's got to be equal now, right?
The guy who recorded his pitch and sent it to 10 million people.
Now, to push this even further.
10:39
What if the guy made zero calls and didn't do anything, who makes more against the best call on Earth, the guy's got a team, he's got 15 dudes, on the phone.
Okay, how good you are.
And if you're like, well, I think I could be 15.
You can't be 1500.
Okay.
10:54
Are you are leverage?
And that guy means your calls.
I have more people calling for me today while I'm on stage.
Leverage, the game is rigged and you've been playing by rules that do not exist.
If you want to make more money, you need to get more for your time.
11:12
You need more leverage and this should make sense because we all trade time for money and I can prove this to you.
You spend time every second of your life.
You receive money over the time that you are alive.
11:28
So Money / time equals rate of output we are all paid dollars per hour.
The reason I'm specifically saying this to this audience, Ants is that y'all get fooled all the fucking time by passive income.
It's not passive.
It's less active, but it is not binary.
11:47
It is not active or passive, it's how active is it?
So, if you make one trade in the stock market all the time, it took you to analyze the deal and every other deal, you decided not to do and then execute the trade and then raise the money and do all the other stuff that is all the time that it took you to do that.
12:04
Now, after that point, you have increasing returns per unit of time.
The point I'm making here is that time is the thing.
We all have the same 24 dollars, In our wallet.
It's about how we allocate them and what we get back for them.
How well we trade just said that, there you go degrees all that.
12:25
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, so Leverage is the difference between what you put in and what you get out there are fancy definitions for it.
12:51
This is the best one that I have.
So I said I would cover three things.
The first one is how making money really works.
The answer to that question is leverage, you make more money by trading your time for more shit, more output.
The second is, why new stuff is making you poor?
13:09
And this is especially relevant for everyone.
Here part of this again was inspired by the conversations.
I was having last night at Yogurtland.
So thank you.
You shout for that this is also how not to get leverage and I felt compelled to make this because I hope that some of you identify that this because I would bet that the majority of you are doing this, how not to get leverage.
13:30
There are five pieces to this that I want to break down today.
Number one, uninformed optimism.
Number two is a story, I'll tell you about a construction buddy of mine.
Number three is something I call the magic wand Story.
Number four is half the bridges number five is one of the red dress, you're like I have no fucking clue to.
That means you will.
So let's start with uninformed Optimism.
13:47
Who here has seen this?
This is stages of change.
Teacher transition.
Anyone seen this this chart before?
Okay, cool.
Not a lot of be perfect.
So there are five steps and I remember the first time I saw this it like it changed my life.
Whenever you're analyzing something new, who here has had a buddy, tell you about something that they're doing and they're making a lot of money doing it.
14:07
And then you immediately feel shitty about what you're doing and then think I should get out of my opportunity vehicle.
Go over here and do what they're doing.
Who's felt that?
Thank you.
Everyone has The reason is because we're at step one, which is uninformed optimism.
You don't know enough about what they're saying, they're just giving you the highlights.
14:24
They're giving you the Instagram real.
They're not giving you the real.
Once you decide to get out of your vehicle and then going over there then you tell your buddy like hey why am I making money?
He's like oh well there's like a hundred other fucking steps that I didn't talk to you about in the beginning but like and it's actually nearly impossible and I got really lucky that one time and now all of a sudden looks like all the people at your old job or making more money than you but yeah.
14:46
Let's keep doing it.
So you move to stage two which is informed pessimism, you are now aware of the shit that is involved to make the money that you want.
And this new thing now you think, okay?
This is probably the worst part but then time elapses and it's still shitty and you still haven't made money yet.
15:04
It blows more now because you have invested more time and still have zero.
So your actual output to time is lowering just why it's so painful which is where people get Into the crisis of meaning.
Why the fuck am I doing this?
What is money even matter?
15:19
Anyways, you know what?
I'd be happier.
If I just spend more time with my kids, you change your goal because you encounter difficulty and so it happens, most times is that people, then crash and burn.
So if you're at the crisis of meaning, this is where most people offshoot.
What happens here, where that that fourth dot there, on the bottom, if I were to cross it out and write uninformed optimism.
15:41
Again, that's what most of you do.
You find about something cool.
Informed pessimism and kind of socks.
Oh, shit.
It's way harder than I thought uninformed optimism.
I'll try something else and then you do it again and again, and again, and the difference between video games and real life, where you face the boss and you can't pass the level, until you beat the boss.
16:04
Is that when you die in the video game, you restart a few seconds later in the game of Entrepreneurship.
You start years later.
This is why people don't progress to keep fighting the same boss that can't learn the Same fucking lesson, they keep losing and I'm saying this, because some of you, I heard a young girl in and I know that that's representative of other people here.
16:25
You keep fighting the same boss and the boss is being able to stick with it is getting through and different charts on this.
The crisis of meaning is also called the valley of Despair is getting through from there.
You get into informed optimism.
16:41
You figure out that little thing like I had to do this one thing and then this started working and then you know what I found out I could clean The list through this tool I found on the internet cuz I joined this form and they started doing that.
And then all of a sudden my pickup rate has tripled right or my response rates tripled or my throughput.
On my website, went up, whatever it is right.
16:57
And so you have to get through that piece, then you get to informed optimism and then number six, you achieve.
And then all your friends are like, yo, what are you doing?
You're like, oh, I got this thing and then all of them, come right?
That is where most people start something new over and over and over again.
And they don't learn the lesson.
17:15
And so this is what their life looks like.
Over and over and over, and over again.
Who here has more than one business in the last 24 months, be honest.
Thank you for being honest.
I appreciate it.
First thing, it's normal, I had nine businesses and I was broke.
17:35
So I say this with the pain of experience, I'm not saying this to be on a Pulpit.
I'm saying it because the faster you can get through it, the faster you will start making money.
You have to beat the boss.
Everyone thinks the grass is greener with the other side still aligned with shit.
Like that's why the grass is so great.
17:53
There's shit everywhere.
I've a CFO has been with us for a long time.
She went through all of our exes last year, she's probably almost 60 and she has to sing.
She's like, it's all shit.
Doesn't matter what business it is?
They all got shit.
She's Southern and Suzanne's awesome, but it just always reminds me of this is that there's always shit and whenever we're starting something new, we encounter something that we didn't know before and were like, oh this makes the shittier Then we think while we're going to jump out.
18:19
No, well this is new information.
Great.
We're more informed, fantastic.
So that is the thing.
Number one that is keeping you.
Poor uninformed on map uninformed optimism.
Number two, is a little story.
I want to tell you.
So, I was called up probably 23 years ago by a guy.
18:35
I knew in high school, we hadn't talked in a while and he said, hey, I've got this roofing business, you know?
When I want to scale it, I want to go big.
I was like, that's awesome man.
And so he's told me about the roofing business, tell me about the roofing business and all of a sudden he says, oh yeah, I mean, we also do some general contracting work.
18:50
I was like, okay, why don't you grow the roofing business?
He's a why, you know, don't leave money on the table, okay?
And then, this is going to sink in for some of you guys, and then he was like, I was like, so you've got the roofing, you got the, the GC stuff.
19:08
He's like, yeah, that's what I'm doing.
It's like you pause for a second.
It's like, well, we also Oh, kind of flip houses to, so we like fix them and flip them.
We also do the Contracting work, but we fixed the roof so we just get huge cock.
We're vertically integrated.
It's like, dude, you're making less than 3 million bucks.
19:23
You're not fucking vertically.
Integrated, you're distracted, right?
And he was like, how do I scale?
And I was like, just pick one, they're going to be nice, like, pick one.
It's like, why do you think you can't build a billion-dollar roofing business just doing Roofing and just get better at doing horrific?
19:40
It's a wild only bunny on the tape who here has said they don't leave money on the table.
The money are you are leaving on the table is the focus that you are not giving the one thing that matters.
And so, by the way, this is the self-made woman list for Forbes.
This is Diane Hendricks.
19:56
She's the number one, wealthiest self-made Woman by the way.
And she owns, if you can see it there ABC Supply, which is Roofing, Not Hasselbeck.
Not General Contracting work roofing.
Why didn't he build that?
20:14
He's smarter than diet Hendrix.
That's why.
So this is the list and this is what I want you to notice about.
This list is the Forbes, the top 64 women self-made, notice the age of the people on their ages.
The left column, 75 78-84, 90-89 63 on.
20:31
The right notice the source.
Roofing Healthcare software, retail and gas stations.
Trucking Little Caesars Pizza.
It.
So sexy, the point of this slide is that if you want to build something epic, you have to be able to do the same thing for an extended period of time, without convincing yourself, you're smarter than you are, which means if you wanted to not make money, this is what you should do.
20:57
Number one, do lots of different things.
Number two, do them for short periods of time.
Don't stick with it too long because you might see success.
Number three do not get help.
Okay.
Number four, make all the mistakes in your own.
It's the best way to do it because otherwise, if you start learning other people's mistakes, you can move faster.
21:15
So don't want to do that.
When you make a mistake, do it again.
Just repeat it.
Especially if you like I've been here before, do the same thing.
Who here knows the definition of learning.
I'll tell you.
Same condition, different Behavior. so if you want to teach someone something and you present them the same condition and they have not changed their behavior, they have not learned If you came to this Workshop, this weekend, with the intention of learning something, can I get everybody?
21:46
Raise their hand.
If they have the intention of learning something while they were here.
If you go back home and your behavior does not change you learned nothing?
Nothing truly took the money and burned it along with losing the output that you lost in a time of here plus travel.
22:05
So if that definition has been singed into my mind because I want to learn something.
And I have the same condition that's been presented.
I have to ask myself if I do the same thing, again, means I have not learned and I don't want to play this boss again.
So if you do want to make money, you can flip it.
You do.
22:21
One thing for a very long period of time, you get help from other people.
You observe what other people have been doing.
You only make the mistake one time if you are going to make them and you always grow and challenge the beliefs that you had and try and answer the question.
What do I believe to be true?
It is not.
Because ordinary business is done for Extraordinary time.
22:39
Create extraordinary results, compounding is the thing.
Like it has two compound.
If the vehicle you are in right now, does not compound with time.
Then change the vehicle get into something.
That if you stick with it for an extended period of time, it would be unreasonable that you'll be poor.








0:00
Mosey Nation.
What's going on?
This is the second half of the Rind.
Dana Moran, kaplan.com interview where we talk this part about creating flow adding friction how much friction to create when to improve the customer experience.
And one of the most interesting questions I've gotten on a podcast in a very long time, which is how do you reconcile the difference between an MVP and a grand slam offer?
0:21
Aren't we supposed to start with a minimum viable product rather than something amazing?
You'll want to tune in to hear the answer?
Because I think it may surprise you and you will definitely get value from It hope you enjoy.
If you sleep with your partner, every single day, your desire will inherently be lower than somebody who hasn't slept with their partner in a week, right?
0:38
And so I don't want the aroused customer I want the ravenous customer, welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
That question of, if I could, if I only had one purchase that forces you to think about like word-of-mouth referrals and that forces you to make the experience so good that that person has to tell other people.
1:10
So when you ask that question, where does your brain go?
When you're structuring the product and the offer.
I believe in doing the unscalable first and then being overwhelmed with the amount of business that you have and then trying to make the things that you were doing unscalable scale or with the added resources, you know, have from new sales.
1:28
So I think a lot of people try and solve a problem that doesn't exist.
They're like, why don't want to do something it's unscalable.
I'm like dude you don't even have any fucking clients.
That's right.
Like what you're doing right now is ultimately scalable.
You're doing nothing because this might be useful from a perspective standpoint is that like before I started Jim wash which you know, everyone in their mother tried to To create some sort of searching, they because muscle cars.
1:49
But like any words that were written.
Yeah, for two years.
And this is after I had a chain of gyms of my own, I had six four, two years Leyland, I flew around the country, living in motels and turn around 33 Jim's, we did 21 to 24 days on site.
2:06
We would sell on average 100 new members, when Layla and I went, we saw an average 190 new members in 21 days.
And so before we made a product, Out how to do this my solution people like well what are you gonna do?
Fly out to your customers.
2:22
I was like we flew out to every one of my customers for two years to figure out everything that they were possibly struggling with and then turned every aspect of their business around.
And so then we made the product, it solved all of the problems because we spent two years literally in the field making it and it's just like, it's hard to comprehend because, you know, we went from nothing to.
2:44
I think our first complete year we did 20, Eight million in revenue and 17 million in profit knows, you know, we were 28 years old and so I bring this up because like it wasn't the advertising, you know?
I mean we spent I think I looked it up.
I think we spent four or five hundred thousand dollars in advertising that year flowers thousand?
3:02
Yeah.
For five hundred thousand dollars in ads.
That's a good return.
That's a good return, right?
Yeah.
So we get so much word of mouth as good as Bitcoin though.
It's not better than Bitcoin.
Okay, dudes definitely takes the cake.
I think the further along that Leyland, I have gotten in this in this business game is like virtually every path is unsustainable except for the product and so I think that the way that people should most if I'm thinking about this now, I think about it in terms of promotion product and then people and so and that's like in stages not all at once.
3:36
Now you need all three but which ones emphasize.
So in the beginning we need a little bit of promotion just so you can figure out what's wrong with your pop, right?
That's the idea is like you shouldn't be blasting, right?
Because then you're You're going to literally just burn all the Goodwill, you have because no one's going to refer anybody else, your product and it sucks, they already had it first bad experience.
3:54
So it's like, all right, we need a little bit of promotion.
Just so we have enough flow that we can fix this product and you keep fixing it, until the company can start growing on that same level of promotion at that point.
Then you double down on the product and then you can bring and then you can gas the promotion that's called getting product Market fit.
4:11
But everyone right now is like super excited about spending a hundred grand a month on ads, make 120,000 in sales.
And it's a miserable existence because at some point the the cpms do get too expensive if you have no back and you have no referrals.
And so it's like it's just this pure exercise in vanity that doesn't make you any money and it's honestly just a big waste of time, but a lot of people do it because they get Awards and they get recognized and they take the screenshots and it makes me feel good and I get that but like I can tell you having now been on the other side of this.
4:41
Having a good product.
Just really makes life a lot easier because your margins are really good.
You don't have to work nearly as hard on the acquisition and you can sleep pretty well at night because, you know, the product you have is good, and I'll tell you one more benefit that no one talks about, which is, I think at a certain level, you start like the pressure as an entrepreneur is continues to increase the the higher and higher levels.
5:00
Like I'm sure Ryan has comments on YouTube, that are - it's like, not me, not home.
So the thing is, is like, if I were to say, hey Roy, Ryan, you have green hair.
He probably wouldn't be bothered by that because he knows that there's 0% truth in that.
5:19
But all of a sudden, if you start getting hateful comments and it starts, really bugging you, it's because there's a certain degree, a lot of conviction that, you know, you could do better.
That's right.
Then what happens, is you start slowing yourself down.
It starts beating up your conscience starts beating up your free space, and I think the only way to get through that is to really go through it by improving the product who degree that you literally cannot think of another way, they could be better.
5:40
That takes years not months.
And I think that's the other piece was like dude.
I worked on my product all week last week, that's cute.
Yeah, that's amazing.
So what you gonna do for the next 51 weeks, you know, and I think that just having that kind of perspective shift would serve a lot of people.
5:58
I have nothing to add except the fact that the car comment on the screen is about Jarvis.
A company that Alex and I were literally talking about.
Yeah, last week, I'm Dave.
Hey, Dave, how are you, man?
We are we are Fans of your work.
Yeah.
Because you followed this process, right of doubling down on creating great product and now like you have 9 billion users now, I think in 8 in 8 Months, 8 months, 9 billion users.
6:26
You can tell Margot that.
That's the thing.
It's like you can't do it.
And I'm like David, Dave comes from the hard work response world.
I was in, you know, in the hardcore direct-response world and like you need to have basics of marketing but far less I think.
Most people think you need, right?
6:43
And that's the Talking Heads don't actually have good product, they're just really good marketers and they say, you just need to have good marketing.
And honestly, I don't think it's militia.
They just don't think they've ever experienced what having exceptional product looks like, but it is the only way that you can have something that's unbelievably sustainable and grows viral.
7:00
A like if you have - train which they obviously does here with 25,000 execute Source software named odds, right?
The only way you can do that is if the people who buy the product tell other people and I think with the more digital world that we have at a certain point, everyone will mediately know how good you are within seconds and so we get ahead.
7:17
Here's that analogy is coming in mind for me, who the people that know, the best pickup lines, the dudes that dive deep into pick up and study that world are the most insecure dudes.
And now sometimes they can use that world as a way to gain confidence and improve themselves that does happen.
7:40
But For the most part, most of the guys who go deep into like the that world of pickup are compensating for a lack of confidence for where they are flawed and the become Masters at manipulation and persuasion to cover up for a feeling of lat, marketers are the same way.
8:00
Marketers become deeply involved with persuasion and sales and sometimes copy or having the best funnel or whatever it is to To overcompensate for the back that their product sucks, that their business sucks.
8:16
But when you flip the whole thing, when the dude has absolute confidence because he just chooses to have it, he doesn't need to have the best pick-up line in order for every girl to prefer him.
And when you have the best product, you don't need to sell it that hard because you have the conviction that what you have is the best thing for the customer.
8:38
People pick up on that we are A smarter as human beings than we think we are, we are not nearly as persuaded by the words on a page or the words that you say as people think we are.
We are persuaded by picking up on the emotions in the certainty that you are projecting and how you really feel about the experience at the person's about to have.
9:03
So the most profitable thing that you can do is for you to operate from a place of certainty, knowing that Your product, your business, and your service is actually the best thing for that customer.
And that requires you to take an honest, look in the mirror and say, is my product, and my business, the best thing for the customer.
9:21
And when the answer is, yes, you have hundred million dollar businesses, that is the foundation.
That is the mindset.
That is the place from which Alex builds, his hundred million dollar Empires and that's what he documents inside of hundred million dollar offers.
9:38
If you are still Here there's over 150 of you on here and you have not yet gone to amazon.com and bought 100 million-dollar offers with the intent of leaving a review.
9:54
You are hereby booted off of this life.
We are not friends, we do not do business together, you cannot come to my house for whiskey.
You are not invited, if you did go, And by the book, If you have done it put it in the comments right now and let me know and I'll take it as a personal favor.
10:18
Sean Foster says by 10.
They make great gifts, so they're wonderful gifts.
Now, while Pete, while people are saying there we go, it just says, bought the book.
Stop drinking while people are putting that.
There's a excellent question from Clement.
10:34
Juan isn't this the antithesis of an MVP?
That's a Fantastic question, Alex, how would you hand?
I would you answer that?
So if you're a row saying earlier like tactically, it's I want to get a little bit of promotion so that I can get some flow so that I can keep fixing the product.
10:52
But I think what ends up happening though is that people mistake that initial flow and say I'm making a sale, I should wrap this.
That's what it is is the first dollar comes across and they see that first dollars.
This is the sign for the indication that they now have a successful business.
When in reality, they have they have signaled that they ought to be smoking.
11:10
Out and sell a product.
Not how do I get, how do I build a business that I built a brand and how it'll affect worry about remark about.
And so we create flow, we monetize flow, we get the product to the point where it can spin on his own and then you can jack it now.
11:26
Alex, this isn't, this was an important point.
That was not in the advanced copy that you gave me, in fact, Alex, would you hand me that box right over there?
I actually want to hold something up, you I'm going to come back to this point.
11:42
You gave me an advance.
This is my Advanced copy.
Look at this amazing packaging.
It came in.
I got it from a place called the max I print it out at the max over here is my Advanced copy my weathered, Advanced copy that.
11:58
So back in 2006 I bought my first Ever ebook.
It was called the rich jerk and I was 18 years old and I was like that's what I want to be.
When I grow up, I want to be a rich jerk.
And I went to the library printed it out, and I sat on my bed and I Les, fleurs it and I took Furious notes and I just had this thought of if I read this book, this is going to change my life.
12:27
If I take this serious country in my life and that was the first book I ever bought on internet marketing which you know, about built the foundation for my first six-figure business.
I learned about affiliate marketing, SEO Chang on clients.
Email, copy writing.
Putting other products.
12:42
That was the foundation for everything I have not had that feeling.
Again until I went to the Max and print it out 100 million-dollar offers and this has gobs and gobs of notes about my business.
I want to do it this and which is why I say the second chapter of my career started.
12:59
When I read, Alex is, but because it was the same experience that I had.
It felt like the new start, I was like I get it now.
Like, I get this now and one of the biggest shifts Happened after I read the advanced copy because you told me about the section that you added, which was about flow before friction.
13:22
And this was like, This was one of those moments where I had to step away and get another cigarette.
By the way, I've never smoked my entire life.
I should probably stop using that analogy and I should just let you stop.
It should just start sick the whiskey.
But please explain this concept because it's such a shift for so many people.
13:40
The flow before friction.
So I pretty much come from the perspective of give everything you possibly can to wait for free so that you can generate Demand, right?
Like, that's the that's fundamentally.
The idea is, how can we just generate demand?
13:56
How can we generate interest?
I Can We Gather attention and it starts by just giving a lot away, and that's where everyone's like, that's not scalable.
I could never be, like, you money doing them, like, right?
That's the like, everyone just assumes that the entire business must be done and profitable at scale from day one, which it doesn't work.
14:12
That way there's their steps in their sequence.
And so the idea is we generate flow first.
And then once I have way more flow that I can possibly handle, then I start adding these levels of friction to it to increase the quote of the prospects.
And so I think fundamentally marketing, if you think about what it is, we're big perspective.
14:30
Is we are shifting the demand curve in our favor.
By adding artificially inflating, the attention that we're putting on our products and making them more persuasive.
And any bonuses on the other things we do, right and through that, We can then add the perfect amount to get the output on the other side, or the throughput of the system to be a qualified lead or a sale depending on, you know, what business you're running.
14:53
And so for, you know, a mass consumer Products Company in might just be add participate, right?
For private Equity company, it might be cold, email phone, call phone call, phone, call diligence here.
I mean, 10 years, 90 days and then we'll see.
15:11
What and then escrow, and then a signed contract, right?
And so the type of sale will depend typically the higher, the price, the higher the friction, right?
And the bigger the front end has to be in order to get that, but that's justified by the higher price of the ticket.
And so, I think what most people don't know how to do is like, there's these big pools of attention and then there's the sales that you want to make.
15:31
And so the best marketers know the right amount of friction to apply.
And I think the experience of the marketer says, this feels like a two-step.
This feels like a three-step.
This feels like a one-step and they just can do That off of the fact they have experienced, but fundamentally the way I do, if I'm approaching a new market is, I want all the flow and then I will add one layer and see how we do, then I'll add two layers and then see how we do until we get to a poor Mike, that's just right.
15:56
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money, you can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
16:18
Its fo free in exchange for email so that can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like 8, Weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
So let me explain how we just use this and our business at capitalism.com.
16:38
So, I spent a few days with Alex last week and he talked about this exact concept flow before friction.
And I realized I've been guilty of this by entire career of like build the perfect funnel and launch it rather than just like get momentum and then approve, right?
16:54
Oh my goodness, like I can't believe I made this mistake for 15 years of my career.
So we went back and we've been we've been talking about doing a book funnel.
For my book, 12 months, doing million for like, you know, since May 5th of last year when it launched and we've just never gotten it off the ground and when it when we haven't was like that's not profitable, just shut it down.
17:16
So we just put together the simplest page possible and put together like the simplest bonus package possible, put a name, your own price option on there and we put three pricing options on there.
One of them being a dollar, just pick, whatever, Pick one of these three prices and let's see what happens.
17:36
Put up a few ads and now we're going.
Okay, now we've got blood in the door like, coming.
We've got momentum coming in.
I don't know if blood in the door is a real term, but you're all serve truck still track of me.
We'll go with it.
There's lots of blood flowing in under the door and we said, all right, great.
17:53
Let's look at the numbers and the numbers.
Like we lose a little bit of money to acquire customers and it's not nearly as bad as we thought.
And now, we're getting regular.
Euler sales and customers add one upsell or profitable way.
Turn up the ad spend and now we've got lots of flow adding friction.
18:12
And it's that simple idea of, let's just get sales or leads or opt ins or views and then we add in the layer of complexity and that's how we build the machine.
This, I don't know why I have not thought of that concept since I became a business owner.
18:31
But that idea.
It's like oh yeah, lay layer one first.
Then we will lay layer 2 and then you end up moving incredibly fast, Alex every business that you start.
Or every personal brand you start seems to grow incredibly quickly, is it because you focus on flow?
18:57
Is it all like a hundred million dollar model like all-encompassing or is there like one primary lever that is the reason you seem to move.
So quickly, thank you for being here.
19:21
We try to make the free stuff way better than everyone else.
And that's that's been I mean I feel like there's a lot of Truth to people say but they don't feel you know, mean and so they say like make your free stuff better than other people's paid stuff but they don't they make it look like everyone else's content but it's like what if you actually made it better than everyone else's paid stuff.
19:44
And a lot of times I think people notice the Were the spirit behind what you're what you're creating.
If anyone reads the book, they can probably tell that I could package it into a course, in turn in the end.
And I put a course with the book and you can probably tell that it's not a webinar that just got transcribed and put into a book so that I can sell it.
20:01
So, a thing which is not, that's not how it is, right?
And so, the idea for me is to create such a high price, develop discrepancy that I engender Goodwill, which is candidly all, I want right now at this point in my career and that's the whole point.
That's it.
And the There's six pages called the delicate dance of desire, which is in the book, which is the last thing I added to the book before it got published and it kind of talks this concept A Lot, which is like we are artificially stimulating Demand with our marketing, right?
20:29
And so, you can also control your supply to increase prices by increasing scarcity.
Right?
If Ryan for example, sold one hour per month, and it was open on the calendar and it was a bidding, your auction system, right?
Or we only sold one, then he would probably be able to fetch a good price for it if you sold.
20:46
You probably wouldn't be able to get nearly as good of a priced, right?
And so the idea is, how can we find the delicate dance between supply and demand?
That best serves us as business owners and best serves our clients.
And so I say this to say, my goal is always to create far more demand than I have Supply and to not try and immediately meet the demand.
21:07
But always stay just behind it.
And in so doing create far, more pricing power for my products, far more profit and In you to keep a little bit of demand in that in that pool.
That's Penta.
Right.
And so I think I use the analogy.
21:22
Like if you sleep with your partner, every single day, your desire will inherently be lower than somebody who hasn't slept with their partner in a week, right?
And so I don't want the aroused customer I want the ravenous customer.
And so the idea is, we only want things that we cannot have right.
21:40
Desire is literally the app is the wanting of something you do not have is sewing it.
As soon as you have it, you are satisfied.
And if Saying that we were demand generators, then we are generators of Desire or better stated where channelers of the desire that already exists and so if we're going to make stuff right, we're going to make something.
21:58
Then we want to make it so good that that demand become so.
So great and the supply so small, right, that the profits that we get are breathtaking and we keep it there.
And then maybe next month, we do this much.
But now, because of how good the product was and the word of mouth that happened on the back end.
22:16
In that pool of demand doubled, right?
And then we open up a little bit more and then that is how you never go hungry.
Because you always have every time you open the door, it sells out and it sells at the price that you want to sell it.
So that's my goal.
And I think that's why we've been able to have tremendous uptake on the on the products and things that we've sold is that we try and try and work in that in that minute.
22:35
You tell a story in the book about being at Arnold's charity event, where there was a lot of demand more demand than there was Supply.
And the person that you met their said, when there's that much demand, you have the capacity or you create even more scarcity.
22:53
Yeah, explain.
To me, why?
That's the case?
So this guy was like an Eastern Bloc.
I came here definitely been through rough times big dude, and he sold Ultra high-end jewelry.
So, I think the pieces were talking about seeing, you know, 1 million, 5 million, 10 million dollar pieces of like status, they weren't even to worry about point, right?
23:15
And he's figured out a way to do this, and this guy was a master, he told them at the fundraiser at Arnold's house, they had more demand for tickets from the, from the year prior, they had sold two hundred tickets.
I think at 10 grand and instead he told our money been five grand and instead he told him to cut it from 200 to 100 and raise the price to 25,000 a ticket and he's like and the charity fundraisers was like, dude, I don't know about this like what if we don't sell me the tickets, he was like fucking trust me and so the demand went up and they cut the supply and the Jack the price and he was like we made more in selling tickets in the ever had and we haven't even started the event yet and so they had more just selling tickets than from the auction.
23:56
Than they had the year before because he had learned how to master supply and demand and so I'm whatever.
I remember seeing him do that and it was such like a pivotal moment for me.
That's why I tell the story in the book is that I truly think that the strongest, the single strongest factor in all of pricing is supply and demand.
24:12
And I think a lot of people don't take into it into account and that you can you can manipulate it and that's fundamentally.
We're supposed to be doing here where manipulator system and we're marketing.
We're stimulating, were artificially, inflating it, so that we can.
So we want to sell, right?
And We can play that dance that we can get the outcome that we want.
24:28
And I think that I talk about that stuff in the book and I think I was there.
It was actually, you know, it's interesting because there's still questions coming in on the chat about how this applies to e-commerce.
And it's this, this idea of where you take the sale, is the only as like, where your business ends.
24:49
And because, like, if you're selling on Amazon or even if you're selling on shop, if you're selling any stuff, The idea of limiting, the amount that is available, is a little bit of a foreign concept, unless you're launching them in connection with an mft, which I kind of think might be around the corner.
25:07
You can flavor drops, you could do but, but even beyond that Alex, when you said earlier about taking the conversation off of that primary sales Channel, where now, your platform, like, Amazon is really just a place where you're collecting leads at break.
25:25
Even Because you have your having all these buyers flood in.
But the entire business is, is constructed to give the customer an unbelievable experience.
That gets them to their dream outcome.
The business is actually the backbone.
25:42
It's not, it's not the front, right?
It is it is everything else that overcomes their challenges, like, you mentioned those Partnerships with outside vendors.
It is the memberships on the back end.
It is the offers that That you send them in the customer, follow-up process, it is that entire structure and all of those can be limited all of those can be, can have an amazing amount of scarcity.
26:08
And I think so many people in our Circle, specifically, e-commerce Circle.
They don't think in terms of scarcity in a positive sense.
Meaning limit to the amount that is available because they're just thinking about selling the next widget and the beautiful thing about what you just suggested is that when you're able to have that flip and realize that you can generate demand, you can pull levers in your business all day long, like it and that's when it gets fun because you're literally liberated to just do whatever you want in the business that is in the best service to the customer.
26:48
Yeah.
Beginning like thousands of Subs a day on your YouTube channel.
I love and hate you for it because you're, you are the One, You're the One, You're The One YouTube business channel is better than me.
27:05
The only one, the only one Gary Vee and dear Gary, He's got nothing on me, but Alex hormones, he's better than me.
And so you don't want the market has spoken.
You're doing great.
What is The reason you think that that which is like it's just a passion project for you.
27:24
What why, why is that growing so quickly and why did you even write the book besides the fact that you need the 99 cents?
It's mostly the 99 Cents, so just icing to get that out of the way obviously capitalism.
Yeah, that's the capitals.
So yeah, I mean Layla and I, we have a portfolio companies under the umbrella acquisition not calm and so the book is kind of the launch of that.
27:48
And so you know we take companies between 3 and 15 ish million and we're you know with the goal of taking them to 50 to 100 and so you know we've got three companies that are in there.
We started this about a year ago.
I've wanted to take on, you know, one Reporter.
That's kind of a penciled in goal.
28:05
We started a year ago, we have three.
And so we're four months and we have three and you turned down, probably 150 companies.
And it's really just like this is just a way for us to help 99% of people for free.
And for the one percent that are hyper executors, who can take something and implemented immediately and see their business go from 500 Grand at three million or 1 million, 25 million and then want to allow us, you know, to To participate in the growth with them, we can vote invest alongside and crush it together.
28:37
And so that's kind of the idea is like is there a way that we could create a business model where we could just help everyone and still have the people who need a more customized?
Like you know, when you're going from 5 to 50, 50 million?
Like it's like by my course on.
28:54
It doesn't really it doesn't really, you know, lend itself to that type of solution.
And so I was like, okay well how do I work with the people that I want to work with and then how can I give everyone else what?
You normally are paying 5,000 10,000 20,000 dollars for and give it for free.
And I can do it from the perspective of someone who's not made their money selling a market.
29:10
But actually Margaret example.
I'm thinking of, I'm comparing you to Taylor Swift for 99% of people.
Taylor.
Swift music is free.
You can get it.
Actually, she might not be on Spotify, but just go with me.
Yeah.
29:26
Allmusic's free you.
Let's do it.
Anytime you want that for a small fraction of people, they pay her million dollars.
Come sing Somewhere.
This is your kind of similar, right?
We like your for a small percentage.
People you're coming in and taking a nice wad of business and help them grow from 5 to 50.
29:47
I freaking love this, we love the business.
This is the business.
Taylor Swift is that what the the had learned of your that Taylor Swift?
I've been online business, Alex, Alex, I am proud to call you my friend.
I am thankful for your friendship and I told I told somebody, I'm so glad I was friends with you before you write wrote this book because I would have been fanboying.
30:11
Like a madman ever be like this person's the smartest man I've ever met in my entire life.
The book is that good?
Like it's kind of weird.
I only, I only ever had this experience with one other person.
I became frantic friends with with a guy named Dan who had won the tea.
30:32
V show, big brother and I don't want, I don't watch Big Brother.
But after I became friends with Dan I was like, oh, that's so cool.
Like I'm gonna go back and watch your Seasons turns out.
He was the greatest Big Brother player of all time and I had no idea.
And I was like, I'm really glad we're friends before because like I didn't know you were you were the Dan?
30:53
That's how.
That's how I felt about you after he was looking like, this is the smartest person alive, like, this is my homie, like he lives up the street.
I can't I can't believe this.
It's though, my daughter even likes this guy.
31:09
She doesn't mind a dead.
I don't feel like they've got enough affiliate offers and so, I did like I'm not just saying, this is your friend, but this is probably the best business book I've ever read.
31:27
It gets its really, really freaking good.
So well done, my friends were Watching, they're still over. 150 of you watching.
Go on Amazon.
Buy this book.
It's called 100 million-dollar offers its by Alex, or to Mosey.
31:49
Click write a review when you're done because it's 99 Cents.
And if you don't make a million dollars from reading this book, you read it wrong, you're right, they're wrong.
Well, what's the scam, right?
32:04
A few dollars then you know what it is right now.
That is that's not a legally binding guarantee because I have no affiliation with this book, but like, if this does not raggedly change your business, you're doing something wrong you misunderstood.
32:24
I was gonna call it a million dollars in 12 months but it was already taken my second favorite name.
He took all that 100 million 100 million dollars in months.
So I tend to master says, I just bought a million copies did.
I do it right.
32:39
You did it perfectly.
Thank you so much and I'd say it's a good start, it's a good start.
Just to just for a little bit of context.
Everyone else here, the books broken into probably like three main sections.
So you've got the primary section which is picking the right Market to go after which I think Brian and I had a lot of conversations about but like there are ways to pick the right mortgage that are probably counterintuitive and so this is how we pick niches that we think are going to do well and it's not complicated, it's just different and that is what unlocks the Empower the purchase power of Christ, things that we talked about charging, what it's worth, getting a premium over, delivering all that kind of stuff.
33:14
The second kind of chunk of it is the actual product itself, which is kind of the entire ideation, the different lenses and perspective to the rich.
My favorite part, what up?
Yeah.
And that's and candidly.
That's the meat of the book.
I mean, because that's, it should be, it's about the product, you don't know.
I mean, it's that's where we talk about the valuation.
33:30
We talk about how we can solve problems, the six different parts of the cube in terms of delivering on the product.
And then the third main section is What we call or what I call enhancers.
And so that's the bonuses.
That's the scarcity.
That's the urgency and Fun, Fun.
33:46
Fun Factory one was people conflate the two like scarcity is a function of quantity.
Urgency is a function of time and so you can have just urgency and you can have just scarcity or you can have emergency applied to bonuses, scarcity, applied to bonuses.
You have a scarcity, apply to a guarantee like there's different ways.
34:03
You can combine these things, guarantees, their sport, different types of guarantees that exist.
Lot of people don't know that.
You know, it's a combined guarantee.
So you can have like a 30 day unconditional with a 60-day conditional, you can have an aunt.
I guarantee you kind of implied guarantee which the fourth cyber security and so I talked about different guarantee the pros and cons.
34:20
I've used all of the guarantees netbook and I pulled out my 13 favorite, that were the highest converting process.
So I have those in there.
And then finally, one of the sections I think it's underrated is it's just naming.
So, like, how do I go about naming promotion or how do I go about naming a product?
It's more about promotions.
34:36
It's kind of at least how the naming session.
Is it set up but it's like more about promotions and bonuses is how to name those things.
And there's some interesting things on like, how to rhyme the names.
How to illiterate the names and things that make means, catchy, and stick that have just been things that I found over time that, I think a lot of people find valuable, because a lot of times, simply by changing the name of the promotion you can 3 or 4X.
34:59
The conversion even though you haven't even changed the product.
And so, that's what's crazy, right?
And so, it's like, sometimes people just missed the most basic thing.
It's like you're six inches away and you just need this.
Last portion.
That's why I think I pulled out the name because I thought it was an important component to, to wrap the whole journey up.
So, that's the that's the book in a nutshell.
35:17
I think that's why we've had such a high return, our advertising.
It wasn't, you know, as much as people enjoy ourselves content and the pricing stuff that we talk about all that.
I think that the end of the day getting the product to be so good that people can't help but line up and buy it.
That's the people.
35:33
And let me wrap with one thing that is early on in the book.
That is so So motivating and inspiring and uses the best analogy possible, baseball the best.
The best thing, the biggest win that you can have in baseball is to score.
35:54
Four points.
The absolute best case scenario is to walk up to the play with the bases loaded and hit a home run, we call that a grand slam, that is literally the best play that can happen in the entire sport.
36:12
But in business, the great game of business you get to take as many swings as you want.
And just hitting one Grand Slam in business, can make hundreds of millions of dollars and so often we get caught up in, getting it just right.
36:33
And making the one thing that we have going, I call it the golden turd polishing it until it's perfect and hoping that it becomes something one day instead of just swinging and swinging and swinging and Swinging until We have the Grand Slam.
36:52
This book gives you the loaded bases, right?
It can't help you connect.
It's not going to do push-ups for you so that you're stronger but it loads the bases for you and you get unlimited swings in business until you die, you can keep swinging and you can keep trying different experiments and eventually you're going to connect.
37:15
And what this book did for me is make me feel like I was coming up.
To the plate with loaded bases.
And now it's up to me to become the the person who has the skills and the habits and the mindsets and the beliefs, and the right approach for many able to swing and connect and hit a home run.
37:39
And when you've got the bases loaded, It's a grand slam offer.
So my friends as someone who cares, go get this book and go through it.
And let it impact your business because this world is filled with business owners, entrepreneurs marketers that are in it because they want to do something for themselves, which is a great start.
38:07
They start a business because they want to have a different life, but you have real freedom and control, and upside, and value, and freedom and peace of mind.
When your business Is completely in service to the customer.
38:23
The beautiful irony of Entrepreneurship is that you get everything that you want.
As soon as you build the business that is completely in service to everyone else.
That is the beautiful irony of it is that entrepreneurship is learned selflessness and people on the outside.
38:45
See rich people and they think it's all about selfishness which brings more People into the game and they slowly discover that the more that it's about them, the more they lose and the more that it's about other people the more they win in the process.
39:02
It's a beautiful virtuous cycle and this is a Playbook Hunter million-dollar offers how to make offer so good people feel stupid for saying no is a playbook for actually building the business that has the foundation to be completely in service to other people and How've, you get everything that you want in the process, please give some hashtags and some thank yous to Alex or Mosey for hanging out with us tonight.

And so there was multiple beliefs that I had to have broken because I was very against it, it's all a walk through each of these things and hopefully you can take away.
If any of these are beliefs that you currently have.
I'll just walk you through how I at least overcame them.
And so the first one was, why does this even make sense, money-wise right?
1:47
Because in the beginning when you're making the content you don't really make any money from it and you don't do it make any money from it for an extended period of time.
And so for me when I was seeing this is like if it doesn't make me money I'm not interested, that's just being real.
2:02
And then what happened and this is like the day that like put the first huge crack in the belief shell that I had around organic was when Kylie made the front of four.
As a billionaire and she was 20.
And at the time I was 27 and I think I had taken home 17 million in income.
2:20
The year before I was on Pace to do like 13 to 15 that next year in terms of taking a take-home income and I thought like I was hot shit and then this girl is seven years younger than me fucking crushes me in net worth and I was like, Wow.
2:35
And so it was just this huge belief shift for me was like, what am I doing wrong?
My ego felt hurt.
So I started protecting myself.
Laughs.
And I was like, oh no Kris Jenner's, her mom, she's an absolute gangster, she was born into this royalty.
It's not that she did it, it was someone else and blah blah blah, right.
2:50
So that's right.
And I was like, okay he go protect it, I feel.
Okay.
Now and then I went back to my life and then who did Beauty sold a percentage of her thing for 600 million.
At the time, it's worth over a billion today and I was like, some makeup check, 600 million and then Conor McGregor K with proper 12.
3:08
And 12 months later, boom was a 600 million dollar deal and then the rock had Tara Mana tequila.
Just now worth like four billion that it came out with and it just kept seeing this again and again and again to the point where I was like, I believe something that's not true.
And so I talked about how skills beliefs character traits are the three things that hold back entrepreneurs.
3:27
And this one for me was something that I believed about the world.
And I was functioning as though and it was not and so I was trying to find those things because they construct our reality and we make our decisions based on the things that we believe to be true.
And this was a statement that I believed that was not true.
3:43
And so I basically was walking through reality that was not real and it was that personal brand socks person, work and make you money and seeing these overnight billionaires.
Made it click for me and so you'd still think.
Okay, so that's when Alex started do it.
Nope.
Not when I started to do it, I then read a book mind of all Robert Koch is Almanac which is really good really quick read and you talk about the four types of Leverage in the book.
4:06
And so in increasing order of Leverage on The Leverage pyramid, you've got labor.
You get other people to do stuff for you, which means you get, More of your time back and you get output above that.
You've got Capital.
So people give you money, you invest the money that other people give you and you get leverage by extension the, the last two levels our code.
4:24
So you got software and media.
So if you think about this, you make a piece of code and then 10 million people can use it over and over again.
That's leverage you put one time investment, you get infinite on the other side with media, to same way.
If I take however much time, it takes me to make this video, one person a million people, a hundred million, people can see this video, which is what gives it Leverage.
4:43
And so when I saw that, that was what made everything clicked for me, as to why these people were giving this a, these crazy, crazy numbers.
When they had like I had heard Kylie had a team of seven and she was doing 200 million a year.
It's like team of seven and was because she had a compounding leverage vehicle built with it her business and that was when I looked at my own businesses at the time and realized I had nothing that compounded.
5:07
Nothing and that was a huge moment for me because I knew that whatever like I almost became dissatisfied with the business that Had because I realized that whatever I wanted to do next.
I wanted to have a compounding vehicle something that multiplies unto itself over and over again.
So Warren Buffett could build Berkshire Hathaway because the money itself, compounds and compounds and compounds, and on a long enough time Horizon, when you keep rolling the snowball after you do that for 4050 years, you have a big fucking Snowball, right?
5:33
And I had no snowball machine and for those, you were listening right now.
If you think about your own business, if you keep doing what you're doing over and over and over again, if it's not significantly, not just twice as big but 10 times bigger 100 times as Big 10 years, or 20 years from now that you don't have any compounding vehicle that spinning the machine.
5:51
And so if right now and you want to become Ultra Walter, you want to become, you know, bigger than you are right now, you have to unlock one of those four types of Leverage.
And so when I looked at that pyramid, I was like well I understand the leverage of Labor so I've got that I'm now in a position where I have Capital that I can deploy now.
6:07
I don't have other people's crap because that's not what I want to do with my life right now.
But when I looked at software and media, I was like, well, I'm not a code guy, that's just not my like, what can I be really great at I thought given my skills, Etc.
I could be better at the media side than I could at the code side.
And so that was just kind of me saying, this is me, I think I'm going to go in this direction and so that's why I decided to do the media thing but I still wasn't there yet.
6:30
Because now I looked at these people that are Ultra famous, I was like huh?
Why still rather be anonymous?
Because you know they've got all these stalkers and Weirdos and you know hey it is what it is.
There's when you get exposed to 10 million people if you figure One percent of people are crazy, you got 100,000 weirdos, all right, it's a lot of weirdos and so, anyways, I go to have dinner with front of Mind in gracioso, who's Tony Robbins, right hand?
6:52
And he was huge on infomercials, for a long time.
He's still, she still has tons of stuff media-wise, and he gets like weirdos, it come to his house and I like my stuff and I was like, how do you deal with this?
I was like, why do you think this, like, how is this worth it?
You know?
I mean, like, tell me on this because I just was, like, I'm not sold and so he's having down.
7:09
He was like, dude, if couple weird letters, Every day, or every week is the price.
I have to pay for the impact.
I want to have he's like I pay that price any day of the week and twice on Sunday.
And there was just like this pause when he said it between when he said it and we looked at me and I just felt like it hit me because I was like, God I'm being such a pansy like I'm just I want I say I want to make this impact.
7:33
I say I want to help all these people and yet I do want to be inconvenienced, you know what I mean?
And I was like, I just don't think that when I'm 85, I'll look back and say wow.
Wow.
Like I was I got stopped at dinner a bunch of times by fans.
I'm so high and mighty that that would bother me.
7:50
You know what I mean?
And said that was the moment that the watching other people hit it, big overnight.
Understanding the why behind it with the leverage and the media and how it worked gave me, kind of like the mechanics of it.
And then having Dean kind of break my belief around Fame being a vehicle for impact rather than an inconvenience for my life.
8:13
Those are the big things that kind of like big Domino's how to get pushed over for me to start doing this.
And so one of the interesting things about this is that right now.
The entire economy has shifted.
So if you look at from like a century perspective, the last century was a century about power.
8:28
When I say power me like energy, right?
So, like the, the biggest four out of five companies, 20 years ago, we're all energy companies.
They were all power oil, Etc.
And then if you shift today for to the five, biggest companies are what they're media companies and it's not even media.
8:45
That's the output.
The thing that is being pumped and drilled every day is the attention of the masses.
And so, if you think about what what makes money is, it's the things that are scarce, right?
Scarce resources are the things that are the most valuable, and so oil was the scarce resource and now attention is the scarce resource.
9:06
And so that's why attention is the new oil.
And so if you want to have a machine, you should be pumping and drilling.
For the most viable resource that's out there and so now maybe you'll make the next Facebook.
The next Tick, Tock the next whatever those are the platforms for pumping but then you have all these little mini drilling companies.
9:23
If you can think of it like that that you used to have, you got like oil is the big thing and then you've got ExxonMobil, whatever.
But now you've got Gary, Tom had my, let and even sell like all these other guys who are pumping, lose house, you know, pumping oil, the attention of today, the oil of today which is attention.
9:41
So I thought that was really interesting.
Right now, one of the last things that I didn't like about the whole content Media stuff, there's a little bit more mechanical is I hated the idea I hate like, if you follow any of my stuff, I hate doing something that I don't get credit for later.
9:57
And what I mean by that is, like, if I do a rep at the gym, I build that muscle and that muscle is permanent it sticks.
Okay, not forever.
I'm 85, but like, for a long enough time that, I'm okay with it.
But when you go out and you make a decision about what you're going to have for lunch to me, it's such a waste because I Like that decision is not going to stick with me, you know what I mean?
10:16
And so I want to build something that I don't have to rebuild again later and so the idea of making a short that is going to float today and then disappear into the ether tomorrow, right?
Or make a post on Instagram, that's going to be gone in a week like no one's ever going to see it again to me taking the scarce resource of my time and then having it vanish.
10:37
It's just I couldn't I couldn't make that work for me and so it was a huge belief that I realized And that the media, the content is not, the output is the input.
The output is the audience, and the audience is, what compounds?
10:54
The audience is, what sticks?
And so you're not wasting your time on something that's going to disappear in a while you're Gathering the scarce resource.
And the audience is the thing that pumps attention over and over again, you're actually increasing your land mass for attention to drill.
11:11
From if you think about media in this, Way.
Right?
And so I thought it's like me thinking that like every time I pump something for oil it was a waste when in reality that's not the thing that I'm doing the output is that thing that I'm doing it's the amassing of the land.
11:27
It's the pumping of the oil.
That is the long-term output of the behavior.
And so once that shifted in me, I'd stop seeing it as a waste.
Because I thought if I got one more person who's going to see this short?
Or see this long, or see this poster?
See this tweet, or see this?
Whatever that That was the point.
11:44
And so, once I shifted that then I stopped feeling insecure about like, wasting my time etcetera.
And so, one of the really interesting things with media and audience.
All right?
So this is from a cost perspective.
When you expand the time Horizon is that media will only become more expensive over time.
It literally only goes one way which is up on a longer time.
12:01
Horizon advertising work becomes more expensive content, creation, becomes more expensive, it becomes increasingly fragmented to cost more to do it across different platforms.
It just becomes more expensive, but here's what's interesting audiences and their attention becomes more Valuable over time.
And so we had this unique pairing of something that will never be cheaper than it is today, and the output of that thing will never be less valuable than it is today.
12:23
So the audience becomes more valuable the cost of getting the audience becomes more valuable, which means the best time to start is now.
And that soon as I realized that I had a cost curve that was going up and the resource the value of the resource going up on the other side, I immediately felt the sense of urgency of like oh my God, I should have started this five years ago and so I had this tweet that went viral that Was like my biggest regret is that I didn't start sooner.
12:44
It's I got a bunch of people were like dude you don't seem like the type of person who would read things and I really don't but that feeling of knowing that I have two things that are working against me, gave me the decrease, my action threshold enough that I was like, I'm going to do this, right?
So that's what got me to take that.
Next step.
13:01
As a fun side, note about media businesses, in General Media is the only business where marketing and delivery are the same.
To something about this the way you mark it the brand.
If you had, let's say a show like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan's marketing for Joe Rogan, is his delivery for Joe Rogan which is one of the ways that media creates even more leverage.
13:23
Because if you think about from operational perspective, you can just have one team that does all days focusing on marketing expanding the audience, pumping and Drilling and pumping and drilling the audience because it's getting you new people.
And the more people you get from your marketing, the more eyeballs and Balls you sell on the backend through sponsors and endorsements.
13:43
Now, we're not doing that, but I find it really, really interesting to think about that is that there's no other business where the thing that you Market in the thing that you sell are literally the same kind of interesting.
And so one of the things about audience growth that I started looking into was, you've probably heard give give give ask right or if you know, my kind of Islam on that is like, give give give, give give give get because people to start handing you things.
14:06
But if you look at platforms that are trying to grow Grow right there.
Trying to grow the audience, they're trying to find more oil to drill, right?
More land to drill oil, from rather the ones that are new, have a different give to ask ratio.
So if you noticed that, so when a new platform comes out, they don't have ads, they just have content content, content, content.
14:25
And so, if you think about that in terms of like, giving, all they're doing is giving giving giving giving giving, and then what happens is, they have this radical expansion and they just gobble gobble gobble market, share, and the moment they start introducing ads, right?
The Growth starts to decrease.
14:41
And so it begs the question.
Why would you make your asks, if you know you are multiplying unto yourself, you are compounding the longer you just give before making your ask, right?
This is why having a long time Horizons, interesting and important.
So there's there's been a ton of research that's actually been done on this and I looked into it.
14:58
So the mature platforms are not in expansion mode anymore.
They're in mining there in reaping and selling the eyeballs in the air balls as much as they can.
And so if you look at like television or radio, do they have roughly a four to one ratio of giving to asking, if you were to put asking as commercials, right?
15:16
So it's 13 minutes per hour.
That's dedicated to commercials where to 47 minutes of content, all right, per hour, kind of interesting.
And so if you look at Facebook Facebook right now if you scroll your news feed, it's 4 to 1.
They figured this out, they know that people are willing to give four units to everyone roughly as they consume content.
15:37
Now here's what else is interesting.
Is that the audience that is on?
There has been conditioned and reinforced to continue to want to consume it and they're willing to incur the cost of the commercial but somebody who's new may not have been weathered or conditioned over that period of time of slow integration of ads that they not be.
15:56
They might not be as interested in staying on this platform.
And so the moment you start integrating the ask and integrating the takes or whatever way you want to say, it is the moment that you consciously decrease, your growth, you consciously.
A I don't want a bigger better audience than I have today or I'm willing to trade some of it off and that's okay.
16:14
You got to eat etcetera I understand but if you're thinking like super long, you have a compounding number that you were literally slowing down your rate of compounding.
The moment you start doing it and so if you think that you're going to be in the game for a long time and you want to be as big as you can later and you want to give to the audience, all of the things of providing value are literally aligned with massive growth.
16:39
It's just you got to wait and so rather than reap and harvest.
The way TV has and why Facebook doesn't grow anymore, because they're overly added, you know, advertised on etcetera.
It's the platforms that have the lowest amount of ads that get the most amount of reach the most amount of compounding.
Now, they have a business model, they have to make one.
16:54
At some point could get that, but the longer, you can wait the bigger, the ass can be at the end, the longer, the runway, the bigger, the plane that can take off from it.
So one of the things that interesting about digital media versus old forms of media, is that other Media made zillionaires to Right newspapers, back in the day, direct mail stuff.
17:12
Billboards like radio will radios digital by but we'll just go with me on this Warren Buffett invested in so many one town newspapers because they were monopolies.
There wasn't enough room for another paper to come in town and a newspaper had to monetization things, which may never be available again.
17:29
And cable TV had the same thing.
People would pay to have access to the content and advertisers would pay to have access to the eyeballs.
They Got peed on both sides and people became exorbitantly wealthy.
From this model, the cable TV became was a really wealthy, the newspapers became exorbitantly wealthy and they were able to justify because there was a cost of distribution, there was a cost to distribute the newspaper.
17:52
Now they probably could have lived on just the ad Revenue alone but they chose not to because they were business people.
They're like if they're willing to pay for it and so are they will charge them both.
The thing is that digital media eroded that first sale to the customer, which is when Facebook came and said it's free and it always will Be right.
18:10
And they stuck with that because they realize that because it was free, they're able to gobble up so much more media, their cost to acquire eyeballs at a platform, level is so low that it made more sense for them to not try and monetize the audience except through the advertising.
18:29
And so media has changed in that you can now make one video like this and 10 million people can see it.
And so that is that is what I took.
It took me way too long to realize that the game had changed fundamentally in terms of how media is monetized and how media can grow a brand and the amount of reach that a single video single bout of effort can deliver.
18:51
And so I'll make a prediction right now.
So if the Rockefellers were built on oil, the new generation of ultra wealthy people, built on attention.
Zack is going to continue to be a gangster because he has the attention economy.
You know, he's buying attention, then on the Creator level.
19:07
You've got mr.
Beast.
Right.
And people who have Mega of mounts of attention, a mast and pumping towards them.
I think he opened up a restaurant in a local area and then ten thousand people show up at a local restaurant, right?
Like, I don't think people still understand because we as humans can't fathom or comprehend the difference between a million and 10 million because we can barely even comprehend what a thousand is.
19:31
So it's hard to understand what a million versus 10 million versus 100 million is, but I'll put it to you this way if and and this As with all the love to Gary, if mr.
Beast lost, all of Gary's attention from the amount of attention, he has cute still have over 100 million people.
19:49
It's kind of like Elon Musk losing all of Donald Trump's net worth in still being worth the exact same amount of money.
Like there are levels to this game.
And so, I don't think people realize that he's 24 and media compounds.
He's number 1, comma and has 60 years in front of him.
20:08
We're judging his business Acumen today, when his Acumen was built on building media.
Once you have tons of media, the monetization is, is, is the easier part.
The question is, which way are you going to monetize their going to monetize their endorsement?
You're going to monetize it through through companies.
20:24
Are you going to monetize it through moving markets?
Which when you're that big you can do that.
There's so many ways to monetize it.
At that point that I will make prediction that he will be a sensibility and are not just a billionaire.
But a sensibility under, which I know is bold and I just think that Anybody who disagrees with that is always entitled their opinion, but you haven't played it out.
20:43
Like he hasn't given 60 years and he's conquered every new platform, right?
He's the fastest one on Tick-Tock that most followed person on Tick-Tock.
Right.
If you just recently decided to get on there like just recent was item start doing this and boom, he's almost got 50 million people on his Tick-Tock, right?
21:00
And so he's growing faster than he did on YouTube.
So think about that.
And so it means like he gets the short game.
He gets the long game and so becoming a master of media is A huge way of creating leverage because if Kylie can just point mr.
Beast can just point and then you have 100 million people who buy anything, you have a billion dollar plus company.
21:19
And so for that reason, my whole goal instead of started to create the content out there was that I looked at all the things that I just said, I know that the people who build the biggest things don't ask and they grow the fastest so that's why I was like, I have nothing to sell.
You write the people who have the longest time Horizons allow the compounding to work in their favor for a long period.
21:38
I realized that the audience was the output, the attention is the output, not the media that I'm creating.
So that was a realization for me.
That allowed me to get over the fact that some things that I make vanish forever.
I realized that for me to have the impact that I wanted to have, if I claimed, which I do that, I want to make real business available for want to make real business education available to everyone.
21:56
If I claim that if I say that, that's what I actually want to do, then I need to match my actions to that otherwise they're just empty words and so that means that if this is the price I have to pay if getting stopped when I'm walking out and you know if I'm at the gym Have to take my headphones off a couple times because someone wants to say hi or take a picture.
22:11
If that's the price, I have to pay for make the impact you want to have.
Then it's a price that I'm willing to pay because this is Meaningful for me.
And I think what I'm 85 not gonna look back and be like, you know what, I'm really glad that no one knew who I was and that I had all this information that we've gathered.
It is just that is going to vanish with me and so it's like I'd rather have that knowledge not vanish with me at all.
22:32
Be completely spread have a whole horde of entrepreneurs who are younger better faster sharper than I was Who can pass the torch on, and I hope that those guys will pass it to the next generation and then as a species, you know, I mean, we just move forward and get better.
So that is why I decided to make the plunge and do the stuff that we're doing.
22:49
Now, pump out the amount of content that we're making, it was because I had an internal shift of realizing that if I wanted to make the impact you want to have, then I was willing to do it.
Hey Mose.
An Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
23:06
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
The wealthiest individuals of the last century were built on oil.
23:23
They were built on energy.
And if you look at fast forward today, four of the top five, biggest companies in the world are not built on the old oil, but the new oil and the oil of today is attention, because attention is the scarcest resource on the planet right now even scarier than oil because people are willing to pay even more for it.
23:42
And so, the companies that have figured out to a, how to grab the land, they're literally buying up the real estate of the The collective attention that exists, right?
Think about every sense that you have, you have 24 hours a day that your ears are open, you have 24 hours a day that your eyes are open.
23:58
And so the idea is how can we capture as many of those hours from as many people as possible and the war for our minds.
And so the people who are creating the platforms that other companies can come and drill their basically the digital landscape, they even envelope.
24:13
The world, the oil tycoons had to go and buy a state negotiate haggle.
The farmer to get his things, the new world today.
They don't need to haggle with anyone.
They just take it right there, only competing against each other.
They're competing against the couch that Computing is television.
They're competing its radio but they're fighting a war that they can't lose because they have so much more analytics, they've so much more real time data that they can adjust how they combat the old school, which is why they're killing them.
24:39
And so, the total amount of attention that exists is every human's eyes and ears, collectively 24 hours a day, that is the pie and they're fighting for it.
And so the ones that are able to map to as much of that, which is why the AR thing gets really interesting when they think about that, if they can get you, if they can literally be the lens through which you see the world, they own your most precious resource, your site 24 hours a day Friday.
25:04
And in that way, how do they can put an ad there?
They can have you pay every month to just not have ads.
Like there's all these different things that they can do and it's because that is the new game.
Our senses are the real estate in our attention is the oil.
That's getting pumped from it.
The reason who to the Rock Conor McGregor, Kylie were able to translate their Fame their attention into money.
25:27
Is that one?
They spent a long time, building it, right, and amassing that attention, because they knew that the moment they did decide to monetize it.
It was right there.
Now, the mistake that you've heard me say million times, when we say it again, that many newer craters make is that those people waited years, think about how long The Rock has been building the brand of The Rock.
25:47
For he signed his deal with Under Armour before he made term on a before he made.
Zoa right before he did this thing, he was in it for 15 years, 20 years, he'd been building this brand.
And so people piss, and moan about the fact that they built, you know, they posted content for four weeks and they're not famous yet.
26:03
It's like this dude put in, literally 100 times the effort, and that's what you just posting.
Once a day, this guy's everywhere.
He's doing speeches, he's on WWE's making movies.
He's in shows.
He's doing all of that every day and he's been doing it for 20 years and so some people Were Somehow surprised that he's crushing them, right?
26:20
And so one is they waited a really really, really long time and they didn't ask they just they gave right in their own way because everyone's giving you Kylie's give looks different than the rock says but they give to their particular audience.
The next thing is that the thing they chose to monetize from was on brand and this is like a key point.
26:37
It was on Brandt in that.
This is something that Their audience already dug, right?
Like the rock signing the deal with Under Armour makes complete sense because Fitness is a core part of Brand right, him working out, put in the for am grind.
Like, all of that is something that Under Armour wanted to tap into to associate their brand with.
26:56
And so it's interesting if you think about this is that the biggest brands that exist come from the endorsements of celebrities.
So, hear me out.
We can't be Kim Kardashian like a girl can't be Kim, right?
So Kim is the ultimate status.
27:12
Then Dolce Gabbana, signs Kim and says, where our shit people then see.
See, the status that Kim has an associated with Dolce & Gabbana and then little lady who's got money and doesn't have status trades her money for the bag that she can associate with Kim to get the status.
27:28
That's the game and so that's Kim status.
Now, if the rock did it, he does kind of dress fancy but it probably wouldn't be on brand for him to start rocking.
Like he just wouldn't like you can feel it right now.
You're like, I mean, I guess he could, but it wouldn't really make sense, right?
But him doing the Under Armour Deal completely makes sense in doing an energy drink completely Since because he's all about use like powering, you know, grinding going heart.
27:50
It's on brand, same degree, tear Mana.
He always says, he does his cheat days and he has his little sipper of tequila and it made sense that he start his own because it was on red.
If all of a sudden he started a whiskey, right?
Even even an alcohol, I think about how tiny of a difference that is if you just started a whiskey, would have been weird.
28:07
It's not on brand.
And so, with these guys did is they waited a really long time.
They figured out which of the messaging buckets are the things that are kind of.
They represent like this I believe this is what I'm About, right?
And the people who follow me Vibe with, not only one, but a lot of times multiple of these Dimensions which brings up another point, which is that the people who are the most famous, if you look at the big ones, you look at Rogan right?
28:29
He's got UFC that he's into fighting, right?
He's also a really amazing comedian in loves the comedy community.
He's also got a fitness background, so he like loves talking about Fitness and biohacking in supplements and all unlike brain stuff, he loves all that stuff, and then he loves aliens and UFOs, right?
28:48
And so you talk about all these different like and these are all totally different but the more Dimensions that someone can go deep on that, the more they'll get an audience from Comedy and then they'll cross pollinate them with fight it.
So you all of a sudden people who really like Tommy, you're hearing, Joe and being like, you know what?
I'm going to go see them Gregor fight, right?
29:04
Which seems completely Contra.
And on the flip side, you got these guys from fighting, we're like, you know what, UFOs might be real, right?
And so it's this total pollination, which ultimately compounds the audience even faster.
So like what is it that the Megastar As have we have the rock.
He's got movies, he's got TV shows.
29:21
He's got, he's got his drinking.
Think not that, he drinks.
But like that he likes to relax and peel back.
He's got his wife and his kids that's another bucket for him, right?
And then he's got his hardcore Fitness vibe in terms of training hard but he also have out.
Sub-segment, this is that his 4 a.m. wake Up's.
29:37
His no excuse attitude is like a whole nother bucket that he demonstrates from a psychographic standpoint and so these people have multiple Dimension.
His WWE, forgot about that right.
He is these All dimensions.
And so these Mega stars go deep on many things in so doing capture bigger and bigger audiences that Compound on themselves and they wait, because they stay loyal to their brand, and then they appeal to a segment of Their audience, or they try to cut across the one that appeals to the most of them.
30:04
And in that way, they'll monetize the best and not detract from the brand, because when you're monetizing your, you're rarely building the brand unless the product is exceptional.
Now, I don't know if most of their products are exceptional, be real, I don't know.
But the next level of this would be that That they not only serve the most of their audience but that the product they give is actually so good that the product does the expansion in and of itself rather than just their personal brand.
30:28
And so there's only two ways for people to find out about the stuff you sell.
You can tell them or other people can tell them.
There's only one of you.
So think about which way is easier.
It has more leverage that being said now because we have the megaphones we have with media.
All single person can have tremendous leverage unlike we've ever seen but still when you've got Even an sitting across the kitchen table, and she's like why I tried Kylie's.
30:50
Lips thing is actually pretty good.
That's where the purchaser made.
It's a think Seth.
Seth Godin said it's a million Whispers.
It's not one megaphone and that's where the real virality hits.
So Kim Kardashian and Dolce is an example, The Rock and under armours, and example.
But let's look at LeBron and Nike, they wanted to sign him because they figure he is going to be iconic.
31:11
He is Iconic, right?
They're betting on the fact that his brain is only going to continue to grow because immediately continues to expand Right over time and they wanted to associate Nike Victory with somebody who is Victorious.
And so they reinforce their brand position through the endorsements.
31:27
They get from people who actually do it because a brand can't be victorious.
In it of itself.
It's not a person, right?
And so they got to find the people who embody, the spirit and the values of their brand.
They make the endorsement people make the association their mind and then they buy the brand to get the association of the thing they could never do, but always aspire to.
31:44
So there's two terms that get tossed around a lot in the Meeting leverage and compounding.
All right, Leverage is the difference between what you put in and what you get out.
Alright, so for example, literally Archimedes had a stick and you've got a little fulcrum, which is a little triangle.
31:59
You gotta stick on it and depending on where you put your hands more weight, you can lift.
So you're the same strength.
But depending on, where you put the stick on the fulcrum, the more power you can have on the other side, right?
The more lift.
And so Leverage is the difference between what you put in and what you get out in the more leverage, you have The more you can get out, right?
32:19
And so if I make a hundred phone calls, that is my output 48 Hours, whatever.
If I spent eight hours hiring eight people and then they now make a hundred phone calls every day.
I spent eight hours one time and then I get 800 calls every day from now until I, you know, until till Kingdom Come From that 18 hours.
32:39
So if I had eight hours of calling versus eight hours of hiring somebody and training them to make those calls for ever, which one is more leverage, right?
The second one.
So that's labor.
With capital.
It's like I can go gather all this money over my lifetime or I can just ask people to have gather all the money for me and then I say I will allocate it for a percentage but my time basis is zero.
32:58
The only time basis I have there is literally just the getting of money from those people, not the income generation.
It's just literally getting the money that they spent their time generating to give to me to then invest.
And I get a percentage of that with no time spent which is how Warren Buffett Carl Icahn, some of these huge people David Rubenstein which is Carlisle's CEO and founder.
33:18
All these people built their next level of wealth.
So like ancient Egyptians leverage, through Labor, old school, American tycoons, leverage through capital, and the new school is through code software, and media eyeballs.
So the compounding, the second part of that is, how does something feed on itself and so the way that something compounds is that the Baseline that it starts with never gets lost, it only grows unto itself.
33:43
And so if you think about a dollar getting 10%, right?
Or it's a dollar and ten cents next year.
Now, if I get 10% again, then I get 11 cents on my dollar and ten cents and now it's 121.
If I get ten again, then I get 12.1 cents for the next year, which goes to one thirty, two point, whatever.
34:01
And so the idea is that when you have a long enough time Horizon that little bit that went from 10 cents to 11 cents 11 cents to 12 cents in 40 years goes from 1 billion to one point 1 billion right?
You just add zeros to the machine.
34:17
And so, if you want something that's going to become a huge, you need something that compounds and ideally even multiple forms of Leverage, right?
That compound unto themselves.
And so, if you look at Facebook for example, just simple one, they had leverage because Zack wasn't actually doing the stuff inside of this company.
34:33
He got Capital because you got a whole bunch of other people to give him money, rather than trying to make it in order to build the thing he had code because he had software that they could build one time and then infinite, number of users could build it and then they have built on media, right?
Side it all for, which is why it's, you know, one of the most valuable companies in the world.
So you look at Amazon, same thing, right?
34:50
The meat of they have is of buyers and customers people search for shit.
They want to buy its media, literally High intent media.
You look at, look at Google same thing.
It's they're searching for stuff.
They want to know Amazon searching for stuff you want to buy Facebook searching for people.
They're all search engines in their own way, but of different Commodities.
35:08
I'll make a prediction.
I do think that there will become micro more fragmented channels over time.
In terms of media, I think they'll become they'll be deeper.
I'd just like old-school media did.
They had four channels and need 100 channels and then we went to four channels, which is Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, whatever, and then we're talking about like a man when I was a kid, there was only four platforms for social media now they're hundreds.
35:32
And so that's Alex's prediction of how I think media is going to transform over time.
Which also means that the people who are really going to be able to stay big and stay relevant, will have to build the infrastructure in order to package their content in such a way to be present across all of them.
And so right now, Is why it's one of those crazy times where if you run an ad on one of the four TV channels, everybody knows you the fact that mr.
35:55
Beast is 24 and can have 100 million followers is something that I believe is a blip in time.
And then, for that to be recreated 10 years from now, will be significantly more difficult because he wouldn't be able to start in immediately have access to the entire world because also, because social media is becoming weapon ice, right?
36:16
From a propaganda perspective.
And for those who don't know, like propaganda is an actual part of military warfare's, there's a whole thing about it right?
Psyops.
I agree or I think that media will become nationalized for many, many countries that already is in a lot of countries.
America just one the only one that doesn't.
36:32
So we allow businesses that are owned in other countries, to own the media and the attention of our population.
It's kind of wild and so I don't know if that's going to continue forever.
I don't think it's wise that they do that but if that's the case, like You know, Russia is building their own version of YouTube.
36:49
China is building their own said they want.
They everyone wants to control media, right?
Just why, you know, the first amendment's of the u.s. our freedom of press, right?
So we want to be able to have that will have to look at what that looks like.
When when that wall was written, the UK would have no way of doing it.
But now, the UK absolutely could own the newspaper that everybody reads right now.
37:08
We don't have a beef with the UK, but you understand the point.
And so big picture, leveraging, compounding, leverages the difference in.
What you what, you put in, what you get out, the people who make the most money are the ones who have the most leverage because Everybody has same amount of time.
It's just who gets the most back to their time writing compounding.
Is that now, that you've made that trade with your leverage that trade that you made one time, is it going to compound unto itself and get you even more back?
37:28
Because compounding is a form of Leverage.
Because if it compounds means, I made this investment one time and then 20 years from now, I get even more back from that one time investment, right?
So it's another way that you get leverage attention is scarce resource because there's a fixed amount of it, you only have so many hours per day and so many senses ears and eyes that Turned on, that's it.
37:49
So there actually is a fixed amount of the resource, right?
Just like oil, just like land, right?
These are all fixed resources.
And so the interesting about right now is that attention was going wildly under monetized.
So, up to this point, the vast majority of people's days, their eyeballs were not being monetized, the things they were listened to or not being monetized.
38:09
And so right now is a land, grab for the entirety of the pie of our Collective attention.
And so, right now, that's why these companies, These are just gobbling up so much money because they can just sell it at zero cost to other people.
A hundred percent margin like, think about this when you pay Facebook, a million dollars a month or five million dollars a month ago, some of the companies that we have do in our portfolio we don't even get a ref like think about a business where you sold something and someone peed you five million dollars a month for the thing and you don't even get a representative to talk to and the cost for the media cost basis is 0.
38:46
Then you have the people who Run things you have this offered about the actual cost itself is 0.
Like that is how you make so much money.
Like the cost basis on oil, once you bought the land, the zero, you had the equipment, you've literally energy to pump the stuff out, but like, it's like water except they sell it for $200 a barrel, right?
39:03
That's how it works.
So when I was looking at virality viral growth, people who have compounded growth in their media because their audience compound.
So if you have 10 people and then next month, one of those people brings a person and you can count on that consistently then next month you have 11 people and then the Next month, you have 12 people and then 12 and then it keeps compounding, right?
39:21
And so that is how audience compounds, right?
It's not actually your media.
That compounds is the people telling other people that's the compounding vehicle behind media.
And so the more giving you are, the more your audience is going to want to share your stuff because there's relational Capital that they gain by sharing it, right?
39:36
So if you think about, like people only share stuff because they're self-interested, they say, hey if I share this funny thing or share this insightful video, this person will think more of me, right?
It's not because of you it's because you provided enough value to That they think they want to be able to just like the bag in the status.
They want to be able to associate the value, you provide with them selves and so that they get status as a result of sharing your thing.
39:58
And so you want to make the stuff you have as good as possible with as few takes or ask as possible because you want to make it a shareable as possible.
Because there's if there's a take in the video, the likely that it gets shared a significantly lower, which decreases your own virality, the platforms that are the fastest of the ones that give the most, because if they give the most the audience, then shares them through word of mouth and through.
40:17
You know, sending them to friends, Etc.
Right?
And if we're thinking about our own content in that way, we want to.
If at least, if it's me, if I want to go as fast as possible, I want to decrease my give to a server issue, to such a degree that it becomes crazy that someone doesn't want to share it.
Like my whole goal, when I started this Channel and all the different platforms that I have is that I wanted people to say one thing, this is better than the stuff that I paid for, it's my it's my favorite comment when I see it on YouTube.
40:41
And when I see it on the, on the Instagram comments and Linkedin, and tick-tocking all the stuff like I can't believe this is free.
That is Always what my goal has been.
Because if I can do that, then I can siphon a whole bunch of the market share and not monetize anything, right?
And everybody was trying to compete for the same attention is going to do that, but they have to throw their asked said because they got to make money and I don't need the money.
41:02
And so that gives me my long-term enduring advantage and as a side note, if you ever would have a competitive Advantage, have it be patience because no one wants to copy it.
So with all that being said, how do you reconcile the whole give give give, don't ask be patient with, like, dude, I gotta pay rent, I gotta like feed my kids, like this is awesome, but like how do I actually do this in a way that I can feed myself?
41:23
Good question.
So I think of it like this is that you promote publicly you give publicly you sell, you ask privately.
And so if someone follows your stuff right and they're interested enough, they will seek you out.
41:38
And then when that happens by all means you sell and sell like, you mean it that way, you get all the compounding of the top of funnel that keeps multiplying itself and this is Compounding.
But it doesn't need to be because it's attached to a compounding rocket.
And so if you just know that you're going to monetize 10% or 1% of your audience every year, if your audience compounds then so too, will your sales even though the sales exchange itself?
42:01
Is it necessarily value additive you want it to be, but like, people are going to tell her father, dude, you gotta go through the sales process.
I just went through, like it's not really something that people share that way.
So how does this stuff work with, like outbound, right?
Like, how does all this stuff that I just said, like, work without bound?
Well, you're not going to outbound from your personal.
42:17
Brand, right?
But you'll outbound from the on behalf of your business.
Now when you have an outbound strategy and this could be totally separate whatever, but if you have an outbound strategy, the idea is that you recreate the organic experience that someone would do on their own, if they found your personal brand organically and so like acquisition.com could reach out to companies and say, Hey, you know, you should partner with us, but I don't have context, right?
42:38
And said the deal structure I'd have to give would be significantly worse and I'd have to take them through significant longer process, and so if I wanted to get the same types of companies who had the same values as me, who had all these, The things I would have to take them through a tremendous amount of filters and indoctrination in order to recreate the same and customer from that process.
42:55
Now, there's nothing wrong with that.
It depends on the complexity of the thing.
You're selling.
If you're selling Salesforce the software you absolutely can do reach outs.
But the thing is, is that when you're building a personal brand, you're actually not selling the software you're selling values, you're selling ideals.
And so outbound works very well and transactional environment, like I could start the brand and then the brand has an outbound team.
43:14
It's better than Alex being the outbound team in my And so just like mr.
B's, The Rock Hooter.
Conor McGregor, my prediction for the people who will become the new sense of billionaires Etc, is going to be people who can do three things.
It was able to capture.
If the beetle hold, they have to be able to multiply attention.
43:32
And so, not only do you have someone's attention.
You have to be able to capture it first.
If you have to hold it for an extended period of time because you are interesting, you are fascinating, fascinating, your Lily fastening them down and pulling the attention from them.
And then you get them to tell other People.
43:47
And that is how you retentions attention multiplies because your audience grows so people can do those three things are the ones who are going to become Ultra, Ultra ultra wealthy in the future.
People.
And that is how you retentions attention multiplies because your audience grows so people can do those three things are the ones who are going to become Ultra, Ultra ultra wealthy in the future.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
You've read every email you seen every report.
So if you were coaching you right now, what would you tell you to do?
And what's crazy about this is that half the fucking time is not what I'm doing.
Take your own advice.
If you do that, I promise you'll make more money.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:38
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wish besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
So I had a conversation with a different friend.
He had a zillion businesses like resilient I get a spreadsheet family business is yet and they were all bullshit businesses.
0:55
They don't actually make any money but he has like a logo to website and like some VA, you know, I mean I got it's a business.
And he was believing the fallacy of.
I'm just going to wait to see the thing that takes off and then go on and on that who here is thought this thought Again I'm going to focus.
1:13
I'm just going to, we going to be patient.
See which one works out and then because I'm a good you know?
Statistics guy I'm going to go with the winning horse, right?
But the reality is that any of them can take off?
You have a billion-dollar roofing business end of a billion-dollar GC business, you got a billion dollar house will be business.
1:33
But you can't have them all.
She got to focus, you gotta pick one.
And the nice thing is it doesn't really matter which one you pick, but you do need to pick one.
The picking is the thing that grows it.
The ability to say no is the thing that grows it, not something you pick, it's who you are as a consequence of the decision.
1:50
That changes the outcome, not the vehicle.
So I make sense.
So how arrogant is that the thing that we can do multiple things at once and compete with someone who's spending all their time on that one thing, it's ridiculous and yet we still do it.
And so this is a, I love this little cartoon.
2:08
This guy, you know, he's got all the spinning plates and this is, this is me with the red hair, going to this guy, who's hopefully my competitor and handing him or place be like, oh, did you see all that shiny object over there?
Here more plates, go.
I'm just going to do this one thing.
It's my favorite thing in the world compete against.
2:25
Somebody's doing lots of things, it's very easy to win.
You don't have to do much.
Because you only have to do a tenth of what they do.
So this is what Focus really looks like one thing.
All it can write that down, you can Circle it one thing all in.
2:43
So I asked my friend of mine that had to Excel sheet with all these billions of questions, right?
I said, if I had a magic wand and I ended all your side projects except for one.
Just one, the one that you think has the most opportunity.
The one that's probably making the most money right now that you're not paying attention to because it's boring because it's old could be doing it awhile.
2:59
It's like yeah.
I was like you know, what business it is he's like yeah.
Like okay if you ended everything else dive a magic wand.
So I get to make the rules magic wand.
They all disappear.
I said, how easy would it be to go?
That thing is looked at me was like, really fucking easy.
3:15
It's like, hmm.
Interesting.
And so, he's like, but that would be so hard because of insert real reason that no one gives a fuck about, no one cares but I have to fire the huh.
But I would have to shut that.
Uh-huh.
But I would have to lay off the, huh.
3:32
All the riches you want on the other side of a few hard conversations.
And most people spend the rest of their lives, not having them and being poor in wondering why?
It's going to suck.
It's going to be okay.
That was my number three story magic wand.
Number four, my favorite story, who here has seen The Matrix.
3:52
Awesome.
You need to become the person who can say no to the woman, the red dress.
The woman in the red dress, is the representation of everything that is shiny object and beautiful and wonderful in the world, whatever your flavor of woman in the red dress is in.
The thing, is, this is something that I have now learned painstakingly, is that being able to say no to the one, in the red dress changes at levels.
4:16
You can say no to the one of the red dress.
She's a crackhead on the corner, right?
Thousand bucks a month.
You're like, I can stand out of her.
No worries.
I got something better, right.
But then the ten thousand dollar month, girl.
You're like huh?
Okay, interesting.
And if you're making ten thousand dollars a month, it's hard to say no to that girl, but let's say that you're a hard-working discipline motherfucker, you get to a hundred thousand dollars a month, there's a hundred thousand dollar month, girl, that's an opportunity that is much bigger than the one that you said no to before.
4:46
And you have to learn to flex the muscle every level.
This, this is a lesson that I learned the hard way.
I started a supplement company.
When Jim Owens is doing 26 million a year and rather than say, oh, why don't I just take Jim launch 240.
Next year, I'll start another thing.
5:02
Jim launch stayed the same, and then I added another source of Revenue that got us the 37, but it was a mistake strategically.
I can tell the story.
It sounds great on paper.
We sold the company, lots of money, whatever, but like it was not the right move.
And so I had learned how to say no to a million-dollar opportunity, 5 million, 10 million, but I hadn't learned how to say no to a 20 million dollar opportunity when I was making 20 million.
5:27
And so like the woman in the red dress becomes more seductive more attractive, the better you get the more status, you get the heart of the girl you attract.
Right.
And I'm saying this figuratively for entrepreneurs, that makes sense.
For every was not into women with red dresses, okay?
Because this is what the woman in the red dress, really looks like just ready to smash your shit and distract you and spread you thin so that you can't keep your eye on the ball and then eventually she spreads you.
5:56
So thin that you don't know how to get out and it feels like quicksand.
Soon as you put out fires here there's fires here as far as here fires here.
I need more Talent.
You take the best person from over here to fix that problem.
Then this thing goes to shit.
How do you get out?
Got a cut shit.
Got to eat your ego.
6:12
You got to watch your Revenue, go down.
So you can refocus, reconsolidate.
Bring the troop said.
I'm saying this because someone here needs to do this and I wish I'd fucking heard this from somebody else.
I would avoid a lot of pain.
So how do you become that person who can say no to the one in the red dress, you do the activity.
6:30
Someone with this character traits would do, despite not feeling good about it so I'll tell you a story that'll drive this home.
So Layla I were on this walk not that long ago and I said you know, I was like I'm so impatient so impatient I need to be more patient, right?
6:45
And she was like, I don't think you're impatient, I was like, yeah, I fucking hate this.
Let's I want this to be faster.
I want everything to be bigger faster, stronger.
She's like, yeah, but you're not changing your behavior.
Like you feel that way but you haven't done anything.
That's not aligned with the long-term strategic Vision.
7:02
Like yeah, I feel fucking terrible.
I want to be like Zen about it is like yeah, that's not how it works.
She's like patience is about the behaviors.
We do not how we feel about behaviors.
So, who here has heard the quote courage is not the absence of fear, but it's action despite fear, right?
7:18
Patience is not not feeling impatient and feeling terrible about waiting about not jumping on these opportunities.
It's about not jumping on the opportunities despite feeling like shit about it and wanting to write loyalty is not necessarily about the fact that your eye doesn't get caught every once in a while, right?
7:35
Or maybe even feel a desire that you wish you didn't feel.
It's about with you act on it because who here would rather have somebody like I think you already know where I'm going with this, right?
In terms of loyalty.
How would you rather right?
You'd rather the person not act on the behave on the thought?
That is how you gain the trait.
And then over time, this is my belief.
7:52
If you do that enough times, those feelings, go away through exposure therapy, like you get exposed to this condition over and over again and eventually you know that you don't die, because that's what it feels like.
And so whether it's a loyalty issue and integrity issue, a courage issue, a focus issue, which is the point of this message today, to become that person, you just start acting like the person who has those beliefs and you behave in that way and then it will stink in woman in a red dress.
8:21
So nude, Attraction.
Kill leveraging.
Keep you poor Focus.
Multiplies it.
I said three things.
Number 1.
How make you money really works.
All comes down to leverage.
Number two.
Why making new stuff is making you.
Poor to means you have to focus.
And number three is why better is leverage.
8:39
This is the make money part.
Here's a simple approach to growth that we use with our portfolio companies, better is better than new better is leverage because remember, Leverage is how we get more from what we put in If you do it better, you get more for what you put in.
8:55
That is leverage examples.
If you have call scripts, if you make content, if you have websites that you are building, if you have follow-up sequences, if you have offers, if you do the current thing you get what you currently have, if you make it better, you will get more from the activities.
9:14
You can create leverage in your business.
By being better.
And better comes from boring.
Most of us solved an emotional need by quitting, whatever we were doing to start to become an entrepreneur.
And then we had a positive reinforcement from that from that behavior.
And so then we learned that as a way of life.
9:32
But the problem is that the thing that forced you or give you that emotional that decrease your action threshold, thus that you would jump into the next thing is the very thing that will make you jump out of the opportunity that could become your billion dollar thing.
Does that make sense?
9:48
You felt uncomfortable in your job?
Quit your job.
You got rewarded.
And so you think, oh, when I quit things, I'll get rewarded, but that's the wrong lesson.
It only works once, then you have to unlearn it.
And with each level of Entrepreneurship, there are lessons like that that you have to unlearn the thing that got you.
There better comes from boring.
10:04
It is not exciting to run your 38th split test on a landing page.
It does make you more money.
It comes from doing all the shit that, you know, you should be doing but aren't and so, right now, this is an activity.
So this is an active part.
Imagine a list of all the stuff, you know, you should be doing but aren't doing right now within your existing business.
10:25
Like right now, like top of your head, you know, there's some shit that you should be doing in your business.
I'm going to give you 15 seconds.
The reason that stuff is so important is because you already know what you need to do.
And we come here get Rod Etc.
10:44
But the shit is on your desk at home.
That is the work.
That must be done, it needs doing.
And most of us know what to do.
And we don't want to confront because we want to do something more stimulating.
Exciting that makes us feel alive and your business doesn't give a fuck better is boring and better.
11:01
Get you more of what you put in better as leverage.
Now, imagine who here has a few businesses You really fucking hard to make that list, wouldn't it?
There's too much shit.
It's too much, too much stuff to make the business which means you have as possible, which means, that's why you have to pick one because there are so much stuff that has to be done to do one business, right?
11:25
Just do it, right?
If you do it right, you grow by default.
There's a promise.
Who here is like I know I should be doing more email follow-up.
I know, I should be calling my leaves within five minutes who here thinks that right now. okay, let me ask a different question and then if you did Richard, who hear calls other leads within five minutes, Okay.
11:48
Like too hands.
You will triple your sales triple triple.
What's a triple fucking business triple but that sounds boring.
Sure.
It's got a - ERM gotta get round-robin setup.
He's got to come in, you got to figure out how call prioritization Works between the team.
12:08
That's more makes you shitload of money.
That's how it works.
Who's going to win two different businesses.
The guy's got the shit.
Dialed better.
Gets you more for what you put in.
And when you do get home order it from the amount you have to put in to get the thing done.
12:28
That will result in the most output and start taking them off.
And you continue to ignore the new things that sound really exciting and you become the person who's able to do that by pretending to be.
The person is able to do that.
Cuz you already know what to do.
So this is a mental model.
I really like a lot.
12:46
Who here has ever had a coach or a mentor.
Has anyone ever coach or Mentor other people today?
Want to feel like they're a better Mentor than they are person who does shit 5 and said, the thing is is I asked myself this question.
It's actually one of the like most profound most helpful questions I've had which is if I were coaching me and the beautiful thing about this is that when you coach, you, you have no other agenda, you're just trying to help you.
13:10
And you also have more information than anyone else has.
You've been on every conversation?
You've been, you've read every email, male, you seen every report so if you were coaching you right now, what would you tell you to do?
And what's crazy about this is that half the fucking time is not what I'm doing.
13:28
Coach me much smarter than me me.
Right.
Boom.
Oh okay, take your own advice.
If you do that, I promise you'll make more money.
Billy got him, a special snowflake.
You're just convincing yourself that you're smarter than you are giving yourself reasons that reality does not apply to you.
13:48
It does and this is just a boss level, you might need to keep going against the snowflake until eventually figure out that you just got a melted by being there and hanging in.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
14:07
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And so in my entrepreneurial career, there's two periods.
14:23
Very clear definitions of periods of time in my life, the first period was when I was distracted, this is when I did not make money, I had six gems, I had a launch business, we return, we do Jim turnarounds in person that's where I actually physically was not at my gems.
14:39
I had a dentist Dental agency at a chiropractor agency I think I'd something else more lots of fingers, right?
And I was 26 ish and I would love to tell people.
I own nine companies, right?
14:56
I'm poor, but, but it felt really good stroke my ego not a bank account.
So it was only one Layla, the angel of my life just like, hey, you know, this one makes us the most money and you spend the least amount of time on it that Jim wants thing actually works.
15:16
But I have to like, I would have to like sell all those gyms I'd have to and Partnerships that have to let go of people in the agency and she was like, yeah, or you could just, you know, keep doing what you're doing.
Just clearly working point taken, you know, and so over the next 90 days, I sold five.
15:33
Jim shut one down, shut down, both agencies and got rid of everything and 12 months later from that moment we were doing one and half million a month. 10 12 months after that.
We had four and a half million a month one sec.
15:50
So this was the second period just focus.
It's so much easier to stack the deck in your favor.
If you just do one thing because when you focus on one thing you make it unreasonable to fail.
If you do one thing for an extended period of time, it becomes unreasonable to suck.
If you do it more than anyone else has done it, you'll be better than that.
Just is what it is.
16:06
We must talk to, like, hey, how'd you get so good at sales?
I took four thousand fucking sales calls.
That's how I did it.
So, I did it.
I'd even I didn't go through a sales training at four thousand, five and conversations.
That's why I did it.
And so if you, if you wanted to be the best salesman the world, then have more sales conversations.
Anyone else has if you want to be the best real estate investor, then do more deals than anyone else has.
16:23
And the stuff like the subsequent before that is send out more mailers.
Anyone else has have more cold callers.
Anyone else has said more cold gems than anyone else has and you'll become the best.
And if you put that as the output, the thing that you're looking at, it becomes unreasonable that you would be not the best, right?
16:39
Like you're leasing me top 10.
Hey, who here would be top 10 in real estate and us you be okay with that wouldn't be bad.
And the thing is that everyone fails because they want to move fast like this is the number one issue.
So they don't have a solid foundation.
They draw the dotted line.
16:55
They think I'm going to try and shortcut it.
I'm not going to fix my product.
I'm not going to make it really good because I want to go fast as I want to show to my friends that I'm growing every month on a show.
How good I am.
The thing is, it's a short game, like, how many times?
It's like it's the, the restaurant example.
17:11
So simple.
So many people start a restaurant.
Slap two pieces of Wonder Bread together.
Put a slice of bologna in there and then Marketed like fucking crazy and they're like, dude, I don't get why my business isn't growing.
I'm like, because everyone who has your food, literally tells everyone that it fucking sucks and never come back.
So there's this invisible hand, that works against people, which is who knows about the power of Word of Mouth, right?
17:34
The Invisible Hand, who he runs ads.
When we ask that question, here, runs advertising.
Okay, if you run ads and it has become more expensive for you, disproportionate to the increase in cpms, just cost per impression or eyeballs in that period of time that you've been in business, then it means that you have negative word-of-mouth.
17:52
So if you're like, why don't get that many referrals?
Oh you sure do get a whole bunch of people who you get - referrals you get - sales you spend twice as much with our Customer because every other customer that you would have acquired was told by someone else, not to buy from you.
It's invisible head when you shortcut it, promote, promote, promote, promote, and then Flatline, and then dissolve, and then you come up with new shit and you who here has seen the people on the internet doing this game over and over and over again, don't get the product, right?
18:18
They put two pieces of Bologna.
You know, if sandwich together with Abalone slice in the middle and they call it a product and then we have ham with one slice in the middle and it's still shit because they don't want to take the 12 months to actually get the fucking product, right?
But on the long game, ten years from now, the guy who takes a first-year takes a break even on that year, just to get the product right, makes everything easy but no one can wait 12 months.
18:43
Because they can't see the big picture.
They keep trying to string three of these little shortcuts together rather than building Foundation.
Better is leverage better, get you more for what you put in.
This is what small businesses look like.
This is what big businesses look like.
19:00
The amount of activity is actually not that different.
It's just a line just on the same direction.
It's all it is.
It's really not like I promise.
You been in both, it's all this.
There's nothing.
There's no magic.
Just a wine.
Same own put more output, well boring but better looks like it means split.
19:18
Testing landing page is not once but weekly Not just one time.
When you come here, you put the process in place to do it every fucking week.
Split testing, emails, not once but weekly making you ads and creative.
Not, when you have to but before you need them role playing with the sales team, not once but daily Role playing with customer success.
19:39
Hey, I want a refund.
Hey, I hated this.
Hey, it wasn't fast enough.
What do they say?
Roleplay, you have amazing.
Customers, she says a role play every day.
Look, if I'm good, I promise how exciting is that?
Not at all.
Not at all.
19:54
You know, what it does is makes more money.
Taking 10 more interviews for the same role.
Sucks sucks to talk to him or people for no reason, but there is a reason because you're trying to find the one person that's going to give you 10 times The Leverage on that time.
You got back.
Think about this.
What if you didn't take this interviews, you hire someone.
20:12
Wait, six months in the have to do the whole thing again and you lost the six months.
That's what Layla was talking about taking more time to make your lead magnet better.
Make your offer better and better.
All these things are boring, but make you more money.
And so this is my promise is that doing all the unsexy shit that you aren't doing?
20:30
But no, you should is the secret to the success by promise.
If you do nothing new but only what you already know you should be doing that yourself, coach tells you to, you will make more money next month.
And you can imagine you just got to do it, right.
So this is actually a text I got yesterday.
20:49
Yeah, it was yesterday.
This guy had lost everything and he had set a goal down for himself and he said, hey Last Day 2021 said, a business goal.
That's always quite honestly unrealistic impossible to hit.
Well, I'm going to surpass it in Q3 and so the only thing that I told him to do was to commit to the activities.
21:09
I was like just do the same thing every day rain or shine.
It was Prospect as a prospect every day.
He's like, And the first few months, he actually had a couple good months and then he slow down.
He's like how do I say how do I stay committed?
I was like cause you felt successful for fucking getting an outcome.
It's irrelevant for who you are.
21:27
Some of you guys have heard this quote but your work works on you, more than you work on it.
I was like, you need to become the person who isn't satisfied with, whatever that outcome was, but only by the commitment that you made yourself about the activity that you were going to do.
And so whether it was up or it was down at divorces, the actions from the outcome, not to say that the outcome is not the work, it is.
21:45
But in terms of Who You Are, who you are is is forged in the repetitive act.
And so I just said this last thing.
I said once you feel whatever the matter final point, Who here knows the difference being a 7 out of 10 book and a 9 and a half out of ten book.
About 20 times.
22:01
The work realistically who here?
Knows the difference in sales is 27 and half book and a nine and a half Buck about 1,000 times the sales.
And so if you do 20 times to work and get a thousand times the effort, that's a 50 X increase per unit of input.
22:19
It's a lot it's worth, but you do have to do 20 times more work.
That is leverage an opportunity is missed by most because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
So I said I was going to cover three things, I want to make sure I fill my promise.
Number one is how making money really works, leverage, every feel, good with that, to make sense.
22:37
Alright, number two, why making new shit is making you, poor?
Why you have to focus number three, is why better is Leverage Awesome output comes from, volume times leverage, you must do more and get more from what you do, the way you get more, from what you do is you first do everything that you know, you should be doing better.
22:58
The way you do that is to focus on one thing for a long time without distraction.
Anything can become big with time when you line all actions to a single outcome and you keep working at it, your success will look effortless and obvious from the outside, but you will know that it came from years of saying, no to everything, except that, which mattered.
23:15
Most, this is how we grow companies that acquisition.com.
Through leverage most entrepreneurs like the who the what and the how to scale attack was not calm.
We recruit the who we give them the what we show them the house once in an entrepreneur has all three, the business scales by default.
And that's it.
Thank you guys so much.
I appreciate you.
23:18
Through leverage most entrepreneurs like the who the what and the how to scale attack was not calm.

And that's it.
Thank you guys so much.
I appreciate you.








0:00
Motivation.
What's going on?
This is a podcast that I did three years ago.
So this is Young movie.
This is pre-acquisition.com.
This is in the middle of gym launch.
I went on a show with Billy Rickman and we talked about how to do business without breaking the bank and how to leverage hard work within the context of a small business.
0:17
I think you guys will dig it.
And enjoy, it's like restaurants as number one and then gyms are number two for the highest failure of businesses.
And I think typically it's just for the same reasons, people are like, I like cooking.
I'll make a restaurant and people, like, I really like a fitness and health.
Oh, Open a gym and the skill set that it takes to like fitness and health couldn't be further apart from actually running a profitable.
0:35
Jim welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
You tell the story.
It's almost like when a child Company CEO tells a story about 20 years ago, when we started this company, you know, especially we just quickly, shouting off are beforehand and we'll talk about Revenue, right?
0:57
And so to give people some perspective about the rapid growth You had put a post out the SS as anyone have any questions they want me to ask our leeks and leaves the people DMV and one.
One specific person was super intrigued about how did you grow so rapidly without bankrupting the business or without going nuts?
1:13
Either way.
Yeah, we're sensitive.
All right, first of all what are your numbers right now?
How quickly have you grown the company?
So this last month we did over 4 million like 4.1 or something like that.
U.s. so my Mark is Australian so yeah we're talking six million a month.
It's like 25 million.
1:29
Australia, right?
Yeah.
Yeah our place is insane, right?
A can of Coke is $150 over here.
So yeah, so that's where we're at right now.
Yeah.
And so going back to the question, how did you do it?
One of the things I'm super fascinated by adding business, is the psychology of business about why some people make it and some people don't.
1:51
So like following you online, listening to your podcast, watching videos, reading blogs and articles about you, things like that and even chatty soon.
After about five minutes, I can see you have a certain level of Charisma and confidence and and well, you know what I mean?
Like, there's some times that those things come into it, right.
What?
2:08
How much, Comes down to the hard work of about the strategy, the, the knowledge or their, you know, the comprehension.
How much does it come down to just the person as an individual?
Well, I think one goes hand-in-hand with the other and so, like I think I've just recently, I recently, read through the book grit by Angela Duckworth and like one sitting I read half the book and I was like, all right, I get the point.
2:30
So basically they just look at it like super successful individuals and they were able to tease out like because it wasn't intelligence.
We already know that IQ doesn't really do it.
EQ is like a little bit better, but like they're like, what is it to predict, you know, someone becoming, you know, being able to achieve massive things and they just called a grit just name it index for it.
2:48
And I kind of said, but it's basically like, how long will you hold on and keep pushing when things suck.
And so I think that grit is what creates skill level that then creates the achievement, because the simplified version of it, and I'm trying not to paraphrase book, but it just it articulated it really well.
3:05
And it's just that, like, within the equation of achievement, there's two Jesus, there's Talent times effort, equal skill, right?
And then ill times effort equals achievement and so effort, counts twice.
And so that's kind of like Talent is only one quarter of that whole piece when effort is counted two times.
3:25
And for me, it's really encouraging because the amount that somebody who paints consistently for 30 years can paint for somebody who's talented at painting and only pays for six months.
The person who's been paying for 30 years is better by a mile.
Even if They have a quarter of the talent.
And I think that a lot of people put too much weight on how talented our, how smart they perceive themselves to be rather than what their actual potential is based on actually just consistently doing something.
3:50
Yeah, there's a ton of people who graduate from Harvard and Ivy League schools which and do the math or anything.
Yeah and so the original question was how much do I think strategy and hard work contributed to the rapid growth?
The strategy came from the fact that like this isn't my first business this is my seventh business and You learn things each time and the gyms were one of the, you know, I count that as like, you know, 1 and so like there's a lot of little failed Ventures that happened in between that were valuable lessons and I think that's kind of the great aspect is like you just keep going because some people just go back to get a job and it sounds like you just keep going and you keep collecting these scars.
4:29
That eventually amount to better decisions based on experience.
And so like right now, people consider me a sales, whatever.
You know like that I'm good at selling.
It's more so than Good at teaching people how to sell, but I also did 4,000 one-on-one closes and so like, is it that I'm really talented or that like I've just done it a lot of times and it would be unreasonable for me to not be like if I weren't decent at it at this point, like you like what is wrong with you?
4:56
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
5:11
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
Even to use your industry as a metaphor with the GM.
5:27
Like, you know, it's the same thing, right?
The guy goes, and does a thousand bench presses or the guy goes and does 20 bench presses.
The guys going to be stronger, who's done a thousand, it doesn't matter what your genetics are like, you know, for the moment, you know.
Yeah, most that exists somewhere that are just, you know, program there's whatever.
5:42
But like for the most part.
Yeah.
Right.
So when I when I didn't shoot Alex shop and he said that you and I were similar in a way because we were both passionate about failure in our industry and so my Be one of the reasons why so my background is I was in the military for eight years, I kind of fell into the the Hair beauty cosmetics of Industry, started a franchise business, grew up for eight years, sold it off and and start exactly the same thing.
6:09
As you had someone reached out to me said, hey I'm struggling.
Can you help me?
Yeah, sure why not.
Let's just yeah see what we can do and got really good results and then they told somebody else and it kind of snowballs and eventually I went, you know what, I'm going to sell my franchise to do this full time because I really love helping people and seeing results and I must buy yourself a lottery system, has a lot of it anyway.
6:28
And you know, I could just float in and one of the things when I first started coaching that became really apparent to me, is the amount of failures in the industry.
How many people were in love with the industry?
And they are going to start a business in the industry, they start it and they never transfer transition from technicians, a business owner and you speak to you later, they're pulling their hair out.
6:49
They've got no relationships at home, you know, money and they're totally out of love with the industry there.
Like a chain and shackle to their business and I was like, something has to change here.
This is, this is not a good direction for the industry.
And so Alex tells me that El Chapo tells me that's a similar kind of way.
7:06
The gym industry is for.
Yeah, it's exactly like that I would say that.
I mean, it's like restaurants as number one, and then Jim's our number two for the highest failure of businesses.
And I think, typically, it's just for the same reasons, people are like, I like cooking.
I'll make a restaurant and people, like, I really, like, fitness and health open a gym, and the skill set that it takes to, like, fitness and health.
7:25
Couldn't be further further apart from actually running a profitable gym.
And so, you know, and to be really, you know, it's funny.
You said that, like when I had my gyms, I honestly thought everyone was doing what I was doing.
So I just didn't, I didn't think that the things that we've put in place we're really revolutionary by any, you know, by any stretch of the imagination.
7:43
I was like, yeah.
So we assign Elise and run some ads and fill the gym, you know.
Yeah, everyone must be doing is yeah, it was like halfway through I convert three out of four and two alone.
Oh, in into a year-long membership was like and then we're good for the air like it's, you know, I mean, it seemed it seems simple but a lot of things as like you don't know what you do.
8:02
It's like unknown unknowns.
You don't know what, you know, or you don't know what.
Yeah.
So yeah, that resonates.
Yeah, we went with the geometry that it's funny.
You say, you don't know what you don't know.
And it's funny when you're looking at somebody else's industry and you think they've got it so much easier and say some things, I would see I see some ID amount of friends and they do amazingly well but it's very like you focus on the people who are doing well, right?
8:23
You don't look at all those ones that are The road anymore.
When you drive down there, like, you don't notice that they've gone.
You notice the ones that are consistent, they were there all the time.
Well, they must be doing something well, and, and what?
And I look at gym owners, I think to myself, they've got an advantage over my industry.
Because you've got usually typically when you're looking you say, well, they must be self-disciplined, they must be self-motivated.
8:43
They've got high energy, all of these things and so is that true?
Or is it not true?
So that like I would have an advantage in our business because gym owners are more disciplined and warm.
Elevated etcetera versus coaching psychism.
Yeah.
8:59
Gym owners are hardworking a shit so because also in the fitness industry, it's super common to work from 4:00 a.m. until 9 p.m. like it's normal and you work six days a week because your first, your first client, your first session starts at 5 and your last client ends at nine.
9:17
And so you're basically always working and that sometimes you get the middle of the day off.
But you're so exhausted that it's Forgot to like, do lots of productive stuff and sometimes you try and work out and you get a half ass workout and you're the person who's supposed to be the fifth person and, you know what I mean.
9:33
And so then you start snowballing and the only day you get office like Sunday.
And then you really just meal prepping that day for the rest of the week.
You can eat at a tupperware is all day at the gym and so from an advantage there, point from a work ethic side.
Yes.
I mean, I don't know how hard salon owners work but I know that Jim was work their ass off.
9:49
Yeah, it's all I get the feeling you don't work hard, I think they work really hard, but I think people in a lot of people in my industry will be watching this.
And Listen to this, their mums and they have to do the kids school runs and and they're trying to, they're trying to figure out how to balance your work and, and their career and their ambition with the personal life at home as well.
10:07
And I think that's one of the things I hear from my clients all the time.
Anyways, one of the hardest things for them to try and they have such big goals and dreams but it's like they have this apparent guilt and then they feel like they're not being a good wife and mom and things like that.
I'm not saying that father still struggle with it, the way moms do, but I would say that if I'm being candid, they probably struggle with it.
10:25
It as much because there's a certain expectation for culturally.
You know, that guys are going to be putting bread on the table and doing everything you can to work.
Well, you know, wife, mom, Etc, States at home.
I'm not saying, not all of our, all of our gym.
Owners are married, not all of our gym owners and kids but by and large.
But clientele wise, we're 80 percent male.
10:42
So 80 percent of my clients are alarmed.
Hope you guys enjoyed some throwback Mosey way back.
When pre-acquisition.com got to hear me, probably a little bit more tactical than I normally would be about business.

They have no idea.
You don't need money to make money.
The wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.

I hope you share and enjoy.
I want to break the myth that you need to go make a million dollars that you need money to make money, all right?
And so I'm going to show you 10 different ways.
You can make a million dollars and you can apply this to a thousand dollars.
0:54
A hundred dollars a hundred million dollars.
The concepts is what I'm trying to translate to you because you can do any of these things and add or detract the amount of zeros that you feel comfortable with.
So if you want to make less money by all means, take more zeros off.
All right.
Now the first thing that you can do, if you want to make a million dollars, is that you can Sell something for a million dollars and as crazy as what I'm saying, sounds you absolutely can sell something for a million dollars.
1:20
If you go to an e-commerce store and they're doing a hundred million dollars a year and you say, hey if I can increase your conversion across your entire site, rewrite, your emails, redo your landing pages, etcetera, and I can get you a 5% lift, site-wide, can I get one percent of that?
1:36
So you make them an extra, five million a year, and you get one.
Do you think you can do that?
Yes.
Why are you gonna be able to do so much?
Not because of you but because of who they are.
Alright so you make a million dollars by selling someone else five to ten million dollars of value.
That's how you make a million dollars.
1:53
Like real talk the second way and you're like I don't know how to do that that's fine but except you don't have to do that and then say I want to learn how to do that and go get the skill of doing that and then you can go sell it.
You can't say that you don't have the money and that's why you can't make money.
That's why I'm making this video.
The second one is that you can borrow a million dollars and then buy something and have someone else pay it back.
2:13
Fundamentally, what real estate is you borrow money to buy an asset, you put tenants into the asset, they pay off the money that you never had.
That is what real estate is, right?
And if you can get the asset for free which is going to be the next bullet, I'm going to make, you can get a contract on something for less than it's worth and then you get the bank to finance the whole thing.
2:35
So if you're like, but I don't know if they'll do that, they will if it's priced low enough.
So if you have to go talk to a thousand building owners, Hours.
Then you will probably get one of them who's willing to depart for their thing for significantly less than it's worth.
And a bank will loan the difference and you don't have to put any money down out-of-pocket.
2:52
The also be willing to sell our finance, a portion of their house to you.
So if you get a house for let's say, let's say, you have a hundred thousand dollar house, okay?
And you get it under contract for eighty thousand dollars from them saying that they're willing to give you the house for eighty thousand dollars.
And then you say cool, I can give you 70.
3:10
And then you got a seller, financed me the 10 over the next five years and they say sure and now all of a sudden you just got to get the bank and the bank finance is 80%.
And now, you actually just made the difference if you wanted to, and you can take that number and you can do it at a hundred million dollars.
You can do it at any of these levels.
That's number three, is you refinance something for more than you bought.
3:28
It number four, is that you get a contract for something for less than it's worth, and then you sell that contract.
And so, for example, in the refinancing thing that I just went over, if I got that contract for eight, I could not even go through it.
Purchase and just sell the contract to somebody else for nine.
And I make the difference between those two prices again.
3:48
Add as many zeros or as few zeros as you want to this example.
But if you understand how it works, then you'll stop asking how to make six figures a year because fundamentally the fact that you're attaching it to a year means you're thinking that you have to trade time for the money and that's how poor people think.
4:03
That's why most people stay poor because they're trying to think about what they have to do over a year to make a hundred thousand dollars because they're not thinking in terms of value.
You, they're thinking about themselves.
So if you want to be selfless, you have to think about the value.
Providing somebody else not about the money, you're going to get their time that you're going to spend.
So if you can make somebody like the cro example, conversion rate, optimization example, the beginning, if I can make some 15 million dollars, it takes me, 10 minutes, I could charge million bucks for it.
4:28
Why would I ask, how do I make a million dollars a year?
I would try to do 100 of those every year, right?
Doesn't matter how many of those would I do?
As many as I possibly good people think differently.
If you want to have more than you have right now.
Now the next one you can do is that you can sell something that's really expensive and get a commission.
4:45
Sounds really simple.
If you sell a skyscraper that's $109 skyscraper, you'll get 34 percent of that deal, you'll get three or four million dollars on a single transaction.
If you sell a 20 million dollar residents you might like that's crazy.
They exist.
Look one Zilla.
It's fine.
Believe me they exist.
5:01
The realtor gets five ish percent of the transaction.
That's a million dollars in the never own the asset and so you absolutely can make a million dollars with No money down if you have skills, that is the point.
That's the point I'm making the next one.
Is that you can find somebody who has an audience and buy whatever they're about to launch early and then sell it later.
5:20
Now that one does take some money, it's less but the value of the thing later that's how it balloons.
This is how the entire nft thing worked is that you have tremendous demand for a scarce resource.
They have the scarce resource and then it balloons the price because there's so many people bidding against each other to get it, right?
5:36
And so getting an early on those types of things which is why if you buy into something, The IPO it tends to almost always go up simply by the fact that there's way more eyeballs that are competing for.
The next one is selling units of stuff.
All right?
You wanted to make a million dollars.
You've got 52 weeks in a year, you gotta sell something that's about.
5:52
Twenty thousand dollars a week is what you got to make right over a year.
So there's a million bucks, 20 times. 52 is technically a million forty thousand for the internet trolls, but we're going to go with that.
So if you got to make 20 grand a week, how many different ways can make 20 grand in a week?
Well, you can sell 20 people a thousand dollar thing you could sell.
6:10
So two people a ten thousand dollar thing.
You could sell one person every four weeks and 80,000 do anything right?
Or you could sell on a weekly basis, 20 people who have 1000 or lifetime value.
And so, for example, if you have a hundred dollar month membership and the person stays for 10 months on average, then if you sell 20 of those every week over time, those will stack up and then you will cap add a million dollars and the only way to grow from that new million, that's your new crib.
6:36
Kapoor threshold is either you got to sell more units or you.
Make the thing that you're selling worth more, that's it.
And so right now for example, if you've been capped at your current Revenue level, your current income level, this is for small business owners for listening.
You either got to sell more units in the same period of time.
We're going to make the unit's worth more.
6:52
That's it.
If you've been stuck, there's the only to think those are the only two leverage.
You got, you got figure out which one it is for you.
The next one is that you can get people to give you their businesses for no money down.
Alright?
And so good friend of mine actually did this and he combined for different information businesses into one business and they were all a small businesses.
7:10
They were all doing about a million issue year.
I get small is relative but it's like and so he combined them all to be a four million dollar top-line million-and-a-half, bottom line business for no money out of pocket.
He literally said hey I know you don't want to do this business anymore, just give it to me and I'll pay you the income that you were going to make this business for the next two years.
7:27
That's what he said and they said sure.
And so we combined all this business together and then overnight, he owned an asset that was doing a million and a half a year in profit and four million and Top Line, and it cost him nothing to do it.
So not only did I make a million dollars, he made something that made him a millionaire half dollars a year.
Year per year.
Now, he has to pay the debt service back.
7:42
Which is the loan that those people said that he would pay them overtime back from the profit from the business, but he owns the asset.
And so if he turned round and went to say, hey, I'm going to go sell this, you probably sell the thing for five million dollars put together.
And so you got no money down and he said he would sell it and you could sell it for five million bucks.
8:01
And let's say that, if the seller financing all those was two times earnings over overtime because at small numbers, the deals are very good for sellers.
Right?
It It cost him two million bucks over the next, however, long and you can flip the whole thing, 45.
And he makes the three and he could still just choose to slowly pay them off over time where you could probably have an early cell bonus and pay even less like he made more than a million dollars with no money out of pocket.
8:26
If you like, I don't know how to do that.
The point is not to teach you how to do it.
Was you to recognize that you don't know how to do it.
And understand that the people who are making money, don't constrain themselves by time.
They're not thinking, how do I make X dollars per hour x dollars per year?
They're thinking, how do I provide the most value?
To somebody.
So they'll give me a percentage of the value I provide.
8:43
And so, the reason a good buddy of mine was able to make so much money selling and flipping commercial.
Real estate, was that he realized that if he bought for very little money down that he could basically take a hundred percent of the cash that someone put as a down payment for a commercial building and make it into a write-off.
8:59
Which means that if you made a hundred thousand dollars, let's assume you're in the highest tax bracket, a million dollars a year and you had four hundred thousand dollars in taxes.
You could take the four hundred thousand dollars that you were going to give to the government and just give it to him and then he put it into a building because of the amount of Leverage.
9:14
He was able to get in his deals because he would get them to seller finance half of the down payment.
So you'll need to put 10% down on these buildings.
So when you put 10% down the building, he could take the depreciation on the whole building and hand it to the guys who gave him money and so they got free buildings.
They didn't even care about the return on the building because it was bought with free money and so he figured that out.
9:37
And so he was able to get these big buildings under construction.
Contract under the terms that he knew his investors would like, because it basically exited them from the tax system, and then he was able to make the difference on every one of those deals.
And so is because he understood the value that he was providing to the building owners who own the building's for many, many years and wanted to get cash, he would lease it back to them after he bought it from them, and then you'd flip it to an investor who wanted to get a tax write-off.
10:02
So he understood the needs of multiple parties, was able to make the difference.
And if he does one of those deals, they make four million dollars.
How does he make a hundred thousand dollars a year?
I have no, Idea, he probably wouldn't answer the question because she's like, why would I bother?
And so that's the things people are asking the wrong question and so you always answer the questions you ask.
So the point of this future, ask different questions, I'll show you the last one right now, which is that you might be like, okay, well I don't have any money Etc.
10:24
And I gave you a whole bunch of examples that don't require anybody, but here's another one is that you can go find something you really like and go promote that you don't have to go find and make your own products.
You can find products that you really like from other companies and just become Affiliates of those products.
Right.
And the nice thing is that I just recommend you be honest like I tried a hundred fucking different soaps.
10:42
This is my favorite one and here's why people don't want to go through the time and the money of figuring out, which soap is the best for your audience.
And if you make the rack after you do that, they're like oh well shoot, he just save me time, he provided me value.
And so then I'll go buy from him through his link or whatever, right?
11:00
It's you can inflate other people's products and make money in that way, without any money out of pocket.
And then finally, Arbitrage in general, which is a fancy word.
But it just Means that you sell the same thing between two different markets because they're priced differently.
So the simplest example is if Bitcoin is nineteen thousand dollars in Japan on the Japanese Market is nineteen thousand.
11:21
One hundred dollars in the US market.
You buy the 19,000 are Bitcoin over in Japan and you sell it in the American market for 19:1 and you make a hundred bucks.
That's all Arbitrage is, and it happens with physical products.
It happens with lending money between two parties, if you can get money for 1% and you can sell the money. 6%, you make 5 is the difference, and you can put as many zeros as you want on that transaction.
11:44
It works the same way.
All of these are different versions of Arbitrage which is just same thing to markets, two different prices, you make the difference.
And so if you're looking for ways to make money look for Arbitrage opportunities because that's where you can make tremendous income.
So the next way to make a million dollars without any money is that you find something that is undervalued or that you believe will be undervalued in the future and then you Ask for a contract to buy it.
12:11
So I was talking to Caleb about this because he's like, oh it's kind of like flipping.
I was like, it's not because the difference between flipping is like you go to the garage sale, you buy something for a buck and then you find out that it's worth 30 online and you make the difference.
The difference here is that when you get an option it's like you go into the person who owns the garage and saying hey I would like the option to buy this thing for a dollar or rather two dollars.
12:33
If they're marketing it for a dollar for the next 30 days, that's what I would like and I will pay you a penny for Option and they you sign an agreement and they say sure you have that option and then now you take that piece of paper that the agreement that you can purchase it at a fixed price over this period of time.
12:50
And then you say, hey anybody who's got $30.
I know you want this thing because you're willing to pay me 30, why don't you pay me 20 for it and I'll just give you the rights to buy it and then you sell the paper for 20 bucks it cost you a penny and then the person who bought it from you makes the spread on the 10 because they're happy because they're going to get it for Less.
13:09
They probably you paid for it and you get rewarded for finding something that is worth more than you got secured the option to purchase it for and you made the difference.
And in that instance, you made a lot of the difference, right?
And you're like, how is that possible?
I'm making is to break your beliefs about what is possible because it is a farce.
13:27
When you think that you have to have money to make money, you have to have skills to make money.
If you can find an asset, that's undervalued like a house, like a building.
Like, what's up, whatever?
And if you're like, well, these aren't all over the place, duh.
That's why it takes skill to do it.
That's why Not a millionaire.
I'm not saying it's easy but I'm saying you don't need to have money to make money.
13:44
That's what I'm saying here.
And so if you go find a house that's worth 10 million dollars and you can get it for seven, you can get the bank to pay you ate for the house because literally 80 percent loan to value, right?
And so if you bought it for seven and the loan will be 48, it's like refinancing out the money.
14:04
So you make the spread from the bank, with no money down.
So many Kaufman was able to make his first million dollars in real estate.
If you've ever heard his story was because this is literally what he did.
He went from broke to a Millionaire on his first transaction.
The reason I'm telling you this is because if you believe the shit that you're reading, if you're listening to poor people and advice to on how to be rich, you will stay poor.
14:27
They have no idea.
You don't need money to make money.
Well, clockwise you guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs.
And make more money feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
14:46
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
Another way to make a million dollars is to sell something that's expensive that you never owned and be the salesperson like a 20 million dollar house and getting million dollar commission.
15:13
That's how you do it.
You never own the house, you literally find something that's very valuable, you go to the owner, you say you can sell it, you have the skill of sales and you sell that very expensive thing and you get a small percentage of the thing.
And the bigger, the thing that you sell the more money you will make the same thing can happen for So, when we sold Prestige, labs in gym laundry, social forty, six point two million.
15:34
The bankers got two million dollars for facilitating the transaction.
They never owned anything.
They signed an agreement with us, which cost them no money.
And then they did work which cost the company money.
But didn't cost the individuals money, they had skills, they applied those skills.
15:50
They got paid two million dollars.
You can make money, lots of money without having lots of money and literally all you do to all of these examples I'm giving is you, add zeros like it works the same way.
The option to buy a company.
What do you think we're options Traders?
That's what they're doing.
They trade options to buy companies so they they buy an option to buy a company.
16:09
Let's say they get 100 options because they have limits on them, is not an unlimited option.
They get 100 options that they can choose to exercise, right?
And so let's say that the stock price that they're getting the option for is $40.
And at the time, it's $50 in the future.
16:25
When they secure the option, the past and so they paid one percent of the total option which should be 40 times 100, which would be four thousand dollars.
If he one percent of that is typically the price for acquiring options, one percent of the total purchase.
So they pay whatever, 40 bucks for that.
And then later, if it does, go up, and it's 50 bucks, they make the difference on the 10 times 100, so the thousand dollars they made on 40 bucks, right?
16:49
That's how I've been treating works at a high level.
There's a million other things I want to get into it.
But the point is like they're doing that just on companies, right?
So you can do that on a house.
You can do that on a business, you can do that on a company.
The Concept of treating a future value.
So what it is another way that you can make a million dollars is that you can put a small amount of money into something that's extremely risky, which is the end of T, crypto, Etc, world and then attach an audience to it.
17:15
And so you create scarcity for a good or service or asset.
And then you blow an audience on top of it, which then Jack's the price up of whatever the thing it is that you're selling.
So you have a scarce resource.
Let's see if five of the thing and you get a million people to want the thing and then you sell, Only those five and then the price that you can charge for anything, when you have a million people betting on it, if there's only five of them is a lot.
17:36
So it's another way you can make a million dollars and that's on a digital asset, which cost you nothing to do.
Another way is literally reverse engineering, the so this is a little bit more tactical, but I think it's important is that most people don't even know the math around making a million dollars, all right?
And so, in a big picture perspective, you can just sell something for a million dollars and that may make you laugh.
17:56
But like that is also a way to make a million dollars underneath of that you could sell.
Things that are ten thousand dollars right which is to a week.
So two people week for 10 grand, have a million-dollar business now you're not making a surly man dollars unless you have no employees but you have a million dollar business underneath of that.
18:13
You can also think about it from a monthly perspective, right?
Which is okay if I have people who are paying me, $200 a month, right?
That's 2400 dollars a year.
Assuming they stay for that period of time and in order for me to make a million dollars, I have to do 400 people who are paying me too.
18:30
Dollars a month.
Roughly, it's 83,000 but you get the idea 413 or whatever.
The number is on recurring Revenue every single month.
Makes you a million dollars, right?
You can sell 1000 people, 1000 Dollar thing and a good way to think about this is not even necessarily the ticket price but the lifetime value.
18:47
All right, we'll get real with you guys right now.
This is how I analyze every business that I look at.
I look at sales, velocity gets LTE and you're like, what the fuck is that?
I'll tell you right now, sales posses the number of units sold per month, all right?
So if you sell 20 people a month on your Think yourselves lost his 20s.
The number of units sold.
19:03
Okay, and then you multiply that by the lifetime value of the customer.
Okay, and so for me, I know I have a long time Horizon and so even if something's $10 a month, and I know that this person over time is going to be worth $1000 to me.
Then I know that at this sales velocity at 20 times the lifetime value of a thousand dollars.
19:22
I'm going to be at twenty thousand dollars a month if I change nothing about this business it'll increase quickly and then it will slow down as you start to reach your equal.
Librium at the top.
We have 20 people per month if thousand dollars and LTV.
It just depends how long it takes to get that thousand dollars.
It takes you a year.
You'll get to that balance point in about a year if it's actually probably takes two years because every year to assemble that amount and then a year later but the matter and so big picture when you were thinking about how to make a million dollars multiply the number of customers you have by the lifetime value and that will give you your predictive index of where you will hypothetically max out.
19:56
So right now you're stuck right at 10 sales of And the average person who pays you is worth, $1500 of lifetime value.
And if you're stuck at 15,000 a month because you have 10 people such a hundred you're stuck at 15,000, you're not going to drop because your life size 15, and you're selling 10, unless you make them more valuable or you sell more of them, you're not going to grow.
20:19
And so if you want the million dollars, you have to figure out how to make that math work.
So either, you got to sell whatever that is five times.
Six times more on the front, in terms of total units, or you have to make them worth five or six times more, More on the back, end by selling more expensive stuff, get by getting to stay longer upsell cross-sell Etc, right?
20:35
And so reversing your way into a million dollars.
From a business perspective just come down to number of units sold and then lifetime value.
That's it.
Another way to make a million dollars with no money.
Is that you can combine things that make money for no money down, give an example.
20:51
So, there's a company that we're looking at in our portfolio, that's trying to come on.
And they actually have guy went through a course on Ma, he got four small Guru businesses.
To give him their businesses, he seller financed it.
So let's say, you know, I'll give you two hundred thousand dollars for your business.
21:06
Your business makes two hundred thousand dollars a year and I'll give it to you over the next year, right?
So you just give me the business.
I'll keep running it.
You get your your turn, it thousand dollars.
And after the end of that year, I get it back where you can spread the dead over two years.
Whatever, right.
And so, he did that and he combined for different businesses, and he has a business.
21:22
Now, that does 4 million Top Line, a million and a half, and bottom line.
And he didn't build any of it, he just combined it, by getting all of them to sell our finance, their own.
Businesses to him.
And now he's a business that does four and one and a half, which might be worth 45 million bucks combined, right?
21:38
And so, he was able to create that value because of skills.
He didn't need money to do it, he needed skills, and it's exactly what he did.
And in that instance, he doesn't just make a million dollars.
She made something that makes him a million and a half dollars a year, and each has to wait a year to pay off his debts and then you can start realizing that.
21:53
But day one, even with the debt on the books, he has the asset that is now worth more.
Now you probably want to Run right through that.
Like, you know, it's stable and it's not going to all go to shit, but fundamentally it is now much more viable thing than it was before.
So when you combine small things into a bigger thing, things become more valuable, if you've heard the term a rollup and private Equity, that's when they take lots of little things, they combine them together.
22:15
They make it into a big thing and the big thing is worth a lot more because of the effort, it took to combine all the little things.
And so guy who's got a bigger check, Carlisle can't write checks for less than a hundred million dollars.
I think just it's not worth it to them, it's not worth the time.
And so they let these small Operators make the purchase more efficient for the big Sellers and get the Arbitrage.
22:36
So at the smallest level people will just give their businesses away for free.
By the way, if you didn't know that like every day, like 10,000, you know, old people retire and they just give up their businesses because they're kids, don't want to be plumbers or whatever it is, right?
They just, they just give up their businesses.
So there's huge opportunity right now to do that, and so people can mop these upper basically nothing.
22:55
They roll them together and they sell it to the first kind of tear of private Equity.
Now those tears are private Equity.
Like the guy that I was telling you He's just mopping up the bottom here, right?
He's got four million by million bucks of top white.
Now, another guy's going to take four or five of those guys and pop them into 25 million dollars of top-line and six or seven million dollars of ibadah and he's gonna be able to sell that for 60 to 70 million.
23:17
And then from there, there's a guy who's mopping up 25s and putting them together to be 125 million, Top Line, with 30, 40 million, and that guy's going to get even bigger multiple.
So you get the Arbitrage on the multiple, that is given to the Business that you're buying.
23:32
Like that's the Arbitrage between the two things, like the guy who gets it for free, he gets a huge Arbitrage by percentage, but his absolute amount is lower at the end.
The Arbitrage, in terms of multiples is not as high.
You're getting it on an enormous amount of money.
And so everybody makes money down the chain, it's just on different ways here on the bottom, it's on the multiple on the top.
23:49
It's just on the fact that it's such a huge amount of money.
If you get one more, you go, from a 10 x to a 12 x on a hundred million dollars.
Well, then you just make 200 million.
Even with that 11:50 difference, right?
That's the Do another way to make money is that you lend money between two parties.
24:05
So if you get access to money between one person and he's like, I'll give it you money at this rate.
And these people are like, I'll pay you money at this rate.
You hand the money to this person, you make the difference.
And you can do that at every level of business, whether it's a hundred dollars, whether it's a billion dollars, your arbitraging price, but now you're actually just arbitraging money.
24:26
Another way to make a million dollars is to promote stuff that other people sell.
So rather than you try and figure out how to like build a supply chain and build products and do all that stuff, you find stuff you like and then you promote their stuff and you just get money and it costs you nothing.
24:41
Right.
All did is cost you the time to build the audience, all right?
And so if you're like, well, I don't have an audience, it's like, well, I didn't say that it was free.
I said it wasn't costly money-wise, you can do that.
If you don't have money, if you have the audience, if you don't have the audience, get the skills.
Yes, that's the point.
The last one is arbitrage of a different kind, which is arbitraging between two things, and so think about it this way.
25:03
So I talked about the option thing, right?
That might seem like a little bit of Morpheus to some of you.
But think about this, imagine you look on walmart.com and see a product that selling for 10 bucks and you go on Amazon and it's selling for 14 bucks.
You can mark it and have the difference between those two prices and never touch anything, right?
25:23
You can do that as many times as you want to Million dollars and it cost you know risk right now.
Whenever you take on inventory, take on these other things, you incur more risk, but you have more upside, but the thing is that with scale, you can make anything big rights.
If you sell a million units of something, you tend to make money in general.
25:40
And so I want people thinking in orders of magnitude, in terms of like not just how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year.
But how do I make a million dollars on a single transaction if you're?
Like I don't know how to do that.
Then solve for that problem.
Like it's going to take you to sit and honestly you might even take you less time.
To learn what to do to make a million dollars than it does to learn what to do to make a hundred thousand dollars.
26:00
Like the time, it takes to learn the things the same, you just change the goal of what you're trying to learn.
And so what ends up happening is that people go up the entrepreneurial ladder and they give themselves permission to learn the next level.
When I'm giving you permission to learn the top level day one, you can just go for learning the skills at the top.
26:18
You don't have to learn how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year.
You can just go straight for learning how to make a million dollars on a single transaction and learn how to do that.
I'll tell you a quick story on this so buddy mine got into real estate.
Was flipping houses, didn't think there was a lot of money in it was like, oh, this sucks is so much work and there's all those tent, you know, fixings and all the stuff he didn't like it.
26:37
So he ended up buying a 14 unit apartment building with someone else's money, and he didn't have any bought the apartment building and then sold it for months later for 500,000 dollars, more and you made 500 Grand in one transaction.
He was like, holy shit and so, then he realized that the more sense of the building he sold, More money he made.
26:56
And so then he started getting into commercial real estate, which is even more expensive than residential on average.
And so he's like wait a second, I can buy something for 10 million and then I can flip it to somebody for 13 and not even hold on to it for that long in a few months.
27:12
And then all of a sudden he started flipping 30 or 40 of these a year with just Him and a couple of yeas and just like that, the man's making many, many millions a month.
And I say many, many have been many, many Very small team because you learned a skill that he could do at scale because he's not actually selling a ton of units, just each of the unit's, he sells is worth so much.
27:33
And so, he sends out 250 thousand letters, a year to make 40 deals.
People are like, oh, well, how can I find a deal like that knock on 250,000 fucking doors.
And that's how you find deals like that.
But people dramatically underestimate the amount of effort it takes to be really successful their logo, so no hundred letters out.
27:50
It's like a hundred not even a test sighs it's literally just in a relevant number the statistical like Efficiency of that number is so small, it's irrelevant doesn't even matter.








0:00
There's a nation.
Welcome back to part 2 of the big Rickman podcast where we get talked about getting big in business.
This part of the podcast of this half, the podcast is about having an exceptional customer experience and how to blend that in a way to sell more expensive stuff over time.
And this is from all the way back in, 2019 pre-acquisition, not comprehended.
0:19
Million-dollar offers pre-beard.
Mid stash.
And I think that you guys will enjoy it and hopefully enjoy it as much as we enjoyed putting on for you.
I mean, one of the things that I told the gyms, It's like when we all started, we looked around at whatever else is doing and said cool.
0:34
I'll charge that but the secret that no one knows, is that everyone else is broke.
So why the fuck would you copy them?
Welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
You know, yeah, I see that actually a lot in your, in your post.
0:53
And so again, obviously I was doing my deal with my due diligence on the onion research and you beforehand a lot of the stuff you've been putting out, I don't know whether or not it was just more.
It's more of a focus now, but it seems like when I was looking at stuff earlier on and looking at stuff now, the staff now is there is a huge focus on the fun and exciting and she's like part of right and side of the business and just about not taking yourself too seriously.
1:18
Is that something like it's just a part of you?
Or is that something you?
Tried to now move into to remind yourself?
Is it like a conscious thought?
I think what you're referencing is Instagram stuff because that's usually like the behind-the-scenes type stuff and that's that's not necessarily for me.
It's just like that's just how how we live but I think that like life can be stressful enough.
1:35
As is like we could all be stressed if we choose to be so it's know what Tommy be stressed about brothers are so if he's just about so it's like I got a funniest cat and he just ridiculous things and you know Layla makes funny faces and we just we try and try to keep it light.
Yeah, well somebody so I let me just quickly ask you then about your five.
1:54
If I don't know if is the pillars or what you call a bit, essentially the five steps of the customer Journey which is you talk about their the lead generation, the league nurture.
Oh yeah, we generally nurtures sales, fulfillment and then resell on a citation and depending on the size of the business, you could also include HR and finance but for most small business owners, they're not really that would, those are not like I mean in our business obviously we need to have those functions but because right now we have 120.
2:21
Five employees right now full time whereas a small business earns need to concern themselves with that.
So it's really like how we getting names, how we how we generating interested parties, the collecting data, right?
What are we putting out there to generate it from that point?
How do we get, how do we turn that Prospect into someone who's going to show up for a conversion conversation of some sort?
2:40
Which typically for a brick-and-mortar service business is going to be?
How do I get on the schedule?
How do I get him to show, right?
And then once they're there, what's the natural series of questions that's going to lead them to want to work with me?
Which is Is the sales component and then after that, it's like cool.
Once they make the sale what do I need to do to absolutely blow them away?
2:59
And this is kind of one of those nuances that like a little bit more.
Jim specific is most the time I teach a concept called climate Finance acquisition.
And so, the overarching picture that when you ask the very beginning, what is the one thing that has grown the business and how do we do it without going bankrupt?
All that stuff.
3:14
Client acquisition is how I grew my gyms.
It's how I grew, Jim lunch, it's how we did, all of them so fast, and it's essentially When I can put money into ads, right?
I prefer to sell something expensive on the front end when someone's the most excited about it.
Typically people will do low barrier offers on the front right to try and attract more people.
3:33
My opinion is I can when someone is excited, I can generate more revenue from that person, get more of a commitment cover, the costs of onboarding and giving an amazing experience.
And then when the cost of fulfillment drops because that person knows, the system knows, the work knows how to be a good client, then at that point.
3:50
Point I can decrease their continuity and so most people in my opinion have it backwards.
And so I got a decent amount of credit for saying down, sell the upsell.
I don't think I'm the one who invented it, but I doubt but but it works well because what happens is you're like hey do you want to have more of what you've just got for half price.
4:10
They're like, like everything I just got was amazing so I can get all of that for half.
Like yes.
You want to stay there?
Like, yeah, rather than And hey, I just gave you everything.
For nothing, what a now, pay for it and they're like, you know, maybe I'm not.
4:28
Is it was classy amount.
Yeah.
Right.
And so we flipped it and that's what has been able.
So what happens is, if let's say, I'll give you a number two examples.
So let's say you spend $100 a day on ads, right?
And day, one used to put $100 in.
Let's say, you get 10 leads, right?
4:44
For 10 bucks apiece.
And then from those 10 leads, you get 72 schedule.
Okay.
Okay?
And then from the 7th at schedule, you get for to show and from the for that show you get to to buy.
And so and you're getting them to buy at 600 bucks apiece.
So you made twelve hundred dollars from your hundred dollars.
5:01
Right?
And so what that would look like.
Is let's say day one.
You spend 100 day to spend 100.
Now let's say those people came in on day two, that you spent on day one and then you made the sale on day for you should be able to get the payments from.
You know, they would actually hit your bank account.
I'm talking real money in your bank account they would say.
5:18
Yeah, donate for which essentially means that It I'm now down 400 because they one day, two day three day four but then I get my twelve hundred dollar deposit right from those first two sales.
Yeah.
At that point is when the rest of the campaign is Cash flowed from sales that have happened.
5:33
You mean yeah?
Right.
It's a - acquisition cost and so now I'm making money getting new customers and so there's really no reason to stop until you have another bottleneck.
And so that's typically what happens with our guys has acquisition.
No longer becomes the limiting factor in your business.
Usually it becomes operations because most people have the skill.
5:50
Set to lead, don't have the skill set to manage their entrepreneurs.
They're not organized while bottle and so that becomes the next product.
So everyone thinks it solves all the problems when in reality just exposes the weakness of their operation.
Yeah.
And so then they're like oh my God, I have all these people coming in and no one's saying it's like right?
Your shit sucks.
That's why you didn't have people to begin with right now.
6:07
Everyone just knows so and then you know, I mean the younger for the process in place like yet, every child should have handwritten card, you have a while back, she don't be like there's all these things that everyone's like man our stuff so good if people if people just knew about it like Your stuff was so good.
People would already.
6:24
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're not that good.
And that's why you're struggling if we're being real.
Yeah, not that good.
You're just mediocre and that's what everyone else has.
Yeah I heard you talking about Jeff.
Bezos is quite the other way the other day and it was that one way he was talking about.
6:39
The customers are always going to be dissatisfied.
Yeah but it's true right here is outlines all the time.
I always ask them when the question I asked was like so tell me just what is your USP or what is your point of difference?
And everybody always says, My customer service and like not, everybody can have a point of difference.
For great customer service.
6:55
Your customer service is probably just the expected level of customer service.
It's not exceptional.
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
7:12
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, I want to I want to go back a little bit if I can just do to the acquisition though because I know a lot of people who are just listening to that would be like that's awesome.
Alex.
I totally understand.
7:27
Let's flip it.
Let's let's get them on the high value first and then we can deliver a rigid prosthetic.
Keep them on the program.
How is it then that you get people purchasing a high dollar value amount if they don't know anything about your business in the first place.
So you want to talk about GMOs.
That's fine.
We can relate.
7:43
That's the same to two sounds.
How do I get somebody to spend $600 straight off the bat?
When In mosul night has eyes that we like I can't get people to pay $40 straight off the bat.
Right?
One word is sales.
I'm just being like super real with you because I think the biggest thing that is underestimated and under underappreciated is making an amazing offer, right?
8:08
So I had a mentor early on and most people don't know who he is, but so TJ, Travis Jones was in the gym Guru space way, back when I don't know if he's doing anymore.
But, and I at this This point.
I had no Jim, I had no clients.
I had no nothing.
And I bought a three thousand dollar seminar on marketing you know as out of those there and so I was like what does that mean that they would feel stupid to say no to?
8:48
And For some reason because it was like, probably cuz it was so early on in my career, just like imprinted on me.
But it's something that I really, I really kept is like, if you have to be amazing salesman to make the business work, the business is broken.
And so, the way to make any person, be able to sell, is to give an offer.
9:04
That's amazing.
And then let the business model and the systems and processes back up, why?
It's so great, you know, me, then let the business do the work of keeping a person getting lifetime value, right?
And so I'm a big fan of ridiculous guarantees.
You know, to get people unbelievably happy with the experience that they're about to have with your guys's.
9:25
I mean I would be doing two-step stuff which is I'd be closing hundred-dollar appointments like 100 bucks, just to meet with this person because she's so amazing.
Like she's booked on the celebrities all day long, so position her.
And then I would go in and just having this soon closed for, like, 2 Grand for like extensions and whatever.
That's the angle.
9:40
I would take.
That's more sales oriented process the other way from an offer standpoint and this is where it gets a little more difficult for me to like dive in.
It's like you have to look at all the different Slowly services that exist and think like, what things could I offer for free that I could then upsell other portions?
That they really can't live with that.
9:57
So I'm still free here.
So an example would be, there's like a weight loss clinic that I know I'm not sharing names, because they're whatever.
But they run free, free weight loss, just free like free is a clinic.
And so what happened is they would come in and they're like, we'll continue, I mean it was like five dollars a week, something nothing.
10:15
Right?
And as long as you continue to buy Food from us or by Ours from us or whatever.
Then you're good to go.
And so when a module would be anyway.
Right.
So they gave the service away but then they monetize another aspect of it right?
And so it's like there's it's just like how creative can we go with the offerings so that people look like people have a cool offer that's going to generate a lot of traction but then how are we going to monetize it, right?
10:40
And so I think everyone thinks to two-dimensionally like their chiropractor it's like I just got to get free back crack's.
It's like.
Okay what else do you sell?
You don't get angry.
What else is this person who has a bad back coming in with, they probably haven't because they're overweight is probably because they, you know, I mean like it's just like this take a couple more thought processes and think.
10:57
How can we make an offer?
That's going to be.
I call him a splinter stack, but most people are like they want to compete on best value, which is the dumbest thing in the world is no one understands it, right?
It's like, we do this, and this, and this, and this, and it's all included, you know, or whatever.
Right.
But they don't say that right there.
11:14
Like, this is what we do, right?
But instead, you should peel off each of these things.
Things.
Right?
And then name them as like bonuses for this thing.
So like you can have like up crack your back.
And as a bonus you're going to get this and this and this, and this, and this, and then it seems like you're stacking shitloads of value.
11:29
When it was stuff you're going to do anyways, right?
Yeah, it's like to be creative.
You know in that in how we're making offers, you find the right offer, you're golden.
Lastly, on that point, one of my challenges, I'm trying to work through any way with my clients and certainly in the industry, as a whole and I think I've heard a lot of bit, you talking about the same thing.
11:48
The break is about breaking the limiting beliefs around this particular topic.
About like no that doesn't work in the industry.
And I know I'm just like even right now people would be when I, when I upload these people.
Listen to this and go.
No, that wouldn't work for our industry.
That's a gym thing.
And like I reckon it's probably most new owners would say right now.
12:05
It doesn't work with you Ministry that but you're coming along and disrupting the industry and go.
Well actually we just been doing it all wrong.
And I think that's kind of the message.
I want to do an errand, she as well, because traditionally like, people technicians right there, They're really good at hair or they're really good Beauty but they're not really good at marketing.
12:21
Not really good at sales and because of that, fear factor of learning that they don't do it.
And so what do they do?
They do the basic stuff that everybody else is just doing.
They just go, I'll just keep putting it off around there.
That's, you know, get a free facial for all, not free trade, put get a face, Brady, nine dollars, and hopefully it'll convert and then they say marketing doesn't work, but I really love what you're doing, because you're disrupting patterns and disrupting what people's beliefs are around marketing and offers.
12:44
I mean, if there's eyeballs, like marketing works period, you know, I Had a chiropractor here.
And he's like, yeah, I tried Facebook ads.
They don't work.
I was like, yeah, it's like, I tried marketing.
It doesn't work.
When, what you really, I tried to marketing, and even know that means.
You don't, I mean, I ran an ad once, right?
13:01
Yeah.
I mean, it was probably a boosted post of a picture of him that didn't have any kind of people weren't offered, just, whatever.
But I mean, if you're listening to this, I mean, you don't know who I am, but there's so much more than you're letting yourself do.
I mean, one of the things that I told the gyms is, like, when we all started we looked around and whatever else is doing.
13:18
Me and said, cool, I'll charge that.
But the secret, that no one knows, is that everyone else is broke.
So why the fuck would you copy them?
Right.
Just being real.
And so that's that's the that's the fundamental issue, right?
Is that most people are broke.
Most people not some most people.
13:35
And so you talk about the gyms that closed, 80% of them are still open.
In the person's head is just barely above water.
Yeah.
And they've been that way for six years, right?
And every day, they wonder why they're still going to work, right?
Something like by doing the same thing, they're going to get a different result tomorrow.
Right in hoping for a corner to come, that you're going to turn.
13:52
The never does, right?
I just had a client so I just had 10 more whatever, and the things that never comes right.
Yeah.
They don't change their actions and they don't change their beliefs.
Finally, let's wrap this up.
Three things.
Any business owner should be doing right now to help grow their business.
Just real summary.
14:08
Yeah three things.
Well I got more clients, increase your prices and get people to buy more times.
Those are the three things that someone should do.
Do you know?
But if people aren't doing that then I'm a big rule by metrics.
So like if you don't know what your attrition is, can't improve it.
14:25
If you don't know what your average ticket is, can improve, it.
Don't know what your lifetime value is, can improve it.
And so it's like you don't even know those things and what three things can I tell you to do, so do all that first and then once you at least have metrics, you can start moving Alex.
Thanks for joining.
I really really appreciate you time and I know you're super busy and Peter's taking time out with me this morning.
14:43
Well in the afternoon view there is a huge honor and I'm just so.
So going to, I know a lot of people Like you said, even though we spoke about Jim stuff, a lot of the information sets, today's brick-and-mortar, business small, business growth, Marketing sales, it's all the same stuff, right?
Yeah,








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
There are elements of shit that I do that.
I absolutely love but there is tons of shit that I do every day.
Say that I fucking hate.
I just don't hate it more than I hate the alternative.
Like there is no feeling I enjoy, that makes me more sick than the idea that I could have done more.
0:41
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
When I was 15 16 17, 18 years old, I was a pretty angry kid and I thought that I had all these issues.
1:05
I would tell people, I have these issues, I have anger issues.
I am not a nice person.
I would tell people those things about myself because I believe those things to be true and I saw them as problems and then I went to college and in college it's all, you know, propaganda of people who are teaching, who've never actually.
1:27
Unreal work in a real economy ever.
They're all tenured.
They don't live in reality and they tell everyone, they should pursue their purpose and their passion and the things that he loved and I ate it up.
And the problem was that I didn't make any progress.
1:42
And I felt like there was something even more wrong with me because I didn't feel any of that stuff.
And so I read all these books and pop psychology.
I watched all these TED talks and I never felt those feelings and so I wasted all this time.
I'm and I wish I could go back and tell myself dude.
2:01
All the stuff they're saying is just not true.
Like you don't need any of that.
Like you can embrace the fact that you are angry.
You can embrace the fact that you feel like you are in pain and you can use that to make the life that you want.
You don't have to use the lovey-dovey purpose, passion, whatever to build the life that you want to build because if you think about it big picture, what it does is it tells people that having a negative emotional experience as a bad thing.
2:27
Right.
But half of your life is below average by definition and so if you are not using the half of your life as energy or motivation to create the life you want, then you're at a huge disadvantage.
And to give you an example of this imagine, for example you have this big vision for your life that you want on this side.
2:46
And on this side your family gets kidnapped.
And if you don't do something they will kill them all which of those motivates you more.
Right now probably the one with your family.
Getting kidnapped.
Now why is that?
Because it's not trying to harness a lovey-dovey feeling it's harnessing pain and fortunately or unfortunately there's many people whose like I was who felt like I had experience more pain than I had good at that time of my life but I saw it as a disadvantage.
3:16
I saw it as something that I had to overcome that.
I didn't have this big purpose.
I didn't have this thing that I loved I didn't have this thing.
I was passionate about.
And if I could have just skipped all of that and started the moment I accepted that it was okay to be angry and what wasn't okay was not doing anything about it.
3:36
And so, while I procrastinate it by trying to find purpose, jumping from thing to thing to thing, trying to find the thing that really lit, my fire, right?
And just accepted that it was totally okay to work.
My face off in disgust from my current circumstance and who I was I would have gotten to where I wanted to go much faster.
3:58
And so the reason I wanted to make this is because so many people are believing a lie, they're believing that they have to be happy, they have to have purpose, they have to have passion for what they're doing in order to get out of their situation.
They think that they are poor because they don't have passion, that is false.
4:15
You were poor because you're not doing the activities that make you rich and you can fuel those activities whatever way you damn.
Well please period.
It.
And so if you are somebody who is more motivated by the dark side, then lean into the dark side because unlike the Star Wars movie, and unlike the saying the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
4:37
The equal opposite of that is the road to Heaven is is paved with bad intentions.
You can do good shit with bad motivation.
When I say bad, I mean negative experiences, pain, anger, Etc.
Right.
And so, they've already done research on this.
They interviewed the top Olympic medalists and they found that they Actually love winning.
4:56
They hate losing when they win.
They experienced relief.
Not Euphoria, they think to themselves.
Thank God, I didn't lose.
If you look at Steve Jobs, he wasn't some happy-go-lucky dude who was like, man, I just want to make the world a better place.
He was a tough dude to work for, from all accounts of everyone who is around him but he created Something Beautiful from that pain, right?
5:18
You look at MJ you look at Kobe.
What do they do?
They had imaginary situations that they created.
In their minds, to create more suffering in their own lives, to motivate them and use as fuel.
And so, if you are anything like me, what I have is I have Painful experiences in my past and made up experiences in the future that I don't want to go through and I use those on speed dial in my head, whenever I don't want to do something.
5:46
So if I don't want to make this because I don't want to go through the process of scripting.
I'm remembering the day or half day.
I got in front of the camera and was Prepared and did not do a good job and felt embarrassed and stupid for not doing the work.
And when I think about that, not how much I just want to like love on my audience and how much I want to provide value as much as I love and wish that that were my motivation.
6:10
That is not what fuels me.
What fuels me is, the feeling I had when I felt stupid in front of the camera because I didn't prepare, I didn't do the work.
And so I use that when I'm sitting in front of the computer and I know I should do it and I don't want to Do it.
I use that because that is more painful than the boring shit.
6:28
I'm about to have to do.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
6:49
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, all the leads.
And so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like 8, Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
7:07
I spent so long trying to get the right motivation, the right energy to do what I was supposed to do, rather than accept the energy that I had overflowing from me, which was pain and so if you have pain it's not a handicap.
7:23
It's an advantage.
If you choose to make it that way because you can take pain and turn it into something better over time.
And here's what's interesting is that I still have tons of motivation from that side.
But it waxes and wanes.
And so there are times that in sequence later, you do experience those moments where you get tied to that bigger purpose.
7:43
You do experience those moments where you actually love what you're doing.
Because the thing is this for me in the beginning, I sucked at everything.
And so I didn't like doing it because I wasn't good at it.
So why would I love doing?
Of course I suck.
Why are you going to enjoy that?
But the thing is, is you can use the - motivator that you have now to get through the periods of suck because the pain that you experienced sucked more than the suck that you have in front of you, the work that must be done.
8:08
And so, what happens is, you can use that - fuel hit it on speed, dial every time you're confronted with that thing that you don't want to do you push through it.
And what happens?
You do, that enough times, you start to get good at the thing and then you start to experience some Joy from your work, and then you start seeing the result of work that has compounded and start to see a purpose or start to see a bigger Vision.
8:31
The big vision for Alex's life until maybe four years ago was don't be broke.
That was the big vision for my life.
You're like what?
Was your mission with Jim?
What?
My mission was to stop being poor.
That was my mission.
And so now we're in a situation where we have acquired enough skills, we have gone through enough experiences that we can provide value and can help other people not go through that but it would be a lie and I'm telling you right now.
8:53
If someone tells you Alex is really motivated by purpose, Alex has this big you know, he loves what he does and I do there are elements of shit that I do that.
I absolutely love but there is tons of shit that I do every day that I fucking hate.
I just don't hate it more than I hate the Turn itive, which is a hate sucking.
9:10
I hate hate sucking macro.
Not at the thing is that I hate knowing that I could have tried harder.
Like there is no feeling I enjoy.
That makes me more sick than the idea that I could have done more.
So we have I'm writing my book right now, right?
9:26
I'm on the 11th, fucking draft.
All right, and I see people promote their books with their Ghost Riders and a big PR Company and then crushing on the New York Times, which is completely manufactured because they paid the right guy to get on the list even though the book that I made last year.
So two times more than half the fucking books on your times, I know that it pisses me off but you know what?
9:45
Pisses me off.
More the idea that the next book that I launched people say, you know what, I liked his first book a little better and so I keep reliving that experience that I make up in my mind because I don't want to write a seventh draft.
I don't want to write an 11th draft.
I'm like this should be good enough but the pain of the idea of that book not doing well or that book leading to people being like, I don't think you tried as hard.
10:07
That is the thing that hurts so much more than going from the top.
Yet again to make another video to make another article to make another short, to make another fucking chapter revision, yet again, to make it better.
So that when I do launched it, I think to myself, I literally exhausted.
10:23
Sit every option on this if I were to do more to it, I would be breaking it.
And that's where I try to get to and is the third time, I'm filming this and it's because the first two times was not good enough and I got really pissed off so you can see that I didn't want to do this again.
10:39
But one of the things that I live by is that I will not do my best.
I will do what is required and the difference between what your best is and what is required, is the difference between what you think you're real best is where your actual best is.
Is and there's a fucking Ocean between those things and what your actual best is that thing that you would do to prevent everyone you know from dying and maybe if that motivates you, maybe it's you not dying whatever the bigger motivator is for you, whatever that the discrepancy, what you're doing today and what you would be doing, whatever fuel you use, the point of this is that whatever fuel you need to use to go from what you're doing.
11:16
Now, do your actual best use it because the road to hell is not paved with good intentions.
What people care about is the outcome.
People care about what you put out in the world.
Now why you do it?
What fuels you is purely internal to you, that's your business.
11:33
And so I kept trying to get permission or I wanted support for the idea that I had to love everything.
The everything had to be sunshine and rainbows that I had to be all happy all the time.
If I wasn't happy all the time, the work was bad and I should just keep changing the work.
I'm doing super hot from thing to thing to thing.
11:48
Until I found something that I was really passionate about why sucked at everything so I wasn't passionate It wasn't good at any of it.
So, the thing that got me through, it was realizing that I hated my current circumstance.
And I hated the idea of my dad being right, and I hated the idea of people saying, I can't believe you quit his job to do some stupid thing and not win.
12:06
I needed that far more than having another person telling me that they were going to think about it.
And not give me the credit card.
I hated that a lot more than we could before him 100 nights in a fucking row to get up when I didn't want to.
But the idea of failing was so much more painful for me that I was able to embrace the suck faster. suck faster.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show frozen yogurt stores, make twenty one hundred dollars a day, selling 500 cups at 8 ounces each and it was the business that I almost started instead of starting my gym.
So I know a ton about it and I will tell you how it works and when what you can use from psychology that I learned from yogurt stores, that you can apply to your business today.
0:38
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and Buffett a document to their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
When I was 21 years old, I decided that I wanted to be an entrepreneur, and I was deciding between, which business I should start.
0:59
And after looking at the entire world of opportunities, the three businesses that I would securing starting was either a test prep business, because I done really well on my standardized tests, and I thought I could teach other people to do it in charge money for it Fitness because I was in shape, I like, Fitness people always talk to me about it and I thought, maybe I could make something there.
1:16
Open a gym and the third was frozen yogurt.
And so I did an extensive amount of research on How to open a frozen yogurt store and this was back in 2011 2012, right?
When, you know, frozen yogurt was just booming, it was this brand new thing, it made a big comeback and I wanted to ride that train.
1:35
So, a couple quick things that you may not know about Frozen your stores in general, they on average, between 750 and 800 thousand dollars a year, they run margins between 10 and 15 percent.
The average men cheese owner for context makes 93 thousand dollars a year.
Take home, not as sexy as I thought it was when I was Was trying to get into it.
1:53
I thought eight hundred thousand a year.
That means I make 800,000 year.
I'm Gonna Be Rich, right?
Doesn't really work that way.
And it's also a business that has variable costs that are high.
So the more more yogurt people by the more actual cost of goods that you have in order to fill on it right now.
2:09
The reason that I think frozen yogurt interesting is that they have a handful of psychological features for selling more product that I think anyone can use it.
So for context, 800 ish, thousand a year, the average store that we're talking.
About does 2191 a day in Revenue.
2:26
So 2,000 plus dollars a day, but what does that mean in take home?
What does that mean?
In owner pay means $328 a day in owner pay not as sexy, but still kind of cool but still not as sexy as you might think.
And so when you walk in, you're like man, these guys must be printing money.
2:41
Well, you've got strawberries that are going bad, you've got machines that are breaking in the back.
You've got hard cost of yogurt, you've got a retail lease.
That's nice.
Probably probably located with good signage.
Good Foot traffic.
Eric good track like actual traffic in front of it, ample parking.
Like there's lots of other things that go into this business and on top of that, if you wanted to buy into a franchise, most franchises have 6% ish of top line, that goes straight to them.
3:07
Now that may not sound like much, but if you're running ten percent margins that 60% of your take-home so they have figured out a way to take the majority of the prophet and their franchisees.
And what most people don't know is that franchises will structure their fees, such that they will get it.
So you make Just enough that you can keep going.
3:24
And maybe if you're a good operator, open another location but not so much that you're going to get rich on it.
So they're only looking to optimize to beat the return on capital of the stock market by a decent amount.
And so if the stock market gets you 10, they're going to try and get 20 to 25 and they're going to squeeze off the top and take the rest, because of how good their model is things.
3:45
You didn't know.
Now, the flip side of that is that if you are into a franchise, then ideally you should Should be saving enough on bulk purchasing because they're buying for 200-plus locations that they can save you on hard costs of things like yogurt, fruit, spoons, cups machines, Etc, right?
4:04
The converse of that though, is that many times when you starting a franchise, they will up, charge you on all of those things whose are trying to make money too.
So there's the theory and then there's the practicality.
Now, a fun thing that I did when I was looking at opening, my first yogurt store is I went on a site called Rasmus.com and what they do is there, it's a This foreclosure site.
4:24
And so I got my first gym equipment from that foreclosure site for 13 Grand.
All the gym equipment from a gym that went under.
Now, I looked I did a cursory search on there, and there were three frozen yogurt stores that were franchises.
That went under and the most expensive.
In terms of I could buy everything inside the store, the most expensive of the three was 20 grand.
4:44
So if you're trying to get into this world, you want to open a restaurant, you want, open a gym, whatever.
Go find foreclosure sites and if you're like, oh well, they don't there's no gym that's On there.
Just wait.
There will be right or just wait.
There will be over.
Start you just gotta wait and I sat there and I refresh every week until eventually one came up and I bought it.
5:02
All right?
And so if you can think like that, one of the things is a franchise, will let you do that, because that's where they make their money.
But there are ways to open these things for cheaper.
Now, the average cup size is 8 ounces that people will buy the average split between toppings and yogurt is 75, 25.
5:20
So, 25 percent of people's weight is top. 75 percentage ogre.
It's best for the store owner to have as much yogurt as possible in the cup, because the toppings are more expensive.
So, toppings cost between 10 and 40 cents per ounce, most places charge between 25 and 16 ounce.
5:36
And so they can even break, even or lose money, depending on which topics you're going to get the fruit, it's costing them money right, but they make up for it in the fact that yogurt cost him about eight cents per ounce and they charge 50 even 60.
Sometimes that's where the margin of the business exists, but I will tell you when you're working on Mars.
5:52
Ins that are even like 70 percent that means that you have 70% left to cover everything out.
So if you want to run a 50% margin business, for example, then you'd have to take 20% of your top line and pay every other Bill very hard to do.
So for that 2100 dollars a day.
Yes, that means that they're selling roughly, five hundred cups a day of yogurt on average with 8 ounce cup.
6:15
Now, you may have heard of some of these places Golden Spoon.
Yogurtland men, she's Pinkberry like the number of yogurt Doors are frozen, yogurts are endless.
And the reason for that is because there's demand for it, people want yogurt and they go for it.
If you search frozen yogurt store near, you probably have 30 locations that open up the thing is that most people and of all those brands, most of them are commoditized.
6:38
Meaning there's very little difference between a men cheese and a Yogurtland and a Golden Spoon.
There's just not a lot of difference.
And it's because in my opinion it's been a poorly competed Marketplace, solely done by franchisors who are trying to sell as many locations as they possibly We could rather than build a brand.
6:54
So if you were to compare the the yogurt world compared to the fast food, world of like chicken sandwiches, there is no Chick-fil-A of the yogurt world because if there were, they be dominating.
And I think the underlying lesson is that, if you look at any industry, there is the potential to have an amazing business inside of it.
7:12
Even if it is a commodity today, you can out-compete them.
All you have to do is walk into any Yogurt, Land and Sea, the floors are sticky.
The chairs are all over the place, the cops are a mess.
The toppings are in between all the the stuff sample cups are strewn on the side, right?
7:28
And one of the one of the nozzles is out it says, out of order, right everywhere and the girl behind the counter is on her iPhone.
When you walk in, doesn't say hello, right?
Like, it doesn't take a lot to win, right?
And most times just to beat everybody, you gotta people work better than the bottom 25% and you make money, right?
7:45
So it's not hard to win there.
Now, one of my favorite things that I learned from these yogurt places, one of the big breakthroughs that I think they had was, Is actually how they priced.
All right, so hear me out.
They if you recall like the ice cream world, the desert world is usually sold by cup.
8:00
You get a small, you get a medium and get a large.
You gotta kind of want to have it, got to want to have it, got a love to have it, right?
They all have their different little sayings for it.
You guys small, medium, large, whatever, they flip that, it made it.
Wait, the reason psychologically, this is so important is that the consumer gets to pick how much they spend.
8:19
And so what happens is in a normal setting, someone might fill Cup, get to the counter and see seven dollars and be like, I'm such a fat-ass rather than when you buy one off the shelf and then you see the seven dollars, you're like, wow, this place is so expensive because there's an element of control on the consumer side.
8:37
They are the ones who bear some of the accountability responsibility for that fact.
Now, the second thing that they did that, I thought was brilliant if you guys noticed this, but they used to have small normal sized cups, your glands and this is what I'm guessing happened because this is probably how these types of Innovations.
8:52
Occur somewhat, I will bet you a few years ago, ran out of small cups and then people only had the medium and large cups left, and they realized that at the end of the day, their sales probably went up by 20 or 30 percent and they wondered.
I wonder why our sales went up is because when you give people a bigger cup, they will feel more of it because it is the projection of the expectation that they have, they're like, oh I guess this is standard and so it shows you the default the power of the default option when selling anything.
9:21
And that's why I assumed Uses and things like that are so powerful.
When you say, hey, do you want this or this if you say and you can even listen for this at fast food places, like hey, do you want a medium or a large Coke?
They have a small option.
They want you to pick between the large ones Yogurtland and those ones went a step further, just remove the small option because it is self-served, but if you got a small amount of yogurt in a bucket size cup, it just looks weird.
9:44
You have to like, get your hand inside of it just to just to scoop the darn thing out, but they did that.
And by extension, we're able to raise the amount of yogurt that Apple bought probably by a large percentage every single time, and not take the blame for it because they're the one with the hand on the nozzle.
Now, you'll also know that the order in which they present the items are reverse order of the cost to them.
10:06
So they start you with the cheapest option.
This is exactly how buffets work to they want.
You to fill up on the salad, and then they put the seafood all the way at the end because they want people to fill their plates before they get the most expensive item.
They'll attract you with the expensive thing, but they'll put it at the end of your self service line.
So you have the yogurt, which is the highest Arjun first and then you'll have your dry items that don't go bad waffle, you know, crumbled Oreos, things like that, whatever.
10:29
And then you have the fresh fruit that goes bad, that cost more money by ounce and so they get people to fill up their cup in the beginning, with the highest margin.
Then they sprinkle in a little bit of slightly lower margin and then when you have almost no room left, then you put your few fruit on top because if you just fill the whole thing up with bananas, they be breaking even right.
10:47
Actually been in as a cheap fruit but you get the idea if they filled it up.
Well, like if you get one of these little guy, A pound of strawberries.
It's like if you get retail it's like 10 bucks.
Like who, you put that pound on the machine Oz, their cost you 60 cents, 16 oz?
Like they'd be pretty much breaking even on that.
11:05
Right.
So think through it like that.
Hey, Moe is an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
11:22
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Now if you really want to have a fun fun experiment, take one of the Hershey syrup things and just put it on, put it on the on the scale and you can see what they're making from just selling that bottle so you can actually see the retail price.
11:41
Now you can buy pounds of Hershey's for like 10 bucks like one of these huge gallon things and so that ends up being almost the same price as yogurt.
But it's a fun mental exercise corporate noted that the number one way that they are able to get more customers and the highest-performing stores did, so with better service.
11:58
Cleaner stores, more selection, and the most important, one word of mouth because when you have an average ticket, that's so low like yogurt cups, right?
You have margin, even on that tiny little cup.
The only profitable way to really acquire customers is either word of mouth or Affiliates, meaning other businesses that send you business.
12:17
And so they double down on that.
Now when they started years ago, Google search was cheap enough that they could actually drive pay-per-click campaigns to get people to there.
Occasions.
But nowadays it's too expensive for most of them so they almost all have to rely on the quality of the product and the experience.
12:35
And so the store that I wanted to open the way that I was going to open.
My store, was that I wanted to create a better experience for somebody walked in.
So I wanted to have floor-to-ceiling, kind of candy, see through experiences and when someone walked in, they were overwhelmed with these appearance of selection, right?
12:54
And they would just turn the nozzle on there, which by the way, I would have it.
So that would be really close.
D.
So it too much would fall through.
So I get a little bit more weight on it.
It's been real cap was, hey, did you get too many Oreos?
I'm sorry.
And I always felt like the that you should have more selection, because the more selection you give people this has been proven with buffets people eat more of the more options you give them.
13:14
So, I would want to have one entire side.
That would be yogurt, nozzles with more options because people have more desire to do more selection.
They want to try a little bit of everything, right?
And then on this side, I have the floor to ceiling things, right?
And at Variant and I might even consider removing fruit, I would probably look at it, but then, my promotional effort, my plan was to go to the university.
13:38
So I wanted to be close to colleges and then I was going to partner with all of the fraternities and sororities and have competitions between them to see who could get the most yogurt.
And then give some sort of Swag or something for the fraternity, or whatever, that got the most yogurt during that period of time.
13:53
And I could do that I could rinse and repeat that process with companies.
I could rinse repeat that process basically with Ins and that is the cheapest form of advertising.
When you don't have a lot of money, is going to find places where there's buckets of people that you can give them some sort of promotion at bring them in.
Right?
And so if I could do a strong incentive to get people to join my list, like a text list, I could send out coupons on a relatively regular basis and acquire them for next to nothing and so I'd run the competition's to bring them in.
14:17
I'd have a crazy incentive to get the text, the text number because normally, they ask we have now is, would you like to join our text list to which almost all of us are like, nah, I'm good.
Because you don't feel like getting coupons.
But if you knew that your first order was half off like hey you want to save 50% today by joining our text list then you could probably join them at now.
14:37
Some people the the smaller short-term businessman, really going to give half my profit up.
Well to me I just acquired a lead that I can get lifetime value on for two dollars.
I'll take it because I know that I'm going to be able to get them back right or get them to bring a friend and I want to be able to remind them of my store on a regular basis.
14:58
So, if you're looking at stuff that you can model from the yogurt businesses and also not do that, they're doing poorly.
Here's my list for you.
Number one, when you have the option to give a customer, the ability to pick their own pricing by usage, do it?
Because often times people will blame themselves, not you when they / user / spend.
15:17
Think about minutes back in the day or text messages, right?
Like the over you if you have the power to use more, especially if it's something people like they will do more of it.
But they will associate part of that.
Responsibly with themselves rather than you.
Number two, you want to direct the prospects attention in order of your margin.
15:35
So you want the most people to see the thing that makes you the most money first.
Not the thing that cost you the most money first because that's where they're most likely to purchase and then purchase the most of it.
So we want to use up as much of their spending wallet or spending power on the things that make us the most profit.
15:51
Number three selection can bite you in the butt, but in a buffet or consumption setting more selection as long as they're not.
Inflicting.
But if you have twenty six jars of jam, they can only pick one.
It's conflicting.
But if you can have a little bit of all of them, like a buffet, they eat more.
16:08
And so that's why the nuances like psychology is so important.
But if you have a type of product or service where someone can sample multiple things, the more things you offer them, the more things like a buffet, they will ultimately buy and consume.
Number four, if you are starting a business unless it's something brand new and completely radical there's likely somebody who started a business just like yours who failed.
16:29
And you can often times by all their stuff for 10 cents or 5 cents on the dollar and dramatically, decrease your startup costs.
If you're newer and you're like, I only have 20 grand saved up, you can start a business for that amount of money, right?
And you can get a decent amount of actual equipment for that amount of money when you go to the right seller and that is a motivated.
16:50
Or somebody who's lost all their money because they did a business because they weren't watching the right YouTube videos because not part of my Z Nation, right.
And you can buy it from them at a huge discount and then you can start your next thing.
It's a great way.
I always looked at that when I was like, I'll bet you there's long care things, there's whatever type of business you want going for business?
17:06
Liquidation sales is a great way to buy those equipment back.
Number five, the power of the default option.
So the fact that they went from removing the tiny cups to only giving large and bucket sized cups for yogurt and encourage people to use more yogurt themselves and they do that because it looks silly in comparison.
17:26
And so whenever there's a possibility that you can set the default where someone would be encouraged by implication to use more just like the fast-food upgrade of, like, do you want medium, or I'm assuming you want to meet him or I am assuming you want a 32 ounce, when you give the default option, many people just like organ donors, which by the way, it went from, I think it was like 10 or 15 percent of people opting in to be.
17:50
An organ donor to getting 80% of people to become organ donors by simply saying, you not want to be an organ donor versus.
Do you want to be an organ donor.
So if you have the potential to get 7 times more people to say yes to something just imply that that's what everyone else is doing and you can do that through as default options which is one of the most powerful psychological selling Tools in existence and no one even knows it's happening to them most of the time but you will probably nation and you pay attention stuff.
18:15
When you're trying to promote something that costs very little money.
So, this is very common in consumer businesses, especially consumer products, cpg, Etc.
Most strategies, it's very difficult to acquire customers with paid advertising profitably.
That's why a lot of these places raise funding etc, etc.
And they have to bank on lifetime value to pay back their cost of acquisition.
18:34
If you don't have tons of cash and you're not funded, then the two most profitable strategies for acquiring customers Beyond, just creating content, creating a brand, which still is very difficult on a local level is is to get Word of Mouth, which is referrals.
It's good.
Old-fashioned organic people like your yogurt and tell other people about it, right?
18:51
And you have a strong referral system in place and this is key.
It's not just having a very good product which is important but reminding and encouraging people to share it.
So I'll give you a quick contacts on this my podcast.
Same podcast.
I just decided to say, hey guys, if you could leave a review and share this with somebody, that would be great.
19:10
As soon as we did that we 20 x.
The number of reviews that we were getting And our growth skyrocketed just because I asked.
And so, Step One is having a good product step to ask people to share about it because people just don't think about you because I think about a hundred other things.
19:26
But if you remind them, at least they're more likely to do it.
By the way, click, subscribe and notification ballot, and all those things and share this on the story tag me.
Okay, cool.
Back to the thick.
The second way is through Affiliates, which means other businesses that have your other businesses or groups that have your desired audience, the difference between referral is one Customer tells another customer.
19:46
This isn't their main game.
An affiliate is somebody who has a bucket of people who are just like your ideal customer.
That's where if I was yogurt store, I would go for the fraternity or sorority or the business groups or the the Chamber of Commerce for the local town.
I would go find those groups and it sounds silly.
20:02
But if you give those people a strong incentive and you say, hey just so, you know, at your clothing store, anybody goes through clothing store, I'll give her free yogurt.
All of a sudden like you just enhance the value what they're selling and then you just get to clink your cart to every other person's horse.
20:19
And you let 100 businesses carry you as they flood you with all their customers.
Just give them something good enough that people actually want to consume it.
That's the key.
That's how all affiliate marketing works.
Is you just have to make a good enough that it benefits the customer A and B that the Affiliates actual thing becomes more valuable with the addition of your thing, too.
20:39
And you can take, I said, yogurt with Clothing store.
But like you can think about that for anything.
If I was doing dry cleaning, then it would make sense that I go to all the luxury store and say, hey, all your people need dry cleaning Tom.
They get the first 2, or Whatever item they get here is on me for the first two.
Well, shit.
If we can just know that they just made a purchase, they're going to have this need.
20:56
They probably have other items that are just like that they'll probably start shipping stuff too.
And so the big thing is that if you don't have a lot of LTV on your customers and you just require a lot of them, then you have to go with the more viral more grassroot ways.
But what you do is you systematized that within your Business.
So that the system itself is what becomes duplicatable.
21:14
And, as a bonus point, I will tell you my favorite frozen yogurt store because I've been to all of them.
My favorite frozen yogurt chain is Orange Leaf.
I believe that they have the best flavors and my opinion.
I think the founder of that franchise, whatever it is actually loves dessert because you can tell by the attention to detail by the cookies that they bring in their always fire.
21:33
They're so good.
The flavors themselves are decadent.
They don't have all these weird fruit things like it's just like, caramel chocolate.
It peanut butter, you know, I mean the good stuff and that is my personal favourite of all the different over stores.
And if you haven't been doing orange lie, if you check it out, the very good.
21:49
I was not paid to say that.
They are very good though.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's going on?
I've told you a little bit more Pie in the Sky stuff the last few days and I am excited to bring you some very actual nuggets that you can use immediately in your next sales, how stations.
0:46
And obviously like we saw lots of really expensive stuff and so naturally we have to be over be able to overcome price objections which is simply saying like I don't believe it, but you f is sufficiently diet.
I already told my sales guys to watch this video so I'm trying to make extra good.
1:07
Yeah, Chris cornet was that dude.
So there's four kind of parts to so we have a lot of price overcomes that we do in, you know, are suspended for those who are, you know, in our stuff.
And one of the interesting things is that so we have probably 10 15 overcomes for every objection, you know, like I need to think about it.
1:25
I'm not the decision maker or money right.
There are the three main obstacles.
I come up at all times every Other obstacles.
Not really an obstacle because you can get over it.
Like nothing times.
Are not sure about the workouts all about, you can get over all that stuff.
The only things that are the main three option.
Roosevelt.
Same three options that have since the dawn of time of selling stuff, right?
1:44
And so it's a delay, not the decision, maker for money.
And so today, this tune is one of the overcomes that we use for price.
Now did can be tells a story about how he was talking with the best vacuum sales reps in like a 1901.
2:01
It's operation like 1950 or something like that and they had to pass like a test and you had to memorize a 356 Optical overcomes and he was like, can you tell him Daniels like You know how many I actually use is like through.
2:18
And so, what ends up happening is that you're going to start finding like we have 10 15 over comes in each of our trainings.
But like, there's going to be a couple of them, just feel like, it feels like, the way you describe something, where it resonates with you, and then that's the one you should pick, right?
And that's what you should use.
2:35
So, what I'm going to share with you today, on this price, one is one that for those of, you know, by my first gym when I was like fighting the good fight, Solo solo premiering it.
This is sort of actually one that I discovered just in the trenches.
I didn't pick this up from anyone and so kind of has four pieces to it and it's probably the one that I use the most when it comes to price, right?
2:58
And so you know, this is when right after you do you explain that but you sold sold them on the vacation.
They're totally bought in your like listening to cost your first kid, right?
And then they're like, holy crap.
They're like, that's expensive.
And so, a lot of people says, people are soon.
As someone says that's expensive, they immediately go to the defensive. 100 discount prices, that's silly because you should agree with them and says the first step if you agree or absolutely.
3:20
It's totally expensive.
And that's why you guys ever seen my videos and like we are 100% by far the most since in the marketplace, like we are the most expensive and then you always hear me say this word afterwards, I'm like we're also the best, right?
And so the second piece is first, you agree with them, totally agree with that.
3:35
We are definitely the.
I mean, hopefully were the most expensive.
You don't like, almost, like, taking on, like, you proud of them, right?
Like, who are the most expensive, because we're definitely the best.
Right?
And then they're like huh wow I didn't actually get him off off-kilter right and so he's number two is so agree and then you're like, so I mean the reason we're at, you know, the most expensive is because we had a decision, right?
3:58
We could have either been, you know, who she competed in the world of the cheapest, right?
Or we can be the best and get people with the absolutely.
And from what it sounds like, you've already tried the cheaper up and it brought you into them, right?
And then you get agreement, they're like yeah, right.
4:13
And so Right after that.
Awful disability like so do you know what it's like when you're basically backtracking to the vacation reminding them in restating the value.
You know?
They say we honestly I mean if this program does what I say, right?
This is why you got to deliver hard, right?
4:28
So, you can sell part, it's just like.
So if this does die say that, right?
It truly gets you free of any of these food issues that you can suffer from the last 10 years, right?
Gives you one, last example, and here's one that you guys can use generational Health, right?
People talk about generational, wealth about generational Health.
4:44
Don't you want to have by?
I don't really affect your family.
It's like what if your kids kids were impacted, by the way that you live your life today, like Jack, the lanes, family, two generations later, they're all into fitness and health, right?
It's generational people talk about that because no one knows how to get and I'm going to show you how this works, okay?
5:00
So like I said, if this does what I say this and like the weight on this field, you own them right?
And never goes anywhere because you know, exactly to you.
And you can have cake and we've been in bikini we're going to show you how to get that, right?
And guess what it's not going to take you know for days.
So we're 21 day detox, right?
5:17
We're going to show you how to do this, to did that weight on the scale is what it is forever, right?
And you can actually get rid of that second.
Half the closet your shame to have but you're still wear right?
Because you're like I don't know if I'm going to go back to that you can get rid of it and that little black dress or whatever it is like, whatever that pieces, you know that pieces.
They laugh, right?
5:33
You're like whatever that is like you can own if you can step into a new life.
Yeah this is mine.
I'm going to show you how to do that and not feel like you're starving yourself to death so you can live with this.
That cool.
Yeah.
Okay, so if this did what I say does, wouldn't you eat not even believe me if it were cheap, right?
5:52
Like, I just told you this program for good, if I just sit on this stuff and I said, yes, 300 bucks.
Would you believe me?
Of course not.
So.
I think really what it comes down to, is the main question which is do you want to keep running in circles using the cheap route, or do you want to solve this problem for hit?
6:13
The guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And like notes, let's hit it.
6:35
No one's going to say no, you don't have been like, no, I want to keep doing the cheap browser.
So you like and that's the beauty.
That's why you have to establish the gap which is one of the videos I made two days ago, is because the reason came in today is because you don't have what you need.
You don't have what you need because if you did, you would not have walked in, right?
6:52
If you like one might think about I'm like, girl, what do you like?
Are you going home to?
There's nothing there right?
Fitness.
What are you gonna do, right.
There's nothing else besides us right now because like you have Bolton Village that they walked in be admitted.
I have a problem.
We can solve right itself just to restate.
7:10
Someone says, oh my gosh.
That's expensive.
You like absolutely?
It's definitely expensive.
Hopefully, when the most expensive fish were definitely right.
Pause.
But it's, they're getting like, I mean honestly, the reason we did it, that way speed of decision, we could be the cheapest or we can people with a actually needed.
7:26
And in order to do that when you give you more attention to you, more kind of building.
We need to give you more closely like all the things that like everyone else.
Halves Quarters on is the reason that no one beats the results that they're looking for, they get sold on them but they don't actually get that, which is why you're here, right?
And so, like I said, and you recap it if this does what I say, it does.
7:44
If I can get you free of this but you can struggle with the last 10 years.
You charge me.
Look at you the way you want it to write.
Did you know that?
Bikini Etc.
It's your kids healthy forever.
Generational Health wouldn't be worth three.
Great, right?
Wouldn't you not believe me if it weren't through Grant?
8:02
Right?
Okay, so main question is, if you wanna keep running the cheap cycle, or you want to fix this for good, that I can guarantee you, if you add up all of the next 10 years, worth of cheap, things are going to do, it's going to cost 10 times more than this and all the emotional trouble and time.
You're going to put into it, that will solve this for good awesome.
8:21
What you want to use and then you close it out.
So hopefully that makes sense to you.
If you are new to this group, by the way, we are by far.
The most expensive.
I'm going to increase our Again soon.
And so the main question is if this does not say it does, Jim Owens does what I say it.
8:39
As if it's going to help you bring two hundred thousand dollars Revenue in the first year, which is what it, what happens to virtually, all the things that do it is it worth what I'm charged with for it if it did that and I was summoned for a grand.
Wouldn't you be a little suspect, right portion?
8:55
Would his it wouldn't actually do that because of course, I wouldn't do that.
So if you're like, man, this costs a lot I'm afraid to take that jump.
It's like Okay.
Well then how else do you think of the fulfilling that promise that I mean, Right.
We have a 40-person company like this is not a good business anymore like with a 40-person company like dedicated you one thing which is fiction for money.
9:15
So anyways, I say that too.
I saw something on the here the other day.
Someone was a I was afraid to make the jump.
The thing is, is like you're supposed to be afraid.
That's okay.
That makes you feel normal.
Like if you're not afraid, you're just a psychopath and that's also another good.
One you can use in the sale which is like, someone's like, man, this is a lot of money.
9:32
I'm like, if you weren't afraid to spend the money right now, I'll flip you out the door.
Of course, you're supposed to be afraid, but that makes you just like everybody else.
Like no one has like virtually.
No gyms have the money to pay us.
And the reason that they don't have the money to pay us is because they don't have the systems that we have to give.
Right?
9:49
And that's how it works.
And then I mean I guess the main question is I got this on my own golden.
These are not like this one a lot too.
He said he said, hey, make him talk to you.
Like you're like you're my little brother and this is one of his price.
Overcomes is like Sherman is a so how long do you want to not have you want not having ten thousand dollars to put forward on some of them to be on that list of problems that you have in life?
10:17
Life.
I use.
I actually freaking you to like, so you'd like our program thing that just so you know, our program one finger but How long do you want not having 10 grand or thousand dollars today to be among the things that you struggle with them?
So that's a be to be overcome, not on there, an emotion, so acceptance.
10:38
If you have a business to business service but it's just like a real question.
So if you're someone who's like man, I mean I can barely put 1,000 tons of well then like what do you think is going to change unless you change them?
And how long you want that to be one of the problems that you have three ways?
Lots of everyone.
Hopefully, this is useful for you for overcoming price.
10:57
One of the stories that I had from mccallion.
Have any more speakers than I'm just dropping a whole bunch of stuff today.
That's okay.
Is that?
So she was selling on six pack shortcuts, you guys, saw that, like my king all those six pack shortcuts, dudes, he was their top sales rep, the 875 sales reps on the floor, they need about a million a month in phone sales, just in like high volume Turn and Burn transactional sales.
11:19
And one of the things that they have in floors, they give you didn't get a gas when you set the price, you didn't go home because they would anger is so high on that first presentation that they get down, saw them and whatever they wanted to And but it's like they didn't get a gas bill of shit.
11:35
I coulda gone.
I put it on right now.
I'm not saying you should think that way because they did very transactional sales not a relational sales, business is very much.
You know, when bam you know get the credit card and close a Turn and Burn.
That's not how I suggest you and your gym but There's something some truth to it.
11:52
Right?
Is that starting with that high ticket starting up top justjust, don't be afraid of the gas.
Just embracing me like, yeah, because we're the best, if it does.
What I say that is when you be suspect, if it works Prime squared is always positive guys.
Have an amazing day tax and president for me, some likes, can appreciate it.
12:12
I'll smell you get a little notification to have an amazing Thursday.
I'll put you guys on the flip side.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show frozen yogurt stores, make twenty one hundred dollars a day, selling 500 cups at 8 ounces each and it was the business that I almost started instead of starting my gym.
So I know a ton about it and I will tell you how it works and when what you can use from psychology that I learned from yogurt stores, that you can apply to your business today.
0:38
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and Buffett a document to their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
When I was 21 years old, I decided that I wanted to be an entrepreneur, and I was deciding between, which business I should start.
0:59
And after looking at the entire world of opportunities, the three businesses that I would securing starting was either a test prep business, because I done really well on my standardized tests, and I thought I could teach other people to do it in charge money for it Fitness because I was in shape, I like, Fitness people always talk to me about it and I thought, maybe I could make something there.
1:16
Open a gym and the third was frozen yogurt.
And so I did an extensive amount of research on How to open a frozen yogurt store and this was back in 2011 2012, right?
When, you know, frozen yogurt was just booming, it was this brand new thing, it made a big comeback and I wanted to ride that train.
1:35
So, a couple quick things that you may not know about Frozen your stores in general, they on average, between 750 and 800 thousand dollars a year, they run margins between 10 and 15 percent.
The average men cheese owner for context makes 93 thousand dollars a year.
Take home, not as sexy as I thought it was when I was Was trying to get into it.
1:53
I thought eight hundred thousand a year.
That means I make 800,000 year.
I'm Gonna Be Rich, right?
Doesn't really work that way.
And it's also a business that has variable costs that are high.
So the more more yogurt people by the more actual cost of goods that you have in order to fill on it right now.
2:09
The reason that I think frozen yogurt interesting is that they have a handful of psychological features for selling more product that I think anyone can use it.
So for context, 800 ish, thousand a year, the average store that we're talking.
About does 2191 a day in Revenue.
2:26
So 2,000 plus dollars a day, but what does that mean in take home?
What does that mean?
In owner pay means $328 a day in owner pay not as sexy, but still kind of cool but still not as sexy as you might think.
And so when you walk in, you're like man, these guys must be printing money.
2:41
Well, you've got strawberries that are going bad, you've got machines that are breaking in the back.
You've got hard cost of yogurt, you've got a retail lease.
That's nice.
Probably probably located with good signage.
Good Foot traffic.
Eric good track like actual traffic in front of it, ample parking.
Like there's lots of other things that go into this business and on top of that, if you wanted to buy into a franchise, most franchises have 6% ish of top line, that goes straight to them.
3:07
Now that may not sound like much, but if you're running ten percent margins that 60% of your take-home so they have figured out a way to take the majority of the prophet and their franchisees.
And what most people don't know is that franchises will structure their fees, such that they will get it.
So you make Just enough that you can keep going.
3:24
And maybe if you're a good operator, open another location but not so much that you're going to get rich on it.
So they're only looking to optimize to beat the return on capital of the stock market by a decent amount.
And so if the stock market gets you 10, they're going to try and get 20 to 25 and they're going to squeeze off the top and take the rest, because of how good their model is things.
3:45
You didn't know.
Now, the flip side of that is that if you are into a franchise, then ideally you should Should be saving enough on bulk purchasing because they're buying for 200-plus locations that they can save you on hard costs of things like yogurt, fruit, spoons, cups machines, Etc, right?
4:04
The converse of that though, is that many times when you starting a franchise, they will up, charge you on all of those things whose are trying to make money too.
So there's the theory and then there's the practicality.
Now, a fun thing that I did when I was looking at opening, my first yogurt store is I went on a site called Rasmus.com and what they do is there, it's a This foreclosure site.
4:24
And so I got my first gym equipment from that foreclosure site for 13 Grand.
All the gym equipment from a gym that went under.
Now, I looked I did a cursory search on there, and there were three frozen yogurt stores that were franchises.
That went under and the most expensive.
In terms of I could buy everything inside the store, the most expensive of the three was 20 grand.
4:44
So if you're trying to get into this world, you want to open a restaurant, you want, open a gym, whatever.
Go find foreclosure sites and if you're like, oh well, they don't there's no gym that's On there.
Just wait.
There will be right or just wait.
There will be over.
Start you just gotta wait and I sat there and I refresh every week until eventually one came up and I bought it.
5:02
All right?
And so if you can think like that, one of the things is a franchise, will let you do that, because that's where they make their money.
But there are ways to open these things for cheaper.
Now, the average cup size is 8 ounces that people will buy the average split between toppings and yogurt is 75, 25.
5:20
So, 25 percent of people's weight is top. 75 percentage ogre.
It's best for the store owner to have as much yogurt as possible in the cup, because the toppings are more expensive.
So, toppings cost between 10 and 40 cents per ounce, most places charge between 25 and 16 ounce.
5:36
And so they can even break, even or lose money, depending on which topics you're going to get the fruit, it's costing them money right, but they make up for it in the fact that yogurt cost him about eight cents per ounce and they charge 50 even 60.
Sometimes that's where the margin of the business exists, but I will tell you when you're working on Mars.
5:52
Ins that are even like 70 percent that means that you have 70% left to cover everything out.
So if you want to run a 50% margin business, for example, then you'd have to take 20% of your top line and pay every other Bill very hard to do.
So for that 2100 dollars a day.
Yes, that means that they're selling roughly, five hundred cups a day of yogurt on average with 8 ounce cup.
6:15
Now, you may have heard of some of these places Golden Spoon.
Yogurtland men, she's Pinkberry like the number of yogurt Doors are frozen, yogurts are endless.
And the reason for that is because there's demand for it, people want yogurt and they go for it.
If you search frozen yogurt store near, you probably have 30 locations that open up the thing is that most people and of all those brands, most of them are commoditized.
6:38
Meaning there's very little difference between a men cheese and a Yogurtland and a Golden Spoon.
There's just not a lot of difference.
And it's because in my opinion it's been a poorly competed Marketplace, solely done by franchisors who are trying to sell as many locations as they possibly We could rather than build a brand.
6:54
So if you were to compare the the yogurt world compared to the fast food, world of like chicken sandwiches, there is no Chick-fil-A of the yogurt world because if there were, they be dominating.
And I think the underlying lesson is that, if you look at any industry, there is the potential to have an amazing business inside of it.
7:12
Even if it is a commodity today, you can out-compete them.
All you have to do is walk into any Yogurt, Land and Sea, the floors are sticky.
The chairs are all over the place, the cops are a mess.
The toppings are in between all the the stuff sample cups are strewn on the side, right?
7:28
And one of the one of the nozzles is out it says, out of order, right everywhere and the girl behind the counter is on her iPhone.
When you walk in, doesn't say hello, right?
Like, it doesn't take a lot to win, right?
And most times just to beat everybody, you gotta people work better than the bottom 25% and you make money, right?
7:45
So it's not hard to win there.
Now, one of my favorite things that I learned from these yogurt places, one of the big breakthroughs that I think they had was, Is actually how they priced.
All right, so hear me out.
They if you recall like the ice cream world, the desert world is usually sold by cup.
8:00
You get a small, you get a medium and get a large.
You gotta kind of want to have it, got to want to have it, got a love to have it, right?
They all have their different little sayings for it.
You guys small, medium, large, whatever, they flip that, it made it.
Wait, the reason psychologically, this is so important is that the consumer gets to pick how much they spend.
8:19
And so what happens is in a normal setting, someone might fill Cup, get to the counter and see seven dollars and be like, I'm such a fat-ass rather than when you buy one off the shelf and then you see the seven dollars, you're like, wow, this place is so expensive because there's an element of control on the consumer side.
8:37
They are the ones who bear some of the accountability responsibility for that fact.
Now, the second thing that they did that, I thought was brilliant if you guys noticed this, but they used to have small normal sized cups, your glands and this is what I'm guessing happened because this is probably how these types of Innovations.
8:52
Occur somewhat, I will bet you a few years ago, ran out of small cups and then people only had the medium and large cups left, and they realized that at the end of the day, their sales probably went up by 20 or 30 percent and they wondered.
I wonder why our sales went up is because when you give people a bigger cup, they will feel more of it because it is the projection of the expectation that they have, they're like, oh I guess this is standard and so it shows you the default the power of the default option when selling anything.
9:21
And that's why I assumed Uses and things like that are so powerful.
When you say, hey, do you want this or this if you say and you can even listen for this at fast food places, like hey, do you want a medium or a large Coke?
They have a small option.
They want you to pick between the large ones Yogurtland and those ones went a step further, just remove the small option because it is self-served, but if you got a small amount of yogurt in a bucket size cup, it just looks weird.
9:44
You have to like, get your hand inside of it just to just to scoop the darn thing out, but they did that.
And by extension, we're able to raise the amount of yogurt that Apple bought probably by a large percentage every single time, and not take the blame for it because they're the one with the hand on the nozzle.
Now, you'll also know that the order in which they present the items are reverse order of the cost to them.
10:06
So they start you with the cheapest option.
This is exactly how buffets work to they want.
You to fill up on the salad, and then they put the seafood all the way at the end because they want people to fill their plates before they get the most expensive item.
They'll attract you with the expensive thing, but they'll put it at the end of your self service line.
So you have the yogurt, which is the highest Arjun first and then you'll have your dry items that don't go bad waffle, you know, crumbled Oreos, things like that, whatever.
10:29
And then you have the fresh fruit that goes bad, that cost more money by ounce and so they get people to fill up their cup in the beginning, with the highest margin.
Then they sprinkle in a little bit of slightly lower margin and then when you have almost no room left, then you put your few fruit on top because if you just fill the whole thing up with bananas, they be breaking even right.
10:47
Actually been in as a cheap fruit but you get the idea if they filled it up.
Well, like if you get one of these little guy, A pound of strawberries.
It's like if you get retail it's like 10 bucks.
Like who, you put that pound on the machine Oz, their cost you 60 cents, 16 oz?
Like they'd be pretty much breaking even on that.
11:05
Right.
So think through it like that.
Hey, Moe is an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
11:22
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Now if you really want to have a fun fun experiment, take one of the Hershey syrup things and just put it on, put it on the on the scale and you can see what they're making from just selling that bottle so you can actually see the retail price.
11:41
Now you can buy pounds of Hershey's for like 10 bucks like one of these huge gallon things and so that ends up being almost the same price as yogurt.
But it's a fun mental exercise corporate noted that the number one way that they are able to get more customers and the highest-performing stores did, so with better service.
11:58
Cleaner stores, more selection, and the most important, one word of mouth because when you have an average ticket, that's so low like yogurt cups, right?
You have margin, even on that tiny little cup.
The only profitable way to really acquire customers is either word of mouth or Affiliates, meaning other businesses that send you business.
12:17
And so they double down on that.
Now when they started years ago, Google search was cheap enough that they could actually drive pay-per-click campaigns to get people to there.
Occasions.
But nowadays it's too expensive for most of them so they almost all have to rely on the quality of the product and the experience.
12:35
And so the store that I wanted to open the way that I was going to open.
My store, was that I wanted to create a better experience for somebody walked in.
So I wanted to have floor-to-ceiling, kind of candy, see through experiences and when someone walked in, they were overwhelmed with these appearance of selection, right?
12:54
And they would just turn the nozzle on there, which by the way, I would have it.
So that would be really close.
D.
So it too much would fall through.
So I get a little bit more weight on it.
It's been real cap was, hey, did you get too many Oreos?
I'm sorry.
And I always felt like the that you should have more selection, because the more selection you give people this has been proven with buffets people eat more of the more options you give them.
13:14
So, I would want to have one entire side.
That would be yogurt, nozzles with more options because people have more desire to do more selection.
They want to try a little bit of everything, right?
And then on this side, I have the floor to ceiling things, right?
And at Variant and I might even consider removing fruit, I would probably look at it, but then, my promotional effort, my plan was to go to the university.
13:38
So I wanted to be close to colleges and then I was going to partner with all of the fraternities and sororities and have competitions between them to see who could get the most yogurt.
And then give some sort of Swag or something for the fraternity, or whatever, that got the most yogurt during that period of time.
13:53
And I could do that I could rinse and repeat that process with companies.
I could rinse repeat that process basically with Ins and that is the cheapest form of advertising.
When you don't have a lot of money, is going to find places where there's buckets of people that you can give them some sort of promotion at bring them in.
Right?
And so if I could do a strong incentive to get people to join my list, like a text list, I could send out coupons on a relatively regular basis and acquire them for next to nothing and so I'd run the competition's to bring them in.
14:17
I'd have a crazy incentive to get the text, the text number because normally, they ask we have now is, would you like to join our text list to which almost all of us are like, nah, I'm good.
Because you don't feel like getting coupons.
But if you knew that your first order was half off like hey you want to save 50% today by joining our text list then you could probably join them at now.
14:37
Some people the the smaller short-term businessman, really going to give half my profit up.
Well to me I just acquired a lead that I can get lifetime value on for two dollars.
I'll take it because I know that I'm going to be able to get them back right or get them to bring a friend and I want to be able to remind them of my store on a regular basis.
14:58
So, if you're looking at stuff that you can model from the yogurt businesses and also not do that, they're doing poorly.
Here's my list for you.
Number one, when you have the option to give a customer, the ability to pick their own pricing by usage, do it?
Because often times people will blame themselves, not you when they / user / spend.
15:17
Think about minutes back in the day or text messages, right?
Like the over you if you have the power to use more, especially if it's something people like they will do more of it.
But they will associate part of that.
Responsibly with themselves rather than you.
Number two, you want to direct the prospects attention in order of your margin.
15:35
So you want the most people to see the thing that makes you the most money first.
Not the thing that cost you the most money first because that's where they're most likely to purchase and then purchase the most of it.
So we want to use up as much of their spending wallet or spending power on the things that make us the most profit.
15:51
Number three selection can bite you in the butt, but in a buffet or consumption setting more selection as long as they're not.
Inflicting.
But if you have twenty six jars of jam, they can only pick one.
It's conflicting.
But if you can have a little bit of all of them, like a buffet, they eat more.
16:08
And so that's why the nuances like psychology is so important.
But if you have a type of product or service where someone can sample multiple things, the more things you offer them, the more things like a buffet, they will ultimately buy and consume.
Number four, if you are starting a business unless it's something brand new and completely radical there's likely somebody who started a business just like yours who failed.
16:29
And you can often times by all their stuff for 10 cents or 5 cents on the dollar and dramatically, decrease your startup costs.
If you're newer and you're like, I only have 20 grand saved up, you can start a business for that amount of money, right?
And you can get a decent amount of actual equipment for that amount of money when you go to the right seller and that is a motivated.
16:50
Or somebody who's lost all their money because they did a business because they weren't watching the right YouTube videos because not part of my Z Nation, right.
And you can buy it from them at a huge discount and then you can start your next thing.
It's a great way.
I always looked at that when I was like, I'll bet you there's long care things, there's whatever type of business you want going for business?
17:06
Liquidation sales is a great way to buy those equipment back.
Number five, the power of the default option.
So the fact that they went from removing the tiny cups to only giving large and bucket sized cups for yogurt and encourage people to use more yogurt themselves and they do that because it looks silly in comparison.
17:26
And so whenever there's a possibility that you can set the default where someone would be encouraged by implication to use more just like the fast-food upgrade of, like, do you want medium, or I'm assuming you want to meet him or I am assuming you want a 32 ounce, when you give the default option, many people just like organ donors, which by the way, it went from, I think it was like 10 or 15 percent of people opting in to be.
17:50
An organ donor to getting 80% of people to become organ donors by simply saying, you not want to be an organ donor versus.
Do you want to be an organ donor.
So if you have the potential to get 7 times more people to say yes to something just imply that that's what everyone else is doing and you can do that through as default options which is one of the most powerful psychological selling Tools in existence and no one even knows it's happening to them most of the time but you will probably nation and you pay attention stuff.
18:15
When you're trying to promote something that costs very little money.
So, this is very common in consumer businesses, especially consumer products, cpg, Etc.
Most strategies, it's very difficult to acquire customers with paid advertising profitably.
That's why a lot of these places raise funding etc, etc.
And they have to bank on lifetime value to pay back their cost of acquisition.
18:34
If you don't have tons of cash and you're not funded, then the two most profitable strategies for acquiring customers Beyond, just creating content, creating a brand, which still is very difficult on a local level is is to get Word of Mouth, which is referrals.
It's good.
Old-fashioned organic people like your yogurt and tell other people about it, right?
18:51
And you have a strong referral system in place and this is key.
It's not just having a very good product which is important but reminding and encouraging people to share it.
So I'll give you a quick contacts on this my podcast.
Same podcast.
I just decided to say, hey guys, if you could leave a review and share this with somebody, that would be great.
19:10
As soon as we did that we 20 x.
The number of reviews that we were getting And our growth skyrocketed just because I asked.
And so, Step One is having a good product step to ask people to share about it because people just don't think about you because I think about a hundred other things.
19:26
But if you remind them, at least they're more likely to do it.
By the way, click, subscribe and notification ballot, and all those things and share this on the story tag me.
Okay, cool.
Back to the thick.
The second way is through Affiliates, which means other businesses that have your other businesses or groups that have your desired audience, the difference between referral is one Customer tells another customer.
19:46
This isn't their main game.
An affiliate is somebody who has a bucket of people who are just like your ideal customer.
That's where if I was yogurt store, I would go for the fraternity or sorority or the business groups or the the Chamber of Commerce for the local town.
I would go find those groups and it sounds silly.
20:02
But if you give those people a strong incentive and you say, hey just so, you know, at your clothing store, anybody goes through clothing store, I'll give her free yogurt.
All of a sudden like you just enhance the value what they're selling and then you just get to clink your cart to every other person's horse.
20:19
And you let 100 businesses carry you as they flood you with all their customers.
Just give them something good enough that people actually want to consume it.
That's the key.
That's how all affiliate marketing works.
Is you just have to make a good enough that it benefits the customer A and B that the Affiliates actual thing becomes more valuable with the addition of your thing, too.
20:39
And you can take, I said, yogurt with Clothing store.
But like you can think about that for anything.
If I was doing dry cleaning, then it would make sense that I go to all the luxury store and say, hey, all your people need dry cleaning Tom.
They get the first 2, or Whatever item they get here is on me for the first two.
Well, shit.
If we can just know that they just made a purchase, they're going to have this need.
20:56
They probably have other items that are just like that they'll probably start shipping stuff too.
And so the big thing is that if you don't have a lot of LTV on your customers and you just require a lot of them, then you have to go with the more viral more grassroot ways.
But what you do is you systematized that within your Business.
So that the system itself is what becomes duplicatable.
21:14
And, as a bonus point, I will tell you my favorite frozen yogurt store because I've been to all of them.
My favorite frozen yogurt chain is Orange Leaf.
I believe that they have the best flavors and my opinion.
I think the founder of that franchise, whatever it is actually loves dessert because you can tell by the attention to detail by the cookies that they bring in their always fire.
21:33
They're so good.
The flavors themselves are decadent.
They don't have all these weird fruit things like it's just like, caramel chocolate.
It peanut butter, you know, I mean the good stuff and that is my personal favourite of all the different over stores.
And if you haven't been doing orange lie, if you check it out, the very good.
21:49
I was not paid to say that.
They are very good though.








0:00
Hey guys, this was probably the best or one of the top three interviews that I have done to date.
This is with Ken Coleman on the Dave, Ramsey Network, just a wonderful interviewer and conversationalist, and I don't think we talk.
I've ever really talked about the majority of the topics on this interview, which is what made it kind of.
0:16
So, unique, we talked about the larger economy at large different opportunities that are existing right now, and I just think overall, if you get as much value out of this, as I enjoyed making it.
I think you guys have dig it, enjoy.
It is worse to not be able to work than to be.
Forced to work.
If I had to pick up, being unable to work is worse than being forced to work, the wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
0:37
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $209 and Beyond, if you share and enjoy.
All right, Alec I talk about education all the time, on the show mainstream media and it because I'm so fired up about it.
0:59
I'm looking The data.
And I know you talked about it on your YouTube channel and in multiple places, bottom line is, I'm not sure, it's a great investment anymore, and I think it's in danger, higher, ed of becoming extinct.
When you look at enrollment numbers are down big-time you contrast that with, of course, you know, tuition up student loans up, and I want to know what you think about that.
1:23
Is you look at this new economy and you talk about the new economy all the time, where does college sit as it relates to Relevance, I think it's a really interesting question.
I think one of the easiest ways to think through it is to think, like, first principles of why was College established to begin with and then going backwards from there.
1:41
And so, I think, for most people they say college was established to increase the quality of the workforce.
So increase skilled labor so that we could be more competitive as a nation and there was kind of different tiers of workers.
There was tears of workers didn't have a college degree tears, that did college at that time from a price to Value perspective was significantly, higher surprised, what you pay values what you get The return on the investment of both time.
2:01
And money still made sense for people to forego income for most people for that period of time.
I know that it rains, it's, it's you encourage people to do both, which I would encourage as well, like don't stop making money, you have the option, that's right.
But the idea that you have an investment of time and money, and then you can make up for it more later, which makes complete sense.
2:21
And I give a little analogy to this, which is a friend of mine has a daughter.
She's in high school, and she started working in a bowling alley for minimum wage.
And he said, hey you should take a phlebotomy certification, it takes a weekend, it's 500 bucks and you can start making $25 an hour.
Now for her to save up the money to then spend the weekend, it might take her eight weeks to save the money versus borrowing 500 from Dad, doing the certification and being able to pay dad back in a week and then making seven more weeks of basically net profit or whatever you want to call it, increased earning capacity.
2:54
That's a micro example will College was supposed to do.
The difficulty is that now there is no I could see between what someone can earn with or without a college degree, but there is a very real costs in both time and money.
And so, I think that is the fundamental discrepancy of why college no longer is worth it.
3:10
And then there's the additional risk of if you take on college debt, or search student student loans, you can't bankrupt out of them.
You're stuck with him forever and you're stuck with him forever at a, at a lower or in significantly raised earning capacity over now.
And I want to stay in this Lane because when I get to talk to people, like, you different viewpoints worldview, you're younger than I am as well.
3:29
Well, I'm just curious.
What you your generation.
What do you think?
Is the distaste that parents have with trades?
I think everything comes down to status and so I would imagine that most parents want to be able to say that they did a good job of being parents.
3:48
And so they use their children as a proxy for how good of people they are.
And so, if they can go and say, hey, my kid is doing X, Y & Z, it is perceived as high Prestige versus my kid is an electrician, even though he makes more The biggest social media manager at insert random mid-market company.
They would get more Prestige.
4:04
From social media says, it's white collar versus Blue Collar from a dollars and cents standpoint from a return on investment Staple.
In bar Ghibli, from an enjoyment of Life standpoint that person who might be inclined, to be an electrician or a plumber or whatever.
Might actually like that more and have a better life, but I think it's selfishness at its core is that they they're putting their own needs rather than the needs of their children.
4:22
First and most of them were doing so without knowledge, I would say, that's the vast majority and then I would say the other oh no.
Steve A truck nearly half are there and they are portion is parents who are just afraid of messing something up.
And it is always safe to go with the herd because I mean, that's that's human behavior.
4:40
If you have a check mark box, on your purchases says, this is what everyone does, or 89 percent of people, choose this option.
Most people feel safe doing it because other people walked on the ice and so you feel like you're not going to, you're not going to go down, right?
So I feel like that's evolutionary and so people go with her behavior even though the reason College originally was started was to create a price divided as currency in terms of You added two, people went through it and that's coming soon.
5:02
Alarmed, resist.
It transformed from being a value additive to a cultural norm and so people continue to do it as a cultural norm, not because it has value because they've always done it that way.
That's exactly right.
So I've got a ninth grade boy and a junior right now, and my ninth grader goes to our, we go to, we're very blessed Bill to go to private school.
5:20
So the night, my wife says to me how she goes, hey, it's a college seminar 101, something or other for the ninth grade, she goes.
Are you going?
And I'm like, I'm not going.
I'm not going.
This is part of the problem.
We're putting 9th graders and their parents in a room and we're creating again.
5:36
More pressure, right?
And having conversations about college with a 14 year old, who is just like every other fourteen-year-old, the world, he is temporary insanity.
Most of the time, he changes his mind all the time.
What are they doing?
He's 14.
It's okay to change your mind 50,000 times.
5:54
And and I bring this up to you because you know, you've got a lot of you got a lot of young people.
Watching your channel, you've been tremendously successful and we've created this homogenized view of success that has a lot to do with your test scores, the diploma and everything else.
6:12
When in all reality, the diploma doesn't guarantee anything at all.
Other than in some jobs and career paths, it does get you the ticket in the door but that's increasingly less and less of a reality.
I think.
Gary Vee said something that was really profound.
6:28
He said I get it, you know.
Doctors lawyers, accountants you need the degree.
He's like, but what about the 95% of people that aren't in those three to ten pockets?
That's right.
Of career paths that are the easy ones to name off the top of your head.
What about them?
You don't have mean, what about the two million?
6:43
You know, plus sales people that exist you don't mean just in the United States alone.
Like what, what about those people?
And so, yeah.
I think everything comes down to price to Value discrepancy and cultural norms that I think that the price of a discrepancy, I don't think there's really an argument for it anymore, with the exception of, like you said, the ticket of Entry 2, Potentially higher path.
7:00
Which then makes the argument that it's really the higher education above the four-year degree.
That's the when the thing that's conferring the value and you only have to do this as a mandatory cost for lack of better term to get in.
And then for everyone else, the cultural norm argument of, if they're going to take a normal job, there is no Reese do incur for years and the that's kurupt bankrupt, less debt.
7:21
Yeah.
Well, let's just look at large companies like Google and other tech companies that are hiring young people and they don't even care what the degree is.
Where they have one or not, because they're training them.
For the job.
You know, I love the story.
You tell them one of your videos about your 19 year, old neighbor.
I think I'm just going to tell it.
Yeah, go ahead because this is great, here's a kid who's literally in the middle of this scenario that we're talking about probably has well-meaning parents.
7:42
He's 19, he wants to be successful, he's blessed to be your neighbor and boom, one day he goes.
Hey Alex, I want to make a bunch of money so he was what I would consider an above average, but not exceptional student, you know, he did probably a 35.
7:59
Something like that student.
He got into Pepperdine which is a expensive, coolant School in Southern California.
He did a semester there.
He didn't like kind of the social programming aspect of everything that was being pushed down his throat and then beyond that, the big realization that he had was that he just didn't like this and he still felt like all of his time and all his energy was going into watching YouTube videos about how to make money.
8:20
And so we had this long walk, I remembers almost like two hours.
We walked our neighborhood and kept walking until I wanted him to make this decision.
And so what it came down to for him was that he took Because a he had parents who were well-to-do and could afford to put him in this college but for him it was a safety.
8:35
Net was that he had an excuse to not succeed at his entrepreneurial desire because he had a four-year buffer and so I told him I was like you will always be able to go back to college.
They will always take her money.
Oh they will have no problem.
Take your mother right?
8:51
That's right.
But what I want to do is talk about A Tale of Two Jacobs.
Write his name is Jacob and so, I said, so Jacob number one, you go and you finish your Your your Pepperdine in four years with a 3-2 Business Degree.
I was like let's be real the world doesn't need a 3-2 business degree and I'm not listening to anyone from Pepperdine with a 3-2 business to grow and how I'm going to use, how I'm going to grow my business.
9:10
Let's be real, right?
So you're going to get some whatever job for 40 to 60 thousand dollars a year, right?
Out of college four years from now, with two hundred thousand dollars in debt.
That's where you're at to your parents.
At least, if you want to pay them back in scenario, two, I said, you have four years.
And what I told him to do is to just join our front-end sales to, I was like, Just Dial, Dial photo, is the lowest.
9:29
It's the lowest tier job.
I said you will learn so many skills on how to talk to people how to work longer hours, how to work with adults people who are doing this as they actually their main source of income Etc.
And I said I promise you that a four years from now if you did nothing else you'll have saved two hundred thousand dollars in not cost, you will have made a hundred sixty thousand dollars because you'll have made whenever you know four times 40, if you make no improvements in your life, you don't love us like but you do have the decent shot at moving up in the company, gaining skills.
9:58
And then if we do an apples-to-apples, Comparison.
And right now, this kid is two years into that path where he decided to quit despite all of his friends in the parents and you know, kudos to his parents for.
They've been very supportive of this, which I think a lot of people don't have, and when you say quit, I just want to clarify quick cop.
10:16
Okay.
Dropped out after his person.
Okay.
Right.
I had to talk to his parents for times off the they're like, hey, I don't want, you know, you have a lot of influence over our son and I really want you to use that, cuz I'm not going to screw your side over like, all right, all right.
Good hands.
Hey let me go.
Can we stay here for a second?
10:32
This is so good.
What were the fears that the biggest fears you had to address with his parents?
They didn't want him to be seen as less than or less capable and they wanted, they felt like, because of their upbringing, their side, on arms, whatever they felt like college was still a viable plan, b, or it made his trajectory into the workforce, less risky and more guaranteed as they perceived it to getting a job.
11:01
And I had to explain to them that if you have Jacob number one and Jacob number 24 years from now.
Yeah, Me a guy's been working on a sales for four years versus a guy who graduated college before his eyes.
Like there's no businessman that I know who would take, you know, liberal Edge.
11:19
Jacob 32, Business Degree over the guy who's been banging phones and made, you know, forty thousand phone calls over the last, you know, four years, whatever.
And so I think once they understood that he was better off and it wasn't for them, the money wasn't the significant part.
11:35
They wanted risk.
Adjust his trajectory the trajectory of His career.
Yeah, I explained that the risk adjusted return on the value additive like on the skills, he would acquire over the four years.
That's right.
Because you want to do business and I was a big because he wanted to get in business and make money the best way to learn business is to get into business.
11:51
That's right.
Well, let's so he's two years in with you now.
Yeah.
And how's he doing?
So he's got two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved up.
Wow.
As a 19 year old, he worked his way off the call floor as the top Center there.
The dialer outbound dollar and then we have three sales teams.
12:08
To get to In The Weeds here but there's three tiers of salesman.
He worked his way up the top of the bottom tier worked at the top of the second here and became second highest in the top tier over the span of 18 months.
And so and I told him when he got the job, I said I can't even give you the job.
12:24
I can get you the interview.
I said it's up to the salesman, he manages his own team.
You have to, you have to show him and the same thing with his career path.
And I would always check with the manager.
I was like, Hey, I want to make sure that he's not getting any special treatment.
They're like if anything we give him worse treatment because He's young and we are like but his numbers are his numbers.
12:42
Like they're like he sounds like a man on the phone.
Wow.
And so that was one of the things that he had to overcome to is like, how do you and he's now selling stuff.
He's selling you know, Thirty fifty thousand dollar, you know, licenses to Jim, you know, like basically like gym franchise easier to say for sure two grown men.
12:59
And so the amount of maturity and the amount, how many people have hung up on him, on the dialing side that he had to learn how to overcome that and position him and hold the frame, all these things that You talk about that guy for years from now compared to the guy who was studying Aztec literature like we're going to hire.
13:15
Yeah.
All right, so what you're essentially describing is this young man may take a four-year Gap, like a gap year is like a horrible thing to say to a parent.
I I've done it at Live Events before I was afraid of 2,000 people recently.
Dad stood up and said hey can I got to ask you a question about my son?
13:31
He's thinking about a gap year and I think he thought I was going to give him some advice.
How to held it talk that kid out of it and I was like, do it It yeah just do it.
Who cares?
As long as he's working, he's active, he's exploring, he's trying, I think it's so important.
13:47
And I want to stay here with this 19 year old, because for my audience, they'll get where I'm going here, I'm only talking about the intersection of talent, what you do best passion, what you love to do and then Mission what motivates us.
And so I'm curious if this young man is told you now having worked for you for two years is he beginning to see a clear mountain top?
14:06
Or is he still just saying?
I want to get Much experience as possible to figure out one day.
What the business is, how far along in his vision, is he?
I'm curious.
I would say he's, I mean, in his entrepreneur trajectory, he's so green.
It's, you know, right.
14:23
But in terms of because transparently he had he worked out with me.
So he he so I had a big garage Jim if he would work out with my first school every day, right?
And so here, two years of like 10 you know, he had a lot of time with one-on-one mentorship of reframing, how he saw The world.
14:39
And so he understands that this is a chapter in his life to gain one plume in his cap of, I understand sales God.
And so he also understands that I've, you know, been very clear with him was like, these are that you need to understand all the Departments of a business in order to run one.
So he understands his personal finances because he he's followed what I say he doesn't spend money.
14:57
He lived he splits a place with four guys in the kids making 25 Grand a month.
Yeah.
Well, it's a place with 4 dudes and he's got no girlfriend.
No everything he owns in cash, but he was like, you still don't know marketing.
So you need to learn how to Market.
That's going to be the kind of the next.
Any, just any Star to do this?
He's making content now, he's making sure it's he's made his first YouTube video this week.
15:15
So he's learning the content game.
He's learning how to Market, how to position himself.
He's going to have to learn delivery, which is probably the next thing after that.
And so, he understands that he's on a journey to acquire skills.
So that when he does choose to deploy them, they'll have the capital and have the experience in order to increase the likelihood of success because I was explaining to his parents.
15:33
I said I want him to start cold calling because if he knows how to turn a phone in two months, Honey, he will never go hungry the rest of his last right?
The rest of his life.
He wants to start a business.
He's got a phone and he's got numbers and he can find business and if you and he can take that skill to any business and any business owner will pay him handsomely to go get them business.
15:52
Well, I got to tell you and I think that's what's even more important than the ability to make money.
And I think you're absolutely right.
Is by putting him on a cold.
Call floor and a phone where he's just banging on the phone.
Let me tell you something.
You learn to overcome rejection, which is Maybe the most valuable skill of any successful person.
16:11
I don't care.
What Walk of Life, you did, you learn how to handle rejection.
That's huge.
Because we are so scared of at the sting of hearing, no, and boy, you've cured him of that pretty quick.
And then, I would also say that this is where it comes from.
Holy I mean, real grit, I mean, it's the ability to go.
16:31
I'm going to do hard things for the purpose of Learning how to do hard things.
Yes, like I'll tell you, I got three kids and, you know, I don't want to sound like a middle-aged old guy, but I probably am already.
I am middle-aged My Generation, I'm Gen-X.
16:50
One of the things that is concerning about me is how we have removed.
Moved - feelings from our kids lives.
We're so concerned about our kids feeling good.
We forgotten to teach them how to actually be good, but you can't be good, Alex, unless you suck.
17:08
I don't know how you get to be good at anything without sucking in the first place.
Is that, is that fair to say that that's our greatest, failure to our to these kids, these days.
I feel like you're preaching the gospel of mozi nation and that's the that is it is you must suck before you are good.
17:24
Yeah.
There's no way around that and to your point about the, the ascribing, a negative or positive label to an emotional state.
Is in my opinion, the biggest plight of the youngest generation right now is that we want to draw a line and say, any feeling below.
17:41
The line is bad.
It's like looking at the sky and saying, sunny days are good, rainy days are bad but they are both required for the earth to continue.
Right?
And as humans, The Human Experience is the breadth of the experiences.
Not just Everything to the left of the line, which is why you have these overmedicated kids who think that any bad feeling is bad or rather, any feeling that they would prefer not to have as something that they should not have, or should not experience rather than a corrective tool to get them back on the path that they want to be on.
18:10
Like this is 100% I could.
And to I just want to hit on a point that you said earlier because it's really profound for me and audience that I have, which is, I believe that there are three main things that people have to develop, you've got skills, you've got traits and you've got beliefs about the world.
Got Actives.
18:26
And so, you know, you are limited or at least in my view entrepreneurs are limited by one of those three at any given moment.
So if you have impeccable character and you've great beliefs about the world, but you have no skills, you will only be able to, you know, provide value to the level of your skills.
Now, once you add a ton of skills to your tool belt, the sky's the limit, the flip side, you've got tons of skills, right?
18:46
But you don't have the character trait of Focus, right?
Like you can't stick with something for a long time that your grit that you were referencing earlier or you can't take rejection, that's a trait.
And so it doesn't matter how skilled you are or what you believe to be possible in the world and what you want to allocate your time and energy and resources and skills to words, you won't be able to accomplish because you want the character to character trait to get there.
19:06
And so we I see it as those three paths.
And so to Jacobs education, learning the phones was a very small percentage of what what he was learning during that period of time.
He learned discipline, he learned how to show up on time, he learned how to have uniform, he learned how to talk, to adults, you learn how to hold a frame.
He learned from a belief perspective, you learn that you could sell stuff for tons of money before.
19:25
Before he could adopt I'll say this hopefully as people in people, understand me saying it, a poverty mentality around money and she's like a thousand dollars is a lot of money will to a 16 year old maybe but also sometimes to a 40 year old and it's sad to me that it is a lot to the foil because they learned that they didn't know that they were taught that that it was a lot of money and I wanted to get to him before he would learn the wrong lessons.
19:48
And so he can now say a hundred thousand dollars on the phone and not break a sweat because he doesn't have worldviews that I had to unteach him.
Was blank slate and so anyway, theater learned a lot of things and the traits and the skills of just how to pick up a phone and get someone to say yes and move forward was that was the minority of the things that he learned in that experience.
20:05
Yeah.
This young man's working hard for you.
He's busting his butt.
Oh, we don't know if he has a passion for sales.
He might now he discovered because you made him do it but he might not he's doing it.
If he doesn't have a true passion for sales like connecting with people and getting them a solution.
20:21
He's doing this because he's got maybe a passion for Options, and maybe a business around that and that's great.
All right, but but here's my point.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
20:40
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
It's that as he is experiencing and you have putting through some, some real pain in a good way.
20:57
He said to learn rejection, how that feels, and busting his butt and competing and losing all the things that you've discussed.
My point is, is that in the doing hard things, embracing the suck as we've been talking about, I feel that inside of that, we begin to discover along the way.
21:16
Oh, I did this just because it was hard, but in the all along the way, I found that that I would do this.
Whether it was hard or not, like if I got did some hard stuff now, became easy.
But now I find that I want to keep doing hard stuff because the pleasure I get from doing the hard stuff, the work itself.
21:34
And that what I mean by that is when I do have a 12-hour day tomorrow, 12 hours, I'll do three hours of the showw video, shoot.
All kinds of stuff.
I'll be mentally.
Like, you know, it's gonna be a hard day but I do it because I have found pleasure in helping.
21:53
Other people relieve pain because of my own pain.
When I went through some of my career crisis stuff, that's the point that I'm making is that in just getting kids out there and doing stuff, they're going to begin to find pleasure in this thing called work, which has been created as a four letter word, like work has to suck that I only work for money.
22:12
I just curious your thoughts on that because you're talking a lot about work and Career Success but this idea of a connection between some of our pain and pleasure.
Well I'll say a statement that we say a In our community, which is your work, works on you more than you work on it and so I believe that we were meant to work.
22:29
Yes.
We're about to work.
Yes.
And I had a very A rock-bottom experience, which was in a rock top situation.
So I'll tell this to give context.
So last year, we exited three of our companies for sizeable amount and during that year, I wasn't really allowed to work because I couldn't show that I was doing anything the business.
22:49
We also couldn't make any big changes because you don't want to change stuff during a transaction etcetera.
And so, during that year, I basically had to take off.
So they also didn't, I'm a big liver, not starting new things until like you have finished the thing that you are working on.
And so I pretty much had to sit idle and it was one of the more More depressed years of my life because I had to just sit on my hands and do nothing and I realized the blessing that it is to, it is so much worse.
23:14
It is worse.
To not be able to work than to be forced to work.
Yes.
If I had to pick a being unable to work is worse than being forced to work and so I think if we extrapolate that out we learn to derive pleasure from work in a job.
Well done.
23:30
And I think that the gain or pleasure that you get is proportional to the pain that you experienced to achieve the outcome or accomplishment if something comes easy and less to you they'll try and so if we want to have these meaningful experiences as Then we must bear the price of that because there's no way we can cheat it.
23:51
What we put in is what we will get out.
Like, what we reap is what we sell and so if we want to have the big reap, we have to so big and so I think that's what people want to do, want the big reaping without the big selling.
It's absolutely right.
And you cheat yourself because you don't get the emotional experience of the fulfilled Victory without the the grit the suffering that leads to it.
24:11
Yeah, I want to do is just a brief break down, we're going to cover some things, but I do want to walk you through.
The the methodology that we teach on the show so people can see it uniquely to your story and that is Talent.
What would you say?
Are your top two or three talents?
Even get it.
Persuading.
Okay persuasion like to.
24:28
I think that's that's one.
Okay, probably the biggest one.
I hate to use this term but I'm I'm pretty good at resource allocation.
Hmm.
And so what I mean by that is if we have limited resources and time and money and band with her attention and we have unlimited options that we have that the world presents us.
24:48
We have to learn to say no to 99.99% of things.
Truly because options are unlimited resources are and so the ability to allocate resources, I think for me has allowed me to move through things quickly.
Wow.
So I want to take a shot at rewarding that not because it needed to be rewarded but to go a little deeper it, my hearing you say that you have got a natural ability to dive into the complex.
25:15
And simplify and then also then execute on it.
So there's a little bit of both.
Are you're able to analyze and then be decisive.
Is that what I heard?
You say?
Yes.
So you got the ability to analyze, okay.
I've got limited resources and I can quickly take complex and simplifying.
25:32
Go, we got to go here.
I think I've that's wild.
Yeah, been able to move quickly through life because I've been able to allocate my energy into the highest leverage activities.
The things that I get the most return on for my Time.
Yeah.
Okay that's good.
Okay.
So let's go into passion work that you love if there's two or three roles and or tasks what would you say that?
25:55
I love this kid.
If I'm doing this, I get excited thinking about it and I get lost in the middle of it.
What would you say those passions?
Are I love learning which I to through teaching.
So I is a realization I had about myself.
I used to say that I love teaching and I thought more about it and it's actually I don't love teaching.
26:15
I love learning and I use teaching as a vehicle for learning, right.
You love learning in order to dispense, right?
Yeah.
If I want to learn more about sales to say, I'm going to go write a book on sales because I know I'm going to learn a whole, a whole heck of a lot more.
So like if I'm, if I'm doing that, I'm in a good space, okay?
That is transparently the majority, what I do in general and talking to people, you know, that's that's what I, what I enjoy doing.
26:37
So whether it's talking to the team, whether it's talking to our portfolio CEOs, whether it's talking to a camera to talk to an audience, like, that is what promotion if you want to put that.
As a as a different bucket.
Yeah.
If you had teaching and promotion, those are probably the two things.
If I have a hat inside the business, it's it would be CM.
Oh yeah, it wouldn't be CEO.
26:53
Actually think my wife is she is the CEO.
She's the chief executive officer and I have a function.
That is, that is what I do.
She is, what's better?
I think it makes sense for what you just said, a CMO because you really love the communicative work.
Connecting with people telling stories that teaching instructing and guiding.
27:11
I mean, as I watched some of the videos I can I just it was fun for me.
As I've told people many times, if I wasn't doing this, I'd be coaching basketball somewhere because I just love coaching, and really, what that is, it's about connecting with people and helping them, get from here to here, if you're going to simplify it.
27:27
And when you talk about these, the young neighbor and just, you know, here's a kid who wanders into your gym or however that happened and you decide that's really the heart of a mentor and a coach, you know, that guide if we want to choose one word, I love that.
All right, so last piece of it.
So talents what we do best passion is what we love.
27:44
Love to do the last piece of a person's purpose.
Statement is Mission.
What results matter to you.
So what fires you up when you think about everything, you're doing what results, really give you the juice, this is so timely that you're asking these questions.
28:01
So I recently after 10 years have just redefined this for myself and it was something that I'm almost ashamed to say what it was before, but why I defined my self-worth through my net worth For the vast majority of my career despite knowing that it is not the best way to do it.
28:19
I know that that was still true for me.
I could say whatever I want and I know that I was still true.
And so recently, I'm a big believer that the measuring stick that we choose to use is the filter that we decide what paths to take throughout our life and we measure them against this lens of, will it help me accomplish this measuring stick, right?
28:37
And whether it's to glorify God, whether it's to be a good parent, whether whatever the thing is and for me was, will this build my net worth fast?
That something else, right?
That's been and it has worked for that goal that being said, when I look at my 85 year old self back into today, I don't think that that man would care if you had 50% more net worth and so I feel like my decision calculus has recently begun to change.
29:01
And so for me, I have defined this and I'll try and break it down as will this build Goodwill?
So, I love that.
Now, everything that I do is, will this build Goodwill and the Decision calculus for that.
Is it can only build no neutral moves.
29:20
So if something's just neutral, like, it doesn't detract from it, but it doesn't build it.
Then I don't do it.
And so I think about brand brand Equity Goodwill as on monetized value.
And, with my prior decision making thesis, I would have to die on my death bed with no Goodwill because I would have monetized.
29:41
Every aspect of Goodwill that I had in the marketplace to maximize mind.
It worth like if we just take it to the Natural extreme of me on my deathbed having fulfilled, my measuring stick, right, that I had prior to this.
How do you define good?
Will I'm going to, I want to, I want to give you, I want you to go deeper on that because I think people want to know they're like, come on Alex.
29:58
What what is Goodwill, what's the measurement?
It's giving an excess of what you take.
And so if I give to somebody, and I ask for nothing back, I have Goodwill, I've deposited and I owe you into the world, okay?
And I would like to die with a surplus of iou's.
30:15
So does that known as an investor?
You're going.
That's the measuring stick.
It's not how much I'm going to exit for its.
Can I come beside a business that needs my help?
Or someone like me?
And I know I can make their dream bigger.
Is that what you mean?
When you say give more than you, that was that what you're talking about?
30:32
Like, I would love to die with the tombstone said here, lies, the man who gave the most so it's literally give you money away.
Money is part of it but I think we can get a lot more than because like if I think how can I provide the most value?
If I write a book like the offers book that I wrote last year and it's like a number one, whatever that I've got more messages and from the hundreds of thousand people who bought and read and use the book then I could possibly influence with the amount of tiny amount of money in comparison to the amount of good that way.
31:04
And so I think what are the highest leverage ways for me to provide Goodwill to the marketplace and a lot of that right now is either coder media.
You right?
So like I can take, you know, we have this time that we get to spend together but then millions of people can hopefully benefit from the conversation shift, the perspective, gaining skills, Etc or hopefully maybe lead their child down a path.
31:23
That might not be the one.
The hopefully, hopefully, we can help some more Jacobs and let me just say just to applaud you.
I mean we may never know the impact that Jacob will have I mean, get goose bumps right now going.
31:39
That's what it's about, we don't know yet.
What story Jacobs telling, and you just believe in this kid and being an advocate to.
His parents me this is real stuff.
Let me I want it because I do hope a lot of people watch this and get behind the layers with you.
What was driving the Old Mission?
31:56
I asked you what results matter to you.
And you said, I've recently just changed my narrative.
What was driving it to be all.
Net worth words that come from your background Own voices in your life.
I were what was driving that narrative before that, my net worth is the narrative.
I think it was an internal shift from Fear to Faith.
32:15
Wow.
Not in the, not in the, you know, traditional religious sense, but more so just It Was Fear driven, you know, fear anger, whatever, you know.
But I think fear is usually at the core of the year of what fear of not being good enough.
Where's that mean?
Where's that come from?
32:31
Look at you, dude, you're busting out of your shirt.
You're clearly a guy.
Who goes hard after the physical discipline, what's driving that?
So, I had a head of our still do have a middle eastern.
Father, I was the only child only son.
No, real mom, no siblings.
32:46
Okay?
So, if you can imagine a very strong parent, father, with all of their world dreams, put onto one person, right.
Wow, there was no and I'm very grateful for the upbringing that I had, but the results of that was never been good enough at anything.
33:03
And so if I got a It was, what did you miss?
If I was Varsity it's like did you start more minutes like whatever.
Whatever.
The thing was there was always a goal post and move and it took me a very long time to realize that the goal posts would always move.
Yes.
And so I still think I learned the innate traits of I wanted to become bulletproof.
33:21
So that meant marrying the hottest girl that meant being richer than everyone that my being in better shape than everyone.
So that and it wasn't and at least for how I am built.
It was not too loud over people.
It was so that People would leave me alone.
Yeah, that no one could criticize me.
33:38
Wow, because it hurt.
And so, a lot of my life was building a fortress of being Beyond rebuke that there that no one could hold something to me, because I could buy every objective measure, beat them.
33:54
And I'm not trying to say that from a prideful place.
It was, it was from a place of trying to protect me.
Yeah, sure.
And so In real life and thinking through one of the men, you know, we evolved do these things over time as you're up, you know, in the beginning, it was make as much money as my dad, then it was make more money than my dad.
34:10
That it was make more money than my dad's arm in his whole life.
Again, it was, how can I get this even more bulletproof?
Because when I made, you know, I think it was seventeen million dollars and take-home income.
When I was 28.
I told my dad and he said, we'll see how long it lasts and so it was one of those things where I just wanted to.
34:25
I just wanted to win.
I just wanted to win and so what I realized was that I was winning a game That was set by someone else's rules.
Yes, I was playing his game, not mine.
And so, then when I was tasked, or at least I tasked myself with the idea of like, well, if I were to define a game, what were the rules?
34:41
What rules would I make?
It was a very different game.
And so, I think over the last probably three issue.
Here's 36 months was not that long.
I've been consistently kind of redefining this, and I would say, recently, I've had a more major shift in terms of my distillation of language are Decision of language of it was just a shift from Fear to Faith that what I am doing.
35:06
Even if I do not monetize every aspect of the Goodwill that we put out in the world, that's okay.
Because the goal has changed.
Yeah.
That's beautiful.
I mean, you nailed it.
I mean, you went from protecting yourself.
Those are the words you used to now, it's about distribution.
35:24
So from protection to distribution and what a what a great shift that is in your heart.
Wow.
That's beautiful amazing stuff.
Wow.
That's beautiful amazing stuff.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
0:28
So the big issue is that the stuff that most people sell socks, right?
And so they're constantly focused on promotion.
They're constantly trying to find the next Customer because I haven't confronted the real issue.
Is that you're just not that good, right?
And that's okay.
But the problem is that you're not focusing on the hard work, which is getting better.
The wealthiest people in the world.
0:45
See business is a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond, if you share and enjoy, If you understand the steps that I'm about to share with you, you will be able to step by step.
1:04
Create a fortune.
If you don't know who I am, I crossed 100 million dollars in net worth.
When I was 32, we have a portfolio at acquisition, not combat as $200 a year and I've nothing to sell you and it took me way too long to learn how fortunes are built.
So right now, if you imagine, the amount of people that you have sold in your lifetime and whatever business you have, whatever it is side, hustles gigs anything and you were to instead add up all of them together and then they continued to pay you month over month.
1:29
With over month at whatever price, you sell stuff at, how much bigger would your business?
Be, if it were mine, a lot bigger.
So I'll give you an example.
My first big business was called Jim launch.
Jim wants to date, has 5,000 brick-and-mortar gyms that have purchased the licensing from it.
1:47
Now, if I had 5,000 of those gym still paying right now, that company would be worth over a billion dollars that companies probably worth.
Now, close to about 100 million I've missed out on about 900 million dollars during my career just from that one company alone because it took me so long to learn what I'm about to share with you.
2:06
The big problem that most people have when they are starting their business is that they are in the selling business not in the reorder business, they don't have recurring Revenue, they have one time sales.
And so when you see these merch drops and these things where people are just selling crap and they get the one-time purchase and no one buys.
2:24
Again, the reason they can't make money is because they have no compounding vehicle.
What that means is that if I sell somebody today, I want to get credit for that person that I sold today in a year because what happens is, if you don't have that, then you're always selling for tomorrow.
You're always selling for the paycheck.
2:41
This month are always selling to pay rent rather than benefiting from a sale, you made 10 years ago and having that person still pay you today because the thing is that you need to harness time.
The people who understand wealth understand time if time is a liability against you, it means you were thinking like a poor person for the wealthy.
2:59
I'm becomes an asset because the longer you wait, the more you win.
And so if you imagine a business as a wall of glue and you're blowing people at it, if you never even increase the amount of people you sell, let's just say, you sell one person a week in 10 years.
3:17
You could have 500 customers every month who pay you, all right, and if you have any price point, that is reasonable.
That is a lot of money that is a fortune and the reason people don't have that happen as Because they don't get it and they're only thinking about the short sale for tomorrow.
3:33
The easiest question that I like to ask when were analyzing one of the businesses that were thinking about purchasing an interest in is, is there a way that we can get someone to buy this and never stop paying for it?
Is there a way that we can make this so good that the moment their card changes or they get a new credit card?
3:50
They call us ahead of time because they don't want to stop receiving value right now.
If your phone gets changed, your phone carrier and your credit card goes out.
What do you do?
All your phone carrier, you replace it because the value is there.
If your credit card goes out, what do you call Netflix?
4:06
Right?
You're going to make sure that your car goes through, if your utilities go out because your car doesn't go through you fucking pay it.
If your rent, doesn't go through, you make sure that it's paid on time because these are things that our valuables that you cannot live without.
And so, the goal is to figure out a way to make our value.
4:23
So high, that people don't want to stop paying, they wouldn't you want to be in the reorder, not the order.
A business.
And so, is important.
Point here is that there are recurring Revenue businesses and reoccurring Revenue.
So, for example, Facebook is a massive company.
4:39
They do not have recurring Revenue model.
They have a reoccurring Revenue model, meaning I go to the Facebook store today.
I buy some eyeballs and tomorrow I might go back again and buy more eyeballs.
I don't have a subscription but I reoccur I reorder over and over and over again.
4:56
So this applies whether you have a subscription business We have a one-time purchase business.
The point is that people come back.
The key question that I like to ask the portfolio companies when they're coming in is if right now you could no longer mark it you cannot make content you can't run ads, you can't cold call, you can't DM people.
5:14
All you could do is have the existing customers you have, get you more customers.
So the question that I asked the portfolio companies, then we're trying to grow them early on and really get the product to be.
Exceptional is if tomorrow, you could not mark it, anything you.
Could not get any new customers whatsoever.
5:31
And the only thing you had were the customers you have today and any new customer that you get could only come from referral and word of mouth of the people you have right now, how differently would you treat them how different with their experience be and how much better would you product B?
5:47
If the only way you could get new?
Customers was them sending new business, your way.
We start thinking like that you start thinking like the wealthy not like the poor, we're always in a rush for the next sale.
The next paycheck because the reality is you don't get customers to make sales, you make sales to get customers.
6:07
It's an important distinction, we only transact in order to create the relationship so that we can have Revenue again and again and again you want that customer to exist, like a node of Revenue in your business, that pumps money your way month after month.
After month.
6:23
So the big issues that the stuff, the most people sell socks, right?
And so they're constantly focused on promotion.
They're constantly trying to find the next Customer because I haven't confronted the real issue.
Is that you're just not that good, right?
And that's okay.
But the problem is that, you're not focusing on the hard work, which is getting better, right?
6:39
And so there are three steps that you look at when you're actually trying to scale a business.
You want to go to zero to a million, make a couple million bucks a year, you can just promote and sell shit all day long and never build real wealth.
Now, can you make a million bucks a year from anyone?
Guys watch that.
That might be a dream for you.
But for me, I want to build a fortune.
6:55
And the only way to build a fortune is to get people to never stop paying you.
All right?
So, if that is our goal, we only need to learn how to promote as much as we just need people to start trying our product.
The point of making the first sales is to get customers.
The point of those first customers is to give you feedback and you keep getting feedback and not even caring too much about how hard your marketing because the goal is to get the product and service better and better and better.
7:21
This is why most people can't scale because they start selling a little bit and say, oh, I should promote even more, but the problem is, they never fixed the product and so they keep selling more and more shit.
And then what happens is, if you saw 100 people this month, you have to sell 100 people next month, just to maintain.
7:37
And then the month after that, if you bump to 200 new sales month, then the next month, you have to sell 200 just to maintain.
But if you have 10 customers a month and they never leave you in five years, you have 500 customers. 600 customers a month that are paying You only with 10 new customers a week or ten new customers a month.
7:56
All right.
So do you understand the compounding effect of not losing customers?
That is the problem you solve for not the promotion.
Because happens, is when you get customers who do not leave you, you can afford it, any marketing, you can afford to outspend everyone.
8:12
There's a company that we're about to make a huge investment in and right now, their lifetime value.
Per customer compared to their competition is 10x and their cost to acquire customer is the same as their competition.
Hey guys, real quick.
8:30
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more.
8:48
And ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
So in a gunfight who's going to win in a bidding auction for who can buy the next customer on Facebook or YouTube or pay for the eyeballs between them and their, their competitors.
9:09
But win every time because when you get that right, everything else is easy but no one wants to do the hard work of doing that.
So step one is you promote just to get people to make sales and become customers.
You keep doing the feedback loop on those customers until you get a product where people are referring business to you.
9:29
Once you have that, then you focus on improving it even further.
And the way you do that is through serving, the customers to figure out what you can do better looking at their client experience, looking at the results seeing if you can make it happen faster.
9:45
Seeing if you can make it happen, easier, and then to add the cherry and sprinkle on top, you make it harder to leave and we make something harder to leave.
You can do that through Contracting, you can do that through.
Increasing the cost of switching.
You can do that through a Community to your services and products, you can do that through adding a cause behind your brand.
10:03
Because if they switch to somebody else, the lose the association with the cause you can do that through.
Making sure that you've added so much value.
That there's no one else that they can compare your product to.
And if you're in a B2B situation, you want to add in collateral or controlling, the money flow.
10:18
So what I mean by that is if you are, if you work with stripe, they probably process your money.
They control the money flow.
They don't worry about decline cards because they collect your money for you up front.
Right?
The person controls the money, has leveraged.
So the three steps of scaling, the business number one, you have to promote it and you promote it so that you get the first C, which is consumption if people don't consume your product, people don't consume, you serve it.
10:43
It's not that they're numb nuts.
It means that you suck, means you have created such a difficult experience, for someone to interact with, you made it.
So difficult for someone to on board that they never even experienced the benefit, the amount of people that I hear, especially in the, in the Internet space were like, oh, these people don't work hard.
10:58
They The follow-through is Amazon, complain about all the service tickets, they get no, because they fixed the product, so you don't need to have a big customer support line.
Weird.
Right, because they spent the time to keep solving problem.
11:15
After problem.
After problem, until there were almost no problems left with the product.
The second piece that everyone misses is that actual Improvement Loop.
And so what happens is when their business gets hard when they hit a plateau, Though when people can't grow anymore, they do one of two things.
11:32
They start marketing more, which is crazy because it means that more people find out about the stuff that you saw that sucks.
And they tell more people that it sucks, or they create another product because the first product sucked people stopped buying it.
So they create another product.
How many people how many interviews has so many gurus?
11:49
How many personalities have you seen launch product after product, after product to come up with a new thing?
And they launched come up with a new thing and they launched it come out with a new thing and they launched it.
Why are they not still selling the first thing?
Because it sucked and rather doing the hard work of getting the feedback collecting the - emails and rather than blaming their customers taking full responsibility and saying, you know what?
12:13
We can make this better and focusing on the better, not the new.
Because what happens is, if you actually focus on one product for an extended period of time and you launch it again and again and you have first version, second version, third version, fourth version, it gets better and it gets better to such a degree.
12:31
Imagine a world where 10 years from now you'd only worked on improving the same service.
How good do you think it would be probably very but that's boring.
And that's why most people report.
It's not exciting, but it is how you build a fortune.
12:48
And then once you crack that, once you say, I'm only going to sell so that I make sales to get customers.
I'm going to continue to improve and iterate the same product over and over and over again, the same service over and over and over again.
Until the point where I have so many people are coming to me because of how good it is.
13:05
Then I'll put gas on it and spend as much money as I can on the market.
Because now I can outspend everyone because in, Say Marketplace.
I'm making ten times a hundred times more than my competitors.
Because when people buy for me, they don't want to stop because after all price, is what you pay values, what you get.
13:24
And so what we want is a customer Surplus.
We want an insane deal.
We want to bargain that people do call ahead of time to make sure that they never stop getting built.
So for example, if you wanted to buy my house, right?
It's not about the price in an absolute term, it's all relative to the value that someone receives.
13:41
So if someone's prices here in the valley, You delivers here, you can make this price whatever you want.
If this price is a million and they get 10 million in value, they will pay you for it.
And so the game is saying hey I've got a five hundred thousand dollar house, I'll sell it to you for 50 Grand and I learned how to build it for 10.
13:58
That's the game we're trying to play and so even if you provide more value upfront and it's less profitable, that's okay.
Because then through the iterations that you have of getting better, you get more and more efficient.
You can drive down your costs while also, increasing the value.
And maintaining your brand and reputation, but most people do it in reverse.
14:15
They sell as many product many as they possibly can burn all the Goodwill they have and then come out with another product, put a lot of hype around it, sell a bunch of them and then do it again and again.
But they cannot build a compounding vehicle of Enterprise Value.
Because if every single Watch if every single customer that they had sold for the last ten years, we're still paying them today.
14:36
They would have more money than I know what to do with.
And this lesson took me seven years to really internalize because when I looked back at my own customer list and I saw five thousand locations on there.
I was like, I would have a billion dollar business.
If I had taken more time up front, to figure out how to never lose people and then it would have gone, it would have gotten so big by default.








0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there, Chick-fil-A makes more money than McDonald's, Starbucks, and Subway combined, and their first day in business, they made $50.
0:27
And today, they make over 5.
Billion.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
0:43
Please, share and enjoy.
I love Chick-fil-A, I love their sandwiches.
I love their desserts.
I love their milkshakes.
I love their waffle fries.
I love their sauces.
I love their tenders.
But what I love even more than that is their business and what you can learn from Estrella Kathy, the founder who started it 76 years ago, as of today, when he was 25 years old in Georgia.
1:06
And so one of the things that I love the most about this business, is the perspective that he took.
So, think about how many people you see on Instagram.
We're talking about their side hustles in there and they're like six businesses.
They got open.
This man sold chicken sandwiches for 76.
Well, he died eight years ago, so he sold them for 68th Street years of his life.
1:26
We weren't even more important fact, the sales of the company have never gone down year to year.
They have literally only gone up and to the right for seventy six straight years, eight of those years.
After he died showing how much he built an Enterprise to stay and live on past him, because I talk a lot about the difference being Reason missionaries mercenaries are people who are in it for the money and most people use on social media.
1:50
I would argue are in it for the money, and I don't cast any judgment on either direction.
But I will say that the people who are the missionaries who are doing it because it's a, cause they build it different.
There is no rush because they see it as a mission, that they have a problem.
They want to solve in the world and they created a business and a monetization system around it, to solve it profitably.
2:10
That's the difference in the mercenaries, the missionaries, The Mercenaries in it, for themselves, the missionaries in for the cause and so as Treecko Is one of those pure examples that he's a southern baptist hardcore.
Christian.
And so obviously his mission is lined with his faith but even the way that he built his business, we can take a lot from it.
2:25
And I the reason I idolized guys like Warren Buffett and and sto Kathy or because of their perspective.
And so I always try to think like what do they see about the world that I don't or what do I believe to be true?
That isn't as far as they see it.
And so, just to give you a couple stats about why Chick-fil-A is so badass.
2:40
As a business.
Number one, they decided to grow slower and that's crazy.
And now it's Today's world, everything has to be fast, everything has to be immediate payoff and they had different competitors that came in during their period of growth that people thought were way hotter, way sexier.
Some of you may remember, Boston Market and remember Boston Market, when they had their rotisserie chickens and the mac and cheese on stuff they took on a ton of debt grew super, super fast and then imploded, and the whole time people are like, oh, they're gonna put you out of business, they're going to like the family value chicken place, but slow and steady every year they just keep making more and then eventually Boston Market shut up.
3:16
Then shot down because he wasn't thinking on a five or ten year time Horizon.
He literally sold chicken sandwiches some time.
He was 25 till the day he died.
Think about like that, kind of focus and I love games where if you wait you in where if you just think about how can I do more tomorrow than I did today and you do that for a long enough period of Time, the numbers become crazy.
3:35
So here's some numbers for you Chick-fil-A makes more per restaurant than McDonald's Starbucks and Subway combined depending on the source and what you're looking at the man got five point two million dollars per restaurant top light, that's a hundred thousand dollars a week on average and here's what's crazier for context, McDonald's averages 2.6 million dollars per location so they do more than twice.
4:04
The sales that a McDonald's does.
But what's even crazier is their profit margins and not only do they have insane margins they do it selling a quarter, the amount of products so McDonald's has 49 products on the They have 12 and they don't integrate that menu.
4:20
The reason I love this so much is because it's so line with everything that I believe to be true.
And so I love and this probably confirmation bias, but I love having the things that I believe, build great businesses, build great businesses.
And so, they have such a refined menu because it makes the order process have fewer mistakes in.
4:38
It, it makes the drive-through process happen faster.
They're able to have less food go bad because they don't have to have all these extraneous options.
They follow Proto's principle of 80/20, they know that 20% of their stuff creates eighty percent of their sales.
And so they have all of these efficiencies in there because they're not trying to be cute.
4:54
They're trying to be the best at a handful of things and by doing that, they've been able to sell way more than anyone else does with a way more constrained menu and do it so much more profitably.
All right.
And so to give you context here, I'm almost certainly don't have any debt on the company today right now during the period of time, there's a short period of time where he took out loans to open a couple of stores himself.
5:14
I know that because I read his autobiography.
But his goal was always to keep that within reason.
And then eventually at least, when I was reading his autobiography, he said they were debt-free today, but that was obviously years ago, she's dead now.
But that was, at least the founders and what's important for everyone listening is.
I think it's the founders perspective because sometimes corporate comes in, they change things around.
5:32
But I think it's important understand the heart of the founder that built, this amazing Enterprise.
So he didn't take the debt because he didn't want to go grow fast.
He wanted to grow long.
He wanted to grow deep.
He wanted have deep roots in want to do everything, right?
Right?
The first time all the way through because he wasn't in it for the money, he was in it for the mission because if you open 10 more stores in the stores are shit, you detract from the mission.
5:54
You might boost top line or boost bottom line in the short term to hit a quarterly earnings call.
Right?
But not for the long-term issue because the quarterly earnings holes don't matter to somebody's trying to do this in such a case images for the rest of their life.
Right?
So some of the things they did one is he owns every single location?
6:11
All right.
Corporate owns all the locations.
Second they get 60 Thousand applications a year to open a Chick-fil-A.
And you have to worked while he was alive.
You have to have worked at a Chick-fil-A.
I think they loosen that up.
You cannot have necessarily work but if they're only picking point less than 1% of the people, which right now is 80 people to 100 people a year, get awarded a franchise out of 60,000.
6:34
Who do you think you have an advantage of me?
Already worked.
You hire.
Somebody didn't right.
You don't have to but majority have now they pay ten thousand dollars if they get accepted to get awarded location.
So if some skin in the game but to open up a Chick-fil-A, It cost millions of dollars.
So like it's the ten thousand dollars is more like a symbolic gesture from the franchisees and they wanted to have a career path for the super exceptional employees because he wanted to create a way for people to come in.
6:56
You know, mopping floors, flipping, burgers, going all the way up and then eventually owned their own franchise.
Here's the catch though, you own the franchise, you are an operator except you can get fired and you can't sell it and you don't get the profit.
So here's how it actually works.
7:11
So 5.2 million.
Let's just use that for round numbers.
That's 100,000 hours a week 52 weeks. 5.3 million hundred thousand dollars a week.
Now, Chick-fil-A corporate gets 15% of top-line, so fifteen thousand dollars every week, gets clipped straight to corporate.
That's what they get off.
Top-line 15% in the food business.
7:27
I got to look at Subway's numbers, but I'm pretty sure they were, like, 12 percent net margins.
So, the royalty.
If they were in an inferior, franchisor inferior business would be the entirety of the Prophet, but because their stores are so darn profitable.
They can do it this way.
So 15 percent of top line goes to corporate then they have the Mortgage that gets paid off through release from the store to corporate because the corporate owns the building and the dirt that it's on, right?
7:53
So they also have the real estate play that's built into the business.
And then after doing all that stuff, because that's also making corporate money, there's profit left over now.
You're like, okay, so that goes to the franchisee half of that, profit still goes to corporate, but what ends up happening is that the actual franchisees make somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 to 250 thousand issue year, it changes every year, inflation itself, Somewhere in that neighborhood.
8:17
And so if you're somebody who comes in mopping floors, you have the potential.
If you're exceptional to someday, be able to make 200 to 250 thousand year, operating your own Chick-fil-A location, which I think is awesome, super cool, American Dream story.
Anybody can come and do it just if you work hard etcetera.
8:33
So to put this in context there, 15% royalty Subway's.
Net earnings is seven and a half percent so they're royalty on Top Line.
This is like if you're not familiar with like the food business or Or brick-and-mortar chains, anything like that. 15% of Top Line in the food business is twice of the entire thing of subways profit.
8:53
That's how profitable these stores are, all right.
Like, that's why this is so crazy, so they can take 15%.
Then they have the mortgage unless that's getting paid off by the store.
And then they split the remaining profits 50/50 with the store operator, they print money.
9:09
And the beautiful thing is that they actually have compounding vehicle of wealth within their business, which, by the way, one of the things like that, Probably don't know about me is that we open for Brick and Mortar locations per month.
At acquisition, not come between our portfolio companies.
So a lot of people know that but that's like a big part of what we do.
9:26
And so one of the things that I like with the business is that you have a cache learning machine, but you also want a cash reinvestment machine, so it's two sides of this.
And so one of the cool things about brick-and-mortar that a lot of people don't appreciate is that you have a high return on Capital if you have a good business model.
9:44
And so like there's there's a big business that I'm looking at investing in right now for another deal that's like this.
But if I can find a business that gets 50, 100, 150 percent Returns on Capital, you're like, that's crazy.
It happens every day.
If you have a business model that works point is, let's say that you've got a store that generates two hundred thousand dollars a year in profit.
10:06
And let's say it cost.
You 200 thousand dollars a year, open this door.
Okay, let's just keep math simple.
Every year, you can double now the first You open one.
New location, doesn't sound.
You have to her a next year.
You can open for locations.
10:22
Hooray next year, eight next year 16.
You know how this doubling happens after you do it 10 times, you have 1,000, right?
It's a lot that's 1,000 new openings.
Okay, it's a lot and the thing is is that that takes time to do now, if you're following along will happen quickly, is that the operation constraint of opening locations will become the constrain of the business.
10:41
Not the return on Capital itself.
I've because just because you can't open a thousand locations.
Doesn't mean that you can open a thousand locations right in terms of the money.
And so one of the beautiful things though is that when you have a business like that, it's actually very tax efficient because you can keep the money at the C Corp redeploy, within the business in a way that is reliable and gets you, that hundred percent return.
10:59
And so, then you have a compounding vehicle of money, we talk about leverage labor, money is the second level there.
So if your business from labor creates cash that you can redeploy into the business, it compounds.
So when I'm looking at businesses, that want to earn for own for really long time, I want things that Enough themselves, some businesses don't have that many businesses don't have especially like service-based businesses is very uncommon for them to do that but brick-and-mortar chains do have that Advantage which is also one of the reasons that they become hugely valuable for private equity and things like that for buyers in the future because they love seeing a business where they can inject cash and just get huge Returns on it compared to the stock market.
11:35
There's a wonderful book called a little book that beats the market by I think Joel rosenblatt I think is his name and he simplified everything down to two metrics.
He said price-to-earnings ratio which is basically you want to buy the company.
Penny for a very cheap amount of money, relative to how much it makes price earnings ratio.
And the second one is, you want a wonderful company.
11:51
So he to find a wonderful company with a single metric, was, what is the return on Capital?
So if they put Capital into their business, what's the return on it?
And so he ran an algorithm and he still has it.
You can go check it out where he just has the top 20 companies where they have the lowest price earning ratio and the highest Returns on Capital and he buys that stock every year those those 20 every year and he gets 20% a year.
12:11
The problem is he gets 20% a year when measured over five plus years but in Short-term people can't handle the volatility, so they buy for a year, the stock goes down and they freak out.
Part of the reason, stocks will have a very low price, earnings ratio is because there's some sort of strife, there's drama.
There's negative news about it.
12:26
And so people see that, ah, no, I don't want to buy into that, and that's what makes good deals.
So, as an aside, that's one of the reasons that I also like to fly in general, is that it has both both aspects.
Now, there are 100 privately owned, they can do it if they want.
But one of the more amazing things that I haven't even mentioned yet is that they achieve these numbers twice, almost what McDonald's makes and they make more than Starbucks.
12:45
Buck's Subway and McDonald's combined in a single store.
And they're closed 52 days a year, so that may not sound like much, but think about this for a percentage standpoint if you had one out of seven days, and I would probably argue that if they were open on Sundays, they would get so much Sunday church crowd.
13:01
It would probably be a higher sales day than their normal self days.
But let's just assume it was one seventh of their sales.
But I don't think it would be but let's assume it was 17 of their self.
They could bump their sales by 13%.
And here's the thing with these types of businesses, their costs are fixed.
They have variable cost to with food but like They're in current cost of rent, Etc, insurance on the property, that whole day, and they just take the day as a loss.
13:27
So that additional 13 percent, a lot of that would be contribution, March music going to the bottom line.
So they would even further make their business more profitable.
But they've been pushed many, many times on this, why they don't do it and you can summarize into many things one is that desire is created through lack.
13:46
You only want something.
You do not have so by definition You can't always have something in order to have desire.
And so they believe that keeping it, for one day gives people this craving that they would want it more the other six days.
Number one.
Number two is that it's the culture values matter more than just about anything.
14:03
In my opinion, if they are true to the founder to the business and they operate in that way.
And I would say, the Chick-fil-A is a great example of a type of company that believes in its values, through and through, and they practice what they preach pun intended with all of their Workforce.
And if they were to say, we believe in these values, we have this Christian backing.
14:18
And then Then they were open on Sundays.
After they were to reverse it, it would seem like they were swapping their values for a little bit more money.
And so, you could make the argument that the strength of their values makes up on the other six days for what they would have made on the 7th.
Look, guys.
14:33
You guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you just leave review, but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
14:57
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
The last piece that makes them exceptional.
I think their VP of growth who was talking about this.
He said, 80% of what fast food restaurants do between each other, is the same said, but I wasn't hired here to do the same thing for the other 80% are doing.
15:17
I'm hired to do with the 20% are not doing not to just compete but to create a competitive advantage.
And so one of the things that permeates any Chick-fil-A, if you've ever been there is that they have a culture of service and so what they did was they actually study the hospitality industry and even hired people from Ten to help them create an Exquisite experience at Chick-fil-A.
15:38
And so they say things like my pleasure when they do something for you.
And here's what's crazy, the implemented.
This top-down company-wide a lot of pushback from.
If people didn't want to say my pleasure, when someone says thanks for my order, thanks for taking so much.
They say my pleasure, right?
It wasn't until the CEO himself changed his own language patterns that it then permeated through and it took years for him to realize that and he talks about it when he started saying my Pleasure.
16:03
I think it was 03.
It started to trickle its way down and so this is River 03.
So, we're talking 56 years or whatever it is from.
The time, they opened that much more efficiency has been driven into how can we improve this business?
Because if we change nothing about this business, we saw the same 12 items, you just get better and better and better.
16:22
At the same thing, they even do practice runs in an indoor arena for the drive-through to test in real world.
Scenarios to see how they can make the drive through more efficient, and increase the accuracy, that's the level of detail that Kingpins can do because they've been doing it for 70-plus years and so the biggest takeaways I see from the big companies that I try to apply to my own businesses.
16:41
What is a business that I could be in for a hundred years?
And I believe that if you only try and solve the same problem for 100 years, you could pretty darn good at solving it.
And so what happens is, especially with the younger generation in my opinion and when I say younger, I don't mean actual age.
I mean, years of Entrepreneurship is it's all about the fast Buck.
16:59
It's all about the quick thing, but when I talked to the most Successful people that I know they all talked so long because it's almost laughable to them.
They're like a decade is like, their first measuring chunk of like, okay, ten years cool.
But they're talking 2030, they're talking lifetimes.
17:16
And after Kathy lived that and then he, I mean, technically even died that right?
He took one concept a chicken sandwich which is completely commoditized.
It's a chicken sandwich and thought, how can I just do this one thing that everyone understands better than anyone else?
17:33
And he built an Empire and he built a mission behind it.
That I think millions of people are happy and frequent every day compared to their Alternatives that were just mercenaries that were just in it for the money.
And not only do they beat them at the game of customer satisfaction but at the end of the day, they also beat them in Top Line and bottom line.
17:51
And he is edged as way to now being number three and likely will become the second biggest food chain in the entire United States.
So, here are the lessons that I take away from Chick-fil-A that I've tried to apply to as many different places.
Aces in the portfolio companies that we own and even just add acquisition.com, at the holding company.
18:07
Number one, is that they sold chicken sandwiches for seventy six straight years and I don't think they're going to stop.
And so, having singular focus on the core products, and not getting cute, and not getting fancy and not having 49 menu items.
But just saying, what are the things that the most people want?
And how do I get better and better and better at doing those things because better gives you leverage.
18:26
It means the same input gets you more output and so rather than having lots of different things they have to put in put in you just put more and more.
Because you only have so much Juju like if you had two items you can only split test them half as much as you could want and so the incremental returns you get on getting this much better is where the outsized Returns come.
18:42
For example, if you think about this like an Olympic runner, the difference between first place in fourth place in the Olympics is a tenth of a second, right?
But the difference between first and fourth for a person's life massively different and so we get these outsized returns by making these marginal improvements of being better rather than being new despite our entrepreneurial desire to have.
19:03
Not a chicken sandwich.
We're like, what about tacos?
What about, what about Burgers, right?
Like, how many times could they have done something like that?
But they did it because they knew that they wanted to stick to the essential few and they knew that focus is what was going to compound over the long term.
Number one, number two, he always cast out, despite being publicly criticized for not taking on debt and not trying to grow faster and had people in the short-term talking years short-term, just for anybody who's new in the entrepreneurs face for talking, five, six seven, eight years.
19:31
Having somebody beat him.
Him publicly Boston Market and he still knew that he was a missionary not a mercenary wasn't doing it to brag about his ego.
He's doing it because he believed that this way of doing business was what he wanted to represent.
And so I think we have these values that we have in saying, I know that the likelihood that my competitors are going to be here in 70 years is almost zero.
19:53
And so if I build in a way that I'm going to be here in seven years, I will win by default.
But I think that's powerful because so many people want to see their number one.
The question is, when you look at the richest man in the world, I want to be the richest man in the world.
You got a van to somebody's answer with for how long because eventually you die and if you look historically, the number one guy doesn't sit there very long.
20:13
Somebody else comes up, right?
And so it's what are we aiming towards for him?
He wanted to build an amazing Chicken Franchise and for him.
His legacy, outlasted his life and for me, that's I mean, honestly, that's my dream.
My Hope Is that whatever we build can continue and not Only just stay alive, but grow Beyond us.
20:31
And that you can only do through a mission not through mercenary, cause because if you're just chasing the money, people get diluted out because there's always a shiny easy win that distracts from the core items.
Number three, the fact that they don't let anyone have more than one store.
I think there's a lot of wisdom to this.
20:49
So there are lots of people that I won't let me, let me open a hundred.
They're like, no, because you're not gonna be able to focus.
We want someone to put their heart and their soul into their location entry.
Like it's the wrong.
And so, I think that, if you think about each store as a business line, or a product line within a larger Corporation, right, then having people take ownership right and he has profit check.
21:10
Now mind you, it doesn't share the whole profit, but after he takes his pieces off, they have an ability to make more money and having that kind of, I'll say uncapped earning potential for somebody is very inspiring, but he keeps a constraint to a singular Focus because they know that somebody can give it their all at one location.
21:26
They've already tested.
That believe me, I'm sure they've Tried to open before.
They've learned over the years, I think there's a lot of wisdom in that we can take for own businesses.
Number for saying, no on Sundays means you have to say no to things that are obviously going to make you money but will detract from your values.
21:44
And so there are lots of opportunities in entrepreneurship and you probably have some on your docket right now that you're like, I don't know.
This is a little left of center, but like it's such an easy win but imagine the new CEO comes into Chick-fil-A tomorrow and says, you know what I found a way to make us 13 percent, more sales and have most that dropped about But what's your amazing idea?
22:00
And he's like, we're going to be open, also on Sunday, it would be such an easy play in.
Imagine how hard it is to say no, because in the beginning, he had to say no to an extra 13 percent on a million dollars to make, so nother 130,000.
But when 13% is 650 million dollars and you still say no, it means that you're appealing to a higher power, something above the money.
22:22
Now I also believe that appealing is something above the money.
Long long makes you more money, but you have to stay know.
So in the short to get the long yes, extra Kathy noted that when he wanted everybody in his team and his companies are saying my pleasure when someone said Thank you to them for doing something that it didn't change until he changed how he spoke.
22:43
And so, it's so much of the same thing.
People parents see with their kids teacher see what their students is that, like, people will learn 10 times more from watching what you do than listening to what you say like that's how humans learn when were kids we observe right?
And so if you say hey, we're About being on time here but you the CEO or late it will never work.
23:02
And so we have to pick the very few values that we know that we will never break that we will always stick with which is why values have to be true to you.
Not nice words on the wall because they have to be things that you would actually live.
Otherwise they are meaningless and so seeing that it had to come to the top down is just a continuous reminder for me that.
23:19
Like I have to be better in order for my team to be better because if my team doesn't get better, this business doesn't grow because it will only grow to my capacity.
The only way for me to get better team is to become better.
Letter.
And number six, if you want to have a business that grows even longer and bigger, you want to have a compounding vehicle built within the business.
23:40
And so Chick-fil-A has a compounding vehicle of capital within their business, whenever a store creates money, they have the cash and they can pick the next location and not only, they'd spend the money with the store, they buy the land and they buy everything itself to.
So they get the highest return and they get some tax benefits.
23:56
And so if there's ever areas in the business, That we can get some kind of compounding effect where money compounds on itself.
That is something that I always try and build an, every business that I have is, how can I get this money that, I'm that I'm getting today to make me even more tomorrow within the structure of the business, not taking the money out and putting it in stocks or putting it into just like, a random fund or whatever it is.
24:16
But actually saying, within my business wife, active control, where I get the highest returns based on my skill and my competitive advantages, I get higher returns.
And that's how these guys build Crazy.
Well, that beats the market.
Number seven, ruthless prioritization on the essential few items that they need to sell the fact that they haven't changed their menu in decades.
24:37
Should be a testament to the fact that we as entrepreneurs want to change it all the time and there's that there's a Henry Ford story that I think drives this home.
So he was looking at a marketing campaign and he had been working on it with his Executives, etc for months and months and months and three or four months in he walked past his marketing.
24:54
CMOS office and was like, hey he's like, what are we going to stop running that at?
He's like, I'm so tired of it.
And the markings have looked up to him.
He was like we haven't even read it yet.
And so the thing is, is that we have all these things that happen in our mind because we're always iterating, like we assume.
Everyone knows everything about our products.
We assume everyone's already bored of it because they're talking about chicken sandwiches, 24 hours a day.
25:11
But reality, is that most people might get Chick-fil-A once a month, right?
As a treat.
And so the customer is perception.
When we change something slowly in our mind every six months as a small business to a customer, it just feels like it's constantly changing, there's no consistency.
And so one of the things McDonald's prove which I think Chick-fil-A Learned from the lesson was that people value consistency?
25:32
People want to know that when they exchanged money they're going to get the thing that they liked last time, right?
And if you make the same thing, the same way over and over again, it also gives you the opportunity to improve it.
If you have to improve 100 things, it's a hell of a lot harder than improving to, or improving one.
And so, you've heard me say, one product, one Avatar one channel for anybody who's trying to make their first million and like each one of these stores.
25:52
If you think about them as a single business, like, that's how they're thinking right now.
Do they have drinks?
Yes, etcetera.
But like the Principle behind it.
Compared to everyone else, the marketplace, they have a quarter, the amount of things on their menu compared to McDonald's, and they make twice the money 1/4.
The options, two times, the money and probably four times the profit five times the profit.
26:11
There's wisdom there, it's how I try and think about that is like, okay, even though I could do those things should I and most times the answer is, no, I should just get better at the thing that's in front of me and confront the problem that that I have, which is how can I sell more chicken sandwiches, whatever your chicken sandwich is, And to drive even further on the focus they had even at a micro level within their core product, the chicken sandwich.
26:34
If you compare that to McDonald's Big Mac or Burger, King Whopper McDonald's.
Big nap has six ingredients, the Whopper has seven, not including the bun, Chick-fil-A, chicken sandwich, chicken Bread, Butter two pickles.
26:51
That's it.
Now compare that to Chick-fil-A's sandwich, which just has butter, pickles and chicken.
That's it.
So we even have half the ingredients on there one quarter sized menu because even then they get more efficiencies on at the ingredient level.
27:06
They make it faster and easier to prepare, so it's more consistent and they're able to do that with greater economies of scale and they can make the process itself, leaner, and faster, and leaner and faster.
And then you do that for 76 years, you become unbeatable.
So one of the things that when they were asked, why are you so limited in there in your selection?
27:21
Besides all the reasons already gave their response?
Was that every time they added another item, they just saw their sales of their main thing to client.
So, they're just splitting some sales off the thing, their core products.
It's a, how many of us have open a new thing, God people to switch from the old thing to the new thing?
27:37
And now you're doing two different things.
For the same amount of money sound, familiar happens all the time and so it takes the discipline to say.
No.
And say, we're just going to get better.








0:00
Hey guys, this was probably the best or one of the top three interviews that I have done to date.
This is with Ken Coleman on the Dave, Ramsey Network, just a wonderful interviewer and conversationalist, and I don't think we talk.
I've ever really talked about the majority of the topics on this interview, which is what made it kind of.
0:16
So, unique, we talked about the larger economy at large different opportunities that are existing right now, and I just think overall, if you get as much value out of this, as I enjoyed making it, I think you guys have dig it, enjoy.
I would rather have died.
Then let him be, right.
Right?
I could not accept an existence where I would have to come back with my tail between my legs and then I had not succeeded there, I would have basically had to become his slave for the rest of my life, the wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
0:41
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I want to talk to you about another very important topic.
0:57
I think we're probably very much in agreement and it I could gather every young person in the room and I only had one message.
This might be the message and I Matty you up and actually the date of bears, it out.
Harvard course, everybody knows Harvard.
They got the longest study ever done on relationships.
1:15
They follow people from birth to death.
So people are still in the study of the life, of course, and one of the professors who was leading the study said this, that the study proved to them with data, that is indisputable.
All that 95% of our success or failure in life.
1:34
Alex is directly related to the people.
We spend the most time with and of course, you know, you know, Jim Rohn.
Legendary motivational speaker said, you know the people you spend five people spend the most time.
So that's anecdotal as well.
But the reality is, when you think about failure in every area of our life relationally physically, emotionally mentally spiritually professionally, I mean this is so so true and yet I feel like we walk around like zombies Just doing our thing hanging with the people, we hang with and we don't take critical inventory of the people.
2:07
We spend the most time with thoughts on friends, in your life, people around you, how guarded are you?
And I don't mean like from a privacy standpoint but I mean with your time.
No.
So I am and maybe it's because I'm still young but I am pretty ruthless when it comes to the people that I have in my life.
2:27
And I tend to have a relatively contrarian View.
One relationships, which is that I do believe that all relationships are transactional at sounds hard to say, but if you never got anything positive at some point, most humans will cease to continue the relationship.
2:42
And so, if we think about human behavior, in terms of reinforcers and punishers, because those are the only two things sticks and carrots, right?
The people that we've had a longer period of time.
With, we are willing to wait a longer period of time before we are reinforced to continue to spend time with them, so we will wait longer periods of time.
Before we get another carrot, which then kicks it out again, right?
2:59
For the next, Her to come.
And so for me, when I look at the relationships that I have, I try to cut off the back side which is I don't want to make keep a relationship because I have always had it.
I don't want to give value to something because it has existed but only insofar as it will continue to add value and more so that it is aligned with where I want to go, right?
3:21
And so if I feel at least as I see them, the people were actions.
We take are either going to get us closer or further from our goals.
That is all And so I want to Stack the deck in my favor, with the most amount of people who helped me get the farthest or closest to my goals compared to other things.
3:38
And so often times, at least in my experience the higher up, I've gone on at least the material ladder of success, the fewer people can hang and it's because of maybe their skills their character traits their beliefs.
If I feel like I am overwhelmingly giving in the relationship and there are there's really not much that comes back over an extended period of time.
3:57
My time to cut the relationship has just Decreased over time.
And a lot of this, I think I read some stage of older people because I like studying elderly a lot because I think that they have some perspective.
Yes, the djinns E, I feel like y'all should you also listen to old people?
4:13
They really are.
Yeah.
But if you see a happiness curve on subjective well-being, it's actually like a smiley face.
So people are happiest when they're like 10 years old and then they go as slow and steady down where they the valley of Despair is like 45 to 55.
4:30
And then they start to come up the other side once they get into elderly and retirement age.
And one of the biggest things that they attributed it to, is that the things that relationships and circumstances that people use to deal with or suffer through, they would say they literally didn't have time for that they're like I only have 10 years left.
4:49
I don't have time for Suzie.
She's she's - she's always talking smack behind my back rather than keep this relationship.
I just make more time for the people who don't and I think that if I am going to be that Tway.
Eventually, I might, as well enjoy the benefits of making those types of decisions.
Now despite it not being in Vogue.
5:06
Yep.
Well, I think that's absolutely right.
And that's incredible.
Let me ask you this.
How would you define a person who would be called a friend of Alex?
What do they need?
What's that transaction?
Need to look like between you and them.
Yeah, a high ratio of positive exchange per unit of time.
5:24
So fancy for they need to lift you when you're around them.
That suck the life out of you.
Her the amount of time that so like if I have a relationship that I only, you know, we text once a quarter and it's always something cool or something interesting.
Very low time investment, but low positive back, but still positive, right?
5:44
So I think it's just the ratio of gotcha.
I mean, this is what you put in versus what you get out.
So, a friend would be somebody who has a high ratio of what I put in versus what I get out.
Exactly.
But but I mean, in, what would you say, your circle of close friends is right now?
What would she well, it's the number, how many, how many people if I'm hanging out with you and I'm around you 30 days and I go okay he's got three close friends.
6:04
He's got five seven ten.
What is it three?
Yeah that's that's what the data shows.
Let me ask you this, how many of those three close friends go way back more than 10 years?
That's what I thought my wife seven, if that counts no, she's your wife.
6:22
We can't yeah to okay.
Okay to and You think that that is healthy?
Would you like it to be more?
Is it just perfect?
I don't ascribe a label to it.
Good.
So, just is what it is.
6:37
It's the rhythm you're in and the pace you're running.
I enjoy the life that I have and if I had no friends and enjoy the life that I have, that I would be fine with that.
And if I had 20 friends, I would enjoy the life that I had.
So I think a lot of I think a lot of mental rest comes from ascribing a positive.
It's like the weather like is too rainy and is five sunny.
6:56
Or is it just they just are the way and this Might also be a season of my life that I'm a little bit more of a building season, and I might not have as much extracurricular time that I can allocate towards friendship.
So maybe my ratio for friends is higher now than it might be in the future.
I don't know I suspect it'll raise honestly, but and I just wanted to add one caveat to the front real friend.
7:16
Comment, I believe, just like capitalism where both people, you know, one person buys, and the other person gives a product in both.
People say thank you that in an exchange with a friend is my hope that both of us are better off.
Its not just like Alex taking Because then they would they would be justified in saying that they should I would say you shouldn't be friends with me if I'm only taking from you.
7:35
And so the hope is that at least with the relationships that I have that.
I frequent most often that the exchange makes both of us better.
Yeah, I want to go.
Let's go deeper on this because I get this call a lot on the show.
Sounds a little bit like this.
It is fun.
I'm going to TU up for what it called would be for me.
7:51
And instead of me telling you what I say, I want to know what you say, alright?
So it goes like this, Alex I've got some tension with family members and And I know what I want to do.
I know why I want to do it, but they're not very supportive and it's killing me because because it matters a lot to me.
8:09
And I'm torn my heart to do what I believe I'm supposed to do, but then my heart for my family.
It's an open.
And didn't course I dig in or do you go with that question?
So it's a first, we have to Define some terms.
So the first one is at least for me is that love is defined as what you were willing to give up to maintain something.
8:28
As I Define it.
And so for example you have a project car.
If you've ever worked on a car or something to the time, it's like man he must love that thing because he works on it forever and doesn't do anything.
Like I'm willing to incur a lots of cost before a carrot because I love something, I'm willing to sacrifice a lot in order to keep it.
8:44
So I think the question for the person would be which are you willing to sacrifice?
Are you willing to sacrifice your dreams?
Are you willing to sacrifice a certain amount of influence, your family has over them and so I think that if we can divorce like you can still have people, you can still have a relationship with people but they don't necessarily need to be the majority of your time.
9:05
And so if you have people who I like fast forwarding because I'm a big frame guy so it's like if we're 85 years from now and all the people that were in your family were older than you are now dead because they will be.
And you have not realized the dreams or even attempted to because of the fear of their judgment.
9:22
How would you feel?
Okay, scenario one scenario to you do pursue those dreams and you don't have the family at the end of your life, but you did accomplish them which one you feel better with now there is a third path which is you start pursuing the Dream.
And then they change their opinions and catch up with you, which is the vast majority of the time.
9:39
That's correct.
Because we'll be real, materialism is a real thing.
Status is a real thing.
If you kill it, they will want to, they will want you in their group.
That's right.
It's just that, oftentimes, it's the crab, the crab, in the bucket scenario where the one crab wants to get away.
9:55
And the fact that they're trying to that, you're trying to spin out of the circle of mediocrity that they are in.
You make them feel bad about themselves.
And so that bad feeling they project, On to you and it has nothing to do with you.
Yeah there's everything to do with them and so for me I'm just I am I'm ruthless in terms of what I am willing to sacrifice for my goals because I do at least in my opinion, in my world view.
10:18
If I provide enough value, I will always have access to those people.
If I desire it, I agree.
I couldn't agree more because I think what happens is, if we choose temporary disappointment of the family member, over long-term resentment well said, then I think, what's going to happen is they're going to say Say alright, I'm disappointed but I'm happy for you and just like the crab we pull them and we've got to choose that the gravitational pull that we can have on our loved ones.
10:47
Yeah, I want you to.
Yeah, go for it.
Yeah.
And I think you said it way better than I did by the way, when I when I so I did everything that my dad was, you know, told me to do.
So I finished Vanderbilt and three years, you know, with all the, all the honors and all the stuff and president of the fraternity, I was vice president powerlifting club.
11:04
Like I did, you know, I did.
The things right?
And then I got the swing key consulting job, right?
Out of college for two years.
And I remember thinking like, is this it, you know, because I was 21 at this point, I'd graduated college, I had the good job.
I had my own condo that I had bought because I'd save the money and I was looking out over the high-rises and I was like, is it just more of this is this is this it.
11:26
And I knew that I was not satisfied with the job that I wanted.
I knew that I wanted to start a business and every time that I'd gone to tell my dad, that that's what I wanted to do.
He would end up talking me off the ledge.
And saying now the, you know, we will go to business school and then you'll go, you'll go back to the management or you can go to Investment Banking.
11:42
If you want to do that and then, and then after that, you'll save some money.
And then you can start a business, right?
And it got to the point where I was so incredibly depressed that I wanted to not wake up every day.
So I would go to bed hoping that I wouldn't wake up.
And for me, many of the biggest decisions, my life have come down to life or death.
11:58
And I say that only as a decision-making filter.
Not that, you know, I was at this Crossroads but death for whatever reason is very motivating for me.
And All the the conclusion that I had to come to for me to make this move, despite my father, who had a tremendous amount of influence over me especially at a younger age was, I can either die to him or I can die to me.
12:16
Wow.
And so I knew that by leaving this path and quitting and then starting a gym which is kind of like the electrician job.
That's great.
Yeah.
Especially in the Middle Eastern world, where you can be a doctor, an account, you know, I mean me being in business was already like, kind of I was pre-med.
12:35
Really, you know, I mean, I just can't miss it.
Wait a minute.
I know desire to have his life because his plan for me was, I was gonna take a practice shot, was the whole whole deal, and it made sense on paper.
The guy makes a million bucks a year.
Yeah.
And you know, he's like you could inherit when you're 29 making million dollars urea cycle, why would you not do like and I get the argument.
12:52
Yeah, but I would have been dead inside the entire time and I would have been a prison for my whole life and so When I did make that move and this is for everybody, was looking for the happy ending.
It did make a huge Fisher, you know, our huge gap in our relationship and for years, we didn't, we barely barely spoke.
13:10
And it was only after not only that I had made more money and then made more money than he ever made was, did the did the dynamic shift one, where he respected, what I had done?
And it took probably almost a decade, you know, I mean for that to actually happen.
And so I will say that if you are going through this and you feel dead to yourself in the current existence in the current path, it will not get better.
13:30
You will only have put more time in.
Learning at, you know, burn burning time of your own life.
That is limited to fill someone else's dream and it was his dream of what he wanted for my life as it reflected on him as a parent.
Oh yeah.
And I get where he was coming from.
13:46
So it's like you can understand why they have this belief.
And then yet also disagree with it and act in according to your belief and so that, it's just it's very real for me because I went through that, it was very, very, very hard for me.
It was probably the hardest, it was the hardest issue.
14:03
Jean.
My life was disobeying my father because it was like disobeying it worse Aslam sure, who he was.
I was being disobedient, and then doing this on my own and I did show how much influence my dad had over me.
I only called him to tell him I was doing this.
14:18
When I was six dates away, I started driving.
I was in Ohio or something and I called him to tell him that I had gone and he said, hey, just come back for lunch, we'll talk it over because it was always the same thing.
Oh, you know Alexander cause that's why he called me Alexander's having one of his little fits about You know, he'll come back, I'll talk him out of.
14:34
It was like, I'm gone.
He's like, and then, then the flip switch.
Then it was like, why you gotta be?
So crazy are always, so extreme you always have to do all these things, and it stayed like that for a while.
But like at that point, then that was where the fear came from, where the fear of him being right.
And then that was the big driver for a very long time.
14:52
Was that, even when things were so hard for me, the very, because they were very difficult for me to be getting.
I just, I would rather have died.
Then let him be, right?
I could not, I could not accept an existence.
Or I would have to come back with my tail between my legs because what would have happened is if I had not succeeded there, I would have basically had to become his slave for the rest of my life.
15:11
At least that's how I saw my life playing out.
If I had not been able to make this work and so I just I just I did everything.
I just couldn't go back to that.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
15:28
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
15:51
So it's, it's a powerful motivator.
But man, it's sucked for you and parents.
I mean, I don't know who's watching this, but if you got a little one, I hope you rewind that story because I think that the parental fear can turn into a nightmare for our kids.
16:08
And luckily, for you, luckily, maybe not luck depending on your, I don't believe in luck on this situation, but the way you were wired.
It turns you into a diamond, but I just want to call out and I know this is heavy for the audience.
16:26
But there are a lot of kids that aren't wired like Alex and that can destroy their life.
You talking about big-time depression, I mean just crazy amounts of soul-crushing stuff.
So parents we got to be careful here to not Crush our kids Soul.
16:43
I'm glad it worked out for you as am I and you know, Dad love, you know, we love.
Yeah.
And by the way, let me just say, yeah, none of this is dishonoring your father because he's just as normal as every other American Can this is not a, it's not a middle eastern thing, this isn't your daddy.
16:59
This is the normal pressure.
That parents feel, and we've got a call it out, because it comes back full circle to discussion.
We had earlier about college and pushing kids into stuff.
And if there's another even wrinkle on this, I think understanding the motivation of the person who's influencing you to stay put.
17:17
Yes.
Because once you could, unlike I think Pascal said to understand is to forgive.
Yeah, that's right.
So for me when I understood that That my father.
And I had the same goals for my life.
He wanted me to be successful.
I wanted me to be successful.
It was just we wanted to get there in different ways and there's only one of us that actually has to go through it.
17:36
And so I felt like my opinion mattered more.
Hmm.
And I think that if we can delineate, those things is helpful in understanding that they are not adversaries, they actually want your best.
This is me all have talking to the kids and want your best, you know?
But sometimes into the parents, the kid also wants their own past.
17:52
Do you know what I mean?
And seem like they haven't shared with you or they're afraid to share with you And in so doing, you might actually have an incomplete picture they did.
And they did just as a fun side note, they did a survey on political beliefs between whether they're inherited.
You know, with kids and parents was funny, is that I think it was like, 45 percent of kids weren't actually sure of their parents political beliefs when they actually were asked to name them course.
18:14
And it's 75 percent of parents didn't know their kids beliefs.
And so we think that we know so much about these people that we spend all this time with and yet on the things that matter, most the harder conversations, we know very little Mmm, so true and so much, could be dealt with easier if we sat down and parents share their fears with their kids and the kids share their fears and boy, it's so good.
18:36
Alex, I recently read that 7 million American men aged 25 to 54 are not working and it's on purpose.
It's not because they were laid off or fired.
They are choosing not to work and I study this every day because I'm I'm focused on the World of work, helping people do work.
18:57
They love and then cover it from all angles.
And so there's been economist's are just scratching their head for the last two years, coming out of the pandemic, as we seen the jobs Gap, right?
Or you had right now that it's about ten point, three million jobs available posted jobs.
And then little bit over eight million unemployed and that's down from 11.
19:16
So we had this huge job Gap.
Well, now we're starting to see what's going on seven million men in America.
All right, are choosing not to work.
Now you're a numbers guy.
So we look at this and we go, okay, some of these are have done well right?
19:32
Maybe in their 40s or 50s, and their cashed out there doing, and you got someone living in their basement with Mom and Dad, right?
Some are fallen on hard times.
I mean, there's there's a big group of people here so I don't want to be too General, but the same time I don't mind telling you, I think this is a crisis, I think it's a crisis, I think it's a soul level crisis for the majority.
19:54
Of those 7 million.
Does that concern you?
When you hear that, do you have thoughts on?
Why?
You think that is the way we look at work, the way that you.
And I both believe that we were created to contribute through our work.
I believe that thoughts on that number because I was honestly, I guessed it.
20:12
Who uses that word anymore?
For all you young people that GA s PE D?
So, nolde term, right?
I emotionally was just like, whoa, seven million dudes, what are your thoughts on that?
So I think I would love to know the psychographics of the of the 7 million.
20:29
So I mean, sure, there's the retired folks, you know, who cashed out whatever, right.
And then I think there's probably a sub-camp now.
Are these people getting unemployment?
Are they just getting nothing?
They're not getting unemployment.
They are, they're just not in the system at all.
They're just like happily not working or I don't know if I could use that phrase.
20:45
I don't think that's true so that that brings up.
I would lie.
I would imagine two camps so one it because they're being supported somehow, that's right.
So they think so, It's not through government, then they're being supported by family or spouse.
That's right in the other Camp.
21:00
You've got people who are being supported by, oh, it's like probably I'll say you've got the spouse supported ones and then you've got the like family supported that you don't, that's exactly right.
Look at those two things.
I actually think that despite the fact that the stay at home dad with the breadwinning mom has a use case and then the other and and the the basement mom you know, mom's basement kid.
21:22
I actually and I'm probably A lot of flack for this, but I actually think it has.
I think it has stems all the way down to masculinity in general and how it's being redefined.
And so in, this is again, I'm not the big labeler of good or bad.
I'm just tired of saying what I, at least what I observe is that I think being a man and working and providing 30 years ago, 50 years ago were inextricably linked, huh?
21:45
Being a band and providing for your family were one and the same.
That's right.
One was a requisite for the other.
You cannot call yourself a man.
If you do not provide for your family, that narrows - has shifted.
And so, I think that in the the spouse, you know, the wife works, dad stays at home, there are Arguments for that.
22:03
I am very conservative when it comes to like, how I like to live my life with my wife etcetera.
Like, I don't imagine a world where I would not be the provider ever.
It's just and again, I had, I was raised with very conservative Midwestern values.
So like that's any to my DNA?
Good or bad, who knows?
But that's I think men in based on my experience men are built to work.
22:21
That's that that's right on the other side with Mom.
His basement, right?
I think that there's an entire subset of men who feel completely hopeless and disheartened and feel like the system is out to get them.
Now, there are, there's the other side of the aisle that says, you know, if you're a man, you're born with all of these Privileges, and bababababa, we can say whatever we want.
22:45
In my opinion, human suffering feels the same if you were the one suffering.
That's right.
And so, a 10 out of 10 pain, for one person, from being beat up by their dad versus a 10 out of 10 pain for being sexually.
23:02
Abused by an uncle.
I'm just getting real here. 10/10 still feels like 10 out of 10.
Now we can make an argument that maybe just being physically abused getting beat up versus being sexually, abused.
Its you'd rather be physically abused if you had the pick, right?
23:20
But I think in terms of how humans experience reality pain is pain and so we like to objectify things and quantify them but I think that for that subset they still feel like they are being told all the time that they have these Advantage advantages and yet Yet aren't succeeding.
23:38
And so it's easier for the ego to say.
I'm not going to try because at least now I'm not failing.
That's exactly right?
And so I think a lot of people have opted out because the pain of failure is too great for them and because they feel like the chips are stacked against them, and they feel their self-esteem is Rock Bottom because they can't keep promises to themselves.
23:57
And so they continue to perpetuate that I do.
Think it's a massive problem, and I think that again, as contrary as this is, I think, I think guys, specially younger guys, need a lot of help and I think, A lot of anger do.
And I think that like, the proliferation of like entertaining, some of those types of characters, I think that what they did was they give a voice to some of that disenfranchised group.
24:17
It wasn't like, eliminating tape doesn't eliminate the root, which is that, a lot of men, feel emasculated they feel disrespected and to be are they are not worthy of respect because they have not done anything respectable.
And so, it's a bit of a Chicken and the Egg problem, but like, someone needs to start the flame to say, like, if you want the respect, Act.
24:36
You have to do the stuff that gets you it as much as we could say.
I wish the world gave unconditional love, I wish the world gave unconditional respect, it doesn't work that way.
And so at the lamenting, the way the world is, we can see it for what it is and then play Within those those boundaries, I think you and I are probably both big on personal responsibility, right?
24:54
So I don't want to in any way confuse but I want to address what you said, Alex was, I think you're right.
But I think a lot of the problem lies on the first and second floor, not the kid and not the Not the grown-up kid in the basement, on his screens, getting the dopamine.
25:10
And I think what's happened is that we have Bubble wrapped our kids to the point where the fear of failure is actually way worse than the failure itself.
So there was a little study that said that it takes about 20 hours to become.
You get the most amount of gains in a new skill.
25:27
In the first, 20 hours learning at you, want to learn the guitar, you are saying you want to cold call first, 20 hours, you get by percentage of skill acquisition, you get the most in that first 20.
The problem is that people wait years to start the first ask correct because they're so afraid of that of the pain of not being good enough because they expect for everything to be easy.
25:44
And I think it circles back to what we said at the very beginning to, I mean in that to me is the crisis and certainly you you addressed a lot of issues, it's not all one thing.
But my goodness I think it it's not popular.
Say what you said anymore, I'm glad you said it.
But there is inherently in a man, a craving men and women are different and I don't think that's controversial to say But there's a craving, there's a craving in a man to to go do something.
26:11
And, and so, we're seeing a lot of this now.
We're they've never been pushed it ever been challenged to do anything and it's a big scary world out there and as a.
So I study a lot of human behavior stuff because I think it's really interesting.
Just remote Workforce is persuading, Etc.
And so, I have the belief that all humans are addicted, everyone's addicted, the questions or tweeted to.
26:31
And so, like, I am addicted to the dopamine, Rush that I get, or the serotonin, whatever from Um, lots of grit and then pay off, right?
So II know, I understand that cycle.
Well and so I'd like to play it as many times as I can.
I think that with some of this this 7 million that you're talking about, they have they also have an addiction, but they got addicted to something that was not pro-social, was not / work.
26:54
And so, to your point about the, the video games in the basement, they are addicted to that and they do get dopamine.
They do get there in a way.
That is superior to anything that happens, the real world and it's being enabled by the parents.
Continue to subsidize that addiction.
Yeah, so true.
27:09
Wow, good stuff there.
All right, I want to give you the final word here, just a fun question.
I love to ask a lot of my guest, right?
Who's your how would you describe your demographic your core audience?
What would you say?
They are probably 25 to 35 year old.
27:26
Yeah, they all right, that's that's nice.
Yeah, that's certainly mine on YouTube which is YouTube in general.
So let's say you're talking every 25 to 35 year old dude in the world.
All right.
Got the loudspeaker, maybe you got the old classic you know, horn and you're talking to him.
One message only want from your guts today.
27:45
What do you tell them, You must pick a goal and do so much work that it would be unreasonable for you not to succeed that if you were to look back, having done an amount of work that it would be virtually impossible for you to fail.
28:03
That you said I did that and I can promise you that, if you do that level of work that volume of activity, over an extended period of time, and to quote, Neil Strauss without thinking you're smarter than you are, you will probably get there in half the time, but you have to start, you have to start that first hour and not we could wait a decade to get there.








0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I'm telling you, if you actually actually look at and most people get anxiety.
So they avoid the things that they don't like, you got to confront it, you're like I'm fucking poor.
I don't want to be poor.
And so I'm going to look at this money until eventually.
0:41
It starts paying attention back to me because money sticks to the person who pays it the most attention.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
1:00
I hope you share and enjoy.
When I was a wee lad a young man, I lived on $1500 a month and believe it or not during that period of time while splitting room sleeping on the floor.
With another dude, I was taking about fifteen twenty thousand dollars a month.
1:15
And the reason that I live like that is because hey, I'm incredibly risk-averse, but be because I wanted to have money to go on the offensive later and it was never about the lifestyle that I wanted to prove now because for me, maybe 20 grand a month, was never an amount of money that I wanted to brag about or feel like I had made it for me.
I wanted to shoot really, really Big.
1:32
And so this was only stuff that was going to be stepping stones for me to achieve what I wanted to later.
And so there are three big costs to living, okay?
And so, what I want to do is I'm going to break down how he's able to live for so cheap.
And this is for all the single guys.
All the single ladies, all the people, and if you can live with your parents, even better for me, somebody would have died.
1:49
And so it was for the best that I didn't have to live at home.
But this is what I actually did in order to live a fifteen hundred dollars a month or less.
And I did that eating out every day.
Alright, so we're going to talk about that.
We're going to talk about how I treat to.
Or how I did living all of that good stuff so that you can go on the offense later when you have money that has been stacked up.
2:08
All right, let's rock and roll.
If you don't know how many shocks Mosey own acquisition.com, its portfolio of companies is it Fortuna million dollars a year and I've nothing to sell you.
I make these because I want you to make shitloads of money and make a big company so that someday we can partner together and take it to a hundred dollars and Beyond cool.
So, big picture.
2:24
Number one cost of human beings is food.
All right?
Not in terms of total money.
But in terms of how important it is, For you to stay alive.
So you gotta eat the next thing after eating.
You got to get places.
The third thing is you got to have somewhere to get back to.
All right?
2:39
So, let's break down each of those.
And those in reverse order of cost, typically are actually fuck it.
All right?
There's three big cost centers.
You got Transportation, you got living, and you got food.
All right.
Those are the big cost centers for can break down what I did for those things, and I did that while eating out.
2:54
So food-wise some guys have seen Mosey meals meal hacks.
The things that I do at these chain restaurants and Did it that way?
Because I don't like cooking, and I wanted to have more time to make money and so, it made more financial sense for me to not take eight hours on a Sunday to go grocery shopping and prep.
3:11
All my food versus me getting Chipotle twice a day, which is what I did.
All right?
And at the time, then it was closer to about $15 a day.
If you were to say today, it's probably closer to 20 bucks a day.
When I was doing it, you do that 30 days in a row six, hundred dollars a month.
3:26
All right?
And you're like, you didn't do that every day.
We I sure did.
All right.
Now, that being said, you can also go to Panda Express, which has a phenomenal 110 g of protein hack that you can get for I think under $10 today that we actually went and filmed ourselves getting and that was with extra chicken so you could have 200 grams of protein every day.
3:44
Value stack was off the hook recommend it third best option is Chick-fil-A is one of my favorites.
They are on the pricier side, but if you want, you can just go with two 20 packs of chicken nuggets and getting close to 12 bucks, which is a shitload of meat or two sandwiches.
3:59
Either way you'll end up in that tent.
Of dollar range and you'll be at that 600 $700 a month range and if you're like huh, did he really do that?
I sure did.
That's all I did.
I pick between Chick-fil-A Panda Express and chipotle, that's what I lived on.
So much to this point.
That Layla didn't know that we were going on dates, but for me these were the fine establishments that I was frequently on a regular basis.
4:20
They knew me by name and they knew that I knew how to work the menu.
So first step was Mosey meals and that for me time to money-wise was worth it.
All right so I could have because I measured this when I would go to the grocery store and I'll get all the The fixings on stuff.
I spent a hundred dollars in a week and I ended up spending almost $600 a month as a single guy when I went grocery shopping and did all the prep and all the clean versus me just running or running out next door, grabbing the food eating it and heading back and was a nice mental break for me.
4:45
Cool.
So number one, I ate cheap.
And as crazy as this may seem, it is easier to figure out how to get all of your calories in based on eating out, stuff ahead of time.
All right, so if you as it easier not cheaper, Want to do the absolute cheapest route.
5:02
Which I'll tell you right now is loaves of bread.
Peanut butter cheapest thing in the world.
All right?
Like, if you need calories loaves, of bread, peanut butter, and if you really want to make sure that you're covering your bases, get a multivitamin.
All right?
If you've got that, you can do that and you can live on it if you want to add a third Staple in there.
5:18
You can add Lactaid milk.
If you're dairy, dairy sensitive, you'll get your protein, your carbs.
You get your fat in and I'm sad.
If you want to be extreme on it, you can be extreme.
You could probably knock that down to a hundred dollars a month, so that's the range.
But for me, I They want to live on peanut butter sandwiches.
I did eat them when I was trying to bulk up, but I did those in addition to my normal calorie intake.
5:37
And to that degree, you might want to do one of those mozi meals.
And then do peanut butter and milk is the other one which is a nice cheap in between.
So number one, and the reason we're doing this, the reason this is so important is that you got to know how to live cheap, so that you can go offensive with the cash that you have.
So you can save up to build a business.
5:54
You want.
So that more realistically.
So you can invest in the skills and the experience that are going to make you money.
All right?
So number one is food.
To is transportation.
This is where mozi mobiles came in.
All right now if you're thinking, huh, why there's all these ends?
Well, it turns out there's lots of Em's when it comes to mobiles meals and mansions.
6:12
All right, so lots of apps that we're going to cover today.
So from the mobile standpoint, the most efficient way to own a vehicle is to purchase it in cash.
A used vehicle that is ideally between five and ten years old.
So if you look on any place in America right now, today, you can find a used four door vehicle that is between.
6:31
In five and ten years old for ten thousand dollars, all right?
And to use parking lot.
Now, the reason this is important is that you don't have car payments, all right, so then the only thing you really have to manage his car insurance which is not too expensive.
And here's the cool part.
The cheaper your car.
Let's the insurance.
All right, because they don't have to shirt too much.
6:48
So if you are young and you are living on $600 a month for Mosey meals and you live on a hundred dollars a month, after you've made your one-time Capital expensive actually, getting the car which I recommend doing a, not taking loan for it.
Then all you have is your It's in your Chateau where you going to rest your head at night, but I'll tell you exactly what I did.
7:05
So I lived in Southern California when of one of if not the most expensive markets in the United States, I was in, I was in Costa Mesa was where I lived and after I slept on the floor of my gym which is the first place which technically was Zero, but at the same time it was 5,000 a month because it was my actual rent for my business.
7:23
I then really splurged and at I think month four or five or six or whatever it was.
I ended up having a member at my gym say, are you?
Really sleeping here.
I said, I sure am and he allowed me to after another member was having me sleep at their place for free.
7:39
Obviously able to move from the free place to my own glaze which is really in quotes here because we split a single bedroom in a seven-bedroom house and guess what?
Every other bedroom had a couple.
And there were three dogs in the house.
7:56
So my roommate had a dog, another couple had a dog, and another couple had a dog.
And one of the cup, Two dogs, and they were both big.
So there was marking of territory.
They were shit and piss in the house every day, fucking horrible.
And I lived there and he and I were roommates, not housemates roommates.
8:15
And I had one mattress that I got off Craigslist and put on the floor because I didn't want to buy bedding and do want to buy for.
I bought, you know, sheets, but I didn't want to buy furniture and I want to buy one of those stands or anything.
And so, I had a fan next to my face because it's really loud by the way.
So you can not have to hear what someone else.
8:31
Else is doing is used to snore inside of fan on my face and you all here is The Fan Wind around you and also wake up with dry shit eyes and that was it.
I would wake up, I'd go to work and I worked all day and I would come back at night cuz I didn't need anything fancy.
And so my rent, their our rent for that room in Costa Mesa.
8:48
Come of this was expensive place, was $800 a month that was what we had to split for that room and so I my half was 400 bucks a month.
And so I had my, my rent, for my mozi mention all the ladies love I'm kidding.
I know ladies.
But now my priority the time was I had my mozi meals for 600, 700 bucks a month between Chick-fil-A Panda, Express and chipotle.
9:11
And then I had my Mosey Mansion which was $400 a month me splitting with a roommate and if you're like, man, couldn't you've opted for the extra $400 a month, I probably sure could but I was obsessed about living with as little as almost became a game.
To me was how little money can I spend, which highly recommend sidenote.
9:27
Brain hack if you can get competitive with yourself at how little All you can spend recommend recommend heavily one of the other hacks that Dave Ramsey has that.
I'm a huge fan of is taking out the amount of money that you're gonna spend for the entire month, putting in your wallet and leaving it there and then I would pay my rent.
9:44
I would go to the to buy food every day.
Pay that and then the insurance came out of a card which is like 100 bucks or whatever it was.
And so between those three things because you notice that even mentioned a car payment.
So I've really never had car payments because I've always bought every vehicle I've had in cash.
Always and so here we are.
10:01
And so Big three for living for fifteen hundred dollars, a month or less.
It's number one, you got your 600 or $700 a month Mosey meal plan.
You got your number two, you got your vehicle that you saved up for and then bought in cash and then we have $100 a month of insurance.
You got to pay for slip bump that to 700.
All right?
10:16
And then you've got your rent, which is 400 500.
Now if you're in like North Carolina or you're in Boise, Idaho, or you're in Wisconsin or something, you can probably get a room for four hundred dollars a month without having to split it.
But if you really want to, like dial in, and You're in a better Market, which big picture here, I would recommend you go to the place where shit's happening, not just like that extra two hundred four hundred dollars a month that you'd spend to be in an area where shit like things are going on and people are doing things with their lives to get out of your area of the world where nothing's happening and your friends are still in the same place and your parents don't encourage you.
10:51
And think this internet shit is weird and to tell you to stop watching videos on YouTube to trying to like better yourself and just tell you to get a job, whatever it is like if you want to get out of that environment, it is worth the Two hundred to four hundred dollars a month hardcore.
So to be clear, I still think like there are exchanges in price and value, it is worth it there.
11:08
But for me, the added benefit of having one versus two for half the price was worth it for me to split it.
Now, once we have that, now we can go on the offensive.
And so if you have that car and this is a big one, all right?
This is big.
If you are making less than 60 to 70,000 a year, this is a there's a lot of the audience right now.
11:27
If you're making less than sixty seventy thousand a year, I don't understand why you wouldn't take that car that you saved up for, that's got four doors.
It's 15 years or younger right?
In terms of car years and has no visible damage on it.
If you got those three check marks you can drive.
Uber, I still to this day don't understand why you would not like if you're below that and you're just trying to stack cash right now.
11:50
It is the most flexible job, you can make money immediately.
There's no risk.
Besides the actual vehicle itself.
You can work, whatever hours.
You want, you can do it on separate apps.
And when I say whatever hours, I said there's flexibility.
But also how many hours you want you work?
12 hours a day if you feel like it.
And I've told this before, but my plan B was always strip at night drive, Uber during the day, And I'm dead serious, because I knew that for my plan B.
12:15
If my plan a didn't work, that's what I could fall back on and knowing that I was living on 1,500 bucks a month or less after taxes.
I could in a year spend 20, make another 200, have you know, whatever one something saved up after taxes.
12:30
So I could go on the offensive again.
And what happens is if you know that you live on cheap and this is a big one if you know it doesn't cost you much to live.
Your risk tolerance goes up because Don't have other shit to worry about.
So what happens is and this is the real cost of the shit that you can't afford or shouldn't be affording right now is that you're paying for the car, but you're sacrificing your dreams, you're paying for the neighborhood, you're paying for, for the way the house looks, right?
12:57
You're paying for going out with the boys at the club, right?
Buying a table, getting bottle service, buying girls drinks, right?
All of a sudden, boom, 100 bucks, boom, 200 bucks a night.
Like what just happened, I was half my rent, right?
Is that the cost of those things?
Things is that?
13:13
Now your lifestyle is higher and so you're actually less offensive.
You become less dangerous because it's very hard to fight.
Someone who has nothing to lose and it's very hard to fight someone who can live on.
Nothing because everything you have goes, boom, trading your net worth so you can go on the offensive later, all right?
13:29
And so if we had to pick between living on ten thousand dollars a month and making ten thousand dollars a month or living on fifteen hundred dollars a month and then spending the spread.
If you spend five thousand dollars a month, three thousand dollars a month.
Dollars a month on your education so that you can increase your earning capacity.
13:46
It's hard to be stopped.
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
14:01
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, So, one of the things that I used to play with this game, I had of like, how can I spend the least money is one.
You can either go to Dave Ramsey style, right?
14:18
Which is don't buy shit.
You can't afford, don't go into debt to take out the cash.
You're going to spend every month and then don't spend more than that period.
That's it.
That's all you got.
The other way of doing this is getting competitive with your bank account, alright?
And so one of the habits that I highly encourage you to do.
Is it every morning?
What's the first thing you check?
14:33
Is it Instagram?
Is it YouTube is your texts.
I will tell you the first thing that I checked the mornings.
When I was in this period of my life, was my bank account.
Every day, I wake up and I'll check my bank account and what happens when you do that, is you develop this muscle of kind of this understanding of the money flow, right?
14:49
And right now, depending on where you're at, it might be uneventful to check your bank account every day, but if I can give you a habit, that will make you a lot of money, it's just like weight loss.
So believe it or not, if you get on a scale every day and you're trying to lose weight and you don't do jack shit.
But you literally just get on the scale, everyday people lose weight drawing and putting awareness to the problem or the thing that you're trying to change improves it, if you're in a business and you want sales to go up, Start tracking everything.
15:17
If you just start reporting publicly on clothes rates and put a leaderboard up sales go up you want to start reporting on Connection rates how quickly people talk to other people how quickly it's get followed up on guess what happens?
It gets faster right the moment you start putting attention to it, the moment you start tracking the moment start improving.
So if you want to improve your money situation you got to check it.
15:34
You got to look at it every day.
And the first thing in the day, priority means it is happening.
Prior, it's more important, right?
So you wake up, you make money a priority, you check your Bank at every day.
You start get a pulse on what's going in and what's going on?
What's going on?
What's going out?
15:49
You can't saw the fucking subscriptions that, you know, you shouldn't be doing right, you cancel all those because, hey, that extra time that you're consuming, these other things, you should be putting into education.
You know that if you're not happy with where you're at, these are the changes you make.
All right?
So with the game of money in the bank account, the idea is you look at all of the pluses that go in.
16:09
You look at all the minuses and next month, you try and make that column.
Go up and that column go down.
You keep running that.
And I promise you, if you actually look at your bank account, every single day, even for 90 days, 90 days, you will be amazed at what goes in there.
You're like, ha, I didn't even know.
16:25
I still have that app.
Oh, there was an app I signed up for a year ago.
That just did an annual billing, right?
Oh shoot, I should have canceled.
I'm telling you if you actually look at and most people get anxiety and so they avoid the things that they don't like, you got to confront it, you're like I'm fucking poor.
16:40
I don't want to be poor.
And so I'm going to look at this money until eventually.
It starts paying attention back to me because money sticks to the person who pays it the most attention because I promise you this is how the economy Works.
Think about the think about money is water.
All right.
Money flows.
16:57
All right, it's constantly emotion, but there are grooves in the economy that flow to the few.
So it rains and then it flows into the reservoirs and it rains and then flows into the reservoirs and then these reservoirs get bigger and bigger and they sprinkle little bit back in and then it flows it's the way capitalism works.
17:14
Because You spend money at Walmart, every Walmart in America, is Flowing money.
Back to the Walden's.
Right, you go on Amazon.
You buy something from by something someone else, but everything, flows, money back to Bezos, right?
And so the idea is those guys paid more attention to the money early on, and then the money pays them attention back, the person into parties, who pays the most attention is where the money ends up.
17:38
And so it starts by tracking it.
And let me tell you a good stupid idea that you should not do.
If you're one of these people who wants to credit card hack, right?
He wants it.
Like I get two percent here and I get 1% here and I get 3 percent here.
You're focusing on the wrong fucking percentage side.
17:55
All right, you're focused on the 2% and not the 98 percent, which is where you're spending, got some money, all right?
So recommendation, use debit cards, all right?
Forget about the points because the thing is, is even subconsciously.
If you feel like you can give yourself an excuse because you're getting points on it, you can try and make the argument to me, I'm not going to buy it.
18:13
Well, I'm going to spend all the same amount.
I was going to before I'm just gonna get 1% back.
I don't buy it.
If you're trying to be financially disciplined just fucking be disciplined.
I promise.
You think about this from a human behavior standpoint.
You want to punish bad behavior with yourself as quickly as possible.
And you want to reward good behavior as fast as possible.
18:29
So you do more of it.
That's why you check the bank account every day.
So you start seeing it, go up and you get this little ticker, it goes up.
And if you really want to be a g about it, this is how I did it.
You check your bank account and you have a Google sheet on your phone, all right?
And every day I'd put my balance in And I had a trach just day number day, number day number and you start to know when checks hit when deposits that you start to predict these days you.
18:53
Oh you know what tomorrow I think I've got I got to check hitting and I'm I'm about you know a third higher than I was to choose days ago at the same time of the month.
Boom, you sure heading bank account PRS and if you can start getting addicted to kidding, personal records in your bank account like if I can give you the one gift of this is to gamify it and I will tell you one less That the people who make the most money all have in common, they think about money as a game and she got to start small.
19:22
Got to start playing one, $1 hands, two dollars, and you guys start playing the game and the best way to do that is early on.
So track two things you check your bank account and you put it in.
And what's nice there is that you can start seeing long-term trends and I'll tell you this much, when I would look at that Trend I got a tremendous amount of Good Feeling, I would look at it be like I fucking did that and every month you get a little bit bigger It'll bit bigger a little bit bigger and you start feeling progress for the sacrifices that you make every day.
19:49
Because you look at where you're at this month versus last month and you see progress.
So I get asked a lot about the income to spending ratio and I believe it or not, never had one.
And that's because I just try to maximize both sides and that might sound crazy.
20:06
And some people like to present that works for you.
Awesome.
But for me, it was, how can I hack the game to spend as little as humanly possible period?
And then how can I hack the other side of the game make as much money as I possibly can.
And that was the game I played so rather than saying like, you know what?
20:21
I'm gonna give myself 20 percent of my income to Bubba.
Bubba, I just save every dollar that was at Food, Transportation living.
So, I think the easiest thing to do is to connect with people online join communities, join disk or groups, join Facebook groups, whatever it is, and then try and figure out where there are pockets of them because people people congregate and so you can find pockets of people that have similar goals to you and get around them.
20:47
That was the Game when I like, literally, every move for the first few years of, my career was only to be around people.
So I knew when I was going somewhere who I was trying to be around, so when I moved from Baltimore to California, I was trying to be around San bakhtiar because he was the guy that I was going to Mentor under, so I move cross-country's.
21:05
Anyway, I had someone there and I figured he could make an inch and he did.
He introduce me another person that kind of shows me other people.
And so, as long as you're a person who's going to hustle and people see it, people will open doors for you.
So when I was in SoCal, I moved from SoCal.
To Puerto Rico briefly because I thought that was going to do the tax thing.
21:21
I've made a video about tax stuff, different thing of what I learned about, not doing that but that was what I wanted.
There's people there in Puerto Rico that I was going to be around and I wanted the tax situation from there.
We move to Irvine and then Albuquerque New Mexico because I had people there that I wanted to learn from and be around and I didn't know anyone else besides this one couple.
21:41
Right.
And so with each of these moves there was a Target person that I wanted to get around and I wasn't being a creep about it, but I knew I was like, okay, maybe if I see them once or twice In a month.
If you just say, hey, do you know anybody else who lives in this area and this is where, like now world's even more connected than it was a decade ago.
21:56
And so you're in these Pockets, you're in these communities are in these discs or groups.
Just be like, yo, I'm looking at moving where y'all at and people like people start sounding off and then you'll see start seeing pockets and believe it or not, people do coagulate, they congregate around the epicenters, you'll see a lot in SoCal.
You see a lot in Miami, you'll see a lot of New York, lot of Chicago.
22:13
Right.
And a big thing here is that, if you see Rich is not the same as SoCal.
Rich is not the same as New York, rich.
And so what happens is your, your standard of Excellence raises?
22:30
And so, in some ways you feel worse about yourself, but to the same degree, it shows you what's possible.
And so some people flip that into NV, right?
Which is not the recommendation.
My recommendation is to use that as inspiration.
You're like it is possible.
They're made of the same flesh and bone as I am.
22:47
So therefore I can't 2, and when you get around people like that, they start talking a different time, increments and different money increments.
So, if the people you're hanging out with her talking terms of weeks, talking terms of paychecks, talking, in terms of $100 thousand dollar Investments, you got to be talking to people were talking about 100,000 or baskets.
23:03
We're talking about years, talk about decades, right?
Like you can judge how wealthy people will be by how they talk about how they allocate resources, time and money and the increments that they measure those in.
And I'll put one final point on this.
Is that I've moved a lot faster in life through handshakes instead of hacks.
23:22
All right like it's who who introduced me an open way more doors than any whatever did.
And so getting around the who a lot of times it's hard to measure.
But when I look at all the big deals that I've done in my life, it's all been one or two degrees connect from people that I met randomly.
23:38
And so this is one recommendation that I have for you.
And it's something that I would say that I've been pretty good at in this was Leila's, at least told me is that number one rule that I have with networking is don't turn down the first invite.
All right, so if you connect with somebody at a thing that's like, hey, let's grab dinner.
If you make that first one happened, the likely that you end up staying friends and connecting is significantly higher.
23:56
If you can't, if you turn down the first invite the likely, it shows that you're not as interested and then they also turned on your counter invite and it becomes this whole thing.
And I'm just saying, like, one big move is just make it work on the first invite, all right?
The second piece of advice that I have for you is that when you go to that meeting, whatever you want to call it, meet up, hang out, whatever.
24:17
Do some prep work.
All right, do 30 minutes of research, on the person you're going to meet with and try to bring something valuable to the table.
Now, it might be your skill and you just apply to them.
And this is think this is a fucking hack my life, alright?
For helping people is no one wants a free patio, all right?
24:36
So the story of the free patio is like, hey, you got a buddy who builds patios, you don't have a patio, you have a couple people bid for your buddy's like, hey, I'll build it for you, right?
And so he says he'll do it for free and you say, sure.
Cool.
I'll say Some money.
The other guy said they can do it in four weeks.
He starts taking four weeks and it's you know, a third of the way down.
24:53
He saw him working some other jobs will be around to work on it later this weekend and now it's eight weeks and it's still, you know, halfway done.
And at 12 weeks they start to fucking hate the guy, right?
And so the thing is, is that if you want to do somebody a favor, if you really want them to take it as a favor, blow them away, make them feel awkward for the amount of work that you did.
25:13
And if you've never had this experience, I can promise you.
I've been on the receiving end and it is uncomfortable.
That's a good uncomfortable.
Someone's like fuck.
I owe this guy something, because in the nice thing about this is that you just provide value, you go in and you don't just try a little bit of value.
You actually do what a full scope project would be, for whatever it is that you're good at and you just set it up for the dude or you've spent a whole day walking them through how you do this stuff.
25:36
You're like, well how do you find the time for that?
You work all the time.
That's how you do it.
This is work and it's investing in the long-term relationships that your pay dividends later and that means wait, does that mean that I'm going to give to somebody?
And I might not get anything back.
Yes.
Yes.
Did you say want to be an entrepreneur and make the world a better place?
25:54
That's what it looks like on a micro level because the ultimate leverage that you can have in a relationship is not needing anything back.
And if you do that, you can be the guy that stacks iou's.
And then when you do need to make your move because you are going to do the next thing.
Then you've got all these blank checks ready to cash in and then that is how you can Propel yourself away faster and you just load the deck early when you don't need anything.
26:18
A thing, the time to dig the well is not when you're thirsty, but when you have enough water so that when you are thirsty, it's there.
A thing, the time to dig the well is not when you're thirsty, but when you have enough water so that when you are thirsty, it's there.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
One of the big things with identity is the labels that we say about ourselves.
I am I am impatient.
I am angry.
I am whatever and people in your past, have the identity that they know you as and then they will speak and they will beat that label at you because you're not matching their pattern.
0:42
Why have you changed?
You are xur why and you're trying to not be that because you're doing something different than changing your growing.
Welcome to the game where we talked about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
0:59
I always wished besos musk and Buffett a document to their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I have shed friends, basically every season of my life, and so I think about my life in, in three to five years seasons, and so the seasons of my life have gone from first, I was a high school womanizer for the most part, like externally.
1:22
And then I was also like really deeply angry for my, kind of like Teenage into 19 ish, like 15 and 19.
That was like that 3 to 5-year season.
And then I had my come to Jesus, where my dad was like, Hey, you suck as Human, you have terrible reputation.
Maybe you should stop being who you are, which I took to heart, and I cleaned up my ACT, I stopped drinking nearly as much as I was, I stopped, you know, being the womanizer that I was at the time I started going to school and and and studying 12 hours a day, and then I became president of fraternity and started moving up in status and that way and that was my college season, right?
1:56
That's the lesson that I learned in that season and I had College friends, and then when I left college, and I had high school friends, that when I left High School, I Ali stopping in contact with them and then when I left College, I pretty much stopped in contact with anyone that I went to college with.
Real talk.
2:13
You were like, how'd you do that?
Here's The Tell-Tale sign for me about Affinity right?
The amount you like or love someone is directly proportional which were willing to give up to maintain the relationship and so it is the easiest and best decision that I know to explain love.
2:30
And so, for example, if there's a piece of shit car, right?
You work on it all the time.
You might say that guy must really love it because of how much time you put into a thing, right?
This guy must really love his country because he's willing to give his life for it.
What are you willing to give in exchange right to maintain the relationship, right?
2:48
Right.
And so oftentimes, we say these things like I really love my parents so much, but I'm not willing to drive an hour to see them.
Do you love them that much?
I know it's socially acceptable or not acceptable to say that you don't love your parents.
But if you define how much you love them because love is in binary.
3:04
It's not, yes, or no, it's how much do you love them?
If you're not willing to give up basically anything to maintain the relationship.
Then how much do you love them?
Not interested right now.
They may be willing to give their lives for you because they love you more than you love them and that's biologic.
3:19
It's okay, it's biology.
But I'm just saying when you think with this contract, I think it's been a very helpful filter for me to say not.
Do I love my friends but which friends do I love the most, which friends am I willing to sacrifice the most to keep the relationship, right?
And I am a big believer in utility.
3:36
Which is, there is an exchange in every relationship, you get something, and they get something back, part of the strength of the relationship is, how willing, how long you're willing to wait for the next time that relationship is reinforced.
So if you have a long history of great reinforcements or positive experiences with a person, you're willing to wait a longer period of time if they're going through a breakup.
3:56
They're having a hard time to keep the relationship going, right?
But at some point, even if you've been friends with somebody for 10 years, if there's just not any positive reinforcement.
You were willing to sacrifice less for the relationship.
And so then you stop it.
If you just meet somebody, your willingness to delay when you get a positive reinforcement, when that person is very low, it's very low.
4:18
If you're not pretty quickly in the in the conversation, getting some positive reinforcement, get some positive vibes, get some value, then you'll just exit, right?
And so the longer you're with somebody, the more you've had positive experiences with them, the longer you willing to wait between positive experiences.
And so, if that's why you're willing to go through along with a, Who's going through a hard time because you have so many positives that you're waiting to get back to.
4:41
But at some point you do cut it off.
Because how long are you willing to wait for this person?
Pull them up.
Interesting and so for me as I was going through my entrepreneurial seasons for the most part because my goal is shifted.
So dramatically between Seasons, many of the people I had around me a weren't willing to pay the price that I was willing to pay for the things that I wanted but also wanted me to give them more than I was willing to.
5:05
And so I'll give you a Three that will paint me in a bad light and that's fine.
So, I've told a story about there was a teacher that I grew up with, in high school and he is the one who stayed with me after school for a year and worked out with me two hours a day and you taught me how to work out and that obviously has been, you know, something that I was able to get.
5:22
I got in shape, got more confidence from there.
I got you know, better at school from there that snowballed into me getting the fitness from there.
That's know.
Like, it was a huge Catalyst Snowball, right?
And so, somebody heard that story and then found the teacher and A linked us and I didn't ask them to do that because I already had chosen not to maintain that relationship and the reason was because as time went on he was like, hey man, I'm not asking for a lot.
5:47
I would love to just have like a 2-hour quality every week.
I was like to our call every week was like I don't even talk to my mother that much.
I'll talk to anyway that much talk to my wife that's it.
In that moment, I was like I'm not willing to make that trade like this relationship because to be fair for me, the value of the relationship was in the past.
6:04
Maybe like Alex, you're a horrible person and that's possible.
Maybe I am, but to me, I was not willing to give two hours a week, 100 hours a year for the rest of my life, to pay a debt for somebody worked out with me and I can appreciate what it gave me, but to the same degree, I might have already just who's going to start working out anyways, right?
6:24
And so, we get into this weird indebtedness thing and I just, I think you have one life and a lot of times we maintain these relationships because of social norms and my only encouragement is that I have been willing to shirk.
Or shed relationships faster than most.
And that is because I believe that a lot of growth comes through elimination.
6:41
It comes through pruning the tree because we only have so much Juju.
We only have so much time with so much Focus, so much energy that we can pour into things.
And a lot of people don't like, people talk about like energy vampires, and it makes it paints an ugly way, but it's really Just Energy, distractors.
6:58
It's just, you have this much activity that can happen and you want it to be directionally aligned.
And if you're not walking 100, putting all All your energy in One Direction, it's scattered and then you don't move this fast.
And so for me, I wanted to always surround myself with the people who wanted the same things as me and we're ideally a little ahead of me.
7:15
And so if all the friends that I had, I had achieve more than than my relationship shifted because I had nothing to gain from them.
They had everything to gain from me.
Now you can make the argument that there's other things.
I have one friend that I've been friends with some middle school but the exchange they have is different.
I'm not trying to get value from business with him.
7:32
When we hang out it is purely an unplugged for me and Is the value.
Now, the amount that we hang out once a year, maybe?
And I mean, I get, there may be a text, you change every quarter.
And so some people like well that's not a friend.
Well, it's because your definition of friend of mine definition for under different.
7:49
For me, it's somebody that I positive sense in board, that I'm willing to keep that conversation going.
That is what I'm willing to endure to maintain the relationship, which I don't do with many people and so for me, that's worth it.
My closest friend, I spend one hour a week with every week, my closest friend like clockwork.
8:05
It's my highest part.
A meeting, I mean with him because it is something that brings me joy and we get lots of exchange with one of their.
He's the one who helps you write.
My books are Kashi and so I get a lot from them.
Now, if I didn't get anything from that over time, I'd be willing.
I would slow, slow, down the communication between us.
8:20
I would make it every other week once a month, right?
I start shortening the times and then eventually it will get faded out.
And that's how a lot of these things have.
Now a lot of people are afraid of having that confrontation, right?
And I would say big picture most times you don't need to have it because most people aren't interpersonally aware and if you slow down your communication, So someone and how frequently you see them, and when you accept invitations, it naturally Fizzles, right?
8:41
Just big picture for like how do I get out of it?
That's how you get out of it.
But if you get to a point where it's someone's like so close that, it would be obvious in a conversation needs to be had.
I encourage you to just have it and because you want to be a kind person, and the way you are kind, is that you tell the truth, right?
8:57
It's not by shirking, It Is by just saying straight up because you may have a shot at getting them to realize that they're not on the path that they wanted to be on because you were friends with them at some point.
Point.
And so either your goals have changed or theirs.
And so if you make them aware of the fact that either your goals have changed or yours have it in, there's have, they might not even realize that it has because their plan, you know, a recreational dodgeball league and they, you know, they go to the Sunday with the boys and they drink their beers, you know, and they're in the fantasy league, and they're doing the stuff and I'm saying, there's nothing wrong with that, but I don't want to be the 99.
9:31
And so most people that I'm friends with see me now and her like, he's a maniac, I would never want to live that way.
I even got accosted by a family member who is like, I would never want your life and I was like, and I would never want yours.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
9:51
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com, forward slash leads it, so free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out.
10:15
Out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And so being willing to take people out of my life and I've been very direct about it.
And to the point we were talking about earlier, one of the reasons that I cut people out sooner than most is because I do not like the labels they speak over me.
10:38
And so one of the big things with identity is the labels that we say about ourselves.
I am X, I am impatient, I am angry.
I am whatever, right?
I am poor.
I don't like saying it.
Right?
And people in your past have the identity that They know you as and then they will speak and they will beat that label at you because you're not matching their pattern.
10:59
Why have you changed?
You RX U Ry and you're trying to not be that because you're doing something different than changing your growing but they see it as change.
And that's why the best response in the world to someone who says, hey, you've changed is a yeah.
You have it deep shit, right?
11:16
It's a spiritual process is like an emotional process of going through this, but you have to choose the labels that you want of yourself.
And you want to surround yourself with people who encourage the labels that you want to be, right?
Because the identity shift, the character traits shift is not a binary.
11:33
It's not.
Are you honest or dishonest?
Are you angry?
Are you patient, whatever it is.
It's how patient are you?
How kind are you?
How loyal are you how honest are you?
And so you want people who are voting in that voting machine on this side, so that the balance starts to shift from patient to impatient, right?
11:51
And people encourage you in the behaviors that you Want to be like, but if someone only tells you the stories, when you got fucked up and what you did, that stupid thing they're encouraging and retelling the story of who used to be and you want people around you who don't believe the lies you used to tell about yourself.
12:08
And so for me my close circle is always been very very small but it's because I also feel like I grow really quickly because I don't hold onto things long like is the moment.
Thing doesn't provide me value.
12:24
I shut it.
And a lot of people probably disagree with that, and that's cool.
Like I you disagreed, but that is how I have lived, my life and it has served me well.
And so I have been reinforced with that behavior and so I continue to do it.
And so in each season, I basically make new friends, I joined new communities, I meet new people.
12:45
I learned everything I can and as long as those people are going to the same place, I'm gone.
We're right in side, by side the whole way, and that's my hope.
Hope is that the people that I meet now are trying to go all the way with me, and it's funny.
I was talking to a very big, very, very big influencer.
13:01
And I was telling him about what I wanted to do, how to get how we're gonna get to a billion, how can I get 10 billion Etc?
And he was like, no one thinks big.
He's like, no one wants to do epic shit and I was like, yeah, I feel you man.
And so the increment that your friends talk about and times in money, time and money are the increment that you will talk about time and money in.
13:19
If you're there talk about making a thousand dollar investment, you're going to start thinking in thousand, It's when if you want to be surrounded by people talk about million or a hundred million dollar Investments, then you got to get in those circles.
Now, how do you earn your way?
Well, you get in when you're a little bit below and then you absorb everything you can and you execute you actually execute then you see who's going with you and then once that rubber band starts to stretch where you're too high, you change out.
13:40
A lot of people don't like that but that's how I've lived my life.
And so for me I've wanted to live a rare life and so I will have to be surrounded by real people.
And real people are by definition rare.
They're not common and so it makes sense.
I would have to shift the people that surround me and it's only the romantic story that we were told of friends for life, Etc.
14:00
But if you talk to eighty five year olds, they will tell you the the friends they've had throughout their lives with the majority of them being friends for convenience.
They were next-door neighbors, they were whatever, right?
But with the interconnectivity we have now with the internet we can find those rare friends more easily but if you die with one good friend or two, good friends like you've had a really good life.
14:18
So I think those people change and for me, I don't I don't Regret the seasons that I've had with someone but I just see them as Seasons.
So for the people were like, well, your hometown homies, always have your back, right?
No, not necessarily give you 100 examples of people who haven't had your back.
14:36
You know what I mean?
And it's cool that you guys have whatever.
That is the question is, is that going to last forever and how many challenges have come up to that, right?
Because it's not.
Do they have your back?
It's how much do they have your back and will they have your back forever?
And what have you back now?
14:53
But when they have a wife and two kids and a job, ah, obviously they're not willing to train as much to maintain their relationship.
So then that means they love you less so maybe they won't do it forever.
And so maybe you're just holding on to something that is fictitious.
Your mind that Disney sold you that is very, very, very rare.
15:09
Not saying it doesn't happen.
I'm just saying, it's very unlikely and so I think they might have your back.
Now, in this circumstance, it's like at a bar with a guide, like shoves you and leg up my homies.
Have my Back, that's not saying much like there are strangers will jump in to stop a fight to defend somebody.
15:28
So, is that really saying anything?
I don't know.
I don't think so for me, that's not enough.
So right now, you your Mo Z Nation, you're in it, you think long you want to develop the skills, you want to build a company, that's a great company, that delivers great value to people.
15:44
That's a good place to work that encourages others.
The steps of doing that is that you have to be willing to Have hard conversations.
I think Tim Ferriss said, this is like the, the speed that you go through.
Life is the speed with which you can have hard conversations or the number of hard conversations you can have and I wholeheartedly agree which means either you Fade Out people or you have to confront the people and you just be honest.
16:04
And the easiest way that I can tell you to be honest is you know, when you talk about somebody behind their back, what you'd say, just say it to them.
So yes, a been like all over the place lately and she's like, I don't drink it a little bit too much and not sure if I want to associate that Sandra, you've been all over the place lately.
16:20
You've been drinking a little bit too much, I'm just not sure if I want to associate with that right now.
So either you got to change or we got a, got a separate or distance ourselves for a while.
While you're going through this, you just say to that people don't have the balls to do that, but if you do that, I promise, you either have better relationships or you'll be done with this Mickey Mouse bullshit of not even being in a real relationship and not wanting to confront reality.
16:39
So just have the hard combo and be interviewed.
And once you have the vacuum of friends because you'll probably have weeded people out, then the best thing to do is join communities, right?
And then you'll make friends people in those communities who have the same goals as you.
And then if you crush it, because you understand, that volume is, the answer in time is the ingredient then you're going to rise in that community and you'll gain more status.
17:01
And you'll start hanging out with people who are the top of that community.
And then you can LeapFrog into other communities.
It's just lunch tables on steroids.
It's what it is.
You sit with the people that are trying to do the same thing as you and then once They know they're only talking about football, and you want to start talking about colleges, then you switch the tables talking about colleges, you have to figure out what you want because you need a lens through which to make all your decisions.
17:20
So you can't say, I want to cut these friends because they are going to help me get where I'm going because you don't know where you're going.
So there's that an old Indian saying that's if you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there and so we also know that many times you don't know where you're going, it'll take you somewhere that you don't want to go.
17:39
And so I think she's getting really clear on what it is.
You want now.
Thing is that, that can change, like, that's the big people think that, like, the thing that they pick is the goal has to be impermanent.
Now, I will say this, the longer you can have the same goal, the more of your life you directionally aligned in.
17:54
One way, the more compounding works in your favor every time you switch career paths, you start at zero again.
Now, you still have the experience in the skills so you want to build on that but not totally start at 0.
So that's kind of the Nuance there.
You know?
I mean, if you go from publishing Books and Music to making a book music publishing thing, those are both additive, but if you go from book publishing a mortgage sales it's like okay that's a bit of a shift and so ideally don't want to start at zero and always build but the goal can change the way I like to articulate it is that it's not that the gold changed.
18:22
You got clearer or more refined a great one of understanding what you want is not even being crystal clear on what it is but just being directional.
So it's like well I want this more than that.
I want this more than that, and so you don't have to be perfect.
You want to be, right?
18:38
You just have to know like, well, I want to make money.
Okay.
Well these activities don't make me money so then I'll do more of these things.
And then when you're in that you're like, okay, I like building stuff more than it's like cool then your engineering products, code Etc.
You're like I like being on camera more then your more promotion, marketing whatever and then you're in there and you're like, okay I like being on camera but I don't like being public.
19:00
So it's like okay.
Well then why don't we talk about sales or it's like Like, doing that, but I don't like talking to people individually then, let's talk about promotion, right?
So like, you just start weaving your way in, because I think, like, intelligent design.
Only happens in retrospect, right?
We'd only looks like an intelligent path when we describe it in arrears, right?
19:19
And so, I think, if you give yourself permission to just say, all I have to know is which one I want more, and then just keep choosing between Moore's.
You'll get to where you're trying to go rather than try to pick the perfect spot because you don't have enough information to make the right call.
So it's more about just do directionally choosing getting going on the paths and then with each step, the next PATH becomes the.
19:38
Next step in the path becomes a little bit more illuminated.
And then you can pivot your way to where you ultimately want to go which is through time and repetition.
So people will judge you on how you spend their time and their, judgments are simply Expressions that they would not spend their time the same way you do.
19:53
And then you say, obviously, because we're not the same people and so what feels like an insult is really just a statement of fact, hey you work a lot.
I could say, hey, you don't the only reason that there's any emotional charge there is because of the Judgment, we label on that statement.
20:11
And so to the same degree, it's like you spend so much time with your kids, right?
If I say like that really wait?
No, I'm supposed to it's only the supposed to this.
The thing that gives all the emotional charge, these conversations.
Otherwise it's just observing reality which is one person might spend more time with their kids.
One person might not now people then say, hey well when I'm 85, I'm not going to, you know, want the career growth I had.
20:32
I'm going to wish that I had my family.
Family there.
Now if you really want to get heady about it, how much of your life are you alive and if you only regret this moment compared to all of this was that the wrong call really want to get deep on it, right.
But you could also come from the perspective of like I have more context here and I can look back on my entire life and see what I enjoyed.
20:49
But for me I want to do epic shit and I if I die and don't do epic shit.
I will be bugged.
And so I'm willing to make that trade and I've had conversation My Future Self about what I'm doing right now.
He's cool with it.
You get it.
So That's how I weed through those Waters.
21:07
I think that people don't like the idea that relationships are transactional, but they are and transactional just has a commercial vibe to it, but if we just think about it as from a behavior standpoint, you've got two things that can happen.
Behavior is reinforced or it is punished that's it.
21:24
And so when you have it you have exchanges quite literally with people.
Those exchanges are either reinforced or they're punished that's it.
And so the Stating the original question, which is, would I regret cutting off relationships?
Which punished me?
21:41
No, not at all.
Would I be okay with the fact that there are relationships that were reinforced positively for a period of time, and then the positive to negative ratio shifted, and at that point, I cut it.
Now, because I could see that as I got the best part of that relationship.
22:01
And if I were to keep that relationship for the next 30 Years, I probably hate that person.
So I get to have all the good memories and we got to have our trees inner interweave for a period, a season and not forever.
And I think it's because humans want to live forever and it's like a deep human desires.
22:17
So we don't want to die.
And so because of that, we checked project that onto everything we want everything to be in permanent families forever, not really And your bloodline diluted in fucking 100 Generations so is it?
I don't know.
We're all family here because if you go back a hundred Generations, right?
22:35
It's far fewer people so we are family so but do you feel that way now?
No.
Hmm interesting.
So I like to think of things in Seasons which is this person and the thing is is I can honor our relationship and say like he was a homie of mine and not think less of him because it no longer made sense.
22:54
Just like, this is a perfect example, at least.
This is how I see past relationships, every past relationship that I've had romantically, I've got nothing but love for the person I want.
I genuinely just want the best for them because they shared a period of my life with me.
And so, just because I'm not seeing them anymore, doesn't mean that I don't that I don't wish them.
23:15
Well, I want them to succeed and I heard this quote, I think it was a Tupac quote which is like just because we're no longer friends doesn't mean, I don't want you to eat it, just means I don't want you at my table.
Oh and so that's how I see it.
You know what I mean?
Like I want them to do.
Well.
It's just like they would better be served with people who want the same things to them.
23:33
Right in the same way to relate romantic relationship.
One person's like I want to stay home.
The other person's like I want to work unless they both want that and doesn't make sense and that's okay.
If someone's like I want to have kids, it's a non-negotiable and they love and they absolutely loved each other.
The other person says, I absolutely don't have kids.
It's non-negotiable then.
23:49
They were not willing to give up something to keep their relationship.
If it's truly an honor to go shovel, then it's a non-negotiable.
And so, does it mean the other person's bad?
No means they want different things and so no one at the end of my life.
If I have many, many friends over different seasons.
I'm totally cool with that because I just got to rock with people who wanted to rock the same way I did for That season.
24:10
And if things changed in their Lobby, they got married and have kids and they don't want the same things anymore in terms of what they're willing to trade their time for cool.
Thank you for that season.
It was awesome, loved it, just like pro football players.
They can look back at Seasons with players that they were on the same team as and then they switch teams sound like they want them to break their leg.
24:27
They just think back about the time.
They got to play together and that was a great time.
And I will take that to my grave when I'm 85, but I don't believe things need to be forever to be good.








0:00
I was thinking about my 85 year old self and I know that that man, looking back at me today, would trade everything.
He has to be 32 again, and not only just 32, again, he be 32 and picking up trash having nothing.
I know that I would trade all my wealth to do that the wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
0:18
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
Oi.
I have been looking forward to this interview for a few weeks, mutual friends of ours, that turned me on.
0:36
To Alex said, you need to get with this young man and get them on your show.
And then when I dove into is content in his work, I was blown away.
He is brilliant.
I don't say that very often introduced people, I think he's probably got one of the highest IQs of anybody I've ever had on the show and his content as it relates to personal success and particularly entrepreneurship is very unique, very special, very detailed.
0:59
And I wish we had three hours today like other I said because we could we could use that entire three hours and still have a bunch of time and stuff left over.
I was so impressed with you am I wanting to all of his content and I said can you be here next week?
Like one week from now anybody up on there and then he looked I think was your anniversary.
Yes, it's so I gave him a reprieve for a couple weeks and now he's here today.
1:17
You guys, this is like you're on the treadmill, you're gonna start running faster than you normally run and you're gonna want to get to a notepad to.
So here we go.
Let's just dive into all your stuff.
We're going to go all over the place.
You know, this really unique definition of even what opportunity is in it up Itself that I've never heard before.
1:32
So how would you define, like just the term?
And the, the concept of opportunity.
So something that I was analyzing a lot because we get lots of entrepreneurs who are like, hey, what should I do with my life, Etc?
And when I look at how my income has increased, you know, throughout my career, a lot of times, it wasn't a function of the work ethic in the beginning, you have to work, right?
1:52
But then the next big lever on that is the opportunity.
And so, if you think about any kind of output in a system as volume times, Which equals output the work has to start.
So you have to have something to multiply, which is the effort.
And then the next is, is that leverage?
2:09
And So, within the context of a business, I tried to Define it for myself, which was how many potential units of the product.
Can I sell?
And then what is the gross margin potential of the product that I'm trying to sell and then what are the competitive Dynamics within the marketplace?
2:27
And so an example of something that has two of the three and not necessarily all three would be Be like if I want to get it to telecommunications.
So I said, okay, I hate that.
I have no service.
Like I want to solve this problem and so I would say well everybody needs phone stuff.
So huge, huge potential Market.
The gross margins on an additional user is almost 100%.
2:46
So, okay, really attractive.
But then what are the competitive Dynamics?
Oh, I would have a really hard time entering into this Marketplace because it's super capital-intensive etcetera.
It's like okay, so maybe the opportunity in now.
We rewind the clock, 50, 60 years. 80 years and that was the opportunity, right?
3:04
Because you had all three of the Dynamics.
But then you look at newer things like crypto, you look at, you know, the Cannabis industry which is still nascent and those were a lot of people smoke weed or want to, you know, be involved in that industry or participate in consuming it, right?
There's great margins, especially if you're vertically integrated, with within the space and the competitive Dynamics are still like, you can still be a new entrant and have a huge amount of market share as its continuing to grow back.
3:31
Faster than the rest of the marketplace as well.
So there's a fast-growing Market that's growing faster.
So, if you just stayed the same as the market, you're still going to outpace anybody else really good.
And there's fewer people taking it up and so it's like you have to to competitive Dynamic kind of like Trail winds behind you.
And so when I looked at like we exited our three companies last year like okay I want to be really really selective about what opportunity we pursue.
3:54
Because I know that, you know, Warren Buffett's like one of my big heroes and he talks about how it's much more about not about how hard You, bro.
But about What boat you're in and he tells the story about how he had a companion who is basically the same as him and they both split off from Columbia and he became Warren Buffett.
The other guy just had a normal career in the steel business different opportunity.
4:14
And so I think being selected about the opportunity to pursue is probably the greatest leverage point you have on your career if you're in the middle of one.
So this is really interesting topic.
I was thinking about driving in here today.
I want to ask you some of the stuff like, your take on it and by the way, or take is very similar.
But I think this is an interesting time where perhaps you should be evaluating your boat.
4:31
You just keep rowing.
Yeah, they just keep rowing because you're so far in your like I'm 70% of the way down the road here.
I'll just row harder but I'm wondering about looking at that boat two things on it.
One should someone that's really laser focus.
Should they even look up and evaluate the boat?
4:47
And to what about these times?
You spoke about Buffett, had this great talk a few weeks ago about inflation and about maybe what your boat should or shouldn't look like in high inflationary times which were clearly in now.
So does inflation impact any of what you've described in terms.
Evaluating the boat or what you do with it, OT, two components.
5:04
So first would be someone's timeline and so if they're like five years from retirement, it doesn't really make sense.
You should seek out the compounding.
Returns you have of the 30 years that you put into whatever it is we're not.
Should that would be, you know, if I were in that insides, what I would do if you can think in longer cycles and you have 12 entrepreneurial Cycles left then if you get the opportunity cost starts to really weigh it, we're like, okay.
5:26
Well I might not make as much next year, but three years from now, I could be making five times as much.
Am I willing to give up two years of earning to make five times more three years from now?
And then set myself up for the rest of that time.
The younger you are, in my opinion, the more you should be taking those types of bets and then within inflationary period, This is, you know, Uncle Warren speaking, but you want to have things that are have low Capital expenses, so you don't need to add new equipment, new facilities, in order to expand whatever business you're in, and then you want it to be things that produce lots of cash flow.
5:56
And so, if you have something that's high, cash flow has low Capital expenses.
When you're growing in an inflationary period, you can adjust the prices very easily.
And when you make those adjustments, it drop straight to bottom line rather than having to, then go back, buy more equipment to which now has eaten up that additional cash flow.
Yeah.
See, I totally agree with you, by the way, this Idea right now of you know scalability which were going to talk about in a minute to by the way, when he says young people, when you're listening to this man speak he's 32 years old.
6:22
And so there's two things about you when your brains really big and too.
You have a wisdom far beyond your years.
My sense is that that has a little bit.
Do you do with your relationship with your dad which we might get into later?
And the other is just vast amount of experiences you've crammed into basically or 10 years or so post-college right?
6:39
One of the things you've been pretty good at doing though is using leverage and leverage to Most people typically means borrowing money from other people, but you Define leverage freaking brilliantly.
So, talk a little bit about what real Leverage is, and the way you define it.
So Leverage is the difference between the inputs and outputs in a system.
6:57
It's the discrepancy between what you put in and what you get out.
So if I have a lot of leverage than it means, if I put a little bit in, I get a lot out five low leverage.
I have to put a lot in to get a little bit out if I'm working at a froyo shop, I have to put a lot of time and you get a very little amount of money.
7:13
I very low leverage, if I put a deal together, right?
And I make a couple phone calls and then that deal yields me 10 million dollars from connecting parties and then maybe underwriting something all of a sudden.
That's a lot of Leverage.
So I put a very little bit of time in.
I get a lot of money and so the idea of using more, leverages looking at what my inputs and outputs are and figuring out how I can create bigger and bigger discrepancies between those are there different types of Leverage other than just money?
7:39
Yes, which are so anything that Increases your output, okay?
Without per unit of effort is leverage and so that can happen in the physical space.
So like a literal lever is increases your leverage.
If I take this, we take this podcast and you put it on YouTube that was leverage because we put the same input in but then we get more output.
8:00
If I have a cold calling system and I'm able to Now dial 10 phone numbers per minute because I have a dialer that's doing outbound.
I have more leverage per unit time if I take a form of And then I transcribe it and then I also make an audio version that is leverage.
8:19
So all of those are different versions of just getting more out for what you put in hard question.
So I let's, let's, let's dig deep.
I'm an entrepreneur, I'm listen to, this doesn't matter.
I can even be self-employed.
I sell life insurance.
I'm a mortgage broker.
I mean, real estate.
I've got to cannabis business.
I got six.
8:34
People were there for me and I now kind of get from listening to this dude and listening to Ed regularly.
Like this idea of Leverage is what successful and wealthy people do right.
They do it.
It better than other people.
This is a really big deal.
Everybody listening to this right now.
They do this better than you.
They understand the concept of this better than you and to the extent that you can understand it.
8:53
And most importantly, apply it is where you make a shift.
So it's a hard question because you've answered it but I want to push you order on this.
If I have any type of business right now and I'm evaluated the concept then you've described here.
How do I apply it?
What do I look at in terms of buttons?
9:09
I could push to get more leverage.
Yeah, so no vote, count is really good.
Job of defining, his four types of Leverage.
Now within those, I described a lot of different leverage around one which is Media, right?
But you have leverage on labor which is you buy other people's time so that is the first version of Leverage.
9:24
So is there something that I'm currently doing that?
I can pay someone else to do to gain time back and then use the excess time.
I have to make up the difference.
So if I can pay someone $10 an hour and I know that I can make $50 an hour on the phone selling, then I can pay somebody to do any of my tasks for $10 and then I make up the time selling.
9:40
Stay on that.
Brilliant.
We're gonna go to the other three.
I Stay on that.
This is something I struggled with Young.
I don't know if you did.
When I was young.
I did have a lot of capital, I used to think, no, I'll just I will do these things because I can't afford the expenditure right now.
You were you ever that way when you were young and business?
9:55
I was totally.
I just held on a up because I'm like, I had the scarcity idea that this may be the two thousand dollars a month.
It keeps me in business yet, it was the very thing that kept me in the small business that I had.
I think they're, I mean, you got to work double time.
I have there's no real sexy answer that I have for that which is just like you have to work the normal amount.
10:13
Wood to make Germany and then you work again to make someone else's money and that's in the beginning.
So it's like, I'm making my job and I'm making someone else's job so that can buy that time that I used to work to pay someone else to then, make more money in that period of time.
Really.
And the big thing that I think a lot of guys because I on the flip side of The Entrepreneur Space, the influencer whatever space people always talked about, buying your time back, but that they don't talk about what you do with the time you bought back.
10:34
So if you just buy your time back and don't do anything, you're going to make less money like just want to be clear but because I had an entrepreneur who's talking like I bought all my time back.
He's like but I'm really not making it was like you're not Not doing anything but you still need to work.
You just got to Now work on higher, leverage opportunities, more dollars per time.
So in that it that input is my time.
10:50
My output is my money, so it's a higher leverage varying with time.
What are the other three?
So you got labor, which is the, which is the most operationally, complex, and heavy of the of the types of Leverage.
The next one is capital if you can raise money, leverage other Pete.
That's the one that you know, the mortgage brokers that are they're more familiar with real estate guys because if I don't have to put any money up, and I can buy something and then I can sell it for more money that I get to make the difference between those two things.
11:13
And I used it on some on basically someone else took the time to earn the money and then they just gave me that time.
If you think of money as a tradable unit of time that I got to borrow and then make the difference on something, the third one and I think three and four kind of go hand in hand but it's you've got software.
11:31
Sure code and then media so code is just you know you write code and it takes you one time investment to get the thing to do something and then every additional time.
So the input was the time I took to build once and then every additional In uses software gets a benefit from it.
I get it almost no incremental cost and so that's leverage.
11:48
And then with the media side, we, you know, said it earlier if it takes the amount of time for us, to make this one podcast, if one person listens to this or million people, listen to this.
It's the same amount of effort.
Yeah.
Hey, Moe is an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
12:06
All right.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
I told you guys when I introduce them to this be stuff you not heard before.
12:24
So it is there's another type of Leverage and I really related to this.
I'm 20 years further down the road than you on some of these things by very much relate to some of the things you talked about.
Obviously, you have this relationship with your dad.
Maybe we'll go there but that you were just trying to prove him wrong all the time because it's something in one of your quotes.
12:42
You said, I found out later that I was constantly trying to prove a fictitious person.
Wrong meaning the Type of Leverage that I got on myself when I was young.
Yeah, I'm gonna prove them wrong.
I'm not, I'm wrong.
I was like this.
I mean, I think the best way to describe me as an early entrepreneur was a little bit angry.
13:01
And I leveraged intensity.
Yeah, I leveraged anger.
I actually leveraged fear of losing to this fictitious person of them being, right?
And I, by the way, some of that, probably served me really, really well.
But I don't know that it was healthy long-term.
13:19
So, what about bad?
Leverage on yourself idea.
Would you recommend someone operate out of that space and talk about your own Journey on?
I would recommend you use the resources, you have to create the life you want.
And so, if the cards that you have dealt right now, our anger and fear and disappointment, then you can either wallow in those or you can turn something good out of it.
13:39
And so, I mean, I love the saying you can either let life beat the strength out of you or you can let it beat it into you and I think that you can use that you could put pain, you could put disappointment, you could put fear, you can Whatever that that life you know thing is and so it's just a decision of whether the circumstances are going to serve me or I'm going to serve them.
13:58
And so I think that whatever your raw materials are, a lot of people lament, what cards are dealt.
But you don't have control over those cards.
You only have control of how you play the hand.
And so I think every just needs to move past that and you know stop the pissing contest on who had a sadder upbringing.
14:14
Yeah, I also think though that you have to be, if you're making progress, you know, one of the things that's made Jordan Or Brady, great is changing the leverage.
They get on themselves so it's not the Tom.
Brady still isn't playing football to prove the fact that he was a six round draft pick, right?
14:30
But this notion that that's what he gets up every single day that's the chip on his shoulder anymore is not true.
He's now playing for greatness, he's playing because it has standard praying to sew and I find with a lot of entrepreneurs, they don't ever change the leverage and so when they get to where they have proved that fictitious person wrong, or they have gotten to where they are no longer starving, they don't have Any mechanism to drive themselves any further?
14:52
Do you know I'm saying?
Like I do I think a lot of people are just blob livius to the fact that you've lost the leverage.
I don't know what motivated him or I'm not inspired.
It's because the old lever, you pulled that work at one stage.
You need to now, fight, Jordan needs to say, listen, I play Everyday, Jordan, didn't take a bunch of games off.
15:08
He said because there's a kid in the stands, who it's the one time he's ever going to see me play as that night in Sacramento and even though it's the Kings, I'm going to play all out because that kids going to tell stories about You may play that's different than his motivation.
His rookie year to prove, he belongs in the league, right?
15:26
Entrepreneurs.
Don't find that new lever you obviously have.
So, I've made some content on that specific thing that Michael Jordan said size super resonate on that.
Like, that was my biggest of the whole series that I watch.
That was like, the point where I like had to pause and like, chew on it, but it really made me appreciate.
15:43
Like, every, every podcast, every, every opportunity that we have to share something to really try and bring it rather than call it.
It, you know that mean?
But yeah for me, my my leverage has changed.
I think I was really angry younger and more fearful than angry.
15:59
Just the idea of the disappointment and him being right was just like unbearable him being dead.
Yeah, isn't it.
Do you think?
I think that anger is typically the manifestation of fear and so I, when I say angry, I wasn't throwing chairs all the time writing like that, but there was this almost like gained a intensity type anger every day out of the way, I Approached my life and my business.
16:22
So let's just touch on it since we've gone there for a minute because everyone has these different things that I'll move them.
But as I get it your dad was a doctor and just no matter what you freaking did, it was just never good enough, right?
It was this a man, you got you got a 99 on the spelling test.
What was up with the one you missed, right?
16:38
Or, you know, I made millions of dollars Dad.
Yeah, but you're a Vanderbilt magna cum laude Baba.
Why aren't you a brain surgeon?
Or a neuro or whatever, right?
So this was a driving mechanism for you.
You as it has it, been resolved.
And now, and I think a lot of people can relate to this.
16:54
I'm going to prove my parents wrong.
I'm going to prove this hater wrong.
I'm gonna prove this friend of mine wrong.
Yes.
Okay, it has been resolved.
I kept leveling up the ante of like I would have make as much as my dad.
I want to make more than my dad.
I want to make more than my dad's ever made his entire life.
Like, you know, all of those kind of like points.
17:11
And then once that had once I thought it was beyond contestation, it was undeniable.
And that was the, I mean, that was my first goal as I wanted it to be Beyond reproach.
I didn't To be a pause, or whisper or hesitation in saying you want.
And so, after transitioning from that, it was like, but I didn't have a gap in motivation, though, to be honest.
17:31
Like, yeah.
Okay.
So, yeah, I didn't, I didn't really have a gap from there.
It was just, what else can I do?
And how big can this get?
And I want to see what life looks like when were there.
I think that's the separator though.
I think most do, and I think the reason you've had multiple exits and then you decided, okay, we're going to social media, and then you can go to that, right?
17:49
I think that that's Cause you haven't had the Gap, but I think you'd agree with me, vast majority of people listening to this either.
I have not become successful yet or get to a particular level and they bought their time back in then they do nothing with it.
Yeah.
Like what you said they just can't find that.
That starvation fear thing that they had when they were broke, they just don't have it now that they're eaten, you know, they can go to Mastro's and have dinner and get a glass of wine once in a while, right?
18:13
And they go.
Okay, that was it and I think part of that is because it was always this place to get away from and Also that it's not become a standard.
Like for me, I think often in life, we don't know.
We what do you get your goal or not is immaterial, you're going to get your standard long-term, some always evaluating what my standard is and for me that standard is I want to be excellent.
18:34
I want to be great.
I also want to contribute and I know that guy was on my Show recently.
Rory, Vaden he said something that's probably never going to leave me the rest of my life.
He says, you are best equipped and capable of helping the person you used to be oh yeah.
But what I heard was that's why it's incumbent upon me to keep growing and changing Aging.
18:50
So that there are previous versions of me of people that I can help.
Like, I look in you.
And I there's a part of me when I was studying your stuff.
I'm like, I'd like to become close to the Dukes.
I think I can help him because I've been the 32 year-old successful.
Dude, you've got a great wife that you talked about all the time.
I want to watch you the next 20 years.
19:06
Like, legit change the planet because I think you have to drive in the intellect and the experience to do it.
So, but speaking of that time, the next 20 years, I have this debate with my friends all the time.
And I'm like, so if you could give up all your money, But you could get ten years back in your life.
19:22
Would you do it?
Would you go back to 15 years old again and is inch of diving into your stuff and you literally said, I would easily.
I think you said everything from wrong.
I would give up all of my money to get 10 years back and be 22 years old again.
Is that accurate?
Cause you're nodding but we're on audio.
19:37
Okay.
And then and then you also connect it to what the next 10 years.
Also means or doesn't mean to you.
Yeah, everyone like just get ready for this answer right now because it's awesome.
Well, I I play with time a lot in terms of like when I think through decisions.
19:53
And so I was thinking about my 85 year old self, and I do think that I'll be a billionaire multi multi billionaire, just look on the math.
If I don't change anything right now, and I know that that man, looking back at me today, would trade everything.
He has to be 32 again, and not only just 32, again, he be 32 and picking up trash having nothing.
20:11
I know that I would trade all my wealth to do that.
And so, to the same degree, if I were to look 10 years into the future, I know that that 42 year-old betrayed, everything you has to be My Age Again.
And so it forced me to take a new look at what I was supposedly sacrificing time etcetera for, for something that I know that I would willingly trade back to have the moment.
20:31
And so it made me experience the present in through old eyes Anu.
Oh my gosh.
And what's that mean?
Does that mean that you choose what?
You're doing more carefully?
Does it mean, you're more present in the moment.
What is how does that apply in a manifest itself?
This is something that I think a lot about eating.
20:49
So, I so Caleb's, probably not in the back.
I called the grandfather frame.
Give me two minutes.
Now, it also 10.
So there's something called the frame of the veteran which is, if you're really upset about something, if you imagine that thing were to happen, a thousand times in a row every single day, all of a sudden, it starts to become immaterial because it's just how you expected it to be.
21:07
It's always this way.
If every time you go to traffic it's always an hour.
You're not going to get as upset about if you know that happens every single day it's called the frame of the veteran and so that was really good for helping me.
Decrease stress earlier on in my entrepreneurial crowd used that frame.
There was like, I wonder if I can think of a different frame that would allow me to experience gratitude because it's something that I've struggled a lot with.
21:24
I'm just not an inherently like I don't five-minute journal every like I'm just not that guy.
And so when I think about my 85 year old self waking up in a body that doesn't hurt right?
And I wake up to my wife and I look at her and I'm like, and she's so young because I'm 85 and I'm coming back to revisit this moment and I'm thinking about the problems that I'm experiencing in the business of mine.
21:43
How cool is this?
I remember when I was doing this stuff and experiencing these little problems, like this is cute, you know what I mean?
And it just gives me.
Give me this huge veil of like, Serenity for lack of better term to experience the moment through different eyes and then to the same degree when it comes to like the rush and etcetera of like growing the business and whatnot.
22:03
I think what it does is it's almost like an Occam's razor of focus of like, what are the few things that matter most right now are we truly helping the customer because when I'm 85, I'm not going to carry nearly as much about the money I made.
But the people I helped and so I think it keeps the main thing, the main thing.
And it allows at least for me.
And I want to be very clear.
22:20
I try to keep this Frame at the Forefront of my mind and I practice it and it takes time and you know, I catch myself getting or my hey Bose 85 in this moment.
Howard.
I think about this.
And then I reframes the whole situation just like the frame of the better and does.
And so I'll tell you a short tactical story of this.
22:37
So this is going to sound really lame, but I had a cat and it was two years old and my wife and I love the cat.
Really cool dude.
Anyways, he died had some weird hard thing and I thought to myself, he's 2 years old.
What if I had expected Pected that he was only going to live, six months.
22:52
Was like, What?
If that was what all cats?
Normally only lived with six months and I got him four times longer than that period of time.
And so it shifted, my likes my Soro into gratitude for just all this extra time.
I got to have with this little cat and you can take cat, you can make it whatever you want.
But like that reframing things is allowed me to decrease my emotional reactivity to circumstances so that I can make better decisions in the present around people business Etc.
23:17
And so that serve me.
Well, I am blown away that a 32-year old house.
Thought, but I love you because I've been having those thoughts.
All my life, my dad died about a year will be two years soon and I actually moved it to one more day.
Not my 85 year old self.
23:33
But if I had one more day, how much more grateful would I be for this challenge?
I'm going through right now or this moment where they walk through because I too struggle with gratitude actually, a struggle with being present and time like a pile of these conversations on the show because I actually built this bizarre.
23:50
Our gratitude muscle where I was actually more grateful for the thing.
I was dreaming about that.
I didn't have the one, I actually got it.
Totally got it.
You know what I mean?
Whatever.
Yeah.
And like, that's not cool way to live because you're always not where you are.
You're always projecting.
I'm like I would get more excited and more turned on about what I had not yet done that.
24:05
I know I'm going to do them.
They actual very thing.
I was doing, right?
And now, when I put it through that one last day, yeah, I go.
This is pretty awesome right now.
What would I give on that last day for this moment right now?
Driving out here today, I had a conversation with myself about the things I want to be doing now in my life because of this question, I asked myself and it was interesting.
24:28
I was like, if I had to choose what I actually drive, if I were choosing what I drive out and do the show today with you, and I have one other show in the answer today was yes, but lately, there have been certain things that I was doing that I needed to do when I was young and coming through that.
24:43
I no longer need to do and that valuation is really, really healthy.
I'm going to give you the contrast now of your content.
So we've gone to this, not Paul.
Liana but conceptual thinking, but then you have this thing called the everyday urgency blueprint.
So I love the concepts of it because there's people like, you know, there's things like very spiritual long-term thinking almost esoteric and conceptual thinking.
25:04
And then there's like the day-to-day, what the heck do you do to get to where you can afford these thoughts of conversations you and I, oh, so what is the everyday urgency blueprint?
Cause this is some good stuff right here.
I'm really good.
You know, it's the it's the chopping of wood.
It's the taking out the water.
We call it, do the boring work.
25:20
Which is repeating successful actions over and over again.
If it worked, once it'll work again, two more times than not.
People do something.
It works in the think I should change it.
Yes, when one of the big Concepts that I preached, at least in business is that simple scales fancy fails and so the idea is how can we take something like with scale comes complexity, we do not need to add complexity to a system.
25:42
If you take 100 phone calls a day and you turn into ten thousand phone calls a day, there is inherent complexity that gets added because you have more communication lines from Different people.
You have systems have organized it etc etc.
And so we don't need to go do more fancy things.
If we simply do the volume the complexity will come and so we don't need to add the additional very of variable of complexity to scale.
26:04
It happens on its own and so simplicity.
So thinking through the razor of Simplicity creates a forcing function of you remove all other things besides volume to the equation.
So it's like, I can either sell more units or make them worth more.
26:20
That's it.
That's all we can do to make more money and so always thinking through that frame of if we're trying to grow the business do more of the thing.
Right?
Right.
We're make the thing more expensive or worth more to the customers.
We can charge Bernal to make more per customer and so anyways that has been always like the the rubber meeting the road of the grandfather frame of gratitude down to like you have to do the stuff that makes the money.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll the best businesses start for students where you can earn one thousand one hundred and twenty dollars per day in profit, not Revenue, meaning you're above the 1% earning in the nation in the wealthiest Nation.
0:30
Nation in the world while you're still in school, pretending to try and get a degree.
So you can somehow make money, you can do it while you're still in school.
And for anyone who's not in school, you could still do it only 4 hours per day.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
0:46
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
You can make eleven hundred dollars a day working for hours a day with no inventory, no physical location, and basically no startup costs.
1:04
And it was one of the three businesses that I almost started before deciding to start my GM and the business was test prep and or tutoring.
So most people go about test prep tutoring, the wrong way.
What they do is they try and get one-on-one clients, who will pay them 40 to 60 dollars, maybe $80 per session.
1:23
And so the problem is that they're selling time and they're not Selling an outcome.
And so if you want to do the same business model, but do it way better and make more than the top 1% United States.
If you wanna make more than 400,000 or you can do it, part-time, whether you've dropped out of college, you're still in college, you still have a job and you can do it for four hours a day.
1:41
So here's how the model works.
So number one is that you don't want to sell tutoring, you want to sell the outcome of tutoring which is to get into either a job that's going to pay more or be able to pass a test of some sort or ideally the standardized test, which in my opinion are the most valuable.
1:56
Test that you can help them prepare for it.
Because when you get into a better school either college or business school, graduate school, that has a material difference on the network that there's people hang out with the companies that recruit from those schools and the average salary and earning capacity of those people.
2:12
And so you can a very real way.
Tie the increase of someone's test scores to how much money they're going to make, all right?
If you think about it College was the original Biz op?
It was the original.
Anybody can come in and you will make more money as Sort of going through this training.
2:28
Now you can capture a percentage of that opportunity by being a tutor that can help people move up tears.
So here's the simplest model that works.
That's very time constrained that anyone can do.
Number one is that you don't do one-on-one.
You do one too many but you don't do unlimited because you're probably not good enough to do that yet, but you can do semi-private.
2:49
The reason some are private is one of the most profitable service models is that you can charge probably two-thirds of what you can do one-on-one, but you, Can do it with eight times as many people.
And so, if you have a group of eight students, so you have two, two, two, two on a table, you can very easily look over.
3:04
It's still a small group setting.
They still get the personalized attention but when they're taking problems, you can have them.
Take turn doing the problem versus teaching somewhere on the problem.
And that way, they still get the personalized Touch without having to just sit there while they're doing problems, which is what happens in a one-on-one scenario.
So you're just more optimized for your time but from a money math perspective, you charged 35 bucks.
3:24
It's cheaper than the 60 that someone would charge.
One and you might be better.
And that's how you position yourself in terms of how much added value are going to provide.
But you have eight people.
So a people means you're making two hundred and eighty dollars an hour.
You do for those hours a day, you're making eleven hundred dollars a day for 4 hours of work.
3:42
And so if you're one of those people who was really good student, didn't know what to do, you could make more doing this, then you could be adding a being a doctor, not have to go to school, not have to take loans and still have your entire day and just work from 6 to 10, not bad.
Right now, what's cool about this is that in terms of where you do it, you can do it at free, libraries.
4:02
What I got tutoring for my GMAT which is the business school sat so I got tutoring.
I Did It Free Library.
That's re meant to do the tutoring stuff.
So like she didn't have to pay for that and I got to do it just at cost, right?
And so all you have to do would be to get students that would pay you three times a week and you would need 50 students to do that.
4:24
That's it. 50 students 3, Times a week, you do the tutoring, or you can do it every day, depending on whatever it is.
But either way, it works out 35 bucks per session per hour, right?
And if you wanted to, you could increase the length of the session.
If you so desired and charge a little bit more, it's either way, but I think $35 or session would be a very nice sweet spot that most people could afford and you price that again based on the fact that they would make a hundred thousand dollars more a year, 50,000 dollars more a year if they go to these better schools.
4:51
All right, so let's walk through the simple math here, if you have eight people X, 35, that's to 84 hours in a row.
You go back to back to back.
You don't even move, they come to you.
So you got to 82, 82, 82 82, 1,100 bucks, roughly per day.
5:07
You can do that seven days a week because let's be honest, you're only working, 28 hours.
All right.
So you literally don't have to do anything.
During the day, you could work a full-time job.
You could, you could try boober, you could play video games all day and then just do tutoring for hours.
And with that, if you had class a three times a week class be three times a week and then on the extra seven, Day is the people that want the extra session to catch up which you could have and they could still get charged for that.
5:32
But from a curriculum perspective, you have a three-day curriculum that you teach the class A and Class B separately and then the last day you do is the make up for those people, but they would still have to pay the same rate.
But that way they don't fall behind, right?
And the beauty here is that if you do something like this, it doesn't take a tremendous amount of time and it's a very referral heavy business.
5:52
So as soon as you help one person improve their test scores, which by the way, Test prep is extremely repeatable.
If someone does the work, so they did a research study, which is why I wanted to get into this business was that the test scores that people have on sats and G?
6:08
Mats is directly proportional to the number of problems they solve before taking the test.
So it's a very clear input output equation.
So the more problem someone does the better their scores are and I love those types of equations.
And when I learned, that one research graph, I bought every single GMAT phone book that I could find at Barnes & Noble.
6:26
And I did all of them.
I bought.
Eight books is about this much and I did every single problem off the books and that's how I scored above Harvard's GMAT mid score and it took me four months to do that.
And so, I worked personally four hours a day doing problems.
6:42
And then on Saturday, I would do a test to test my score to see if I got better.
And what ended up happening near the end is that I would start reading the questions because there's only so many ways that they can ask the question and it's kind of like chess where there's pattern recognition you just start seeing the board enough times.
6:58
You're like, oh, this is one of those ones where they have to flip this into that.
I didn't even know how to do the math.
I knew how to solve that type of problem and so you probably have about a hundred different problem sets in your head where they just change the names and the numbers.
But the way you solve it as the same, as you just need enough exposure to that, that you can predictably get your scores up because I wasn't a perfect, dude.
7:17
I was a pretty good student but once I realized how to unlock the great score because this was something that was going to make me more money, I was more motivated to be good at this test that any test We're taking, which is why I got so motivated to help other people do it too.
Which is why I started think about that business.
So if you are somebody who was pretty good at school, was pretty good at standardized test, this is a really great opportunity that you could make top 1% earning with.
7:40
No Capital out of pocket.
No rental space, no, no build out.
No nothing.
And all you have to do is go on college campuses.
Go on high school campuses put up an A-frame hand out flyers and you can very quickly get yourself your fist at 50 students if anything give a couple of sessions for free so you can get lots of people to say, yes, And then upsell certain percentage of them, that's it, doesn't have to be a complicated on it, maybe maybe takes you six months to build up your student base to be at 1,000 bucks or 1,100 bucks a day.
8:06
And would you rather do that?
Then spend four years in college go into debt and not make money the entire time and have to work full time to do that.
I don't know your call but I think it's one of the best business opportunity.
It's why I was one of the ones I was saying about doing early on and if you really want to scale.
8:21
So this is the to one level of this is that you can have other people.
Do those things for you because then you just get really good at getting the students to sign up and say yes.
And then you template size your process, for how you get them to do more problems.
Because that's the most predictable way of increasing their score.
8:37
And so then you have a teacher or you can pay 50 bucks an hour.
And then you make the spread between the two eighty and the 50 and many teachers will happily work for fifty dollars an hour.
And if you really wanted to run really crazy margins, which I prefer to, I like to have my service, based margins to 80% or higher which means that my cost per Unit would have to be below. 56, so 50 works there but that means you can pay good people.
9:03
They could get they could make more than they're making with the real job.
They're happy to do it.
The students are happy to pay it because it's less than 1 0 1 and then all the while you get to scrape everything off the top without ever having risk.
Most Nation real quick.
9:18
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
9:37
So let's look at this tutoring of the going rate of, let's say 60 bucks an hour.
All right, so if you, if you charge $60 an hour and you're doing one on one, which is the typical model that most people will do if you did one on one, then you work for hours, you would make a total of 240 dollars.
All right.
9:52
It's how crazy.
This is $240 versus doing one on eight and charging. $35, with eight people there, you make 1104 the same for hours this when we talk about opportunity, Ackles.
So, this is four and a half times more money.
Per unit of time.
10:08
And because you have this model and not the 101 model, you also can scale this one because you can have enough margin to pay someone else to do it and still have the margins to run the business Market.
It's Al groh etcetera, right?
Whereas if you were just doing one-on-one, it's just you trading time for money, but with nothing left over.
10:24
So you're forced to continue to make that trade until you decide to stop working, right?
There's no scale in the game because if you needed to pay somebody else, the most you would pay if you wanted to keep an 80 percent, gross margin would be 12 bucks, most teachers, Probably aren't going to go there for twelve dollars an hour, but you could get them to happily, then your school work.
10:41
At 3:00 come to your thing at 4:00 and the work for 428 tutoring for 50 bucks, an hour, 200 bucks to probably make more tutoring at your thing than they do from their main job.
And then, oftentimes, I'll bet you many of them would say, bro to their other teachers, dude, I'm making two hundred bucks a day, working for hours a day, instead of making whatever they make now a hundred bucks a day.
10:59
I think teaching all the classes they have to teach with students who don't want to be there.
And so if we're looking at the earning capacity, it's four and a half.
Times less money.
So you'd be making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year using the exact same amount of time and then ultimately having a higher price thing for people with a lot of that session time, being wasted with them, just doing the problems, rather, than you actually teaching them in terms of packaging.
11:21
This, I would prefer to get people to prepay because I don't like transactional, one-off things because it ties it too close.
To the time I'm spending but I would work it out so that it would be $35 in session so I could probably estimate.
Okay, in order for us to increase your child's Or student or your own score, every thousand problems.
11:41
Statistically gives you an extra 20 points, I don't know that math, but whatever that math would be, that would be obviously a core part of my selling pitch.
If you like every thousand problems is this.
And so we have to get you to do this many problems which is going to take this much time and so I would sell to go which is how much do you want to increase your test score.
11:58
So they're like, I want to increase my test score by 80 then I'd be like all right that's 20 times for 1000 is each 20s.
You have to do four thousand problems on average.
It's too And can do a thousand problems every month.
So it's going to take us four months free to get there and right now, given that amount of score, we price it at whatever the three sessions a week or four sessions a week, times 16 or 17.
12:20
So be 35 times 4 times 17.
That would be the package price and if they want to prepay, I would knock, you know, five bucks off a session and that's it.
And that way I can give them a prepaid discount.
So if you're if you were a kid who's really good at school or has pretty good test scores, First thing to do is hit up your network, right?
12:38
All the people that you know, and go knock doors and I say that figuratively but you ask people hand out some flyers and you're like that's crazy that stuff doesn't work.
It totally does.
But also dming people that are in your high school because many of them probably follow you or you follow them, you know who each other are.
12:54
And you could say, hey, do you know anybody who needs test prep Services?
I got this score and I move my score from X to Y just doing this.
And I could, I'm walking people through it so that they can get the same test scores because I was able to get into To a better College as a result of this score.
So we're saying here's where I was.
13:10
Here's what happened.
Here's the method I used, here's the outcome of the Improvement.
Do you know anybody?
Who'd be interested so you're not soliciting them.
You're asking if they know anybody nine times out of ten, they're going to say well me, but it doesn't seem pitchy if you're coming at it from that angle of asking for the referral.
So I would probably use a DM strategy because it's the most it's super easy.
13:27
Don't have to most people are afraid of actually talking to people.
So I'd probably be behind a computer doing it that way off of whatever social-media followings I had.
And I would also be dimming parents and adults.
Because I have no shame personally, and if you want to start a business, you should probably get rid of your shame because you're going to get embarrassed.
13:43
But if you do that, then you're just trying to provide Good Will and ask if anybody needs help.
Like, what is wrong with asking?
If they know anybody who needs help with something.
Nothing just your own fear.
So you just ask lots of people and if you ask enough people and say, hey I'm giving a free session to show how my whole method works and I'll do it for free and if it makes sense for them.
14:00
Awesome.
And what that is, is really more of a half-ass estimate into a sales pitch.
You do a little bit of at the beginning.
Show them one.
Easy win that they can have, they see an improvement and then you transition like this is how I teach, do you like that?
They would see an immediate benefit and then you can confront them.
So let's talk promotion real quick.
14:16
I said you could do GM's but there's a lot of things you could do.
First off, I always still adhered to get your first 5 or first 10 for free.
And you're like, what do you mean I have to work for free in order to start a business?
Well, welcome to every other business, where, at least you don't have to spend money and time to work for free or even better spend money and time and then lose money for the first six months before you even start making profits.
14:33
Oh boohoo, get over it.
So yes, you First 5 to 10 for free and you do that.
And if you want to because this is something that they have to do work to you say, you have to do your homework and everyday.
You don't do your homework.
I will bill you write so that you have some skin in the game and then they might even like that as a sales point, where they're going to be way more motivated, actually do the work, and then in so doing, they will get even better test scores.
14:54
And so, I love this kind of reverse incentives, those sticks and carrots and so at the end of that, there's three things you're going to ask for them, you're going to ask for feedback on things that could be better.
You're going to ask them for review or testimonial and you're going to ask them for a Referral.
All right.
There's the big three that you're going to do in exchange for doing the work for free.
15:10
So you're not really doing the work for free.
You're doing it for exchange so get over the whole like I'm driving my time.
Shut up.
So that's level one.
You get your first ten clients by saying, you'll do it for free.
That's number one.
And if you're, if you're dimming people, you can tell people.
Hey, do you know anybody looking for that?
I'm looking to start a little thing.
Here's my test score, here's where it went.
15:26
This is the outcome, is achieved through my unique method.
It's going to.
I'm taking the first 10 guys for free cuz I Wanna Get Crazy results.
So if you do know anybody, you can better believe that I'm going to give them a mazing results because I need them to get great results.
Start the business that gives even more incentive to do it.
Now if you get more than 10 people who really want, then guess what you can start charging, right?
15:42
Like congrats, you just did it now from there.
If you have your first 10, right?
Your mind.
Remember we said, we have four classes a day of A and B, so you have slots for 32 64, you have 64 people that you can do this billing for.
15:59
So, like, even if you give your first ten slots away, who cares, right?
And if you're doing one on eight or whatever, you can say, this is my time, that way you only have to give one hour so it's Still, you can still decrease your actual cost on doing it with the students, but once you have the referrals and the testimonials guess what, step two is you post the testimonials, which is here's the score, what it was?
16:19
This is the method we did.
Here's the result afterwards.
This is the benefit they experienced.
Let me know if you're interested to very simple.
Like this is not, you know, constant complex stuff.
They post anybody, who engages, you can DM them with a better offer of like, hey, that was my first 10.
16:35
My next 10 I'm doing.
Half off, right?
Which again only you know what your price is.
So like you can you can double your price, then cut it in half, whatever you want to do there.
I make no comment you can keep always doubling in cutting in half as you keep raising the price, whatever.
The point is, is that you give them some sort of incentive to do it.
16:51
You could even give them an extra session that they see that's their, you give them as a bonus for.
Hey, if you need a makeup day, I'll get off.
Throw that in for free if you prepay.
So that's a benefit for prepaying, the whole package.
And so you would do your DMs early to get your first 10 you start posting hack.
17:06
Acts and tips and then you'd interrupt those four or five posts of tactics that are actually working to improve their test scores with a testimonial, right?
So, those are not super hard, right, hooks, because they're inspiring for a lot of people, people think that's cool.
And then you have call to actions which drive into your DMs, and then you can upsell them from there beyond that.
17:23
The other two ways would be reaching out to people who you don't know, not just people, you do know, and then running ads, right?
But this would be, most people could just do people, they know, referrals partnering with something else.
That would make sense.
So for example, going to sports teams where they need tutoring and saying, hey I know some of these guys are worried about getting into school.
17:44
I know, they're not trying to go to Ivy, but they need to get above an X to get in with their sports scholarship or whatever.
You can go to the team's, it spreads really quickly.
And then, all the cross dudes are all the hockey dudes.
Good.
Come at the same time after practice.
And so you can go into little ponds of students or likely candidates, and then you can go fishing those ponds and bring them in, right?
18:05
If you do a good job, the word of mouth.
Will spread.
So you could do all that stuff that I just sit on your own with, basically no help and get yourself to a top 1% earning income, which is better than anything you're going to get after college.
Anyways, you could do it in six months without risking the money, the time and the debt, but if you wanted to go Super Saiyan, you want to go God mode.
18:22
You can do for teachers, rather than one and they're now getting paid 50 bucks an hour.
You're still making your same 280, right?
But you're making 1100 ish per hour because you got four guys working.
So at the end of the day just that have 24 hours with four people working You're making 4400a and you paid each of them two hundred dollars each so eight hundred dollars off 4400.
18:44
So you're looking at 3600 a day, does anybody know what it takes to make a million dollars a year?
In income survey, says 3,300 a day, you're at 36, guess what?
You now make a million dollars a year, you're more than above the top one percent and you do it with four employees that are part-time.
19:01
And some hustle business doesn't have to be hard, you just have to think through the math.
With and be willing to be embarrassed and not judge yourself based on six months of work.
But judge yourself against four years of not working and the debt and the time that you would have gone into the alternative that you were considering.
19:20
So if you were all of a sudden, for whatever reason cool with doing College, in order to increase your earning capacity and spend 100 Grand on for years plus, not making money for those four years, plus, living and food and all the other stuff, just compare that Apples to Apples.
If I just did this one tutoring business for Forestry years, hustled, the way that we just did promoted it.
19:39
Like how gave the first 10 away for free?
Do I think that for years from now, I would be better off than a hundred thousand dollars of debt.
And what I have more savings after four years of doing this business than I would at the college.
My bet probably.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I remember when I was coming up in the business world, Old.
And I was a single guy, and I had one Jim.
I remember seeing a competitor is doing better than me, and he was on the weekend with his kids, and his wife.
And they were like, you know, I do some Parkour something, and I remember thinking how happy I was seeing that cause I was like, this is what I'm going to kill you.
0:44
Like this is what I'm going to beat you.
Is that every moment that you are not working on your business, I will get ahead of you because everything that you think that is more important to you than your business, is everything.
I'm willing to give up to beat you, welcome to the game, where we talked about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build.
1:00
Is worth.
Owning I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and Buffett had documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
So let's say you've been friends with someone for a while and they start going through a tough time.
And so let's say you've been friends with him for five years a full season, right?
1:18
So the question is you are starting to have negative interactions with that person.
Meaning you're being punished for the interactions, you don't want to keep doing them.
They're - they're not fun.
They're not as motivated.
Whatever it is rather eating junk food and you want to work out, doesn't matter.
They're not doing what they used to do, right?
1:33
And that's okay because people change and so the question is, how long are you willing to endure this - period?
Well, it depends on When you get a positive reinforcement together, how long you're willing to wait for positive reinforcement parents are willing to wait for kids that positive reinforcement for almost their entire lives.
You have a negative prints either parent and they will just keep believing in you for the most part, but all of a sudden, if you, you know, you kill somebody or you, you know burn burn the house down and kill us.
1:55
Emily.
I'm just like, we got to take it to the extreme to understand that the concepts right then.
They probably might not feel the same way, they might be like they might just cut you out of their lives, right?
So they're not willing to trade forever, right?
This is why I also don't think family is forever.
I think it's a contract but he was With this person how long you're willing to wait, is up to you.
2:14
It's just how much benefit did you get from that reinforcing period, where you got positive after positive, a positive, the longer willing to wait, is the more love you have for the person?
I see love is the, is the measurement, like how much you love?
The person is how much you're willing to endure for the positive reinforcement.
2:30
So it just depends on how positive reinforcement is and how how important it is to you long term there seven days in a week.
All right you're awake 16 realistically you're probably active 12, right?
Because you've got food.
Food and shower and hit, you know, whatever 12 or like, active hours, the way I think, of my days.
2:49
I just think of them in halves.
So, I've got my front half my back half my day.
That's all I divide my dad.
Which by the way, is how Benjamin Franklin did it?
I just saw his like daily players kind of cool.
So if someone can take two hours, they took a block because like people don't switch tasks.
Well, I don't especially and so if you think about even more narrowly I'm not going to work seven days.
3:08
I might work six, right?
And in terms of blocks of time, I have 2 4, 6, 8 10, and then, And if I want to do a half day on one of the days I have 11.
So I've got 11 time blocks.
And so if he's asking for two hours of dedicated time per week, he's asking for 10% or 9% of my time of my active time that I can invest in growing, what I want.
3:29
That is such an enormous ask and if it's once a month, then you cut it to two percent.
To me, still an enormous ask.
Forever.
I would need some sort of positive reinforcement for that conversation.
And so, in my opinion, the best way to maintain relationships is to continue provide value to the other person.
3:48
Because if you're both providing value and ideally you both feel like you're getting the better end of the deal, then the relationship will continue indefinitely.
The better question in my opinion.
Is why do people get so weird about keeping relationship that don't serve them.
If it doesn't serve you anymore, you don't provide value because like you started to become friends, because you did have positive reinforcement, the beginning or they serve a purpose for you.
4:09
Right?
If they no longer serve that purpose for you, then if that was the reason you started, then why is it no longer?
The reason you keep going if that changed then, so too should the condition.
Right?
You change that change the variables.
Everything has to change as a result, right?
But we I think it's just because we have a societal story around it that you're a bad friend but I could also think of me being as a good friend to my next friend that I just made room for.
4:30
So the story is about friends leaving the hometown and no longer remember where they're from is one that is told by Because Society is the majority, the majority of people get left behind.
So they're the ones who craft The Narrative of it being wrong.
And so if you feel bad about it, it's because there's a story that someone told you when you were little from the 99% that's it.
4:51
This is how the world is and you believe to be true and it's not.
And so your contractor reality has been based on the some truth that you were six years old and didn't understand and took it as fact and then lived your life in that way.
And then you went against that fact, because it felt right, logically in the moment.
But it didn't feel right.
Emotionally is because there's a story that saying, hey, you're a bad person.
5:07
Now right.
There's a Judgment on this action that you did.
And for the person who gets left behind, it makes sense to try and get people to feel bad because they get no value from the person who leaves them.
But for me, I'm just not willing to compromise my goals.
5:23
So if you feel terrible about it, it's also because feeling terrible serves you in some way.
So it's a good question to ask when you feel bad about something, there's a reason you keep feeling bad about it.
It's because it tells you something about yourself and so if you feel bad about it, it may be your way of saying I'm a good person.
5:39
And so you feel good about yourself about being a good person because you make yourself feel that in this is why I like shedding identities is such a core part of Entrepreneurship is that you have to be willing to say I am no longer this way.
I will no longer behave in this way and I don't accept that reality is truth.
5:55
And so this is my, this is why I defined so many terms because like there's a, there's a popular influencer recently just for an example here.
Who said, if you looked up the word humility, you wouldn't want it.
And if you look up the word humility on Google, it says someone who thinks.
Less of oneself or not highly of oneself, but if you look at the definition on Merriam-Webster, it's this lack of Pride or arrogance.
6:15
Right?
And I prefer to use Clayton christensen's definition, which is humility is not decreasing garage for oneself but increasing their regard for others.
That's how I think about humility.
And so to people and this is why language gets really tricky.
Is that one person.
Say, I think humility is stupid and I'm president can say, I think humility is awesome and both of them are actually talk about different things but they're using the bucket as the word is the thing to communicate between those things.
6:37
And so we have these stories Are these words that people tell us and we have definitions that, we believe versus what they believe.
And so, I have to Define what is love.
What is a friend?
What is what is a seasoned, right?
What is a positive behavior?
What is the negative behavior?
6:52
And so when you define these things, the reason I give that lens of Love of how much do I love them?
How much am I willing to endure to keep this relationship?
It massively simplified.
Me sorting my friendships and to saying I love these people more than these people.
People like to say love is incident short but time isn't and so if time is thing, I trade for everything I want in my life, then which one's am I willing to trade the most time for?
7:14
There's Capital allocators, there's time allocation, and if time is treated for money, then money can be traded for time.
And so money is just a construct for time.
And so the people who become wealthiest understand how to trade their time for the best stuff.
And so if you trade your time for very low return, for very long time, you don't get very good returns and so you look at all the people that you're investing your time in and you say, I'm going to stop allocating here, man.
7:35
Turn this allocation.
I'm going to start investing more over here, and you start shifting that over time.
And then you, you become different over time.
Because if you look at someone's calendar, you can see what their life is.
Like you show me.
Someone's counter, I'll tell you where the light is going.
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
7:53
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star review.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
8:09
The audiobook is as low as they'll.
Let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
And so if you look at your hours as dollars, you've got 24 in your wallet, how are you going to spend them?
And realistically, for me, I feel like I only have two dollars a day.
8:27
I've got my front half my back half every day.
And so when someone's like, hey, can I have an hour?
Got two hours.
I'm like, do I want to take half my dollar?
Of the two dollars I have for that day.
Half of them give it to this person.
I'm like, I don't know, which is why I know becomes the strong muscle, you have to force over and over and over again.
The reason it's hard is because it's hard because it's against we were taught.
8:45
We were taught by people who want don't want to do what we want to do.
So it makes sense that it's different.
It's okay, that's different.
It should be different because if they believe the same thing, we believe that maybe the same place we are and wanting to go to same place.
We're trying to go, which they don't and that's fine.
And so, I had many conversations.
We were like, dude, you're trying to get famous.
9:02
Now, I literally have this not that long ago, your Try to get famous.
Now I don't know if I can fuck with that and I was like, then don't because I'm not going to compromise my goals for you.
I love you.
You don't sit at my table because like this is what I want to do with my life and I know that if I'm 85 and your terms of are keeping, our friendship is for me to sacrifice for that man.
9:22
No way.
So that's how I think through this friends is not worth with it, they used to be and that's okay.
They just, you were life becomes what you tolerate.
It's like, if I want to have a fucking epic life, I want fucking epic people.
And if you're not trying to fucking epic, then don't be around me.
9:41
Because this is my bar and like my hope is that I can raise the bar and that raises the bar around people with me.
And they're like, I want to roll too because they see what I see and they want to hold themselves that standard like I think it's so much more like there's champions in every realm.
Like I can talk to a champion of bodybuilding and we can resonate on the fact that he wanted to be the best doesn't matter that it wasn't monetary.
10:01
It's a different game but it's the ation of Excellence, you know what I mean?
And so like I want friends who want those things, it's the same reason.
People don't fire people in their businesses because they have and some of this is because of Pride.
So here this one out people don't fire employees in their businesses because they feel bad about letting them go and that comes from the underlying assumption that you are the best thing that's ever happened to this person because of your ego.
10:27
You think?
You're the best thing.
They'll never get anything better than you.
But what if, when you let them go their lives, get better.
They find someone who's a better match for them.
Write the same thing in a relationship.
Like I feel bad about breaking with this girl.
Like so you feel bad.
Imagine this girl, let's flip the tables and she's with a guy, it doesn't really give a shit about her, not much, and he's just, you just puttering along waiting for something better to come on.
10:48
I was like, how would you feel about the girl?
Now wash it.
I hope that, I hope that that would end for her sake.
So you just don't want to have one single hard conversation.
So you don't actually love the person.
If you really want to love the person truly, then you have the hard convo and you let them move.
Move on with their lives, you release them to free agency so that they have the potential to get what they deserve, which you think is better for them.
11:11
Because what's guaranteed is that you are not better for them because, you know, that this train only goes one way and it's going downhill if there if you guys are together.
And so it's like one way is guaranteed down, the other one has the potential for up.
So then like, why would you not give them, that choice, give them that option for that chance because like, there's going to be a friend who's going to move in to my spot on my buddies.
11:31
Calendar who does want to do fantasy football.
Does want a drink with him on on Sunday.
So it's not this.
Like, all right, I'll go to the game with you but I'm not drinking.
Ah, dude, not going to come on, man.
Like I don't have to do it that because the other guys like yeah, shots all around and they're going to have a blast and in five years maybe they become friends for life because neither of them change.
11:49
And that's a beautiful thing.
But I think it's just as beautiful to change and adapt like a butterfly over and over and over again to become what you ultimately want to be.
And this just different paths neither was wrong but this path especially if you're on the path list taken the path.
Of the entrepreneur of the path.
If somebody wants to build something that's real and crazy and big and epic and might not even happen.
12:08
Then you have to be willing to walk a different path that means that you do have to shed friends faster because you will grow and change to different person.
So it doesn't make sense for them to want to stay friends with you because you're not the same person when they should just redefined.
The thing is what they have to sacrifice in order to achieve it.
This is actually a huge moment for me when I was when I was coming up I remember I was playing out my next T at the 10 locations.
12:30
I had six and I was like, I'm going to 10 and I realize time.
Is that like the only thing that I had left socially, was that like that?
That was not work.
Was that?
I watched Netflix, occasionally, and that it was and, and football and Sundays, that was like, that was what I, the only things left on my calendar that I had to give up and when I just penciled out the math of like number of hours and stuff, I had to do, I knew I was going to have to sacrifice that and so I think a lot of people say what they want but they don't say what they're willing to give up to get it.
13:01
And so, I think we, if we read Fine, our goals by the sacrifices, we're willing to make to achieve it like what we were willing to put on the altar of our success.
Like what were willing to literally kill so that we can have the dream?
It would make a lot more sense to people why they're not successful.
And so I think the easiest way to do it is literally look at your calendar.
13:17
Look at where you allocate your 24 dollar bills per day and say, like am I investing in the things that are going to get me there?
And most people just aren't and so I literally look at everything that is not get me there.
And this is the degree to, which you wanted, right?
How much do I love my go?
13:34
I am, how much am I willing to endure or sacrifice for give up in order to maintain that relationship that I have with my dream.
And if you listen to Kobe's interviews, where he talks about his marriage, his friends, he says very explicitly that everyone knows that if they fuck with him.
13:54
That that's how he rolls that he's willing to put everything on the Altar for his dream.
Now, some people make the argument that's Quote healthy cool.
I don't think anyone's claiming it is.
The question that were answering her is not.
How do we do healthy stuff?
14:10
Question is, how do we become the greatest and that comes with sacrifice?
You can't expect to do the same thing.
Everyone else is doing and somehow achieve a different outcome.
And so it's just the extent to, which you're willing to sacrifice things that other people are not willing to sacrifice.
I remember when I was coming up in the business world where I had competition and I was a single guy, and I had one Jim and I thought to myself, I remember seeing a competitor who's doing better than me and he was The weekend with his kids and his wife, and they're like, you know, how some park or something.
14:37
And I remember thinking how happy I was seeing that because I was like, this is what I'm going to kill you.
Like this is what I'm going to beat you.
Is that every moment that you are not working on your business, I will get ahead of you because everything that you think that is more important to you than your business, is everything.
I'm willing to give up to beat you and I remember feeling that way and I felt that way for a very, very, very long time.
14:57
And I think that that is countercultural.
And I think that your friends I think your family I think your your Second others will tell you that that's bad and I think you have to say back to them you and I have different goals, it's not good or bad, we have different goals and so your goal, serve you the way you live serves the way you want.
15:15
And basically just compound the back like you have a fucking perfect life for you.
I don't want your life, you don't want my life right now.
I would never want your life.
Cool.
So we're in agreement, you don't want my life.
I don't want your life, so I can't do the stuff you do and you wouldn't do the stuff I do.
So what's our disagreement, why I think that you're going to, you know, If I feel that way in the future, I'll shift, it's not permanent, it's not cast forever, I'll shift.
15:39
I just think that you're going to regret not having these friends.
I don't think so because it that beers the assumption that I can't make friends, do you think I can't make friends?
No, I think you can make friends.
Then what are we upset about?
What are you saying that?
I'm going to, I'm going to regret.
I've had these conversations.
I know they go, right?
15:55
So anyways, it just comes down to like do I love my goal?
What am I willing to sacrifice my goal?
Because that's what I'm willing to endure and framing things in terms of what you're willing to give up rather than what you're willing to.
To do because everybody allocates their time, every single person spends the $24 in the world every day.
So it's not that what you're going to add to your plate, you're not going to spend more money.
16:12
You have to stop spending the dollars on something else in order to swap it for what you are doing, something has to stop in order to move forward.
And so if you're fully allocated, which all of us are for our 24 hours a day, the question is probably more useful to say.
16:27
What am I going to stop doing that?
I shouldn't be doing in order to do what I want to do to get to where I want to go.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Hey what's going on?
Everyone hope you guys have an awesome Monday and actually from my Kitchen table right now because for some reason the Wi-Fi in my little boxes going a little slope.
0:36
So anyways, I want to tell you story that I woke up with on my mind and so I figured I would share with you is actually from back in the days of college.
And when I was 19, 19 years old, I was a freshman and when the most impactful experience of my life that I don't talk about a lot, but was one of probably the periods of time where I underwent the most change as a person.
1:00
Scene was when I was 19 and I decided to join a fraternity.
Now, I know that plenty of people have lots of -, you know, stereotypes about them.
And that's, you know, fine and you're totally entitles that.
But I want to tell you story that really changed me a lot and it was when we, you know, I decided to pledge.
1:21
And so the pledging process for those of you don't know, is basically where I mean, the way it's supposed to work is you're supposed to be educated about, you know, the group, Etc.
Kind of indoctrinating.
And the idea is the harder that the harder, the, the processes that you have to get go through, to get into a group and this is psychological, the more you value the membership, right?
1:42
Which is just totally true.
Just from a psychological basic.
So the harder you have to the harder you go through in the more misery and suffering, you go through, especially with another group of people, the more bonding you have with that group of people who are miserable together and then eventually the more you value, the final member Ship that you're doing this for right.
2:02
Which is why there's tons of like psychological things that are in favor of like hazing and all this kind of stuff.
And so anyways, I went to school in the South and it was pretty amazing was definitely a part of my pledging process and I remember in this happened, every single time we had a new class and afterwards I knew because I got to see it from the other side, but when I was a freshman going into it, everything was tons of fun.
2:28
I saw the fraternity and like we've got all all these parties and like the beer was free.
And like there's all these girls there and I was like, this is heaven, this is awesome.
So want to be about this, right?
And I decide I was like yeah I'm going to pledge.
I'm gonna pledge here, right?
And so.
Anyways as the pledging process started, it was literally like this huge Awakening like like reality hit and and within two weeks and almost happened every single time within two weeks.
2:54
There's usually a pledge class for V everyone.
Who said that they wanted to pledge gets together in there.
Like, we're not doing this anymore.
Through these guys.
Like, we're going to do this on our own, we don't need this place, happens every time I know because I had, like, I saw it happen eight more times before I left because we didn't want every semester in the class.
And what, what, they, what they were, what they were fucking against, and it takes about 14 days to do it is is just a change in reality.
3:19
Any change in belief systems have changed perspective and it was really, really fascinating to experience it.
And then later, I ended up being becoming present in the fraternity and having to give this kind of speech that I sieved.
And so, when I was a freshman, we had, you know, 20 of us were holed up in one little dorm room talking about how we didn't want to do this anymore house crazy like unrealistic, you know what they had us doing?
3:40
Which is, you know, you know, you're barely sleeping.
You're getting Hazel at time.
You're getting yelled at for nothing.
Can't talk to girls.
We couldn't talk to anyone who wasn't in the fraternity and you don't start the brothers because they're being mean to use.
The only people you talked to was guys, you're pledging with, right?
So, you started getting closer.
It's kind of the idea we weren't allowed to drink, and so there's just like, all this stuff and we Go to mandatory study hours.
4:02
And anyways, this miserable.
And I remember we were all there and we're all talking we and, you know, we caught up, you know, the pledge Master whatever.
And we're like, we're quitting, you know, we don't want to do this anymore.
We're just letting you know.
And so it came over him.
And another guy, came, the Freshman Campus and stuffed himself in the dorm room.
4:19
Seems Nick Marini and Nick was a super friendly super cool going on.
We like you're the devil.
Like you, like you you fooled us like you tricked us into coming here.
And what was interesting was he's like, hey guys, who here thought who had heard about you know, / pledging before this and everyone's like, yeah, I heard about pledging.
4:38
It's like, okay, who here thought pledging was going to be easy.
No one raised their hands, right.
And he's like What you're experiencing right now.
He's like, this is what hard feels like.
And, and it was like this, it was like, kind of this moment of, like, sinking in.
4:58
He was like, so who thinks this hard and everyone's like, yeah, it's really, yeah, this is sucks is miserable.
It's like, right?
This is hard.
No like yeah, it's hard.
He's like this is what heart feels like.
And I remember this.
It was like this, like I do for me.
I was like, mind blown.
And he was just like, and then all of a sudden after that, fourth, that it happened every single time.
5:17
They're like, you know, this is what we thought, and it's like and and the reason I think it's so significant is two reasons.
One is, and I think about that Moment a lot which is like, is when if something's just difficult right now, I'm like, did I expect it to be easy?
First question with no?
5:33
And then when I'm suffering, right?
Because you're going through the pain of failure, pain of change painted, not succeeding.
Pain of the difficulty of learning a new skill, whatever.
It is right.
Peanut boredom.
As you're trying to acquire a new skill, you know, I'm like this is what heart feels like.
Okay.
You know what I mean?
5:49
And then you can kind of move forward, right.
And the reason, I think it's significant is that A lot of times we as business owners, look at the parties and the girls, and I like figuratively speaking, not actually, like obviously that's not what we're going for, but like I'm saying like we look at the successful entrepreneurs driving the cars and houses and like, all this stuff in there.
6:08
Like, man, that's what I want to do, want freedom, I want to do whatever I want whenever I want.
And, and like, have time for you to Financial Freedom, Geographic Freedom, go like that's most of us sign up to do this for, right?
And then, if we were to ask ourselves, like, did you think that this was going to be easy, right?
6:24
And most of us, hopefully would say no.
I did not think it was going to be easy.
And yet, when it is hard, we throw our hands up and we're like, what the heck?
I didn't sign up for this.
This is crazy.
Like, I have to pay rent.
I've got employees.
6:40
I have to manage like, like they don't want to work and, and like me, do my clients, are your horrible.
They don't, they don't pay their bills on time.
Like they don't honor their contracts and honor the commitments, right?
And you get into this victim set of like, this is what hard feels like.
Right.
Like this is what heart feels like and I think it's just, it's so it's so like, like impactful to kind of like refrain yourself like that.
7:03
And it's just like, yeah.
You gotta learn, like, you gotta like, we have to acquire new skills and like that process hurts because it means that we're insufficient.
It means that we're not adequate, right?
Like right now, if you're not achieving what you want to achieve it's because you're an adequate.
For the goals that you have for yourself and that shouldn't be like a pasture ego.
7:21
It should just be reality, right?
I'm inadequate right now for what I want to do, right?
So you have to force yourself to learn, right?
And there's this stretching process where it's like, man, this sucks, right?
And and then you just like, did I think it was going to be hard to be a billionaire?
Yeah, I think it is right.
7:39
This is what hard hey guys real quick.
For those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans, I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
8:01
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange.
Emails that I can email you when we launched under leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
8:18
It's like like you have to learn to be a leader.
You have to learn to like love employees.
I'm like that and they just work for me.
No.
But you can't think that way because I think that way I'll be constrained by that.
Right.
And, you know, like I wish this would just take care of itself.
Yeah but it never does.
Right.
It's like the I think Trafford said, the entrepreneurs wet dream was if you think that you're gonna be able to truly give a part of your business to someone, that's a core competency and then just never look at it again.
8:43
He's like that.
Is everyone Corners wet dream.
That's why every marketing agency cells you that it never ever.
Forever comes true, right?
Never comes true because No One's Gonna care about your business.
As much as you are.
And there's if there's ever a time where you can literally just leave something hot way like it just doesn't happen, right?
They'll sell you that because it's easy to sell it's just not true and so maybe there's one of you guys right now who's going through this and, you know, I'm going to try one more story into it.
9:08
So to the same degree that like this is what hard feels like.
I think a lot of people don't, man, this is, I would be a second video.
Um, whatever I'm going with it.
So a lot of people don't try.
So, I have this.
9:24
I have this fundamental belief that people don't try hard, and a lot of people will show up as a lot.
Like people like, you know, half the battle showing up, but a lot of people feel like for showing up because they've learned that they're, like, half the battle showing up.
Boom.
And then they show up and they don't do shit, but I don't do anything, right?
And so it's like no one tries hard.
9:41
Most businesses aren't successful or very successful because they're not good.
Right there, just not good.
I want you.
I saw I'm new to this area, which is great because for me, I get to experience a whole bunch of new businesses before I find the ones, the mistake with right.
And so I got I went to go get some, some dry cleaning, like some, you know, shirts pressed.
10:01
And first, first place I went to was like, oh yeah, our websites were on.
We're not open right now.
I was like cool, that's annoying.
But great called another store they said.
Yeah, we don't do pickups and I was like, that's annoying too.
Okay, move to the third store like and I'm just going through businesses like this.
10:17
This right?
And then there's an owner behind that business who's like, why am I not successful, right?
The this market so hard like you know what I mean in just like that, they're just losing customers because I was one of them, right?
And then I went to the third one and finally this guy was open on a Saturday, what a concept, right being open when your when your clients are free and so anyways he couldn't pick up but he could drop it off and I really need these shirts pressed.
10:37
So I said, sure I'll come and I'll drop them off because it's on our way.
So I dropped the things off and once I get the shirts back, right?
This is turnaround time.
Got the shirts back.
There was all these, These are brand new shirts but they had like the new shirt, like lions on him and there's all these fuzzies, all over them.
10:56
Right.
All these like, hairs and fuzzies, all over them.
And I'm like, well, not going to go back there.
You know what I mean?
And there's it's like no one tries hard at stuff.
Like people just don't try hard like really, man, I'm really struggling.
Get generating leads and make how many, how many ads have you made, right?
11:12
Might be like, well, I mean, Six and I'm like, ok cool.
How many of them are unique?
Three.
Okay, you've tried everything.
Yeah.
Okay, so you've made three ads so that took you all of 45 minutes, right?
And like you've been struggling at this for two weeks, right?
11:29
And you spent 45 minutes actually doing the thing that you're trying to fix, right?
Like I Man actually I just remembered.
What if this was actually going to be about, I make another video about this but I had I had this huge transformation that I went through.
11:49
That got picked up by muscle and strength magazine about three years ago or two years ago, I put like 35 pounds on and in six weeks and I was like, I'm going to try and gain as much muscle as I humanly can in a shorter period of time as possible.
And what I said was I thought to myself, I was like if I were to, if I, if the goal is literally to gain as much muscle as possible, what would I do, right?
12:08
And so I worked out for about three hours a day and I did the exact same exercise.
Is every single time and so I did like press everyday.
I did.
I benched every day I squatted every day.
I see arms every day.
12:24
I did shoulders every single day and it did the same exercise every single day, right?
And I was like, well if I hit all of the muscles and I do them every day, I was like, I'll either die a little grub.
Right now, it's kind of the idea and then they grew and grew a ton and I grew really fast and it was because night and yet so many of us trained at the gym because we're trying to get more muscle but we don't actually try to gain more muscle.
12:47
Like a lot of us are trying to get better at business but we're not actually trying to do things to get better at business.
Right?
And so it's like a lot of times it's like this is what hard feels like is when you have to confront, the fact that you're an adequate at something and yet still keep persisting in the fact that you're not good.
But you have to keep going in order to get better, right?
13:03
And so So anyways it was just it was this little story that I woke up with all my mind and I was like man I feel like that was something sure because for me it was very impactful because it just made me realize that a lot of like no one tries hard.
Not like, most people are not good at business because they don't actually try to be even be good at the thing that they're selling, right?
13:21
Like, why is my tip?
Like, here's some real talk for everyone.
Real real talk for gym owners in theory, you should not need to pay for marketing.
Because your service should be so good.
That people tell their friends about it and they bring him.
13:39
Real talk.
And if it's not then that's why it's been so hard, right like why is this rest, why do restaurants go under all the time because the foods not good.
That's it, you know me like we can have the best business model best systems and all that stuff.
13:56
But like the foods not good and so like sometimes journalists like am I really trying as hard as possible to make the best sessions possible?
Am I really actually trying as hard as I can?
And a lot of times we know, right for just being like, we're not.
And so most times, we know what we need to do, we just don't do it.
14:15
And if you just look at the problem and you're like, Huh, I just need to try harder, right?
Like how do you like how do we innovate so much stuff?
We don't like we innovate stuff by literally just looking at a problem being like let's try it.
Sit like we need it.
Like the next Legion thing that we're releasing to our Legacy group, all that I'm going to do, check it out, check it out this.
14:34
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna get 15 gyms, and I'm going to have my team, come up with 200 adds, two hundred ads, and we're going to test them in the hardest markets.
And then I'm going to find a winners and then I'm just going to give them to the gym owners that I have because no other gurus doing that, you get any other group is for, trying to hack my stuff.
14:54
That's my process, right?
We just try hard.
That's it.
We just try, like, what if we were trying to actually get leads for people?
Like, that's what we would do.
We would probably make hundreds of ads, we test them and then that we would know which will work and then we just gave it to him.
That's what we do, right?
That's all we do.
So anyways, I'm not going to go further in this.

There is an actual cap on your business as it currently stands.
You're just not articulating it because you're afraid of saying.
Well, if I can only take 10 people then they'll think I'm a small business or whatever.
But if you said I only take 10 people even though it is your actual cap, it has a very different feel to it.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
0:18
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I think that Duality super powerful so that's why I wanted to stack them or some other Stacks in a minute to that stack them back-to-back because I think you can hold two thoughts at one time.
0:41
I think you can have this concept about your life, where you want to reflect on the final days yet, have tremendous freaking urgency in the moment, right?
And and have Concepts that move, the needle every single day of your life.
Why do I say that?
I think there's two types of people right now on the planet, there's the seminar go, where person who's all in the thoughts and the clouds about reflection and energy and this Some that and the other thing and frankly they're not getting around to making their life matter day-to-day.
1:08
Then there's the people that you and I used to be which is we're making our life matter every single day.
But we have none of the energy, a spirituality, the concepts of time in our life.
And so I think the Duality the complexity of those two things, the contradictions is what makes this conversation the most valuable.
1:24
Can I add one thing to that least.
So I in the comments on YouTube and things like that, I know that a lot of people struggle with that concept.
And so I wanted to give a different example that I think might drive this home.
You already do believe multiple contradictory things.
The same time you believe in Justice and you believe in Mercy.
1:42
You believe in variety.
You believe in consistency.
And so there are these Jensen Yang's that exists and it's not to say that the white part of the egg or the black part of the is, right.
It's understanding the middle path and I think wisdom is knowing when to do, what?
And so it's.
When am I using Justice first is Mercy?
1:59
It's not that Justice is, right?
And mercy is wrong, or Mercy is Right In Is it wrong?
The wisdom is allows us to walk in the gray and be comfortable and select, which is appropriate for the moment though, brother.
So good yesterday, I was coaching someone who used to lead a pretty big country, a big deal and we had this conversation.
2:17
He said, you know what, I was really at my most productive.
I operated out of here often and now I'm constantly forcing myself to operate out of gratitude, in abundance, and all these other things.
And I said, sir, the truth of the matter is it's knowing when to select those mechanisms, fear is not necessarily a negative.
Motion.
It's the abundance of it can become negative or too much of it.
2:35
But if you never leverage fear, heck, fear helped me.
Prepare for this podcast today.
I don't want it to bomb.
I wanted to do great.
Right.
So there's leverage in everything and wisdom, truly is.
I love how you just said of knowing, which lever to pull when and no one knowing when the right part of it applies.
2:50
So good.
Again, I'm sitting here in front of a 32-year old.
I don't mean to, you know, for a lot of people listen, this, they're like, 32 sold, I'm 23.
Right?
So I want to make sure that I don't use my own age bias, but the same time I think Many of these thoughts when I was your age, but I certainly do have the ability to articulate them like you do.
And I'm super, super impression as want to acknowledge you because you're serving millions of people right now.
3:10
Also think you can serve them with parts of your story, they don't know.
There are people listening to us right now that are failing their, they're bleeding money and maybe they just had a business shut down or the last two years is wiped them out a little bit or they're looking right now.
Going.
All right, I am going to make a pivot so you're a guy who had a lot of success building.
3:28
Jim's is really, really going.
Well, as I understand it.
You go over the next 81 you pour all the juice from all the profits into the next one.
And you go bust.
So there was a point where this man, that I'm talking to you right now.
By the way, not that long ago was busted, we're broke.
What did you do?
3:45
When you are on your ass where you on your ass mentally ever, or was it just a physical being broke and then what did you do to make a move?
Because there's a lot of people right now.
Right, where you were, I just focused on the controllable.
So there was a lot of things that I felt like, I could not control or that were circumstantial etcetera.
4:00
And so, it's just Kind of like the Simplicity thing of like, what are the few levers that I have at my disposal?
And at the time I was, like, I know how to Market not a cell and so that's what I'm going to do.
And so I the the stories crazy, but I had a credit card left from all the businesses that I had sold and then lost all the money.
4:20
But I still had the credit card and Amex think God had not actually changed my credit limit.
So I had a hundred thousand dollar credit card and I wanted to launch Jim launch, which was like this Turner I'm business.
We'd fly out to gyms and So we had six guys that I had already recruited and I thought this cash is going to be there and it wasn't and so I put thirty three hundred dollars a day on a credit card and I only had a thousand dollars in my bank account.
4:40
And so every day I was becoming 3,300 dollars poor and we started that.
I didn't even have a payment processor because we got shut down, and that was where the extra money was supposed to come from.
And so we were, we were doing, you know, I had, it was 3200, a in hotels are fair.
Adspend rental, car per diem food, for all the sales guys who are out on the road, like doing the gym turnarounds and I could not process.
5:01
Money that they were sending contracts over from and so I'm seeing these contrasts stack and stack and stack and I had no way to process it and I'm just watching this debt bill go up and I got a processor the last week of the month and it was only for 50 Grand and we had like three hundred thousand dollars in contracts and I had 100,000 and expenses but he's like hey it's per month which means on the first of next month you can run another 50 and so I ran 50 on like the 28th of January.
5:25
And then I ran 50 on February 1st.
I got two more that week and got us another 50.
So the 250s back To back covered my 100k from the last month and that was like, kind of like the plane coming under.
There's like way more of me about to lose it like and losing it again and again after that.
But I can go as deep on that side as you want.
5:44
But well, like where were you mentally?
I mean, we're you mentally when that's happening.
Like, my dad was right.
He's got me.
Or were you like still?
I'm gonna prove him wrong.
I was so, I had made the decision that I would either die or I would succeed.
And so I didn't know when it would happen.
I just figured I fight continued.
So I so if there's one thing for the audience for anyone, Going through it right now.
6:03
The refrain that repeated message that I had to myself over and over again.
Was I cannot lose if I do not quit and so it was that was under my control.
Then when I talk about like controlling the controllable like I could choose not to quit.
And so if I could just have that that it meant that it was like this tiny little thing is like if I don't quit I didn't lose it.
6:22
Just means I still get to play and when you think about like I think Cameron's Aristotle's our Play-Doh but he says like, you shouldn't judge a man until the day he dies.
And so, you know, here, An amazing life.
And then the last five years, like everything goes, you get executed publicly.
It's like, wow, what?
People say it a good life or bad life.
6:38
Like, you only judge after the man is dead.
And so I also think about that within my own life.
Now like when you think about like, what's the leverage for the next for the next chapter?
It's like, well, I'm not dead yet.
And so I got to keep going because that's what, you know, that's what we're going to look back on.
And so I had this little thing that I could protect, which is my willpower, and it's just like, if I do not quit, I cannot lose.
6:57
And so, I was so afraid of losing that just not quitting became the one thing.
And so, If I just kept moving one foot at another one, phone call after another one sales appointment.
After another I knew that if I did that long enough, eventually it would turn around and I could see myself out of this situation.
7:13
Yeah.
Wow.
I am blown away because I have equated only losing with quitting all of my life and the reason for that is just want to share because we're going back and forth.
Oh my dad, my dad was an alcoholic.
When he got sober.
I said, Dad, are you never going to drink again?
7:30
He goes, I can't promise you that.
I'm going to quit for one more day.
I'm not gonna drink for one more day and many many times in my business on my I can't I am incapable mentally right now saying I never going to quit.
That's a like 80-year decision based on a bunch of crap right now but I can decide not to quit for one more day and that means I have not yet lost.
7:49
I literally equated quitting with losing and so, no matter how behind in the score I was I had not officially lost.
The end of clock has not run out until I go, I quit and so I was still in the game so this This concept, I just, I love with someone said stuff and I put it through my life, barometer my meter.
8:08
I'm like, no, I did that.
You're exactly right.
I know someone who did that.
You're exactly right.
What a great answer.
Now, he talked a lot about Stacks, by the way, can you guys if we didn't show by the way, this moves this quickly through stuff before it.
Bam, bam, bam.
Get more debris, and get more in your head.
I almost feel like I'm using you today, you know, I mean like I'm just working this dude, the whole show but it's great to have somebody on that.
8:27
I can just keep working for my audience because this is my family.
Sometimes when you're Talking to something like.
All right, let me help you along here with this with you.
I'm just like, go, go, go give him.
That one, give him that one.
Given that one and I love that about you.
The stack stuff is super cool to me and I love that terminology you.
So now we're going to move a little bit back over to marketing and branding and all that kind of stuff.
8:49
You have this thing called the scarcity stack.
I'm a big believer in this.
I guess just literally did a real estate deal based on the premise that you teach.
Now I would I didn't call it this but I don't think People get the concept here at all.
And I think it's one of the Lost art forms in marketing and you describe it in a modern way.
9:08
So what's the scarcity stack?
So, if we think about all exchanges, as such as forces between supply and demand, right within a market place and I think the, the more Cycles I have in entrepreneurship, and I understand that I'm still young in the game, the greater, and greater appreciation.
9:25
I have for those simple, two forces of supply, and demand.
And what's interesting is that you you can influence demand or you can artificially Emulate Demand by marketing stuff by making increasing awareness about your thing, right?
And so more people find out about it.
So your demand goes up and so that artificially shifts this, the demand curve in your favor and so you some more stuff, right.
9:44
The other side is not nearly as well used, and I think is almost as powerful, if not more powerful than the demand side, which is how can I cut Supply?
And the first time I really saw this happen in person was, I was at an Arnold Schwarzenegger charity event at his house and Wanted to introduce me some of the big donors because we're big donors and the guy was a jewelry like Mega dude, right?
10:07
So he and he was like a first generation from Serbia hard to like, but he sold like 500,000 our watches things like that.
And they had just raise the prices for the charity event, from 15,000 and 25,000 and the charity organizer who made the introductions like yeah, we listen to George.
10:22
He told us to do this thing.
I was a little nervous about it and he just said it.
So matter-of-factly said, whenever demand increases, you said cut Supply and when You look at what Chanel and Louis Vuitton.
And some of these all these luxury brands do is like, they are masters of scarcity.
And so, when you can get someone into a fomo situation there, where they fear missing out, you can actually trigger this incredibly emotional decision and what it happens is, you decrease the action threshold and so you have a person who normally wouldn't take action and so the scarcity, the fear of missing out on this opportunity, decreases their threshold of taking action and they walk across the line.
10:59
And if you use this concept, Of scarcity and use it within your business.
Where the way I like to think about is that, so, whoever's listening, right now, if you have a business or even if you're, if you're a Salesman, whatever, if you were to 100x, your volume tomorrow, you probably couldn't handle it.
11:16
And so there is an actual cap on your business as it currently stands.
You're just not articulating it because you're afraid of saying.
Well if I can only take ten people then they'll think I'm a small business or whatever but if you said I only take 10 people even though it is your actual cap, it has a very different feel to it.
11:32
And what happens is you now actually paste your business at a point where you don't over overextend yourself and you create a stronger pool of the customers into your world.
Real quick guys.
You guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
11:47
And so the only ask that I can ever have and you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
12:08
And more importantly, it may change the world or someone else.
Here's what I like, if you can listen to the concept stuff and then do the hard work, those you that are listening or watching this to the application in your business.
So this scarcity idea, go, no, I'm in the protein business.
12:24
So we have unlimited much protein.
The maybe the scarcity, isn't the product to scarcity is the time meaning that if they don't hurry up and start doing it every day, they fall by like saving money, if you're in the financial services, but you do know there's plenty of these contracts for Investments or Insurance.
Yeah, but every day they don't move forward.
12:41
There's a scarcity of Of time that they can make up for with the compounding of money.
So the getting the concept of fomo or the limiting amount of it or how few people do it.
Absolutely increase his value proposition.
The so so good.
It's a for the salesman in the room over in the Roman Rite.
12:59
Think about in terms of the opportunity cost of the cost of inaction.
And so the nice thing is that you always have a cost of an action that's a mounting and so that will typically stack in your favor as the salesman with every second that passes.
And so, all we have to do is direct the Spec's attention to the cost that is already happening but they are just not aware of we're focusing on.
13:17
And so we just direct the attention and then all of a sudden, what was non-existent becomes a problem.
And so you see this in politics all the time, whatever they're talking about more becomes that hot topic of the election.
But it's only because they're putting attention to it, not because people actually care more or less about it right there, telling us that we should care less about it by the attention.
13:35
They're putting towards it, right?
And so this is a media or masters of this.
And by the way, these things work so.
Well, everyone that you You have to leverage them.
Ethically, yeah, this is one of things.
I just want to say up front because these concepts of scarcity and fomo.
It has to be ethically stated in truthfully stated because long-term.
13:53
If you push these lovers, the wrong way, you'll destroy your reputation.
If there's not a factual basis for what you're describing a couple more Stacks.
I'll give you a note at least so.
So there's there's two elements of trying to create from a besides, like Risk, reversal is a whole nother thing with guarantees and things like that.
But there's scarcity, which is a function of the number of units, and then there is Urgency, which is a function of time.
14:14
And so, a lot of people say, scarce in hurts to be, don't know the difference between the two and so urgency is.
It doesn't matter how many units I have the deal ends tomorrow.
Yes, right.
And so, if you can't introduce that, and so I'll give you an example of like, well, we have protein.
It's like, well, you have protein but I may have a Valentine's Day special.
That is ending this week, and then next month, I might have a spring special, but the thing is, when I'm articulate your prospects, hey, this particular promotion ends tomorrow or ends in two days like you should get this starter to get, get your love.
14:43
Loan application in because like I can't guarantee that as soon as we get into the spring spring time, we're going to have the same things, right?
And then with with the scarcity component, it's a function of units and what you were saying earlier, there's always a way to think about it.
Like, with the protein of like, I thought of a different example, I thought of flavors I was like, oh, just have a limited flavor proteins going to be here, but this particular flavor will not be and so it's like you can always or you can put scarcity in terms of the bonuses, you add.
15:08
So it's like, hey, I have proteins and they're all vanilla.
I was like, but for this month I'm going to be adding a free workout or a free workout template or nutrition template that I'm going to add with my protein.
Which I'm not going to be giving next.
So it's so then what you can do is you create these additional value adds, which no one else is doing.
15:25
And then with the additional value at you both add value and create scarcity.
At the same time to urge the person, take action, very good.
So you just, please don't be sorry, that's informative, even for me.
Listen to me, everyone.
This is all you're gonna get stuff on today's show.
This is why I do the show.
By the way, I want to provide a value and a depth of insight.
15:43
Between two people communicating that you wouldn't get anywhere else based on their experiences.
And here's the thing on this, listen to me, everybody, it is your ability to take these Concepts.
That are absolutely sure fire and find the applications in your own life.
Get them with your team as well.
I have to tell you in business, I have found that the principles are sort of enduring over time.
16:02
This fomo concept or scarcity.
Concept is as old as time.
Technology timing, marketing changes, the application in the mechanism of which you deliver it, But this is not a new idea, it's new idea for 99.9% of you because nobody talks about these things anymore because they haven't done the hard work of, how does this apply?
16:22
Now, how does this apply to Warren Buffett?
We you and I both still take advice from a guy who is double my age and I'm already old because the principles that this dude teaches our Timeless.
It's our ability to apply them.
Now, that separates us in our life, trim and stack hack.
16:41
What the heck is that?
I wrote it down.
Because it's cool firm.
So when we're thinking and this is, this is if you have more control over the services that you're selling, so this tends to be a little bit more on the service side.
You can still think through phone Ecommerce side, but I'm just going to apply this to service gets easier.
So the first thing that we like to do when we're thinking about creating a new product line, or when I say a new service line, we think about what are all the problems that our prospects are suffering from and what are the things that are coming up on sales calls that they're saying they're struggling, whether they wish that we could solve for them and the way to think through this is tactically, what has to happen?
17:13
By step by step and there's 100 mini steps like you think.
Oh yeah, we do these two things.
If you really chunk down and zoom in and and look at it, it's like, well, they first they have to click this thing and then they have to integrate their whatever.
And then they like there's all these micro steps.
And so we list out all of these problems and then we translate this problems into Solutions.
17:31
Yeah.
And so we word it as solution wording to the problem that we are solving.
And then once we have, okay, this is these are all the problems that we are now solving, these are the solutions.
Okay, now, how do we deliver on these Solutions?
So we can think about this in terms of like we could have, we could have a portal that does a training.
17:47
We could do some sort of one, too many thing.
We could have a semi-private or small group, we could have it be in person.
We could have it be remote.
We could have it.
Be a phone call.
We could have it be a chat support.
So I've the something called a delivery Cube which kind of goes with this in terms of how you get into levels of service.
So on one level of the cube, you have, what is the ratio of the people?
18:03
So like, like I said, 121 a small group one too many, you have the speed of response.
So is like, is this going to be we respond instantly?
Or is this a we respond in 24 hours, we respond by the end of Week and then there's the quality of the services.
Are you going to just get a Frontline support rep, or you're going to get a VIP concierge?
18:20
And then the medium of that service which is zoom, is it in person?
Is it a phone call?
Whatever.
There's a cube and I go in more detail about it, but when you're thinking through this, you think through those variables, how you're going to deliver the solution.
And so we had the problems, we have the solutions and then we think about how we're going to deliver the solutions, okay, there we are.
18:37
Now when we think about that we then right, what's the cost of delivering the solution and So then we look at all of those things and we say, okay, if we had to prioritize, just the ones that these people find extremely valuable and that are low cost for us.
What if we just combine all of those and then took out the rest of them.
18:56
So, all the things that provide tremendous value and happened at very little or no incremental cost us and then that is what we will pack together.
And then we'll bundle that whole thing as a much bigger problem solving solution.
Then when you put those things together and then you add some scarcity, you got some bonuses, you get you Increase the risk with some sort of guarantee.
19:14
If you can, if you had some sort of urgency around acting, then you have what I would consider a very compelling offer.
And if you have a compelling offer, it makes it very difficult to be poor.
Because that's because what happens is when you make offers that people feel stupid saying no to they tend to say yes.
And when people tend to say yes to offers you have you tend to make more money and if you did it and you designed your offer in a way that it that you provide a lot of value to cost you very little to do it, you make lots and lots of money and so that is the idea and we try to repeat that action as many times we possibly can.
19:43
Sort of business.
Yeah, you step back and look at it, you take these very complicated things to make them simple and to you.
It's like, yeah, I just but what do you just described as actually called for years of business, in college, right?
Distilled into like 90 seconds, is it exactly how business works?
I have this other Theory right now.
19:58
That's gone by the wayside and business and it just blows my mind and that is like at the end of the day, I want my existing clients to send me or customers to more clients and customers and it and have all of this stuff.
It's like, Hey, I'm Blown Away by how little time and I mean, like almost none, we independent contractors or Bagel companies spend on the product and the in the client or customer experience with you.
20:26
What did I feel?
What energy did I get?
That would make me want to tell someone else you should have the same experience.
I had.
They spend all this time on everything other than that thing which is the only thing that will cause your business to grow without your efforts.
20:43
Effort afterwards.
So I want you to talk about that.
This is like my favorite topics.
Okay.
Very excited about.
Okay.
So I'm going to put in a while because I love this quote.
He says you only sell because you don't know how to mark it and you only Market because you don't know how to build a product.
Let's break down two things to the basic units, right?
20:58
There's there's only five ways you can get more customers.
Number one, is you reach out to people privately.
So you cold call Cody.
I'm cold email, whatever, right?
The next one, is that you make content that attracts people to you.
They find your stuff, they discover it, right?
The third is that you 1p dad's, right?
21:15
And then the fourth is that you get Affiliates, and partners who, who were, who are other businesses to serve people, like your customers and refer them to you and then finally, customers tell other customers.
Yes.
So here's what's interesting is that if you think about, when we talk about leverage, this is gonna come full circle which is great.
21:32
The first four that I discussed have linear, they are linear in nature.
Meaning, if I make 10 more dials I can predict how many customers I'm going to go from that to more reach out to our, I spend 10 more dollars on Dad's or make another piece of content, it's there.
It's relatively predictable, in terms of what's going to come back, it is a linear equation.
21:51
You add more and you get more out with a quadratic equation, you get a an exponential and unfortunately entrepreneurial space people like exponential they say it a lot but they don't know what it means.
They really just means it multiplies, which is not what exponential is but with a referral or a customer telling another customer one person tells to to tell for 7:56.
22:11
And so one of the difficulties that I see a lot of businesses get into is they get to three million to get to 10 million to 30 million especially like consumer products.
There are constants in business one, is that the cost of acquiring?
Summer will go up over time because Impressions will cost more money and you'll have more operational drag on your business.
22:27
And so if those two are constants, then you have to have an opposing force that cannot be linear in nature, that's going to contradict that.
And so, if you are in a consumer-based business, the only one that can counteract a one-way direction, of increasing cost of Impressions and infrastructure is the decreasing cost of acquisition, because every time you get a customer that customer brings you to more customers and so that is like the great equalizer.
22:51
ER, in business.
And I had a first-hand experience with this recently, with the book offers button because I mean one post about it one and I didn't have a following a year or two, you know, whenever I put those year ago and that book from what I understand is sold more than New York Times bestsellers, I just didn't do the politics thing, but right now, sold over 200,000 copies in the first year and I have no paid ads.
23:11
I have no anything.
It was just because people were like, dude, you should check this book out.
Yeah.
And so I say that to say, like if you nail that piece, everything else gets easier.
And it's easier to Market and make money in the beginning and then harder.
Yes, you fix it.
Once you have a bad product, the reverse is also true is that it's harder to spend more time in the beginning fixing the product, but then when you scale it's easier.
23:33
And so the question is, whether you want it to be hard to break through and this may not be real for some of you, but like once you get to a 10 million dollar Enterprise like it gets very difficult to break through that barrier if the products not that good, that's right.
And it's much harder to take the time and effort to fix the product.
And I'm going to do quick segue here because this happens all the time when this is just at least our experience of the portfolio.
23:52
Comes we have what got you to, you know, one or three million is not necessarily what gets you to 10 million, 30 million.
Because in the beginning, you need to sell something to someone that you have to promote it.
You have to promote the stuff you have.
Otherwise, no knows about you and your obscure.
And so people have to buy it where people make the mistake, is that they get this positive reinforcement from the fact that the market and sold and think I need to do more of that.
24:12
And I'm going to say, yes, you will, but just not at this moment because at this point is actually a pause point.
And the goal is not to even necessarily make tons of profit at this.
The goal is to fix the product, such that you start to generate a significant amount of business from referrals until that occurs.
There's no point in adding more gas to the acquisition engine.
24:30
Because you're basically just setting yourself up for failure.
At a later point that will, then reach a point of equilibrium where the only way to grow is to sell more people.
And at some point you will run out of people to sell depending on the niche that you're that you're going after.
And so the idea is to actually alternate so you focus on the acquisition, the beginning, you get, what?
24:46
I always say, one product, when Avatar one channel, that's what you have to do to get to 13 million.
And so at that point, then you fix the product.
If you fix the product, you will sneeze your way to 10 million, it's okay, without doing anything else.
And then, once you're at ten, if you have fixed the product and the customer experience such that, you have a large percentage of your business come from Word of Mouth.
25:04
Now, you've extended the LTV, the customer, you have increased growth profit per customer that you can now spend profitably and out-compete everyone else who just wanted to bulldoze their way to 10 million with a lower LTV and then you can go crush them on every other channel that they're on.
25:19
And then you go back and say, hey, we're going to build a cold Hey, we're going to go to cold-call Team.
Hey, we're going to go to paid ads seem, hey, we're going to build affiliate partners and channel partners and you can do that because you have so much getting extra profit per customer.
Could you spend the time up front to fix it and make it good and you'll sleep better.
Yo, and you've got proof of concept.
So yeah.
Just scale the crap out of it.
25:36
Yeah, no one's ever said that on my show.
No one's ever said that to me about the pause part in the middle and one of the most insightful, really, you would have had to have already done.
Something significant in your life, type breakthrough, thoughts, but someone's ever shared on the A show and I almost want to move it to the very beginning of the show, because it's so important.
25:55
Hope, everybody stuck around for that.
I got one last question for you first.
I like you a lot.
I respect you a lot.
Tell us where they could find you, but then I got a better question for you at the end.
The game podcast, Alex, from Rosie.
That's if you like podcast, that's the easiest thing.
If you like videos where on YouTube really big?
And if you like short stuff, if you type my name on whatever social media channel and you'll probably find me you.
26:14
I told everybody, this is flyby, probably the fastest show I've ever done.
I'm really the fastest I've ever done before.
Curious and I don't even know what you're going to answer.
So we go all the way back here.
This kid being raised by this Dad, that's pretty demanding, dude.
Smart dude, all these options, go to Vanderbilt, crush it.
26:33
By the way, in the middle, there had a DUI, had some stuff happen to wasn't really good that I read about and you've turned it around business failures, then tons of success, then multiple exits and then obviously this really unique way of looking at business, that's accurate by the way.
You worked really, really hard and you sacrifice a lot of things in your life.
26:52
You're still very young, but I grab you at 32.
I'm curious if it was worth it, I don't you be honest but he had to do it again.
What you do all this stuff again or would you have done something differently?
If you could go back, those ten years, give up all your money, okay?
Your back your 22 again, you're just getting out of college.
So I took all your money from you, with which our proposition earlier.
27:09
Would you go do all of this again or would you live a different life?
I wouldn't do all of this.
Again, I would do all of this better but I would do, I would live this life.
I mean, The moment you ask the question.
I was like, the yes, was in my throat just waiting to for you to finish the question but like I'll be a little crude balls to bones.
27:30
Through and throw like this is this is what I love.
It's my it's it's my it's what I love.
I mean I draw pictures about business.
I write books about business, I make videos about business, I do business every day.
If somebody doesn't have a business, it's difficult for me to be friends with them because we have so little share contacts.
27:49
Not because it's their fault because I have nothing else that I do in my life.
And so they want to talk about biking and I'm like that sounds cool for you.
I have no interest and really what's your hobby?
And I'm like I don't have Wedding and I'm cool with that.
And so I took me a while to just accept that.
28:05
That's okay.
And so I 100% would do what I do.
I love what I do, this is the most fun thing in the entire world and the deeper.
I get in business.
The more I want to live a long time and that was something that I didn't have earlier on in my life.
And so I just, there's just so much I want to do that.
28:24
I just, I just that's you know, it's like I crammed a lot in 10 years.
I'm like, I just there's so much cool stuff and And I want to do it all, you know, as much that within this world that you know that we have.
I can't wait to watch you, do it.
Your outstanding brother around stationing.
I really enjoyed today, a great deal.

Know there's a A reason that companies that serve Enterprise or Fortune 500 or Fortune 100 companies, get the highest multiples when they sell.
0:37
It's because those customers are the most valuable and they stay the longest and pay the most serving, a better customer makes you a better business.
The wealthiest people in the world.
See business is a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:55
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy 80 percent of customers will bankrupt or business and keep you poor forever.
So here I was sitting in this conference where I was at the cool kids table because we had our software company Alan that just said cross 10 million, are our annual recurring Revenue, We got recognized for being awesome and so I thought I was hot shit.
1:20
And so Applause, died down the host of the event gets up there and he's like, our next speaker is head of pricing and packaging at Vista.
A fifty billion dollar, private Equity Fund.
I was like, oh, I am poor and don't know what I'm talking about.
1:38
And so, the speaker got on stage and what he said, changed, how I saw selling and making money for the rest of my business career.
So as soon as the speaker opened his mouth, I was like completely focused on what he's saying is like, what is this guy secret for pricing and packaging?
And so, he said, the way that Vista approaches acquiring, a new company starts with its customer base, first, and I was like, what are we talking about?
2:01
I was thinking it must be marketing.
What must be sales, like how are they growing?
All these companies and for context their Benchmark is they want to Triple A business in three years.
That's what they target to do triple in three.
And they're buying multi-billion dollar, businesses and trying to Triple those Type of businesses.
2:17
And so the way they had to do it had to be smart.
And so what they would do in the diligence process where they actually do research on the company before they buy them, is they actually do more research on that businesses customers, then that business already had.
So they would extract all the customer data from a business.
2:33
They were going to buy and then they would Force rank every customer that business had ever sold since the beginning of time by, who had been with them, the longest, and who had spent the most money and then they would look at The customers that were in the top 20% and say, are there commonalities between what channels they came through similarities of Industry, Etc.
2:55
And if there were, and that was not pulled out specifically by that business, they would acquire the business and then cut all acquisition channels that brought in the 80% and then looked at the acquisition channels that brought in the 20%, that was the highest paying customers and they would double down on that.
3:15
And what I realized was this was Perez principle but on steroids.
And so, the typical concept is that 20% of customers spend 80% of the money.
And so what they would do is say, okay, well, what if we had a hundred percent of the customers being that 20%, if they accomplish that alone, they would already have 4X to the size of the business.
3:34
Accomplishing their tripling in three without even having to increase the volume of sales.
But only by picking better customers to sell to begin with.
After the speaker, got off stage, I was completely shocked because we were selling every single person at the time to get to about 1.7 million a month, in six months, in our software company, anybody who had a credit card, he said they wanted to do it.
3:55
We would take them, but what that resulted in was more customer churn different customers with different desires and wants, which means we had to build different features into our product Suite to service all these different people and differing margins based on the differing desires of the customers, which was bad.
4:13
So I've been quoted by saying that the market that you serve is the most important lever on your business success.
Because if you're selling toilet, paper and covid, it doesn't matter how good you are marketing, how good you are at sales, how good you are at branding, you're going to sell out.
And so if you have a supply demand curve that's in your favor, you're going to win a subset of that concept with Market being the most powerful is what slice of that market you go.
4:38
After this is where you become more nuanced and exactly who you choose to serve.
And more importantly who you choose, not to because if you think about the definition of strategy, which is how you allocate limited resources against unlimited opportunities, this is a strategic decision.
4:55
You have the opportunity to sell certain people and take their money.
But because of your limited resources, you choose not to sell to those people that is strategy.
So, after diving really deep in the process, I got it. 80/20 you sell more of the 20.
If you sell four times more of the 20, you make a lot more money, got it.
5:11
But how do I actually do that?
And so I went Really deep on this reading.
Lots of different SAS metrics book, so I could come down to a simple process that I could apply to every single company in our portfolio at acquisition.com.
Now at the time when I learned this, I only had three businesses which is prestige Labs Jim launch, and Alan and I'll show you the four steps that we used and what happened after we implement this at gym.
5:30
Watch the first step is that you survey all of your existing customers past and present.
If you can't get the past has to respond at the very least, get the current customers respond to the survey to get as many people as possible to fill out the say force them to do it during Live support calls that you have with them.
5:47
So you give it to all your reps and when they hop on with them you have them fill out the survey live with them and that way you can make sure they fill it out correctly and that every single person does it.
If you don't have that many reps, you can get all of your customers on the next support call or whatever it is.
And you can do it all together at once live.
And if you want to have even more engagement, give them a soft benefit for filling it out.
6:05
Some sort of bonus and easy way to do that is to have some sort of content that might be exclusive or mini training or something like that.
That is very Work, very tangible value and you give them that as a bonus just for completing it on the survey.
You want to ask every relevant detail that you want to know and explain what those are in a second.
6:23
So first thing we asked in the survey is demographics.
Who are they age?
Gender political affiliation, geographic location?
Are they single or divorced?
Do they have a partner or multiple partners in their business?
The second is before-and-after stats.
So you can think about this from a business to business business or a business to Consumer business.
6:42
Either way, it works, X.
So in a B2B business you would be like revenue and profit before revenue and profit.
After number of employees before number of employees after their turn before, they started working with you, their turn after their pricing before their pricing after every relevant metric.
6:59
Number of new clients, lifetime value.
All of these things would be question that we would ask on the survey for the business debts or the personal stats, you can just think of this as results.
The next is aspirations which is what do they actually want to have accomplished when they bought your thing?
7:16
What was their envisionment of what job was to be done by you and the services or products you have that they hired you for you'd be surprised by how different the answers might be this one form.
Lots of stuff that I'll get to later.
The next is the buying process was there a specific trigger that caused them to buy when they were thinking about the decision?
7:36
What were the variables that they were considering and what was the moment that they decided to do?
And what was that variable?
Was there a specific testimonial that consumed was there?
A number of pieces of content?
They consumed was there a specific piece in general that they consume that force them or cause them to want to buy.
7:52
Where did they see us first?
Did someone refer them?
These are all relevant questions, so we can start get an idea of who this person is.
The second step is that you now sort, by the customers who have spent the most money with you.
So you have all the survey results.
Step one, step two is that you sort the results by the people who have spent At the most with you and for the purposes, what of this exercise take the top, 20% it ignore the rest step 3 and this is the money part, is that you see what they have in common.
8:22
And so the idea here is to find the fewest threads that they all share.
Because ideally, if you could just find one thing that's a little bit weird that they all had it massively narrows it down.
So for example, they all said they were from a certain town that would allow you to laser focus your messaging, your Getting all on that town.
8:41
If that was just the one thing that they all had to come.
That would be amazing.
That's not always the case.
So oftentimes it's two or three things that they all share.
And this is, we're going through doing the boring work, reading every one of the responses of that 20% to see what are the needs.
They had, where do they come from?
8:57
What is the business sighs?
How old was the business?
How old are they?
That you start to see common factors?
Step 4 is that you execute against these new qualifiers.
So there's two important things.
The execution process.
The first is how you speak.
9:13
You will change all of your messaging to specifically talk to these three or four qualifiers that they all share.
So you'll be really upfront with your new customer requirements and you'll be up front in your marketing of who you serve and who you do not serve.
If you know that, it's only people who are doing twenty thousand dollars a month.
9:31
Out of Minnesota who are conservative leaning.
You can do that and that becomes your new messaging, that means that everybody who's not in that bucket.
Will be repelled by your marketing but the people that are in that bucket will be even more magnetized towards you.
Because now everybody up to this point came into your business, by accident.
9:50
Now they will be becoming in your business by Design.
You'll also still catch some of the bad customers they have before.
This now means that you have to have a new level of discipline, meaning if someone comes in and they're not from Idaho and they twenty thousand dollars a month and politically leaning, whatever way you want, you'd actually turn them down and you say sorry.
10:10
If you don't meet our requirements for becoming a customer and that's because you did the math and, you know, that they're not worth it compared to these other customers.
There were three, four, five times more.
The second step of education is reverse engineering, the sales process.
You look at the reasons that the best customer said they bought and you look at where they came from, you increase the volume of effort on the channels that the best customers came in from.
10:32
And then you look at the reasons that they chose to buy.
What were the trigger events?
What were the things that they consume, what was the number of pieces of content?
And then we start to try Recreate the best customers buying experience rather than having happened on accident.
Here's a little tip of why this makes you so much more money for no more work.
10:49
You make far more money because of how much more valuable they are.
Not because of how much more valuable you are, but if you sell to a more qualified customer you, in a very real way can make them more money for the same work.
So if I did cro.
So conversion rate optimization for an e-commerce business that is doing a million dollars a year and I added 10% they would go from one.
11:10
Nine dollars a year to 1.1 million dollars a year.
Now if I did that same work at a business that's doing a hundred million dollars a year, they would go from 100 million to 110 million.
So same work I made a hundred thousand dollars of value here.
I mean ten million dollars of value here.
Who do you think I can charge more this guy?
11:27
Which one was more work?
Neither they were the same work but I get 100 times the output so it wasn't because of us, it's because of them.
And so if we pick the right customers were able to charge significantly more and it's because Really are in a real way, providing more value.
11:43
So, usually, at this point, I get the question.
What if I have no customers, how can I do this survey and reverse segmentation of the customers to figure all this stuff out?
Well, there's a reason that y combinator one of the best startup incubators out.
Their picks Founders, who have past experience in the industry that they're trying to pursue and that should make sense because there's a lot of depth of experience that just comes through osmosis from being in an industry, for a long period of time and rather than trying to have someone.
12:10
Have the Steep learning curve.
It's better that they already know the industry lingo, the beliefs of that industry and the common problems that that particular Avatar is suffering from.
So the fast track for somebody's new.
So this is you who doesn't have any customers just to start with an industry that you are know something about.
Most of us have at least some inside knowledge due to friends, our parents, what they did.
12:30
Like you'd be amazed that if your father was a mechanic.
How much you know about cars just by growing up in a household where your father does a certain thing, right?
Or if you had certain jobs growing That were in certain industries.
You'd be amazed at how much you know, compared to somebody who wasn't in that industry, right?
12:45
Like I know nothing about cars but a friend of mine is dad's a mechanic.
He says all this stuff about cars, carburetor, whatever, I have no idea what he's talking about, but he thinks it's ridiculous that I don't know but I just wasn't around that.
Both my parents were eye.
Doctors of different kinds.
I know a ton of stuff about eyes for no reason, but me hearing them talk about it.
13:05
And so if you can pick something that you have, some relevant industry experience.
Or tangential experience through people, you know.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
13:22
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
13:42
And so fundamentally, the idea is that we always want to pick the people that we feel like we can serve the most and create the most value for.
So if you were like, I don't know, I have three different backgrounds.
It's like, okay, well of this three different people which of those subsets.
Do you think you could help the most?
That's the person.
You should help because if you can help that person the most, it means that you can charge the most and ultimately make the most money.
14:02
And if you're worried about like wouldn't that mean I'm only going to be able to serve very narrow customer.
That's right.
And that's the point because you're not going to try and compete with the biggest companies.
The world who already have all the operational infrastructure To crush you, you're just going to say, I'm not going to beat them at everything.
I'm just going to take strategy, limited resources, unlimited opportunities.
14:18
I'm going to go laser-focused on this one person, and I think that I could beat the best company in the world at this tiny slice and then piece by piece, you'll expand that.
But for right now, if you're starting out, you focus on that slice and you learn that slice, like the back of your hand, that's how you can win.
And once you start serving those customers, guess what?
14:36
You can run this process and then find the 80/20 in those customers.
So here's what happened after we implemented this process at Jim watch.
So we surveyed.
Our customers.
We sorted for the ones that had the.
Most money had spent the most money with us and then we saw it.
They all had in common that steps one through three step four was execution.
14:54
And so, this is what we found from a demographic standpoint, our customers were right-leaning and conservative, which is pretty common for small business owners.
They were married.
They were male, they were 25 to 45 and they were mostly US based Business-wise the best gym owners that we worked with how to sign release date at least one employee.
15:13
They were doing at least ten thousand dollars a month when they came to us and they had at least 30 customers.
So those are the business statistics that we saw that they all had in common, you'll note that I said there was a lot more questions that we asked.
That's right, but not all of those were in common which means not all of them were important and that's okay.
15:29
You ask a lot more questions than you may ultimately use because the whole point is to narrow it down to the fewest commonalities, their aspirations were to have a million-dollar Jim At work so much inside of Jim, stop teaching sessions and open more locations, and the reasons that they bought was that they didn't have enough leads.
15:45
They had a bad location.
They weren't making enough money, and they couldn't find good employees.
And so, here's where got really interesting the last piece that they all had in common was that they had each consumed.
It was 78 percent of them had consumed, at least two long-form pieces of content prior to making a purchase.
16:03
This is really important because when we get to the last step of reverse engineering, the sales process.
We're going to force that to happen.
So in step four, I said execution, there's two things that change one.
Is how you talk to your audience, which is your new more refined Avatar and second how you reverse engineer the sales process.
16:20
So the first thing we did was all of our messaging change to all of our marketing.
We stop talking about aspiring gym, owners trainers, Fitness, professionals, whatever and we got laser focused on gym owners that had a signed lease.
We're doing ten thousand dollars a month or more had at least one employee and 30 minimum customers all of a sudden.
16:36
And when we talk about Is if you're this person and what do they want aspirations?
They wanted a million-dollar Jim.
What are the reasons they bought.
If you want to stop suffering from not having enough leads from not knowing where to get your next employees and from not making enough at the end of the month, right?
So they outlined where they are what they want, and the things they're struggling with and so we changed all of that into our marketing messaging and said it very clearly on every step of our process.
17:00
Our ad set at the video, set it, the creative set at the landing pages, said at the application set it, the phone team said, it, everybody said it.
The way across the company.
So everyone could understand exactly who we serve and most importantly, again, who we don't, we just everyone who's not that.
So, once we found out that the trigger or the thing that they also had in common, from a buying perspective, is that 78% of them had at least consumed to long-form pieces of content?
17:25
We then said, okay, the people who spend the most money with us and stay with us, the longest to the ones for the most pre sold on coming to us.
All right.
Well, then let's force that to happen.
And so what we did was he injected Multiple long-form pieces of content into the sales process itself.
17:40
So we'd Force everybody to consume to long-form pieces of content to make them just like the people who spend the most money and stayed the longest.
On top of that, we started out putting more content specific to the struggles that they said in the surveys.
So each of those pain points, we started making much more content around solving each of those things.
17:58
And then to go even higher or deeper on this, what we did was we created an all-time Greatest Hits list or Excel sheet of the content.
That was the reasons that people cited as the reasons they chose to buy.
And so my sales team had a list of every single piece of content.
18:15
There was, are the ones that they said, were decision-maker pieces of constant or Milestone content.
And then they had that sorted by, you know, the headline of the thing, the link and then the reason.
And so, when they got on a call, when we would inject that, you long-form pieces of content, they'd be the ones that were relevant to the problems that they wanted to solve.
18:32
And so that gave my sales team, a sales or value, cheat sheet that they could give to customers Or prospective customers to consume.
So that would be even more laser targeted in the problems that were solving value in advance before asking for money, and showing our expertise, that we really knew how to solve their problems.
18:49
And by doing that, we forced every Prospect to go through the ideal buying Prospect of our best prospects.
And so we therefore transformed or manufactured the best customers out of the raw material of prospects.
So it's both from selecting better people with our messaging.
19:05
So we got attracted the right people and With that raw material.
We manufactured them into the ideal person, whose closable and pays the most, and stays the longest.
And as a side note, I want to be very clear the valuable content, the long-form pieces of content, we provided them were not disguised sales pitches.
19:23
They were literally just valuable content that truly solve the problem.
It was demonstration of expertise.
That is what we were doing.
A lot of times people try and sell too hard when oftentimes sales if you have to sell really hard, it's A result of poor branding, it means that you don't have enough good.
19:39
Will you haven't provide enough value in advance.
And so the easiest thing to sell more is provide more value before you ask.
And this way, you can manufacture that Goodwill with a process.
So I'm going to give you a comparison between the difference of what happened with our metrics, compared to another business that was in the same spaces.
19:54
Us that hadn't gone through this process.
So while back I was approached to buy an equity stake in a company that was similar in the same space is us because they thought that it would be a strategic purchase for us.
They would benefit from Brand, we have benefit from some things from them etcetera.
And so, in the diligence process, I get to look at all their numbers and this is what's crazy.
20:14
Once we dove into the numbers, it turned out that they were selling the exact same amount of customers per month is US.
Same number of customers but he was making 70 times less profit than me.
Yes, 70 times less 70.
20:30
In spoiler, it wasn't because we were brilliant.
It's because selling to the right.
People works and compounds unto itself because not only Lee do you actually have a lower cost of acquisition?
Oftentimes because you're more specific in your messaging your sales process becomes more choreograph to the needs of that specific type of customer.
20:46
So you get them in more laser targeted, you convert them at higher percentages.
And once they're in all of your onboarding offer fulfillment is far more perfectly tailored to their specific situation rather than having to be far more General and create less value.
21:01
Because you can't be a specific or tailored with recommendations for the business or for the services you provide.
So, the big difference was, they accepted anyone with a pulse and a credit card and as a result, their customer success team was always flooded with complaints and churn and people left as fast as they came.
21:19
Which is part of the reason they wanted me to buy in to try and help them fix this into a certain degree because they were more generalized.
It kind of forced this and so people try and solve all of these other problems in the business rather than thinking, what is the most strategic thing I can do.
Maybe I should stop serving.
All the people who suck and you drain all the resources from us, And actually make very tailored solutions to the best customers.
21:41
And so, that's ultimately what we did.
If you think about it from a percentage standpoint, we were only serving a very, very small percentage of the entire Fitness industry because that means that we couldn't serve any trainers.
We couldn't serve any people who want to do Fitness as a profession or wanted to go online.
We didn't do any of that stuff and we didn't even serve all specific types of Jim's.
21:57
We actually even found out more detailed over time that we serve micro gym owners and we served health club Owners.
Those are the two segments that we serve very, very well.
Everyone like Bar Studios, lasso cycling less.
So, and it wasn't because our model didn't work was actually psychographic, people who are yoga e, people don't usually Vibe with me.
22:18
All right, and my style of doing things and it didn't and it didn't work with our style of doing business, not the mechanics of the business different.
It was just they didn't Vibe with our culture.
And so there are multiple layers to demographics.
You also have psychographic.
That's where the political leaning, things like that.
Those are things that affect who buys and what your messaging comes out us.
22:36
So as a result, we ignored everyone that wasn't our perfect customers and we were rewarded with higher gross.
Margins premium pricing longer retention rates, more referrals, more, repeat business.
And the crazy thing about this is that my business and this other guys business were serving the same Market, but it different Avatar.
22:56
And as a result, got monstrously different results, this stuff matters and many competitors tried to copy everything that we were doing.
They try to ER ads they try to copy our landing pages.
They try to copy our sales process but the problem was they wouldn't commit.
23:12
They would panic and they would cut out steps.
They would cut out filters.
They would cut out qualifiers.
In order to make the short Buck.
They wouldn't hold the line and most times they paid very dealer for it because they wouldn't make as much money.
And as a result, they could never outcompete us and as a tangent in my experience.
23:28
Every time I've cut out qualification steps, my volume has gone up, but my quality has gone down.
And then what ends up ultimately happening, is that I make actually, Dollars per unit of advertising or promotion that we put in.
So, even if I get half the calls booked for x amount of effort, of outbound dials of content of whatever, my actual throughput on sales, even if I had more calls with higher quantity, the net.
23:51
Net sales would drop every time.
You remove filters, one of the other things that we did, as a result of this was that we actually kind of merged marketing and sales and time of an acquisition department.
And we did that because when we just had it marketing, they would focus on getting more.
Right.
The sales guys wanted more but they also wanted better.
24:09
And so, it was always this constant battle, but when we kind of put the Department's together, it was much more about.
Okay, how much are we spending?
How many sales are we making?
And so, we wouldn't obsess about having way more opt-ins because the marketing people would look at the same metrics and salespeople, which is how many deals do we close.
And so by putting them together to lined all the teams.
24:27
And now we use the optimal amount of steps to generate the most sales.
And so, the amount of people who try to copy what we're doing and then panic because it couldn't get the And they'd remove a step.
They thought they were being clever.
We tried that it doesn't work.
The amount of steps that we had in the process, is the exact amount of steps to get the highest return on the inputs of time effort and money.
24:47
For example, I would rather pay five thousand dollars to acquire 45,000 our customer then pay $1000 to acquire. 5000.
Our customer and that's a trade that is easy for me to say, in very hard for other people.
Replicate once they see their ads, been go up a little bit or their number of Outreach temps, go up, they lower the bar, they lower the bar that take the quick money and they can never get that compounding machine going because they always still sacrifice and then they create more problems on the back end.
25:13
They can never get the momentum.
The business going, knowing your ideal customer Journey forces patients.
You begin to see the business holistically rather than, as a widget to be sold to as many people as humanly possible.
The latter is how new be entrepreneurs.
Think don't think like that to give some context because I've looked at acquiring a lot of businesses in the gym and fitness industry, the average TB or lifetime value that most competitors in that space gain is about six to eight thousand dollars per customer in a B2B SMB market, so small business owner Market.
25:45
Our lifetime value is north of 45,000 now, despite our LTV being only six to eight times higher the subsequent margins are breathtakingly different.
So, if you imagine the cost of fulfilling might be the same or maybe 50% higher, but you can make six to eight times more money per customer.
26:01
You make breathtaking amounts more.
And so, for a moment, I want you to imagine Legend what eight times your price if you ate extra price right now and you have the same amount of customers, how much more money would go to your bottom line.
Just think about it for a second, probably a lot that's the difference and that's why it's worth it.
26:18
Now once you narrow down your focus, you will serve fewer customers in the short term, you have to be prepared for that emotionally.
So that may mean in the short term, a decrease in revenue.
And as a side note, the fastest way to build a 10 million dollar thing isn't always.
The fastest way to build a hundred million dollar thing.
26:34
Sometimes, you got to take a step back before you can say.
Ten steps forward.
But over the long haul, you will get more attention, more pricing power more profitability, more repeat business, and ultimately, sometimes even lower cost of acquisition once everything gets dialed in unless you're planning on quitting.
This business long term, why wouldn't you start doing the best long-term decisions today, right?
26:53
So I'm gonna give you a little tip about making a lot of money.
You want to sell to people who don't stop, buying fortunes are created when we sell stuff that people won't stop giving us money for.
So, our goal should be to either.
Improve our products.
Such that they don't stop buying or limit our Avatar.
27:11
So, we only serve the people who have those traits either solution, Works know.
There's a reason that companies that serve Enterprise or Fortune 500 or Fortune 100 companies, get the highest multiples when they sell.
It's because those customers are the most valuable and they stay the longest and pay the most serving, a better customer makes you a better business.
27:33
See if for actions to take as a result of this, because if you watch something and you do not change your behavior, it means you learn nothing.
So there's four things you do.
Number one, is that you survey your existing customers, you ask the questions and you can add more questions that survey number two is that you for strength, those customers based on who is paid you the most in stay, the longest overtime.
27:50
Number three is, you do a common factor analysis, this is the part where you use your brain, you got to look and see.
What do these people have in common, where they came from, how much they spent, how big they were, how long they were in business number of Partners political leaning?
Ever it is you start to narrow these down and see how much of that. 20%, the top 20, ignore the 80 what they have in common.
28:10
Then step four is to execute the two-part.
Plan one is the front end.
In terms of the messaging, you only talk to the specifics and you cut out anyone who is not meeting those requirements.
The moment you budge is the moment, the strategy falls on itself second half is the buying process.
Is that you reverse engineer?
28:26
What were the triggers that cause these people to buy in the top 20%?
And then you force all of these higher quality prospects to go through an identical.
Process over the long haul, this will increase both the quality and the quantity of the lead flow that comes into your business.
And the duration of the time, the people will stay and pay for you and the pricing power that you're able to charge because in a real way do provide more value to them.
28:47
Growing a business comes down to either selling more customers or making them worth more this process accomplishes.
Both you get more clients because your marketing becomes far, more tailored to the specific type of people that spend the most money.
And then by extension, the people that come into the This are now the people who are worth significantly more and so you have two multipliers on the business which is why we're making 70 times more profit, not just two or three times the profit that a competitor selling the same amount of units as we were in the same space.
29:14
Was this may feel like cheating because it's so obvious.
But here's the crazy part, no one.
Does it because it's a four-letter word, and it sounds like, work.
Getting this process, right?
And doing this, research will act as a force multiplier.
Everything else you do in the business in terms of the efficiency of your advertising promotion.
29:32
Efforts and the efficiency of your team and how much value you provide and all of that compounds onto itself into reinforcing your brand, which hopefully is what you're trying to build, this is just one of the handful of processes that we do it.
Acquisition.com for our portfolio companies, which acts as a forcing factor for us to have 3 X increases in profit and 12 months. 4.7 X increases in profits and 24 months of the portfolios that we have.
29:55
Obviously there's a much bigger companies, but just to give you a perspective, like this works at all levels of business,








0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
My investment strategy.
After all of this time has gone completely back to my business strategy which is singular Focus.
Do the things, you know, do more do it better and keep doing that for an extended period of time and it would be unreasonable that you don't win.
0:43
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and Buffett had documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
The game has changed the entire economy has shifted and so too should your investment at least?
1:02
Mine has and so there are three things that you absolutely have to know.
Number one, the way you put your money has to shift because the economy has changed number two, I've taken all my money out of Banks and I'll tell you where I put it instead and it's safer and gets me high returns.
And at the end, I'll explain to you exactly what I'm doing with my money right now, and how it's different from the two, other investment strategy, I've had throughout my life.
1:23
And so if you don't know who I am, my name is Asha.
Mozi.
I own acquisition.com.
There you go.
It's portfolio right now.
There's over 20 million dollars a year.
I cost 100 net worth.
By the time I was 32, I've nothing to sell you.
I make these because I want you to be rich as fuck, and maybe we can partner someday.
That being said, let's get into it.
So, number one, because the economy has changed things are priced differently.
1:43
There's inflationary pressures, real estate is a is hanging on by a thread.
Krypto is crashed Sox, have crashed.
So what is a boy to do?
Well I'll tell you my investment thesis.
First off is what do you do with your cash?
All right, So if you've ever heard Warren Buffett or you hurt people in the news say he has x billion dollars in cash or cash equivalents I never knew what that meant and so I'm going to rewind and explain what actually putting cash in a big count means and why it's important in today's environment.
2:11
So when you put cash into a bank, you're actually writing the bank alone to then loan your money and get something back.
People don't know this, but you actually are a creditor of the bank.
All right, so if a bank goes out of business, they owe you money, right?
You loan them money.
2:26
Now, what happens is the Do one of two things, they will loan it out.
Why?
Actually, they do one thing, they loan money, but they either loan money to the government by buying bonds, right?
Which is buying debt or they will loan it out to people and mortgages and things like that, right?
Or credit lines, for businesses, whatever it is.
2:41
They loan the money out again and they make more than they pay you.
And so right now, if you look at your Bank of America account, they'll pay you between point 1 and 1 percent annually on your money.
Okay.
Boo, that sucks.
Now, here's what's interesting and most important about debt when you loan people money, there are two Factors one is what you going to get back, which is the interest rate and the second is How likely you're going to get it.
3:03
Okay, so the interest rate is if you loan someone of money for a house and it's 5% or whatever.
Then if you put a hundred grand in, you get 5,000 back right.
That's what did you get, 100, plus the extra five.
That's the interest and you get paid that for taking on risk.
All right.
Interest is a function of risk, that's how it works.
Now, this is what's crazy.
3:20
And I didn't understand this, when I was putting my money in the bank, if the bank goes under, you lose all your money outside of the heh.
I see insured amount.
Now, the ftse right now is completely bankrupt anyways, and on top of that, if it exceeds that amount, you get stuck in the bankrupt company whoop-dee-doo, probably not the best outcome you wanted when you wanted to go draw your money down, right?
3:41
Of course not.
So what if there were a better alternative that was lower risk and had higher returns?
I just learned about this and the reason I always ignored it was because it looked boring and ugly.
So, when the bank has your money, I said they loan money out, you know, they loan it to a lot of times the US government.
4:00
Now, why do they do that?
Because the likelihood risk that the government is going to be able to pay them back, extremely high.
Why?
Because they can print the damn money, give it back to him.
Number two is that they are making more than they are paying you.
So they take your money for point, one percent, a year, and then they give it to the government and the government gives them 4% a year.
4:21
So they get 40 times what they pay you by giving the US government money, right?
And What's interesting is that if we were to analyze both one you have a bond from the bank, right?
Because you're putting money in and they pay you a little bit which one of these pays more for percent from a treasury or point one percent from Bank.
4:38
The treasury from the US government.
Now which one is more likely to go out of business bank or the US government?
Well, let's see who's going out of business in the last hundred years Banks or the US government.
Well, more banks have.
So, this is both lower risk and higher return.
4:55
Bingo, ding, ding ding, right?
We have a winner.
Now, the only other reason that you get lower interest here is because the money is immediately accessible, it's liquid.
So you can go tomorrow and get money out, right?
That's how it works there.
But the thing is that treasuries are also immediately tradable.
5:11
So the only other reason that you would get a lower interest rate is because something is more liquid, meaning can trade in and out of it at your desire, whenever you want, right?
A more liquid thing will pay you less because you can get in and out, right?
So here's the thing.
Treasuries are just as liquid as a bank account, Two reasons.
5:28
Number one, because you can take a loan against treasuries in real time you get 80 percent of your money.
So if you put a hundred thousand dollars in bonds and for the US Treasury bonds, t-bills is what they're called.
You can get 80% of that up to at a super low secured interest rate to go and plow into something else.
5:45
Number one, number two, country an entire government's trade in us.
Treasuries, which means that you will never have an amount of money that you can't trade in half a second rallies, like, for example, right now.
If you wanted to trade Bitcoin, you could go and sell it and half a second, right?
6:00
It's not a problem.
If you can get the money t-bills trade even faster than Bitcoin by fucking mile.
All right.
And so, you have immediate access to the money.
It's lower risk because the government's not going to go out of business compared to a bank, it's lower risk, right?
And then you're going to get 40 times the earnings that you are in a big.
6:16
Now, here's an interesting thought for you, instead of putting the money in the bank, and then betting, the bank's going to stay alive, and pay it a little bit.
You could do an identical transaction and just by Bond from Bank of America and get 5% or four point seven percent, from Bank of America and it's literally the same thing.
6:35
You're betting on the fact, they're going to stay there but now they pay you four point seven percent rather than point one percent and the reason you're like, why don't people do this?
Because they don't know.
And the banks are here, like why don't they talk about this?
Because why would they, they are happy to take your money and go make five percent on it and pay you point one?
6:53
That's the business.
Why would they tell people, right?
This is how it works.
So, In this economy, I have shifted to almost all cash.
I've a few ETFs and I'll tell you what I'm actually doing with the money now, and this is important.
So my entire structure of Investments has changed over the last five years, really last ten years.
7:12
The first chunk of my life was SN me, 500.
I put all my excess cash into learning skills, getting access to people coaching, winter, sports, workshops, Etc courses, all of that.
So I could increase my earning capacity, highest return investment, I still have ever made today.
Number one, Number two, once I had more money than I could possibly reinvesting, courses, in coaching whatnot.
7:32
I started plugging into the S&P 500 because that's what Uncle Warren told me to do, forget it work for him, will work for me.
So I pull out all my money into indexes.
That was the next phase of my investing, the third phase.
Came post sale.
All right, so we sold three companies last year and I talked to a bunch of different friends who were very, very wealthy.
7:49
And one of them is a very good investor and he outlined a strategy for me.
They called a barbell strategy, which is I have stocks over here.
I've got Got real estate over here, very little in between and then I just have my private equities of the companies that I own personally, right.
Those are the those are kind of the three different buckets that.
8:07
So I'd make money here and plowed into these to write with basically nothing between.
Now here's the thing that you don't know in the last two years I've maybe made five Investments and those Investments represent in total maybe ten percent of the cash that I have not a lot.
8:25
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, I didn't realize what the problem was until I saw a video from Dave Ramsey and before you cast judgment, you really need to hear this out because it really changed my life and I hope it changes yours.
8:54
So I was watching a video where G Stephen was having Dave Ramsey analyze his Investment Portfolio and he said hey Dave don't you feel like I'm over index on real estate, he said like you know 80 plus percent of my of my net worth is in real estate deals and Dave Ramsey gave one of the wisest responses that I've ever heard an investing and it changed my life.
9:14
He said Said, well, if you put a big circle on the table and I'm Loosely paraphrasing, and we had to say, what percentage of your knowledge is real estate versus stocks and bonds and other stuff.
What would you say it is said, oh well, 85% of what I know is really about real estate.
9:30
He looked at him, he was like, well then that's a perfect distribution for you because it reflects your knowledge.
So, where you invest is what, you know, and so then he went on to say, I have talked to many, many billionaires, probably far more than I have.
I've learned two things from them, we learn many things, but two things from investing, he said, they don't do many things, and the things they pick are things, they understand, and they do a lot of them.
9:54
And for whatever reason, the combination of understanding that in the circle, this is the slice of the pie that he knew and that the people are the richest in the world.
Just pick one game or two games than it really well.
And they do a ton of those games is what changed my perspective?
This as soon as I heard that, I one took all my money and put it into treasuries because I understood Hood that the bank's weren't going to give me anything for it and this is lower risk and gives me a better yield and it's immediately.
10:20
Liquid just better in all accounts and then we decided this is a big deal for me.
I only do private deals and the reason that this became real for me is that I had the biggest deal that I will have done, which I'll tell you about later, maybe a few years from now financially, that normally I wouldn't write a check 1/10 of that size to a real estate deal or an apartment complex or some other thing that I do.
10:45
Understand.
And so I always was banking on other people to be like do I really trust this guy?
How much is he trying to screw me?
What are the fees here?
Where the hidden things?
How do I know this is going to pay off and things just like real estates.
Not my game.
It's not my game.
I'm not a real estate way, it's not my thing.
If you're not a real estate whiz I would recommend not putting all your shit into something that you don't know.
11:06
And so when I got approached for this private deal, it was an industry.
I knew it was an operator that it had a ton of experience.
We had a shared vision of what we want.
To do with the company and the biggest thing, they lack is capital.
And I understood exactly where the capitals going, I knew how he's going to get returns and here's what's crazy, this investment will probably get somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 to 500 percent a year.
11:27
You're like, how is that possible?
It's only possible because it's an incredibly high risk investment.
But it's high risk for somebody who doesn't know what they're doing.
And so Warren, Buffett is two quotes about this that really shifted my perspective.
He said, number one, diversification is a hedge against ignorance.
11:43
It's a hedge against not knowing.
The reason that he tells most people to do the S&P 500's, he realizes the vast majority.
People don't know what they're doing it to the best.
And safest thing to do is just investing everything and just bet on the stock market overall, just bet on the economy growing over time.
You're betting on the stock market, you really betting on a country, you're betting that this country or even the world because many of the companies in the top 500, our Global just that the world will grow.
12:04
That's all you're doing.
The second thing that he said is that it's only risky when you don't know what you're doing.
And so, if you understand the variables and it's funny because as I've gone through this deal, I I told the guys that I imagine you have unlimited Capital, I'm willing to write basically a blank check for you.
If these are the economics at the deal and he said, awesome.
12:23
And I only feel comforted with that because I know where the bodies are buried.
I know what risk to look for.
I know what the upside would do.
I know how I'm going to add value to this deal but in a real estate apartment building, it's not my game.
And so I feel so much more comfortable writing an enormous check because it's a game that I know when I write that circle on the table for me, it's all business.
12:43
And so I will be Sting from the very small percentage of my net worth that's in real estate.
I will hold the equities that I have in ETFs and everything else that I have go straight into treasuries.
And then when big deals come I plowed into the deal and then I repay back my War chest or chest goes back up plowed another deal, repay back the war chest, plowed into another deal that is the investment strategy that I am following.
13:05
And the reason this is so important is that in the economy today you have to do the things you know there's a lot of risk out there right now and so if you're not sure, I I'd say hold and figure out a game that you understand because then you don't have to feel like you're betting, because that's what all I felt like I was doing.
13:25
I felt like I was betting on people and trying to like see between the lines like do I trust this person or not?
Trust this person.
Fuck that find something.
You know, go all in on that one thing.
And this is It's funny because my investment strategy after all of this time has gone completely back to my business strategy which is singular Focus.
13:44
Do the As you know, do more do it better and keep doing that for an extended period of time and it would be unreasonable that you don't win.
So for example, you can go to Robin Hood or whatever exchange you, you invest on.
If you don't order to do that to say like, how do I invest in stocks, you'll be able to download an app that does it.
14:00
You can search treasure or bonds and you will be able to go and buy a bond, is not complicated.
Now, I will give you an advanced strategy though because Mosey Nation love you.
So great strategy for buying bonds is that their maturity dates which means that one is the bond can do.
Ooh, so I was telling you earlier, that liquidity matters a lot.
14:18
So it's like, can I trade in and out of it now, bonds come due.
And when they are due, you're owed the money, plus the interest.
So what you gave them plus, whatever interest was supposed to be out on top of that.
So one strategy is to buy them all at a certain, you know, maturity date and then wait, what we have opted to do is by 6, 12, 18, 24 month, bonds basically go 1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4, and that means that every six months, I get a pop back of Cash Plus interest.
14:41
And then I put it back to another 24 months and so it becomes this cash for cycling.
Machine in the meantime.
So, that is how I do it.
You can still take loans against it, and if you're worried about value of bonds, going up and down, don't because if you do that strategy, you're just backing on the fact that you are going to get the money back.
Don't even have to worry about trading them in and out.
14:58
That's not, you're not at Bond Trader.
It's not the point here.
The point is, you're putting somewhere safer than a bank account that will pay you money.
Pretty much guaranteed unless the government goes under in which case we don't need to worry about the banks are definitely not going to happen.
Yeah.
So if you're a dentist right at a certain point, you will have enough money if you're good at being a dentist.
15:15
East and don't do this until you were good enough of being a dentist that you have a lot of extra money that you could go and buy another dental office.
It's a business, you know?
And what's crazy is that you will get significantly higher Returns on that purchase than you would on the stock market.
So for example, if you wanted to buy a dental office that did a million dollars Top Line and two hundred thousand dollars in bottom line.
15:34
All right, most of these Professional Services businesses, you can get for a little bit of seller financing.
You might only have to put, I don't know one or two times down.
Okay?
Now if you put, let's say One times down, meaning you pay 400 thousand dollars for the business.
15:50
Two hundred thousand dollars comes in seller financing from the person who's selling it to you, they let you pay debt off over time and then two hundred thousand dollars you put in their pocket.
Okay, well, your one, you get your first hundred thousand dollars back, right?
And then your to let's say you pay off the rest of the day, all right?
Well when you did that, your three, you make another sword, a thousand dollars.
16:08
So your rate of return.
There, this is me doing back.
Napkin is basically like 33, 33, 33.
So compared to the stock market etcetera.
You're going to do way better now.
If you know the business that's just assuming it stays the same.
But if you're better at business than the other dentist is, right?
Because that's maybe why you're buying the business, then you might be able to overnight double that and then all of a sudden, you're one, you pay back everything and your to, you make 400 right versus your 200.
16:34
So now, on a two-year basis, you already doubled your money in two years and here's what's even crazier.
You doubled your money on a cash basis.
But now you own your dental practice Their dental practice and the combined value of those things is even higher that in either of those individually and you still own those.
16:52
And so your total net worth based on the equity value of those companies has grown tax-free this whole time and you already put the cash back in your pocket.
That's where you get competitive advantages of knowing the game you're in.
So if you're like, well, Alex, I don't know, a ton about business.
17:09
Cool.
If you recall, I went through three steps in my investing phase.
All right.
So the first one, I was investing in you, right, investing in increasing your skill set, which is later going to be compounded because we talk about leverage all the time.
How do I get more for?
What I put in, you're going to invest in a skill set and then when you get better at it, you might end up start doing Deals, Only around that stack of skills that you acquire but phase one learn shit phase two when you have earnings but not enough to really get into the big investing world.
17:37
You can Cloud into the SP and diversify risk, because you still don't know what you're doing at.
You still have cash flow in excess of what you can reinvest in your, in your education.
But you still not like a Super G yet.
Right at investing, not saying I am you get my point.
All right, the third phase is, okay, I'm making so much money from the game.
17:53
I'm in that.
It makes more sense and it's less risky for me to do more of this game than the stock market.
And then that is where you build the crazy long.
And so, that's what I would consider to be the three.
Step step one, invest in you step to, invest excess and indexes, basically, to wait as a holding pattern, keeps stockpiling the war, chest up.
18:14
And then when you feel like you're Good enough at the game, your main game, then you have the stockpile and you can deploy it and then that starts the compounding machine.
And so when you're like I'm not sure if I'm getting the leverage, I need on the skills, I'm learning right now.
That's not the point right now.
You're learning the shit so that later you can lever the crap out of it in conjunction with capital and then you blow up








0:00
For me, a very core belief that has been I think intrinsic to at least the material success that we've experienced has been a belief that meaning is self-described.
So that there is no inherent meaning in the things that we do or the actions, we take or the outcomes that happen, but only that, which we ascribe to it.
0:19
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $209 and Beyond, I hope you share and enjoy.
I want to Dive Right In.
0:36
If somebody is starting from scratch, what are the traits skill sets that they should be cultivating in order to up the odds of their success?
They should focus on one thing in general, rather than lots of different things that you're not sure about because if you're starting out, everything looks like an opportunity.
0:52
So the correct answer is all of them are opportunities but all of them won't work unless you pick one, right?
See if the C note all the other Mistresses.
So boom you pick one and then from there I would say six figures is sell something.
Someone that's it.
And if you want more detail, sell something to someone.
1:08
So it's one Avatar, one product, one channel.
So you don't have to figure out how do I create 20 pieces of content across?
It's like just pick one channel, one media Source whether it's Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, you know, whatever Twitter consistently start going on that whether that's called outbound, whether that's content with its running, paid ads, whether its Affiliates Word of Mouth, whatever it is, and start reaching out to people there to start selling your stuff.
1:31
And so if you can just do that consistently and I use something all right, What's the skill set?
That's going to make somebody a good.
And this is six figures still.
Yeah.
So what's the skill set in that?
Is it getting good at the outbound?
Is it getting good at saying?
No to the other stuff.
Like how do we translate that into a skill set?
1:47
You have to learn how to advertise, which I defined as the process of making known.
So how do you let other people know about the stuff you saw you have to advertise their six ways to do it?
I covered five just now so there's there's six ways you can do it and then once people engage with whatever advertisement you have, you have to sell them.
2:03
So advertising is the first skill selling them.
The second skill and then product would be the third skill which is the thing that you're at ultimately advertising and selling e.
Okay?
So that gives us six figures, what gets the seven doing the same thing consistently.
So usually once people do it in the beginning, their sporadic, they're not consistent with it.
2:19
Just to act of doing the same thing every day.
Usually gets people to 100,000 a month, which sounds crazy to probably people listening, but most people who think that's crazy.
Also haven't done it consistently for an extended period of time.
And so I use something that I call the roll 100, which is hundred primary Actions whether it's 100 minutes of concentration per day 100 Reach Out, spurred a $100 ad spend per day.
2:43
Like you have to pick one of them but 100 per day, you do that for 100 days and I promise you'll have you'll be making six figures if you do that, most people won't.
Yeah, I know, you know, that if I fail at something then what is the most common thing that you see, people fail?
3:00
So, you give them the blueprint, your ability to articulate, a blueprint to success.
Is insane legitimately insane, dude.
When I so I'm going to make a prediction right now.
Five years from now in this space you will be one of the biggest people on social media, 100%, guaranteed, YouTube podcast, whatever.
3:18
Because your advice is real.
And I said I was about to tell you something and I said I'm going to say it on camera and I will tell you right now I judge everybody that comes on the show by when I'm doing the research to bring you on which is a way bigger time investment than the interview itself.
Did I actually learn something?
3:34
Did I move forward to?
I enjoy myself dude.
It was awesome researching.
You is awesome.
It was good for the business.
It's good for the soul, good for the mindset, everything.
So this is going to be incredible.
But where do people fall down?
Because most people even knowing how articulate you are and know that people are still going to fail is crazy.
3:54
And I know that most people are going to felt so where, where do people really struggle in that equation?
I think it's fear mostly and are, that's not a skill, but I think it's a character trait and so people are afraid of value.
No, not getting validated, or they're afraid of judgment, that they perceive from other people that exist or don't exist in their lives.
4:15
And so, for whatever reason they have this, second voice, that criticizes everything they do that in reality isn't even there, but is constantly present.
It's like the antithesis of whatever the god figure is, but just the negative voice.
And so, I think that's the thing that stops most people from doing the stuff.
4:30
They know they need Because if you think about like whether it's want to get in shape or I would have a better marriage, I want to make more money.
Most people on some level at a basic level, they know what to do and my proof point of like even making money, right?
Most of us have had a bill that came up, that was unexpected attacks, Bill a car, breaks down a health thing, whatever it is, and we find a way.
4:50
And so when it's for someone else, people are used actual resourcefulness that they have to make the money.
But for whatever reason, they won't use that same resourcefulness to make it for themselves.
And so I think that most people Know, if they want to work out, it starts to get in shape to lose weight, whatever.
They know they need to eat fewer donuts and move more in general, but they don't write because they're afraid of getting started or they don't have the discipline to keep going, which is the can make the short-term sacrifice for the long-term achievement.
5:15
So, big picture.
It's like, there's usually some fear that's preventing from doing it.
And then how it looks from a behavioral standpoint is they do not make the short-term sacrifice of discomfort for the long-term achievement independent of whatever path.
They're talking about, you guys are going to want to say to the end.
I'm going to give you my Red Alex quote.
5:32
But now I'm going to give you one that I actually think pertains to this.
So you said how to stay poor assume, you're always right?
Yes.
And when I think about people failing, it's because in fact, there's another quote, this one I didn't write down but I'm going to get close marketing is just a fancy nine-letter word for tests.
5:50
And once people understand you're going to fail and you're going to fail a lot if you can't deal with that failure.
Yeah, if you think that failing makes you a failure, if you Think that it's a permanent state of being and you're never going to get better.
Then you won't do the things you need to do to ultimately be successful.
6:06
You talk about consistency, but it isn't just consistency because if you do it wrong, yeah, consistently.
You're still the fail, right?
So this is you have to be in my own language willing to stir nakedly.
I your inadequacies.
And if you can stare nakedly at your inadequacies then you can actually get better.
6:24
If you're running the tests, they're like hey looking at the data to this work or did this not work on a person?
Then you can actually improve.
Move.
But you went through this.
So in the beginning of your career and this is one of the things I find most interesting about your story, is you failed.
6:40
You actually pulled your now-wife aside and said I'm a sinking ship and if you wanted to leave I would completely understand.
Yeah.
How did you go from that to?
Like there was something you figured out.
What, what is that thing you figured out?
6:58
The reality of my situation was so Bleak that I honestly didn't even process the reality of my situation because the more I thought about it like the Saturn more hopeless, I would feel.
And so I focused on the few things that were under my control, which was like, I can do these things.
And so when I talk about advertising, let's talk about selling.
7:16
I talk about those things, boiled down to the actual actions, because I had to think of it in that way because it's the only way that it wasn't overwhelming.
It's like I just have to make a hundred reach out, so I just have to spend $100 a day and I have to look at the ad.
Ads and I have to turn off the ones that are bad and do more of the stuff that starts to work.
7:32
And that was the process of getting me from kind of like dark to a better outcome.
But I mean, from that actual point we did the only thing we knew how to do which is it market and sell.
And that was that was how we got out of that sand, honestly, that that single skill of being able to generate leads independent of the industry, has been like my get-out-of-jail-free card which is allowed me to fail over and over and over again until finally.
7:54
You know I got it right.
And even after that one, when we were at the Rock Bottom there, I had just, you know, 90 days earlier, got a DUI.
My mom was in the hospital, really bad shape.
That's when I had just lost all the money, which is when I pulled her aside, but then fast forward six months, basically repeated the cycle again, which is we had started doing these launches, where he'd fly out and, and turn gyms around, like, Bar Rescue, but for Jim's.
8:18
And when we were out there, all of a sudden, we came back home, and we saw like to the gyms refunded, all of the transactions, they just told the people, they could just sign up through them and just do it for Half the rate.
After we had already spent the money to hotels and flights and all the ad spend and everything, a whole month of work.
And so, basically, all the money that we had saved up in that, like, I think we're out of jail, free lost it all again.
8:40
And only, then did we accidentally pivot into the licensing model which ended up becoming the thing that was like the first very big success that we had.
But like that whole period of time was five years of basically not having anything even though on paper when I had the gyms, I materially look successful because we had six locations, but I Just put all my money back into each, you know, each new location side, very little actual cash, as asset rich and cash, poor, I know.
9:06
And so, but then, when I lost everything after that, because I sold them took the money, put in the new adventure, in the lost it.
I was like, wait, I just lost five years because I had nothing to show for it and so, that's probably what would has created a lot of the hypothesis.
I have.
Now round, I didn't lose the five years, I lost the assets where we're, which were not the most valuable thing that I had earned over that time.
9:26
It was the skills.
The experience is the character traits because I still had those.
And then using those three things, I was able to do the next thing.
Fortunately, yeah, I'm obsessed with learning and it's interesting because I've had the level of success that I've had and because I'm technically, middle-aged just crazy to say, I used to be the kid, I swear to God, there's a gravitational Center in my brain.
9:50
That wants me to think that I have crossed some line and that it's about looking backwards and Some really dangerous like you have to be looking for.
I mean God willing, I've got you know another 40 plus years of life left and every time that I get in that trap, it's I just really anchor around.
10:13
Well I'm still learning like all this fun 46, but I've learned so much.
I failed so many times and I've acquired so much knowledge and skill set and all of that and then you can think about oh cool like it's long as I've got the energy to keep pushing to keep building because I have to your earliest point about what makes you successful.
10:32
It's the that is literally My Kryptonite is I have a very hard time accepting the fact that I can do anything I want with my life but not everything.
Yeah and that I find deeply distressing but like on a level that borders on mental illness.
10:49
Yeah and by focusing cutting out the other stuff and recognizing okay I've reinvented myself again.
But a lot of that knowledge is going to transfer its going to be useful as I push forward but getting obsessed with learning like that would be the gift if I could give to people and say.
11:08
Okay you you want to be successful.
I get it.
Everybody wants it right now but if you can stack these skills, like then if you've got the skill set and the methodology that you know, you and others can really lay out incredibly well.
11:24
It's like now you can do something, but if you have the methodology but not the skill, Or you don't have the mindset and so you're broken by the failure or you don't have the methodology if you're missing any one of those.
Yeah, then you end up in a death spiral.
So it's interesting.
We're seeing with the learning thing because I think a lot of people have said like the early because I also have like I feel like two parts of the audience's that like follow my stuff.
11:46
I've got the business owners who are trying to sell their businesses, Etc.
And then I've got all the people want to start a business and usually, they're a little bit younger and whatnot.
And I think there's a misnomer around, like education and so on.
Lot of them, I don't know how exposed I can be, but like they mentally masturbates watching lots and lots of videos, they, you know, want the pump up features, they buy the tickets to the things, and so they just learn.
12:09
And I think that, they think that exposure to information is learning.
And I don't think that's true, or at least, it hasn't been for me, so I'm not sure.
So, you know, because I'm sure you get asked all the time like what are the books that you know, transform your life.
And I've had a handful of books that have been useful to me but I would say 99% of the things that I have learned.
12:27
Or they're doing.
And so, when I do the original rule of 100 and whatnot, it's because I think it's the most effective way to learn which is, you force yourself to on the one controllable that you have, which is the activities that you can take and then it goes with the underlying assumption that you go off feedback and you're like, well, that opening message did not work.
12:46
Yeah.
And then I think most people would have a dramatic underestimation of how much volume it takes to be successful independent of the thing right there.
Like, okay, I should go on five dates in the find.
The girl I'm going to marry what if it was 5:00 Madrid to find the right girl?
You're going to marry or I want to you know, start this this new Channel, I want a bonus become an influencer or whatever it is, and they start doing, you know, one post a day for four weeks and they're like, why am I not famous yet?
13:11
And they find, I mean real, right true.
And they find out that like, you know, we ended up doing four hundred episodes before we made it to the top 10 on the podcast thing.
And now we start doing, you know, 100 plus pieces of content a week and it's just this volume game.
13:28
You get the, the skill from the volume, the feedback from the volume, and there's all these, like little things.
I'm sure it's like from the exercise world, because you come from that.
Like, when you squat first time, you squat your, you're orienting yourself to your drop, your barely actually squatting, you're just looking like, you have a bar in your back, but you learn so much between that first rep in your 10,000 threat of squats.
13:48
And so, I think for most people, it's like, my goal, like, you is that the learning is like, if I can just decrease the action threshold for people to begin and be okay with the fact that they're going to suck and it is okay.
A to Sock it is you should expect to suck and it would be unreasonable for you to be good if you haven't done it before.
And so it's like, are you asking the universe to be unreasonable for you by expecting to be good on your first try?
14:10
And I think that's where a lot of people to the expectation that destroys their ability to be successful because they expect to win on the first shot and no one does do you worry at all about people wanting to be on camera right from the jump because that puts an expectation to be good that?
Yeah, that's rough.
So many feelings about this.
14:27
So God, you've got this whole Space, right?
And you look at like if you're like I want to be a business influencer, right?
What's like?
We look at the guys who are actually the top of the business game and virtually everyone, you Andy Ed Gary.
All those guys have killed it in business and most of them even Gary had gone to 60 million a year before he made his first content.
14:47
And so I think the issues that people look at that and say I should make content like them, when you don't have, you can't answer the underlying question.
Which is, why should I listen to you?
Which is always in the back of every audience is mine in.
My opinion, at least that's what I think.
Like when someone's like a relationship expert my find out they've been divorced three times only.
Yeah you know maybe not right.
15:04
I mean and as terrible as it is, they might be giving amazing advice but it doesn't pass the first filter which is if I'm going to take military strategy from someone, I'd rather have a general that has a winning record.
Even if the other guy Napoleon said, I'd rather have lucky generals.
So even if he had to there were even you'd rather have the lucky one.
And so to the same degree, I think people use that filter because actually takes less effort to learn from someone that you trust.
15:24
And so it's like if you've got the basement teacher, that's telling you to dollar cost.
Averaging the Some pig and you've got Warren Buffett who's telling people to dollar cost averaging, the SMP.
They don't want to listen to the teacher even if the teacher is better objectively from a constant a point because they just don't know if they should trust them.
So you have to have two filters.
I'm hearing thing, should I trust a thing with Warren?
15:41
You can just plug into whatever.
He's saying, just take it as truth, which takes less effort.
And so I think most people don't get that point.
And so I think you should advertise the stuff that you sell, let people know about what you're doing, but it should be about the true expertise that you have which is oftentimes just talking about the stuff you're doing rather than I'm saying you should be doing this.
15:59
This is what I am doing.
Hope you find it interesting.
Hope you find it valuable and I think that's a big Dynamic which it first is like how to it's how I just that little shift.
And I think a lot of people would get bigger better audiences and actually make more money from the content that they're making because everyone else is like, why should I listen to you?
16:15
Yeah, yeah, with content.
Like, I'm, I'm open anybody that wants to make it.
Make it.
People will watch it if it's adding value.
Hopefully, they don't do what you were describing earlier, which I'll call spiritual entertainment, where they're just learning learning.
Learning watching watching watching, getting motivated, getting inspired.
They're not doing anything with it.
16:31
But my big concern people creating content is that they will trap themselves because they're afraid to suck like, when I got a new camera, I was like, wow, I'm really rolling the dice now because my life has taught me.
One immutable truth, I'm going to fail a lot and there's nothing that tells me that that period in my life is over like and and it was never interesting to me to like ride into the sunset on Oh, I sold Quest.
16:58
So I sold Quest and then like fucking Babe Ruth.
I said I'm going to build the next Disney, right?
But I went on camera said, look, honestly the odds are stacked against me the odds that I failure, way higher than I, that I succeed, right?
And so going into that, I did not want to back myself into a corner where I was afraid to try things.
17:16
I'm afraid to step into an area where I wasn't good, because that's the only way that I know to get better, right?
If I call the physics of progress, I called the physics for reasons.
I think it is truly the only way to improve.
Basically the scientific method, you come up with an informed hypothesis, come up with a test that lets you actually try that out.
17:34
You test it.
You get results.
If you stare nakedly of those results, which will sting a little because it almost certainly did not work as well as you hoped.
Yeah.
You will then get a little bit wiser.
You will re formulate a hypothesis.
You will retest and you just that's the loop, right?
And you just go.
Go go.
17:50
And you see what works and you see what doesn't, but people are so interested in looking cool that the Content becomes the Trap that stops them from actually getting good.
It's the posturing.
It's the external validation that they need to feel like the success.
18:06
They're not having in reality.
It can be made up for with likes and comments and perceive success.
Talk to me about the so you said that you wanted to Vanquish your dad.
Yeah, so this to me is tied to that idea of like you you need something that tells you you need something that pushes you to go through all of this but also trying Your dad control your actions is probably not the best move.
18:32
Yeah.
So like, how is it useful?
And then is they're getting to the other side of that?
Yeah.
And, you know, to be clear, dad, the, I would say that the vanquishing thing is something that I was able to kind of recognize in retrospect, which was, it was all about beating my dad earlier on so and a lot of that was because I felt like a lot of the respect was withheld from me earlier on.
18:53
And it was always like a moving Target, which is, you know, you need to be this.
You need to be that you have to be in.
A shape you have to date hot girls, you have to be top of your class, you have to play all the Varsity Sports yet.
Like all those things, right?
Be Editor to the newspaper.
Be editor-in-chief of the of the literary magazine.
All those things, the same time and still, if I got something wrong to test, it was like what you did wrong, you know, rather than this is cool and I'm not getting any doing, right?
19:14
Yeah, I'm not boo-hooing about it.
Is what it is?
It's made me who I am and I'm grateful for it, but that was kind of the the earlier part was I wanted to win the game that had been set out for me and, you know, first it was make 100,000 a year and then Make the same amount as my dad, and it was make more than my dad, and it was make more than my dad ever made his entire life.
19:33
And then, once that happened, I looked around.
And I was like, I think I've been playing his game and my game and so I wasn't really setting any rules.
I was just playing with the rules that were given to me.
And so, in kind of thing, like, is this even the game I want to play and so that, you know, that took me, you know, a little bit of time to process and I think that It ultimately to your question.
19:54
I think it did serve me a lot and I don't know how much Each of these reinforce behaviors that I learned during that period of time, still benefit me today, but they're not feel about the same thing.
So, I still have these habits of how I work and, you know, being dedicated towards goals Etc.
That I think we're born of that but no longer are fueled from that.
20:10
Now you lay out three traits of ultra successful people.
Yeah, I don't know if they're yours or if you know them somewhere this.
How much you said it, you put words to something that I have felt for a very long time.
Yeah.
20:26
If you don't remember that, my Them here.
But if you remember, I remember them.
Yes.
And so it's, there's three traits that people don't they looked at because they were trying to find Habits of Highly Successful People.
And when they actually pull it apart, it's not, you know, and I hope I'm not contradicting anything, but there's people who are really rich, who wake up really late and work really late.
20:46
And there's people really rich you wake up, really, really early.
And there's people were really rich who he really healthy must be really rich who drink Coca-Cola and eat french fries every day.
And so there's all these things that we want to make is truth but there's easy examples that counter those things.
So it's like are the few things that are true or at least that seems to be present in all of the situations and it seems as though there were surprisingly few.
21:03
And so the three common traits that they had, that they had found were one that people have superiority complex, they believe they're better than others, and they believe that they deserve more than everyone else does.
And that they can accomplish big goals, right?
So they have a bigger Vision because they believe they deserve it, or whatever it is that they were able to identify that.
21:18
The second thing that they're redundant Phi is that they have crippling insecurity and which, which is a paradox of paradoxes.
They feel the never be enough and they'll always Measured against the things that they've achieved.
And so you've got this crazy dynamic between they think they're better than everyone.
They think they deserve more.
21:34
They want to go after this big hill and at the same time they fear.
They'll never be good enough.
They'll never actually achieve it and they actually suck.
And then the third piece which kind of adds the beautiful like mix of this is impulse control.
Yeah.
And so they're able to control their actions and focus on a single thing for an extended period of time.
21:50
And so if you put those three things together it's like you've got a big goal.
That's pulling it this way.
You've got this big fear that you were running away from and then you've got a this control to keep you focused on the one thing that matters.
Yes.
And if you do that, if you are the type of person who has those traits then you are very likely to be successful.
You gave me the chills twice while you're explaining that.
22:07
So this is, I'm often asked like hey, you know, what does it take to be successful or how did I get successful?
And I'm like, from the time, I was a little kid, so I grew up lower middle class and but from the time I was a kid.
I told everybody, I am going to be rich.
22:24
Like, you don't understand, I'm going to be rich.
I was so.
Angered by not being able to get the things that I wanted as a kid and I had a little problem with authority.
And so I felt like I was being told that I have this box is day and I was like, no, no, I'd always had these crazy dreams and I just believed I could make it come true.
22:42
Yeah, but I'm terrifyingly insecure.
Yeah.
That I'm not smart enough to pull it off.
And I have something I need to prove to myself, to my wife, my father-in-law my own parents, like I just fuck no matter how much I achieve I still have this, right?
22:57
A'ight.
So I have this crushing need to validate myself and to feel like know, you really did have a kid and, but I am psychotic at my ability to delay gratification.
Yeah.
Like I can suffer and toil and a grind and just like, I don't need to eat the marshmallow for 100 years, right?
23:19
Which is stupid in some ways, but you put those three things together and you just go and go and go.
It's really get much.
I got this, right?
Yeah.
So to the marshmallow point because I think this is really interesting and I don't think it's talked about enough which is they like to separate the kids into the two buckets, right?
23:38
Like the kitty weights are two marshmallows and the kid who just says I want the marshmallow now but I feel like they should have third bucket.
Which says, how long do they ask the kid to wait for the marshmallow, right?
Because it's not.
Do you have like is I like to think of things and like a lot of times we have false dichotomies, are we have binaries?
23:54
We're like good or bad, you know, discipline or undisciplined I'm honest or dishonest, right?
When I think more reality is to what degree am I honest to what extent in my discipline to what degree of my you know loyal right.
I'll God there's a whole conversation.
Yeah and so I think that each of those three traits that we just went over it's not.
24:12
Do I have them or not for the people who are listening because people like to think.
Yes I have it or like oh well I have all three of those it's not having them and I'm sure you've interviewed some of the most successful people on the planet.
It's how much do you have?
Yeah, right and so I think that like your ability to Les gratification, it's not just like, oh, I can wait a week or I can wait a month.
24:31
I made this tweet that went pretty viral, it was like, if you can wait a year you can make a ton of money.
Like if you can do something for 12 months, you cannot need for financial goodness.
Pretty much for the rest of your life.
I'm not saying you're going to be hello, rich, but you're not going to need for anything.
If you can wait 12 months, if you can wait a decade.
24:50
You're going to be above the 1%.
If you can wait, 10 years for an outcome, be able to do the doing without seeing the result.
For 10 years, you will be able to be above any most achievement of most people and if you can wait a lifetime and you don't even need to see the result of your doing this even while you are alive but know that it may get done after you pass, then I believe that you can change the world and I mean that and so I think that if people can just extend the time Horizon that they're measuring themselves on they can just do so much more.
25:22
I mean you've probably heard the Bill Gates quote where he says people overestimate, what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in a decade.
Things.
The same thing, just continue to draw it out and I think as I've as we've been able to achieve more leverage and make more money Etc, my Horizon has extended.
And when I listen to people, who are the people who I want to emulate, I can almost tell by the measurement of money that they talk about in the measurement of time that they discuss how successful they are or how successful I think they're going to be.
25:46
Like if I talk to a 25 year old, he's talking about what you want to do in two decades and his whole plan of what he's going to do.
As long as he's not just blowing smoke of these heard an interview for me that I'm like this kids got it, he got That's it, he gets it and most people just don't think they can't wait 90 days.
They most people can't even wait a month, right?
26:02
They started diet and 14 days later than I was expecting.
They can't wait.
But like, if you do a year, you can look whatever way you want for the most part, you know, by and large.
And if you wait a year for the ability to learn how to sell you, wait a year, for the ability to learn how to Market, wait a year, just providing value to a group of people for free and then delaying your ask you do it if you want.
26:23
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money, you can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
26:45
Its fo free in exchange for email so that can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like 8, Weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
Now, and I don't know how you're gonna react to this if we can separate that idea from being patient.
27:05
Yeah.
So I made a shirt that said, fuck patients, okay.
But yeah, if you're not playing the long game, they're screwed.
So my thing with patients is you have to go all out at a sprinters Pace code and run a marathon at a sprinter space if you want to achieve something.
27:24
Yeah, that's where people fall down.
You'll find people that can wait but can they and this Is one of my all-time favorite cause I'm pretty sure it's Winston.
Churchill, do people often attribute things?
They hit, you know.
Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
27:41
Now, there are people that can go from failure to failure, but do they lose the enthusiasm?
Can they attack it as hard?
I was telling you that the at the end of this year we have a plastic table that I'm going to smash the little pieces because it has come to represent like the hardest thing that I've built in my professional career, just all the fucking problems.
27:59
Been associated with it but I'm still going after.
It is hard every day and when I think about like so because I've had success and I know how many people are chasing and I can just say people a lot of time.
It's not going to give you what you think it's going to give you so like don't bother chasing that kind of success.
28:16
So an easy way to say it is don't worry about winning a championship.
Ring worry very much about becoming capable of a championship performance that will be a far more interesting life because you really do want to get that good.
Yeah.
But In the pursuit of that thing in getting that good.
28:32
It's like, it is going to take an inhuman amount of concentration, willingness to fight through the pain and suffering, and an ability to attach enough meaning and purpose to it.
Yeah, that you'll keep going when you're just getting kicked in the sky over and over like it's crazy and so knowing how badly people want that.
28:54
I want for them that think like how whatever it is and I I have a method that I can teach people how to do it, but most people still won't do it which is to build the desire to create an association between the doing that thing.
Yeah.
And the meaning and purpose that you want to have for your own life and that it's not going to seem self-evident, you have to bolt it on.
29:15
It feels kind of fake in the beginning.
But if you really invest and it really is something that you care about, it can't be fake, but if it really is something that you care about, you build that intense Association, then you can fight through that.
But boredom He kills more entrepreneurs than fear or failure ever will.
29:33
When you say boredom, do you mean that they're starting something?
It's starting to work and then they just switch because they're add or no, I mean, that doing something where you don't get the result that you want and 10 years out and you're going to have to do what Jeff Bezos calls overhead, right?
29:49
No matter how much you love your job, there's always overhead.
There is a boring shit and what I find is people they can't stay on task.
Yeah I find it myself Ace.
Strong desire, not to stay on task because it is boring.
It's just boring or even worse, if it feels bad.
30:08
Yeah, and you have to keep doing it, and you have to wake up every day and face that like this is really going to be tough.
And it's going to be tough for a very undetermined amount of time.
Yeah.
So it's not even like I know it's going to be a year.
Yeah.
It's there is an unknown amount of suffering before me.
30:24
And I have to somehow continue to muster the enthusiasm.
Have faith.
Yeah that this theory that I have is actually going to work out or they'd all get better.
Right?
That maybe this Theory isn't the Right theory, but I'll be able to figure it out.
It's interesting.
You say that because we talk about need to believe somewhere thinking about a company that we want to like, invest in and so it's like, what are the, you know, we try to have as few needed believes as possible for, you know, Agro thesis to happen and then not only do we want to have as few as possible in the interesting need to believe.
30:52
Like, I need to believe that this is true for this outcome to be possible.
Yeah.
So how do we have As few of those as possible and how do we have that those needed believe statements are as high likely?
That's humanly possible, right?
So it's like if we had a business that was reliant on and, you know, an inflationary period or something, I'd say like, okay well I believe that that's, you know, it's highly likely that it's going to occur, okay, so I feel okay about that one.
31:16
And if that was the only thing I need to believe for this whole business to be successful, we like we're on our way to check is the only thing.
So it's how many of these are there, right?
And if there's a lot of them than with each additional line or likelihood of getting the outcome, we want goes down.
And so I think That if reversing that for success, for somebody who's coming along as like, what amount of action would it be unreasonable for me?
31:34
Not to be successful.
And so, for me, it's like, I believe that if you do 10,000 cold calls, yo, they'll get better, like, it would be unreasonable for you.
Not to be good bike after that level of effort.
If you run, you know, you take half your paycheck every month or 30 your paycheck every month and you say I'm going to advertising University which is I'm going to spend money, actually, advertising trying to get people to click on this thing and give me Even phone number, if you go, and you spend that amount of money on actually advertising after a year.
32:04
After two years will probably, you'll probably be pretty good, especially if you join a community of other people who are doing the same thing, right?
You seek out mentors who have done and give you framework that you can just work off.
So you can shortcut your path to success.
It becomes unreasonable, that you wouldn't be more successful in the future than you are today.
32:20
And so I like thinking about things in terms of directionally correct, rather than will I hit it or not, right.
I think there's so many binaries because it's easy psychologically for us to say, Yes, no honest dishonest etcetera, successful, not successful, but it makes making decisions really hard because you're like, is this the path for me?
32:37
Is this, the product on the business?
I'm going to start, where I was like, well if I started something, I would be more likely to be successful than if I did not start anything.
And from there, I will gain experience and perspective to then make the next iteration on the main thing and was Quest your first thing ever, first successful, then the you done other stuff before that and failed and I still I was referrals like I hope Quest wasn't his first thing most people hadn't got.
33:03
It wasn't right.
Most people had a graveyard of failures before they had their actual first success.
And so most people spend all this time, a different tweet that went viral.
It said like with 20 hours of focused effort, most people can be pretty decent at something, but it's guitar, it's singing even cold.
33:20
Calling, if you actually cold call, for 20 hours focused effort, you be decent, but most people spend years waiting to do the first hour Whoa, and so it's like how can I decrease that action threshold and get someone to just?
Just just embrace the suck.
33:35
And so it's like, how can I normalize nose?
So it's like, I'm teaching someone to sell.
It's like, dude, I need to get 100 knows.
All right?
It's 2:00 phone.
Everybody else.
Just get 100 nose.
And the thing is, all of a sudden if the no becomes the goal, then they realize that it's about the process and not the outcome, and then they will become better salespeople because they stop being afraid of it.
33:51
The same thing like for training sales person, I want them to hear the gasp, right?
Which is like you say a price are the vitamins are afraid of saying the price there's like dude, if you Get a gasp you didn't go high enough right there like what like oh you failed terrible sale they didn't gasp really and so then it becomes it flips it and becomes a point of pride is like guarded your the gasp on this one and so all of a sudden they stop being afraid.
34:11
We normalize we do like exposure therapy and things that people are most afraid of.
And I hope that with all the stuff that we do that we can do that in a microwave for at least a handful of people.
So they just start doing and realize that they're going to gain perspective and the light of their knowledge will give them the next foot.
But the thing is, they're stuck on the first one trying to pick the first path when they had no idea what they go.
34:29
Was selling ever hard for you.
Like the idea of selling not that I'm sure you were bad at it at one point, but the idea of trying to convince somebody to buy something.
Yeah, so when I quit my job, my dad's buddy was in private wealth management and Merrill Lynch and so he called me up and was like, hey you should sell for me and I to this day he jokes about it.
34:48
Now with me I said sales was like I'm not a Salesman.
I was like I'm an academic, you know what I mean?
I just come from on the bones and I thought I'd you know whatever and And then lo and behold.
I signed my lease is slept on the floor and I was like, how do I pay rent and woman walks in the door.
35:05
I was like, I need to get her to give me money so I can pay rent and I was like, oh, this is sales and I didn't know.
So for me it was just begging people to give me my pain in the beginning, like I promised I'm going to give you the best results ever, but the idea of sales was very, I thought it was beneath me.
I thought it was scammy.
35:21
I thought it was used car sales, you know, just like the poor, it black or you know, that'd be the right word.
But yeah.
And then through exposure.
I realized that it was and I ended up in life's irony being something that I've really fallen in love with.
There are people on the internet, I will let them remain nameless that they give me the heebie-jeebies.
35:40
I am deeply uncomfortable with something in the way that they sell.
And I've actually never taken the time to figure out what it is.
And I probably should I make a lot more money, but they're people that made me, deeply uncomfortable and then there's something about you.
So, I never heard of you, somebody paying me was like, yo, you need to check this guy out and I look to your stuff and I'm like, there's something about the way that you Ooh, talk that is super matter of fact, it isn't that I have nothing to sell you because you're an incredible sales person.
36:06
So even when I interface with the way that you sell it doesn't creep me out.
I've not thought about it enough to know why, but I bet you have what is it that makes a salesperson creepy and why aren't you creepy?
Why aren't you creepy the best the best interview coach I ever had?
36:25
So I think a lot about this because I'm outlining the next book which is so the next book is leads and I'm already done the draft and you know how that is where I'm like oh I'm not done that book but like I can't wait for next book and so I'm thinking through like, what is it that the sales is over.
All right.
It's structured conversation.
Increase the like of the person who's on the other side, gives you money.
36:41
That's what it is.
And structuring that conversation, that way and rock sharing that conversation, I heard you mentioned something that you call and I am so vaguely aware of I proper sales.
Oh, you said holding the frame.
Oh yeah, like it's not about the words.
You say, it's how you say them and whether you can hold the frame that we mean by structure of the call all of it.
37:00
Yes, I mean, so, what is, what is the structure?
What is holding frame?
Like, what does that mean?
So I've liked a lot of sales.
So when you're, when you're 12, people interact in general, no matter what man woman child, whatever two frames Collide, and I believe it's animalistic whatever it is.
37:18
There is a, there's a decision of who's Alpha.
Now, the alpha is also contextual and so you can be Alpha in like the present.
United States is Alpha everywhere until he goes into a doctor's office as you tell him to pull his asked me, six era, right frame.
Right in that room.
37:34
Doctor is King, right?
He is the alpha in that setting in that context.
And so the ability to hold the frame for most for most sales people is really having a, it sounds crazy, having a clear agenda and controlling the conversation, which is why are we here, right?
37:50
Because it a lot of sales is clear communication, because if you clearly communicates, the biggest advantage that a salesman has, is that the person has already said they have a problem most times, right?
So, if someone responds to a Content piece and says, hey, can you help me?
They've already enunciated.
They have an issue, they have a problem.
38:07
And so you already have the inherent advantage of the frame, which is you said you needed help, I'm here.
How can I help you, right?
And so it starts with that, right?
It's being clear about why we're here.
And then we get agreement, That we understood the problem that they said they had next.
38:22
And then from that point we have to turn the desire into a decision which is okay.
You say you want these things here is the frame that I want to give you to analyze the decision.
Can we agree to this Frame right?
And so for example, if I were selling marketing Services, we rework a sales script with any of the portfolio companies which is one of the things that we do to make them grow.
38:42
A lot of times they have all this gobbledygook right?
And so I like the shortest possible scripts we can because a lot of Is wasted, right?
So what happens a lot of times on a sales call is they say hello, build rapport talk for 30 minutes, see that there's time that's running out and then realize they have to pitch, right?
38:57
And so then they motormouth and then just awkwardly ask, right?
And it is to your point about it.
See me, Nikki right or sucking.
Is that it's not normal human communication and you're not providing value to the other person.
And so, giving Clarity to someone on a decision is tremendous value.
39:15
And so if you can sell in a way that clarifies a decision, my objective always When I teach sales goal is not to get the person to buy goal, is to get the person to decide, and I believe that people don't decide for only three reasons, and this comes from Albert.
Ellis.
This is not me, but people blame all the woes of their lives on circumstances other people and then ultimately themselves.
39:38
And so, when we were overcoming obstacles in a sale, we have to make sure that we are accounting for the circumstances, which is taking away time as a reason they can't do it, taking away money as a reason, they can't do it taking away.
Particular aspects of the product.
There's a reason they can't do it.
We have to make sure that they don't cast their power to other people.
39:56
And saying, I can't make this decision, someone else has to make it and then finally, when they're with themselves, they want to avoid the decision.
They want to delay it, they want to not make it there.
I'm not gonna think about it, right?
And so the idea is that, I believe that if you sell properly, you can talk to an empowered person and you have to basically sift through the crap that they're telling themselves about why they can't decide why they have to talk to her husband, why the circumstance of their situation matter.
40:19
And so, I think that if you can do that and you communicate that in a conversation, you are, you have made someone feel powerful and you have given them the tools to make a decision.
And then in making that decision, they take a step towards a life, they want to have.
And so if you can structure conversation that way, it's not icky, its value additive and then ultimately, you do make more money but you're not focused on that because you're focused on helping them make the call.
40:38
And if we can do that, you can sell whatever you want.
I think that's like--that's what I try and structure.
And that's why I'm so excited for the sales book when it finally comes out.
But most of it's clear communication when I listen to sales calls because We'll come to excel like it like therapeutic in Andaman.
There's so much waste people aren't direct.
40:55
It's like why are we here you?
And someone's like, I want to get more information.
That's an obstacle.
So you didn't not here, cause you want more information, you're here, because you're suffering from a problem.
You don't just hop on sales calls all day to get information.
Know, you're trying to solve something, right?
What are you trying to solve?
What are you in pain from?
Got it.
So let me make sure I understand this label the problem, right?
41:12
So, it's like a lot of people just don't know how to talk and they just make face noise at each other and no one's listening in noise.
Talking they ping pong back and With no one actually listening.
Yeah, they're not communicating at, all, right.
They say statement.
I mean, someone says, I'd literally just list a review to sales call.
Yesterday guy says, I'm not sure now's a good time salesman then responds with.
41:32
Well, I'm not sure if you're a good fit, if you're if you're not sure.
Because it just goes off on this where tangent, and then there's a pause, and the guy just ask another question, no, communication happened.
It was like, I have a question.
You just said a bunch of words and I guess it's normal for me to say something else.
41:48
Now, And so then he just asked another question, right?
When you overcome these obstacles with somebody like, I don't have time, right?
I'll just give you a simple 1 because this is 1.
This is for everybody is listening because right now you're probably not doing something.
You like, I'm too busy.
I'll start when it's convenient, whatever.
If you say that, as the excuse for not doing something, then there's an assumption underlying that that says that if I get busy again, in the future, I will stop.
42:12
And so, do you want the success that you want to be long term?
Yes.
Then do you believe that you'll never be busy again for the rest of your life?
No.
No, so the you might as well start when you're busy.
So you have the most support because you learn how to do in your busy when it gets quiet, you'll succeed even more and when gets busy again, you know how to do it, because that's how you started, right?
42:29
Obstacle overcome.
And then one step closer to making a decision.
And so, what happens is in the optical process when people are trying to sell stuff, people start on the outside in.
So it's so easy to sound off time.
It's the easiest thing is out of time out of money, right?
And then once you peel, you show them how that's a fallacy.
It's a logical fallacy Distortion of reality.
42:46
You peel that back.
You do one layer close to them my I won't let me my partner will let me my kids so you can feel like it's closer to you, right?
And you peel that out because how do you overcome that?
Well, five years from now, if you didn't do the things that you want to do with your life and you blamed your wife the whole time, because she wouldn't let you do it.
43:06
You're going to find her, is that fair for your marriage, your relationship.
What do you think now?
So I think what you're doing is you're asked for permission set of support, all right?
And they should be so you have that conversation with, right?
All right, so now we're signing the other side table me like it's play this out, right?
43:22
It's not going to go the way you think it's gonna go because if you keep repeating this habit you're going to end up five years from now.
You can look at your life the same way you're looking at now and hating it and you're going to blame now your five years in you, so kind of like your wife five years from now.
You might not so much because you've had 10 more times.
You try to do something, she said, no.
So today the day, right?
43:38
And so, we peel one layer.
And then finally, you're the person who's squirming.
They're right.
Because you force them to confront reality, which is now, they don't want to make the decision, right?
Because like, I'm just going to avoid In my shirt, cetera, et cetera, you're like, hold on like I've got you, you know what I mean?
Like we're going to get through this because you because you're just waiting through this shit that people tell themselves, right?
43:57
And so finally when they're in the avoidance part, the biggest fear they have is making mistake, right?
They don't want to be seeing stupid, don't want to lose status as a result of this decision.
And so when we're dealing with that, it's making them understand that you don't need time to make a decision.
You need information.
If the only source of the information you have is met.
44:14
Let's talk.
What are the variables that you need to make the decision?
And a lot of people having thought through that, it's like well if you don't know what they are, why don't I walk you through for that might be useful.
Does this thing solved the problem?
The way you want it to be solved?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you want to work with us?
44:31
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you know someone you have access the amount of money to get started this program?
Yes or no?
Yes great.
Let's do it.
Right.
And so you can walk someone threatens like, oh wow, like and like you feel like just one of this magical journey of like all these things of why the reason they haven't they decided not to make decisions but so many people are stuck in that same spot for Why they're not taking action, whether it's selling a product or selling themselves.
44:57
And I think that those Frameworks of thinking through each of those problems, and there's a bazillion of them for each of those things, I had to develop because I use those on myself.
So I was like, I have to give myself a compelling reason to start doing stuff.
I have to give myself a compelling reason to make decisions when I don't want to I have to give myself a compelling reason that I can explain to a partner.
45:18
Why I made this decision right later And so by doing that decrease, the time between me getting information and acting and then it spread out my decision lives in my life in general.
And then obviously, I applied that to sales but I've applied it to everything.
When I say these beliefs.
I don't say these as an affront to anyone who shares different beliefs to be clear.
45:37
But for me a very core belief that has been I think intrinsic to at least the material success that we've experienced has been a belief that meaning is self-described.
So that there is no inherent meaning in the things that we do or the Seems we take or the outcomes that happen, but only that which we ascribe to it and so because of that, I feel like it's allowed me to the point where you're saying about like the amount of pain, the amount of suffering, they have to go through in order to achieve the things on the other side.
46:04
I think it's been able to, it's allowed me to reframe.
A lot of the discomfort into, what if this just is, how it always has been or what if this is actually amazing.
And what if this is exactly what it should look like.
And so, I think a lot of times, it's the, it's the discrepancy between our expectations in reality that The emotions that we have in response to any given situation.
46:25
Bad, good Etc.
And so I think a lot of people can't control their state and I we do with this with a lot of the portfolio companies is it's like it's funny cuz I don't even necessarily want to get in this on to talk about like the business and what's the strategy to how we can actually do stuff.
But, you know, there's a big percentage of time where they're stressed and they think there's something wrong with that as I feel like a lot of people feel like there's something wrong with experiencing human emotions.
46:50
And so they are stressed, and then think there's something wrong with them or they are sad.
And I know that this is the thing, the keyboards that, you know, they're, they're the fingers are right on top of it is my belief, it is contrary.
And except that, that it's the beliefs we have about our emotions that are the things that drive us mad facts.
47:09
And so, somebody sad.
And then they tell themselves they're bad because they're sad or they're wrong to be sad or they're a piece of shit because they're sad rather than saying isn't this a beautiful thought about him.
Existence, like, if I could not be sad, then I would not experience Joy.
47:25
So, like if I say that I don't want to be sad anymore, then I would also have to give up.
Joy, am I willing to do that?
No, well then, this is just a part, like I can't say that I want sunny days if there are no rainy days, like, we don't say, whether it's good or bad, it just is.
And so, I think to the same degree, The Human Experience is also that way to at least how I Define it.
47:42
And so I think having that as my backbone frame in terms of our world view, although contrarian has helped me a lot in dealing with the things that often.
Owl entrepreneurs on their path to getting what they want and so for me that's been very helpful.
So from a contrarian standpoint of, like, believe they do Peter thiel's question.
47:57
Like what closely helpful, if you have that, most people don't agree with, that's one of them.
I'm scandalized, by the way, that that one is something that people don't hold.
I think that people get themselves in trouble because they believe the opposite of the following quote.
48:12
There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.
Yeah.
And they think that now there are things that are objectively good and bad and I'm simply recognizing the That is the, that's certainly what I struggle with the most of my own life that I was simply when I had a negative view of myself or anything else that I was simply recognizing the truth of the situation, not understanding how the belief I had about the thing was influencing my behaviors and my behavior is entirely determined by outcome.
48:39
And so then I was like well hold on if my behaviors are predicated on my beliefs and my outcomes are predicated on my behaviors and my outcomes are actually linked to my beliefs so and so I've got to go in and make sure that I'm believing things that are effective.
And so my whole thing is, I only do and believe that which moves me towards my goals.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out.
0:15
If that's what you are into.
And if not keep enjoying the show, frugality, drives Innovation, constraint, constraint constraint.
Even when you have money, one of the best things to do in my opinion is to constrain your resources constrain time because they don't force you to To think creatively to solve problems without using money as the solution.
0:35
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I sold my company for 46 million dollars last year across 100 million dollars in net worth at 32.
0:57
I had a series of mentors to both Millionaires and billionaires.
That I won't name drop because you would know who they are recommended that.
I spend 12 to 18 months, documenting, all of my beliefs around money and the artifacts that have been created over the five years that led to that transaction.
And so, what I want to do is share the 42 beliefs that I have around money, that helped me accumulate material success that I had.
1:19
And hopefully, so that you can't do.
Number one, he who gives the money has the power, not the one who takes it.
So a lot of times poor people think that they're always trying to get?
My are trying to get money trying to get money.
The thing is that the person who gives the money is the one who's in control.
1:37
Like, if you think that the biggest institutions in the world, where are they Banks?
What do they do all day?
They give money and because when you give someone money, you get to dictate the terms of the agreement.
You actually now own them, when a customer gives you money, you're the one who now has to deliver.
Right?
They have control in the relationship.
1:53
And so one of the biggest shifts that I had, was that having the money, which is why I'm a buyer, not a seller in acquisition.com, which is what we do in private Equity.
Like we have control rather than the person who accepts the money.
Rule number one, the person who gives the money's in control, not the one who gets it.
2:11
Number two, never trade reputation for money because you can get money back, that you can't get reputation back.
And so, if you think about reputation is something that compounds over time the longer, You have it, the more you build it, the more compounds unto itself which becomes in and of itself a competitive Advantage, like it is your brand which allows you to do more deals, do bigger deals, do them faster, get more deal, Flow To You deals, being whatever that is for you.
2:34
So it could be deals.
In terms of like selling cars, you could be selling houses, it could be selling companies right at the same concept remains.
But the moment you lose the ref because you traded it for money in the short, you lose the long, which means you cut the compounding.
And that's where all of the gains in life come from.
Number three, money loves speed wealth loves time, poverty, loves indecision.
2:58
And so a big thing is, is like macro micro micro money loves speed, right?
You want to move quickly, like you want to respond fast a customers, you want to follow up with your leads Etc, right?
But when you think about Building Wealth it's not about transacting.
It's about letting that compounding happen and that takes time and it takes not interrupting it, which is one of the biggest and hardest parts of compounding.
3:17
Is you have to let it multiplied unto itself?
Cough.
Like the size of the business that be creates wealth takes decades, not days to make, right?
But the thing is that most people never achieve either of those things because they sit in decision and they continue to stay in indecision until they take action, which is why poverty, loves the person who cannot decide for.
3:40
We can always make more money than we need.
And so, this is a belief that has served my wife and I really, really well, because we look back on our lives and we've never not been able to Not had shelter and we've continued to increase our skill set.
And so a lot of times we have this desire or, you know, our animal brain wants to make us make decisions out of scarcity out of fear, right?
4:01
And if we give in to that, then we're not following this which is like we don't need any of the money that's coming because we have always had enough and so when you can operate from that perspective, then you have less need to make deals to do things and then you can sit back and have a lot more leverage.
4:19
Average in the conversation, right?
Because you don't need anything and that makes you hard to influence and gives you a lot of power.
Fortunes are made by taking a lot of risk with a little bit of money and fortunes are maintained by taking a little bit of risk with a lot of money.
4:37
And so, one of the interesting things that I've seen people do especially when they start making money, or start having money, is that they think that they need to replicate the high-risk things.
If you think about fundamentally every business in the beginning, like somebody who self-made, Nothing.
And so they risked everything in order to make it big.
4:53
But the thing is, is, when you have nothing, you're not risking a lot, right?
You have basically no downside, you have nothing to lose, which makes you dangerous, which is one of the biggest advantages of having nothing.
But if you continue to do that, when you do have something to lose, you can lose your fortunes and no matter how big the number is, anything multiplied by zero is still zero.
5:10
And so fortunes are made by taking lots of risk in the beginning, but they are maintained and slowly grown by taking little bits of risk with lots of money.
And so you have to change the behavior.
ER, once you have the castle, once you have the Empire, six money flows where attention goes, and I'll hit on this one real quick, which is that if you spend time thinking about fashion all day, your attention is going towards buying clothes, you think about cars all day?
5:32
It's going towards your car.
If you think about your business all day, it should be going towards your business and on a micro level within the business.
If you have multiple product lines, or you have multiple businesses or hustles, this is why I'm such a big proponent of pick.
One thing, go, all in, that's it.
One thing all in and when you do that, because you only have so much Juju And so think about it, like a magnifying glass.
5:52
So if you got the Sun and you are the sun in this instance, right?
And you've got a burn a hole to get through to the next level, right?
If you're spread across two Thin of an area, you never get enough concentrated heat.
But the thing is that that sun when it's concentrated enough can blast through any barrier but most people have the potential but they don't have the focus, which is why they can never break through.
6:15
So money flows, where attention goes.
Seven your home life and your business life have to be aligned money-wise.
So you can't trying to trying to trying to grow a business, right?
And like, reinvest everything here, while you're living a super lavish lifestyle, trying to flex, right?
6:32
Like, it has to be aligned.
And so, one of the things that we have is that all of our business rules around money are also our home rules around money.
And so if we don't live with any, any debt you don't even personally that are for liabilities with in our personal lives, we do same thing with in our business lives.
6:48
And so the values we have and how we treat money inside and outs of the business are the same.
I see so many people who live like split lives, like they've got wives or spouses that want to spend like crazy, right.
But then they're trying to do these things in the business or the reverse, right?
7:03
And so they have to be in alignment, otherwise, long-term you create conflict and then that's what breaks things 8, ignore money.
Advice from poor people, this may sound ridiculous, but let me say it differently.
Ignore money advice from your Dad or Mom who are poorer than you want to be ignore money advice from your good friends who are poorer than you want to be ignore money advice from people who have smaller dreams for your life than you do.
7:30
And so the big thing is just like their opinion does not matter because they have not been there at which is the lowest level of expertise is having been there, right?
The higher up.
The extra cheese is not only have you been there, but have you taken many people just like you to where you're trying to go, right?
7:46
They probably don't have.
Have any of those things.
And so what they're really doing is just regurgitating something that they may have heard from somebody else because they have no contacts and then you somehow take that as truth.
And so what happens is, you have people.
It's the blind leading the blind.
You have people who have no idea, who are ignorant, leading also the ignorant.
So if you want to get out of that situation you have to stop consuming that information because it becomes the lens through which you see the world and it's also wrong.
8:08
The reason that rich people can lose everything and then recreate it is because they see reality more accurately.
The reason people can't make money is because they don't see Ali, the way it actually is because how is it that somebody else can make a lot of money really quickly.
And someone else can't they see reality differently.
And so most of life is trying to pull these rocks out of our vision so that we can see more clearly.
8:27
So, stop listening to poor people about money nine.
It's always easier to buy them to sell.
So, think about it, you want to get into a stock.
You want to get into something, you can buy it instantly, right?
You want to get into a real estate deal.
You want to get into a business whatever.
It's always easier to buy than it is to sell.
And so because of that, you have to be extra careful.
8:45
You want to put all the slow.
Whoa, on the by and you want to put all the lubricant on the cell, right?
In terms of your thinking process and so that's where we use discipline.
Ten money is fickle when he is jealous, it sticks, and goes to the person who pays it the most attention.
9:01
And so, if you think about this big, big, big macro picture money comes into the system.
But there are these grooves like rain grooves in the ground where it all eventually flows up to the few people who pay the most attention.
Right, like someone gets paid.
9:17
They go buy their groceries.
The grocery person has to go by from the supplier supplier by sea from whatever and the economy continues to go.
But the person who has the access Is the one who pays it, the most attention to the one who had sticks to it.
The end, which is why wealth always ends up flowing to the few who pay it.
The most attention.
9:34
Otherwise, everyone else is just a very temporary holder of the money, they're just taking it one hand going out.
The other one hand going out the other.
And so if you pay the most attention to the money, you're the one who will end up sticking to because it always loves the person who pays it the most attention. 11 we stay poor until we've learned all the lessons that poverty has to teach.
9:52
And so one of the things is that people stay in poverty, but they're not trying to pay attention to like what lesson do I need to be learning that?
I'm not like there's a boss right now and it's poverty.
You have to beat the boss.
You have to learn the lesson to beat the level, right?
So, it might be, actually taking action, that might be part of the lesson that you need to learn.
10:09
It might be learning how to save money at a basic level, personal finance, right?
Learning how to make more than you spend, right?
How to increase your skill set so that you can actually provide value to other people solving other people's problems.
These are the lessons that we have to learn in poverty to get out of poverty and until you do that, you don't beat the level. 12, frugality, drives, Innovation, constraint, constraint constraint.
10:34
And so, even when you have money, one of the best things to do in my opinion, is to constrain your resources, constrain time.
Because they don't force you to think creatively to solve problems without using money as the solution, right?
And if you have constraints right now, on time, and or money, don't see it as a disadvantage because it's what people who do have money try to get into to solve problems.
10:57
So it's actually an advantage, and the only thing That's the disadvantage of thinking it is 13.
Think once before investing think twice before spending, so investing is something that you're putting money into that is going to give you a return of some kind.
It's either going to give you a skill.
That's going to increase your earning capacity or it's gonna be something is going to quite literally give you a return in terms.
11:13
It's going to be yield or worth more in the future, right?
Spending is something that's going to never be worth more in the future and it's going to be consumed.
And so think twice before you consume the money that you are spending think once before investing.
And so the idea here is that we want to put the discipline more around the spending than we do around the Just because most times in general, especially when you're starting out the more you invest, as a, as a thought process, is like, you're always investing.
11:37
Some things will return more than others, but overall, you will see compounding returns 14, money flows to the person who needs it, the least.
And this is one of those unfortunate things about the world, right?
The rich get richer, the rich get richer, because they don't need it and because they don't need it, they have leverage.
11:54
And so the idea is you have to sell not from your own wallet, from the person in front Of you, right?
You have to come to the table with our other options.
And so it's the person who needs nothing, who's the person who has the most power and that's where the money will go 15.
12:09
We make money or money does not make us.
This was a belief that Leo and I had to write down because a lot of times you start tying your self-worth, to your net worth, right?
And so what happens is, if you do that, then you're not worth itself becomes a liability to your own self esteem.
And so, I started noticing this Within Myself was that I started tying my self-worth, to my net worth And so, I had to create a different statement of belief that I had to choose to believe, which is that it is my ability to make money, which is what creates my value, not the money itself, because the money itself can be taken like you don't know this, but my family was in the Iranian Revolution and everything they had was taken.
12:45
And so that's why the idea of legacy to me so silly because all it takes is one government saying.
Oh, all that land, all those cars, all those homes.
Those are ours.
No, and that's it.
And so, a lot of people have this idea of legacy and permanence, That's Just an Illusion and So for that reason, the value is in.
13:01
You not in the things that you make, which is why we make our money.
Our money doesn't make us 16, it may be an amazing opportunity but not our amazing opportunity.
And so I think one of the things that I needed early on was permission to not do things because once you start to learn to take action because in the beginning you don't know how to do anything your analysis paralysis and you just get scared and you're ignorant.
13:20
You don't know what you're doing.
But once you get over that which is the first lesson of poverty, you have to start taking action, right?
Once you get over that, then the problem is that your yes muscle becomes to flexed, right?
You start saying yes to everything and so the idea was to be able to say it's not that this thing is a bad opportunity.
I Recognize that it's a great opportunity, it's just not my great opportunity and it also gives you language to tell other people are trying to present things to you say we should do this thing and we should do this thing together.
13:44
You say, dude I think it's amazing Opti.
I just don't think it's my amazing opportunity and it's gotten me out of so many situations that I know.
Long-term wouldn't have been good for me 17, we control the money flow wherever possible.
So if you think about the flow of money, whether you're like people who have a lot of control payment processors, right?
14:02
Like, everybody thinks they're amazing until the day, you can't process money.
Right?
And so the idea is the further Upstream you can go the more leverage and control you have over the money.
And so there's a reason that franchises in general take a percentage of top-line.
There's a reason that insurance companies get paid before they put money out, right?
14:21
Banks, get the money and then they give it back later, right?
So the idea is how, who's the person who's furthest Upstream in the money.
Those people churches, God takes 10% of top-line.
Right?
The idea is that the people who like they get it, this is old money, right?
This is why we do this.
This is why we crystallize it is that the person who's furthest Upstream, the money has the most power over it.
14:40
So whatever possible control the money flow. 18 always having to shit phone.
One of the things that's given me a tremendous amount of confidence in going out out there and risking it.
Is that I've always had this like just in case fund and that I don't invest in anything that is risky at all.
14:57
So this is just like bonds and I know here's what's crazy.
I know that I'm losing money over time by the fact that this money is rotting.
But the thing is is that me knowing that I can take whatever risk I want.
And I am still protected and everything that I have for the rest of my life is taken care of, gives me a lot of Peace which allows me to be more aggressive, be more offensive and so as soon as you can have your oh shit fun.
15:23
Whether it's three months, whether it's six months, whatever it is start, putting that away that nut.
So that you can go more on the offensive because you're not worried about how you're going to eat. 19 the biggest over odor of wealth is ignorance.
The second biggest is taxes and so the idea here is that not knowing how to make a million dollars.
15:44
It's costing you, whatever you make every year - a million dollars and so if you make 50 Grand a year it cost you nine hundred fifty thousand dollars a year to not know how to make a million dollars.
And so the question is, what would I pay to pay down that debt?
That ignorant step?
Which is the most expensive thing that everyone pays for every single month right now, whoever you are Whatever your goal is, you're paying a debt to the ignorance that you have for not having that income.
16:09
Like, if you knew how to do it, you would be doing it.
And so for me that's always been the thing that scared me the most which was how do I pay down the debt as fast as possible which is why I put so much money into paying down this invisible hand.
That's been suppressing my income.
My whole life and yours too.
In the Invisible Hand, is the ignorance.
16:26
That is the depth that collects every single month.
The money that you are not making, right?
And so, you have, let's say, right now, You could be making a million a month but the Invisible Hand is taking nine.
Hundred and fifty thousand dollars every month or if your take.
If you're making 50 Grand a month, whatever it is.
It's taking all of that extra money and put it into his pocket and that's the cost of ignorance.
16:45
And so the thing is, is how do we get that hand go away, and we get that through knowledge by.
We get that through experience, we got that through skills and that's what we have to pay for, in time or money. 20, you get paid for the value.
You create times your ability to negotiate / how hard you are to replace.
17:03
So the idea is if you provide something that's very valuable in, you're very good at negotiating but somebody else can provide the exact same thing as you for a tenth of the price.
You still don't have that good of a negotiating position, right?
So the idea is, how do I provide a huge amount of value?
Learn to negotiate for as much of it as possible and do it in such a way that no one else can compete against me.
17:22
If you can do those three things that is how you create.
A value.
That is how you make money and it's really making money is capturing a percentage of the value that you create for other people.
That is what making money.
Is your solving someone else's problem.
The value of that problem can be Quantified and the percentage of that value that you capture is how you make money in exchange.
17:39
So if you don't know how to provide value and you don't know how to negotiate and everyone can do this, and you can do the same thing as everybody else and nothing unique.
Then you have a hard time making money.
So reverse those things.
And that's how you make it a most Asian quick break just to let you know that we've been starting.
Going to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
17:57
Alright, so send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show. 21 mistakes, love a rushed decision.
18:15
So whenever we feel like we have fomo right, whenever you feel like, I've trained myself down enough that, like, when I feel fomo, I pause fomo means, slow, go pains.
Give it a pause, right?
And the reason for that is that most irrational decisions, mistakes loved a rushed decision.
18:33
Is that I always think about that over and over and is like hey this is probably a mistake because mistakes love Rush decisions and so it's like well then let's just give it a cool down period And so it's just one of those easy beliefs that has Slowed me down, and has saved me so much money for mistakes.
It's hard, even quite, like, millions and millions of dollars in money and failed and brand deals and reputational deals that I didn't do.
18:55
Because I was like, I don't know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give them to give this one, a cool-down period and see how I look at it and 30 days.
And 30 days later.
I'm very glad I didn't do it. 22.
Leverage comes from not needing the other person and more specifically leverage comes from needing nothing.
19:11
And so the Idea is, you can either satisfy all your needs, or you can eliminate all your needs, either way.
That is how you create leverage, think about this.
You can't control somebody who needs nothing.
Right.
Someone needs nothing.
You have no influence over them.
And so the goal is, how do I become that person?
19:27
I can either become bad person by satisfying, every time I have materially, or by decreasing my needs to 0.
Either way, you can do it the monks, do it by, giving relinquishing everything and needing nothing and the rich man, does it by satisfying all his needs, and not needing the other the deal in the other side of the table, right?
19:44
And so by doing that in both of those situations, you create leverage because you can get more because you don't need it. 23 markets, take longer to adjust than you expect and then they move faster than you can imagine.
And so this is one of those things where like the big short.
If you saw that movie, the guy was shorting for like four years.
20:02
He's like the math doesn't make sense, but it's still the Volvo kept going bubble, kept going bubble kept going and then it happened faster than people imagine.
So when there are Corrections and there's something that's feels fundamentally off, it takes longer for a market to adjust and then when it does make the adjustment, it happens very fast.
20:20
And so the idea is that we have to be comfortable with the fact that we might have to sit in discomfort for an extended period of time.
Before.
What we believe to be reality is reflected 24.
Money is a game treated as such, you can't win the game.
If you don't know, you're playing one.
And so one of the things is that the wealthiest people in the world, see money.
20:37
As a game right there, just trading tokens at this point because they don't even use money to satisfy material needs because I already have it.
And so the idea is how can I adopt that perspective as soon as I can earlier on in my career?
And Oh, that's, we're thinking about things in terms of personal bests right thinking about.
20:55
In terms of bank account, PR's, thinking about your PRS being how much you save every month rather than what you make every month, right?
Checking your stats every morning, like you would a video game checking your rankings against yourself.
Like these are the things that the people who have more money.
Like when I was poor, I checked my bank on every single day and I continue to check it every day until we pass about 20 million dollars, net worth.
21:15
And I started switching weekly because honestly the variations made it made no sense to check it out.
Lee.
But the idea there is that what gets measured gets improved.
You can get someone to lose weight just by simply getting them to weigh themselves every day without giving them.
Any advice at all, just weighing themselves, drawing attention.
Remember money flows?
21:31
Where attention goes.
So if you pay attention to it, it will start sticking to you. 25, don't bet the empire for a pot of gold.
And so the idea here is like no matter how big the number is in, this is Warren Buffett, quote, no matter how big the number is anything multiplied by zero is still zero.
And so even though you might have this opportunity here, it's never worth risking the whole pie to get the pot of gold.
21:50
It might be this tiny opportunity but it's not worth the risk.
And I can't tell you the amount of times where I'm like, man if I went all in on this thing, money-wise, so thing is that you go all in on your attention, right?
But I wouldn't go all in on your money, right?
Just have a different perspective unless you absolutely know what you're doing. 26, always do a starter deal with new faces.
22:08
So this is a hard one because when your friends come to you and say, dude, I want to do this Airbnb thing or hey, I've got this portfolio of whatever like you should invest, right?
If you've never done a deal with somebody accept the fact that you're going to miss out on the the first deal and you do a started.
You'll first.
All right, it's training wheels.
You got to see how these people are right now.
22:25
Everything's just still look, great on paper, everything just don't make sense, they should still be amazing character, Etc.
Once they check all the boxes, you still mitigate your risk by saying first deal.
I'm going to do with you as a small deal, right?
And so mind you people come to us for very big checks and so I say, hey, I'm not going to write you a check book above X percent until we've already done a deal.
22:46
Which if you're thinking about that, you might be like, well, it might take five years for a deal to open.
Realize.
Yeah, which is why investing is a long-term game, which is why trust is built over time, right?
And so the idea is like, that means that you might have to get several first time deals done, which is also good.
Because will diversify your risk in the beginning and you will find out.
23:03
I promise you.
When you do get a partner that you were really excited about, then you hand him the check and then a year later like thank God I didn't give this guy the whole farm, right?
And so it's just one of those cases of downside mitigator.
Because most people who are rich, think about not, having risk rather than risking it all.
23:20
Our fortunes are built by the taking, a lot of risk.
A little bit of money, fortunes are maintaining grown.
They're taking a little bit of risk with bottom and you only take a little bit of risk with somebody that you already know, right?
Which is why I started deals with new faces. 27 trust is worth more than a bigger return.
23:35
Trust lubricates deal velocity trust compounds into one of those valuable things.
You can have specially in investing in yourself.
Etcetera is trusted Partners, right?
And so it's one of those things where like you don't want to take all the meat on the bone.
Because you want to have a long-term relationship, right?
23:52
And if you have the opportunity to one over somebody, two years in, and you've had multiple good deals with somebody, that is one where you lose on the compounding benefit of trust, and you will make so much more over the relationship by maintaining it and by maintaining Trust on both sides, making it always work.
24:10
I can tell you, when I talk to Partners when I talk to business owners, how they talk about, the people that they do business, with tells you a lot about them and how they do business.
And so, When I talk to somebody and I'm like, hey, why don't you do this?
They're like, hey, these guys have been good to us for a very long time.
Like I don't want to rock that boat, like we've had a very good relationship for ten years.
24:28
That is something I respect a lot and that is what people who have money act like poor people.
Always trying to one over everyone over and over again and they never get any trust from anybody, which means they have no compounding relationships.
And so they always have to hunt, they always have to find the next thing.
Rather, they have a network of people who are always feeding them deals, always giving them slices of other pieces of pie because they were greedy. 28 money is not a zero-sum game and so one of the things again, when you're poor, you think that if I get this money, I got to take this money.
24:58
It's like, there's this certain pot of money, but the money supply itself is fluid.
It grows, right?
And money is created, quite literally printed, but also in that, you can create a deal where multiple people win and this was something that I didn't understand earlier on, I always thought like I have, it's a zero-sum like they've got money and I have to take it somehow, right?
25:15
I have to exchange something for it, whatever it is, right?
I have to somehow get them to exchange with me.
But the, the older I've gotten the more.
I'm like, how can I get onto their side of the table and both make money together?
And so, I have made significantly more money.
Getting on the same side of the table is the other person is saying, why don't we both take a big piece of this upside, rather than trying to take slice up a pie that's in front of us, right?
25:38
So it's focusing on the future pie rather than the pilots in front of you, right?
It's creating value rather than slicing and dividing value. 29, never take a standard deal.
There's always a better one.
And so one of the things here is that like, there's always a better deal and a lot of times you have to ask for it which is like, hey, this term and this term and this term are things that are concerning to me.
25:56
Is there anything we can do about these?
Because it may influence.
And the big thing here, remember earlier.
Leverage comes from, not eating the deal.
You have to be willing to walk away.
Like I can't say this more than I'm saying this.
Right now, if you need a deal, you have no leverage and you're basically faking.
The only way to actually get better deals.
26:13
It's you're not need deals and the only To get better deals when you don't need deals, is to ask for better deals, and be willing to walk away.
When they say no, and I can't tell you the amount of times that I walked away from a deal and the person comes back after saying, well I can't do a deal and I'm like, cool, no worries.
And they come back three or four days later and they're like, all right man, I'll do the deal.
26:30
Right?
And then I might be like, hey Will the terms of changed?
Yeah.
Okay.
But you get the idea, right?
Is that one don't accept standard deals to the.
Only way you can not accept.
Standard deals is have other deals and have leverage step 3.
You have to ask for it and be willing.
Willing to walk away.
26:46
When they say no 30, expect low risk, amazing returns.
So, one of the things that I found about with the wealthiest friends that I have, who are billionaire plus is that they're just not interested in 10 20 % returns they're looking for 50% plus annualized returns because they're like, well, I figure, if I'm wrong, I'm not going to get that.
27:07
And if I'm right then, I crush it.
They're like my shoot for 10.
If I'm wrong way below 10 and that made a ton of sense to me and it's just like, it's an expectation.
World.
It's like, well when I invest I just expect that this is going to be the new average most people expect 10 percent because that's what the SP does.
It doesn't mean that that has to be your personal standard, right?
27:24
And so thinking through that way, has changed how I saw investing.
In general 31, don't think in irr which means internal rate of return.
Instead thinking how long will this take to double?
How long will this take to Triple?
So for example if you're like hey I want to have a 25 percent irr.
27:41
It's hard to say.
This is going to grow by 25%.
A year would is easier to Say is this is going to double in three.
And so the question is, what can I get today?
That's half off.
What it's going to be in three years.
Is a much easier question to solve than what do I think is going to grow by 25% three times.
27:58
So make sense and so changing, how you ask the question changes, how you'll find the answer?
32, this is a Buffett is MM, but diversification is a hedge against ignorance, right?
And it's only risk.
You, if you don't know what you're doing and the converse of that is that the people who make the most money, know what they're doing.
28:13
And so there's two ways of knowing what you're doing.
Either know, everything or only know a few things and then only do those things, right?
And that's what the wealthiest people that I have seen and witnessed myself the games that they play.
You know, I've got, I've got buddies who only do hard money lending, right?
That's all they do.
And they do shitloads of it, right?
28:29
I've got people who, I know who just do like market-making, which is like basically providing liquidity.
To buyers and sellers to make markets work.
Right.
That's all they do.
I've got friends, who only flip houses, I got friends who only by commercial.
I've only like there's a million games and all of the make tons of money.
And so it's really about taking one game and taking it to its natural conclusion, which is learning every single aspect of that game.
28:50
Rather than saying, I want to be in stocks.
I mean, real estate want to be in crypto.
I would also have my side hustles.
I want to like, you can't get good at any even because you're competing against people who are all in, that's the thing, like, if you're in stocks, you're competing against hedge, fund manager.
It's all they do, right?
29:06
And so play one game and play it.
Well, 34 I skip 33 because I covered it in that last one returns are in the terms, right?
So you probably heard the saying it's either your price and my terms are my terms in your price, right?
And so if I said that wrong, you know what I'm saying?
29:23
The idea here is in my opinion, terms are far more powerful like I could say hey man I'm going to pay you a billion dollars for your company, right?
Like whatever.
Everybody's watching this if you make money doing anything.
That the cytosol I'll pay you billion dollars for your business but it's on my terms right?
29:38
And I can make I can make that deal every time and I was wondering.
And so that's the thing is just like the returns are in the terms.
It's in the fine print, right?
And so understanding the terms of the agreement and how many different ways you can make terms, and the only way you do that is through having the conversations and trying to structure it from learning from other people, right?
29:55
And so, you have to be careful of the terms, but be understand how you can use those things to your advantage.
I give an example there.
So if I bought your For a billion dollars, I would say sure, I'll give you a billion dollars.
I'll give you a billion dollars in cash but I'll give it to you over five years and the only terms that I'll give it an under is that it's already doing 500 million a year in income and it's not doing that today but I will happily give you a billion dollars over five years if it makes 500 million dollars in profit next year.
30:22
It's not doing that today.
So on paper, I bought your company for a billion dollars.
What's the reality or the likely that you get it very low, right?
And under the conditions that you do, get it?
It's worth it for me every time and so the idea is spelling out under what conditions would this make sense and then putting that into a deal into an agreement, like that is why the returns are in the terms.
30:45
It's in the fine print which is where the money is write.
The Fortunes in the fine print 35 whenever possible use house money.
And so what that means is that if there are things that are not your main game, right?
If you have the opportunity to recoup your principal and still have money in the game, do that because then at that point, then you can get super Aggressive with the with the Investments and things like that, that you're making, but you're doing it on a house money.
31:08
You're doing it with no chance of losing principal.
Right?
And so whenever you have those opportunities, if it's not your main game that I'd recommend taking them the amount of times that I have done that, I've been very grateful for the time that I have not.
I have been bummed that I did not do that.
So it's one of the money rules that we added. 36 always know how to get your money back.
31:27
So whenever you're doing a deal, whenever you're making any kind of transaction know how to get your money back, all right?
Because if you think about this, this is is a lot like downside protection or preserving the principal, right?
What you're just investing 101, if you know, how to get your money back, you have to know the exact way of doing it, not just like, oh yeah, I can get my money back just like no.
31:44
But but how would I do it?
Like walk me through each of the steps so that I have full understanding of how this would work.
And when you do that, you are able to decrease.
Because the thing is just sometimes, if they, if they actually don't mean it, then they won't have a way to do it.
You'll be able to sniff something out of mediately 37.
32:00
Cash flow is King.
All right, and that's both.
Personal level and on a business level.
So for you, your cash flow is going to be dictated by your income minus your expenses, right?
When I think cash flow, right?
I'm thinking it's really your savings flow, right?
Because your cash flow in a business is revenue, minus expenses.
32:16
So your cash flow is a person is going to be your income - your personal expenses.
And so many people have super high Revenue, super high income, but very low cash flow because their expenses are the same.
And so the idea here is our profit as a person is our cash flow, right?
That's what we save every month, that's what we should be.
32:32
Like if there's one thing.
That you get from Money Rules, is that you be switching your metric towards.
What am I saving every month?
Rather, than what am I making?
Every month because the prophet will you save is the thing that matters not the top light and it's one of the biggest mistakes.
And so your PR is your personal record should be around your savings amount.
32:49
Now, your income 38 by for forever.
So, this is a, this is a Warren Buffett.
And Charlie Munger is MM, but Charlie said, the money isn't made in the by or the Cell.
It's Made in the weight and so a lot of times, the idea is, you know, they've The idea of, if you had a punch card, right?
33:05
If you got 20 punches on it, those are the only Investments you can make, you'd have a much better investing process and believe it or not.
There's some of the most successful private Equity Funds in the world, actually.
Run this style, right?
So the most successful funds in the world, actually do this with their Traders, each trade early gets ten that's it.
33:23
And so if they want to if they want to buy something else, they have to sell something they currently have.
And so this process gives constraint to the decision-making, which forces you to make better decisions.
And so if you could never sell anything you buy and you made that the thought process when you are buying, you could never get out of it then you by differently and you buy super long and then ultimately that's what doesn't interrupt the compounding process and that's what unlocks huge wealth later. 39 you heard me say it earlier, but fomo means go slow, right, you feel fomo?
33:55
I mean slow down.
It means take a second, give a breather, put some space between you and the decision because most times 99 percent of times, a lot of people are feeling it now.
The thing is is like if you got burned in this last crash, remember the lesson like if you don't remember the lesson and it'll happen to you again.
So whenever like when you next time you feel that fomo I got I got to put money into this thing go slow because you know the best people are who invested in crypto or the ones who didn't do it before during the bubble, right?
34:22
There's the guys have the best friends right now and so don't try and time shit.
Like the best people in the world.
Still can't figure it out, right?
And so again, if you're buying for forever, if you feel fomo, if you're buying from Forever, you feel fomo because you have an unlimited time Horizon, the only reason you feel fomo is because your time Rises too short. 40.
34:40
If you can't afford to lose the money then don't use the money.
Alright, so if you're like, this is my last dollar that it's probably not a good idea to risk it, right?
Which is why we always have the oh shit phone.
So if you can't afford to lose it, don't use it 41.
Peace of mind can be bought and it can be sold.
34:58
And so if there are situations where you're like, man this is going to keep me up at night, don't do it because you can sell it, you can sell your peace of mind.
There's a price that's associated with peace of mind.
You can also buy it like a Things you're concerned about you literally buy insurance, the things that you're worried about like peace of mind, can very much be bought and sold and I can tell you make much better decisions when you've got it.
35:16
And so long term, it's not worth the short term sale of Peace of Mind to get the long-term benefits 42 and final.
A lot of people think about diversification in terms of industry, but they don't think about it in terms of capital stack.
And so, what that means is where you sit on the stack in a business.
35:35
So, if you lend to a business in, your the first like a bank, for example, is at the top is a preferred.
Creditor right?
If the person goes under, they get the house right.
The reason a lot of banks don't lose money unless they're getting greedy.
So I get it that right.
But most banks have been around for very, very long time.
It's because the business model allows them to not lose money and it's because they're the first creditors and so you can invest in real estate but if you have the bank, the bank is the first creditor so you can think about diversification between like stocks crypto, you know businesses, whatever you can also think about it vertically, in terms of where am I sitting on the stack?
36:06
And so if you think about those in terms of both types of diversification, When the tide goes out, you're the one who gets your money back first.

I always wished pesos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
I built a hundred thousand dollar per month, profit business with no employees for less than $1000 in most 26.
And anyone can start the exact same business with little to no money at all.

1:15
Aunt Rosie found her back was not calm, portfolio companies that does Fortuner million dollars a year and I make these, I want you to use the stuff.

So that's my that's my self.
Isn't any room for everybody else.
Enjoy the stuff.
Go make money.
That's the whole point.
1:30
All right, so let's dive in.
So when I had my chain of gyms, I got asked to speak at this marketing event.
All right?
So this is a random thing and I like, I never been asked to speak for anything at all ever.
And so this was kind of weird to me, I just like do my own thing and I'm doing to be stuff.
I just don't weight loss, right?
And so they want me to Speak about how is using Facebook ads to get leads for brick and mortar in 2016?
1:50
All right, so anyways, I wasn't sure but I decided to accept.
Anyways, I was like, there's a challenge, I'll go speak.
And so I went up and, you know, I gave my, I gave my schpeel and I just went step by step this.
I did it, right?
And what I want to do is I'll explain to you exactly what I said on that speech.
And then we're going to Quentin Tarantino, then I'm going to circle back to why it's going to be more to you.
2:07
Alright, so here's how I work and pay attention here because this is the part that you will copy and run the same model I did if you want to model that business that I had those make 100,000 All right, and this business model works for any brick and mortar business Not Just Fitness, okay?
So here's how our I would run ads for six weeks.
2:22
We lost channel.
So you can run it for whatever you want, but I was running for a challenge, I'd run those ads and it's and them to a landing page.
All right?
At the landing page, they would opt in with their name, phone number email and on the thank you page, they'd have a schedule, right?
So they book a time to meet with me at the facility, which is where I would sell it right now.
I would call the leads to confirm their appointments who did schedule and then I would call the ones, you didn't book to get them to schedule a time morning of.
2:43
I'm just give you a little hack here.
I would set up.
Personalized, video be like, hey, Sarah, like, I've got this t-shirt with your name on it, what size, and what color do you want?
And so, then they would respond back with a color size and it massively increase, my Sharp rights, and I got some Goodwill, right?
So when they came in, I would sell them the challenge right?
2:58
When you could sell whatever promotion you want.
And I would sell for five or 600 bucks side note.
And I'll get to this more later, but I want you to sell really expensive stuff.
So if I do it again, add some more expensive stuff, but I was selling five or 600 bucks.
And so the idea was in, this was my big offer.
So you need to come up with something sexy that I lost 20 pounds in six weeks.
3:14
They give the money.
Right.
And I offered a satisfaction guarantee so that even if they didn't lose the weight, if they wanted their money back.
At any point, the six weeks I didn't give service that was amazing.
I'd give it back to.
All right.
So it was a no-risk grand slam offer.
And as you can imagine, it wasn't that hard to sell right, which the Q Point.
You'll notice both offers that we will make one of the business owner and one of the prospects is not hard to sell.
3:34
All right.
So here's how the math worked out.
So I'd pay about 10 bucks Elite and I would sell one out of five into the six hundred dollar challenge.
So if you're doing your math year that's 12 to 1, so I put five Ran into marketing, I get about 60,000 out, and the nicer part was that I got that money up front so I can put it back in ads.
3:50
And this is why the no money down things important.
So I don't even need five grand or ten thousand dollars to start this.
As soon as I made my first, you sales that became my marketing budget, the entire month, right?
And just a side to, I know Jim wants.
Jim still get these numbers today, so it's not like the stuff changes that often people just people still need to lose weight today as much as they did a few years ago, right.
4:08
Like and challenges have really gone away.
And so, the nice thing is that, once you crack one of these for Brick and Mortar business, you can run this, huh?
That was our month.
Profit zero cost to start at zero employees business model on your own for life if you wanted to.
All right.
And the way that I stumbled onto this was that I started launching my gyms and realizing quickly that I actually need more money launching the dims than running the gyms, right.
4:30
And the reason for that was that once everyone convert it from my front and program to my back and program, the average revenue per week per client went from a hundred dollars a week to $50 a week, right?
So they pay 600, six weeks versus, you know, 200 a month which would be about 50 a week.
On the back end.
And so I made at full capacity, I'd make half as much money.
4:48
So I actually made more money launching in filling the gym that I did after was at full capacity.
And so that was one of the big aha moments ahead which is what is how I accidentally stumbled into this business model.
So let's Quentin Tarantino back to when I stepped off that state, right?
So as soon as I showed my whole models, like this is the ads, these are landing pages.
5:04
This is the thank you thing, blah blah.
I got bum-rushed by.
All these folks asked me to help them do what I was doing, right?
And they're like, can you do this for my best can do this for dry-cleaning can use it for whatever, right and add a bunch of Jim.
To obviously and I didn't sell to Jim's.
So like I was like, sorry.
I don't look like I just do this for myself and I hope you enjoy the presentation but you know, being the budding, entrepreneur that I was at the time.
5:23
I figured maybe I can make some money doing this, right?
Maybe I could launch their gyms.
Like, I did my own and work out some sort of deal to get a percentage of the revenue that I was bringing it right makes sense.
So here's the offer that I made some of the guys who rushed me off State.
Now, I got all their business cards that I would call them up the next week because I didn't even know what I was doing.
5:40
And so this is the offer came up with.
I said, I'll fly out to your gym.
I'll spend my own money.
I'll Market your gym for you, I'll work the leads, I'll schedule them and I'll sell them and I'll even do nutrition orientations.
Which by the way, is where I would sell another 100, 150 bucks a head and supplements.
And if you're doing the math, that would also cover my cost to acquire customers on its own.
5:57
And all they had to do was just fulfill the six weeks of service, right?
And then they got to keep whoever they converted into a membership.
So it was a no-risk off of them.
Remember, like I spent all my time and my money, they have to do anything and I got to eat what I killed.
That was the deal.
Alright, so here's the important part.
If you are a single guy or gal per hectare, if you're married, Matter.
6:15
If you know these three things you can make this business model work for you.
Alright?
So number one is, you have to be very compelling offer for Brick and Mortar business.
That gets late.
So for me, it was the challenge.
It could be any number of things, right?
All you have to do is give something very valuable for Less where I could be a free thing or discounted thing.
And then if you're giving a heavily discount thing, you have to learn how to upsell something.
6:33
If it's not that then you can stall the core offer.
Either way a very compelling offer up front.
Number two is you got to learn how to run ads.
Not that complicated nowadays.
You can run lead ads.
You can watch them on YouTube.
It's not that complex to do the number three.
Re you learn how to sell.
If you can do those three things, you got an offer, you can run ads and you can sell it leads.
6:49
You can make this business model work in any local market, all right now, so here's how you get the business owners to agree.
So you go into the groups and you ask folks in the groups and say, hey can I bring you customers for free?
No risk is.
Here's how I'll do it.
I'll fly, I'll spend my own money, etc, etc.
7:05
And then here's the key part.
You then ask them.
What's the absolute cheapest?
That they would fulfill customers for during this thing that you're selling.
So whether it's chiropractor things, whether it's dentist things, Hey Harvey.
Bring you a hundred of these?
What kind of discount could I get here right?
And this works, especially well with services that have low marginal cost which means that adding an additional customer doesn't cost the business that much.
7:26
And remember the big contingency for them is that and you can negotiate hard here is that they're going to get the customers for the Lifetime, right?
And it cost them nothing, so it's like, hey, even if you broke, even on the thing, you get customers for life and you keep making money after that, right?
Like, I'm the one who's, I'm the one, who's throwing all the risk in doing the labor here.
7:42
So ideally you can set it up, like, I had it, where they Read it to do it for close to free Forex period of time because all the customers cost them is nothing right?
And so once you do that because like for me it was I didn't they didn't get anything that I collected for six weeks and after that they can keep whatever they want but that was the deal that I had set up.
7:57
So once you do that you can run the ads and you sell the people.
All right.
So for example, so I'm going to talk about a different industry.
So if I were to do this as chiropractors, I might set up a 20 dollar console, which is normally $200 and every an assessment, whatever that I would mark it, all right?
And then I would get the doc to do the X-ray and then the person would meet with me again and I would sell them at Later for, like 2,500 bucks, for six months, if you can sell a longer form or by all means do.
8:19
So, the deal that you make with a dock would be something like negotiating with him to see what he would fulfill that for.
So if you can get him down to say like 500 bucks and you'd be surprised here, you'd make the spread minus the cost to acquire, right?
So if you charge 2500, and it cost you five, there's 2000 left, then, whatever cost you to acquire is what the cost is.
8:35
And everything else is yours.
More money.
Good.
So you'd run the ads called, we'd sell them to 20 other consult, this make sure they show up just FYI.
And when they come in the docks, you would do the X-ray.
You do the Follow-up meetings then recommend the S the session package.
Right cool.
So let's talk money math.
So if you sold forty eight of these a month, all right.
8:52
That's two a day for 24, working days.
So 24 working days in a month.
So to add a 48, all right?
And you saw them at 2,500 bucks, a pop with a 500 dollar cost of film ever, pay the doctor 500 bucks. 2500 we get and so let's say it.
Also cost you 50 bucks Elite all right with one F5.
9:08
One out of five bonds, 20 percent.
That means your cost to acquire is $250 right?
5 times 50 is 250.
All right.
If you ran this play for a month and spent $400 a day and it's twelve thousand dollars total.
Remember you make money quickly so you can reinvest it in.
Dad's you make a hundred, twenty thousand dollars in gross revenue.
9:24
Mind you.
That's not profit.
That's Revenue.
All right, so we still got to take out your 12K and marketing and your 20 4 K that you have to pay the doc but now you got eighty four thousand dollars left over as a single person that has no employees.
That's all profit.
Right?
So you can stop there.
You can make a million dollars a year in personal income, not bad for no money down to start.
9:41
No degree, no employees, right?
But if you're smart cookie, you do better.
So this is what you do.
You also meet with all those leads again and then sell them retail products.
So think like cream supplements, oils Orthotics, etcetera, right?
Which you could pre-negotiate that you keep all your product sales which is what I heard and so then you make another 500 bucks, a head in profit with this product sales.
10:00
So that puts another twenty four thousand dollars back in your pocket and that now covers the dock.
So now you're back to 108,000 minus your cost of living which when I was doing this across about three thousand dollars a month in Extended Stay, that's I would stay at a motel food gas.
Cetera, so hundred five thousand dollars, boom, 100 Grand plus and profit do employees thousand bucks to start before you run off and do this.
10:23
I told you the beginning that to the good and the bad.
I still haven't told you the ugly.
All right, so here's what I would do different if I could do this again now.
I ran this model for a while.
Here are 11 things that went wrong for me, that I would have changed, all right?
Number one, I'm massively overwhelm.
10:39
The facilities.
I would have spent far more time really planning out how they would fulfill another X.
Patients or clients or customers, Etc?
I would have like, really like, okay, well if we get you 100 customers like what time you going to put them in, like, how can you fill the slot?
I go to spend more time doing that with them.
Number two, I partnered with struggling facilities and so this was a double-edged sword, they're really easy to sell, but at the same time they have bad reputation for a reason.
11:00
They weren't that good a fulfilling.
And so, if I would do this again, I probably would have tried to find good.
People, not just anyone, who would just let me sell in front of the door.
I was young.
I was an experience, I've been mistakes that was one of them.
Number three in retrospect I would have explained all the Stout incur upfront, hotels are fair food, rental ads, been etcetera.
11:18
So, they wouldn't think I was just like, taking all this money, their facility.
I feel like I got cost to right.
So explain that.
So they understand, like I have to make money to do this, right?
And make it worth my time.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
11:38
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
Number four.
I'd also explain how much I plan to make revenue and profit from the facility.
11:56
So they're going to be shocked when I crushed it as they all work, right?
So have them.
Try to get me to stop selling and I would refuse because I needed to sell a certain amount hit my target.
That's why it's so important to explain the cost of fruits.
Like hey this is how much you cost me just to break even.
So I got to sell 40 people just to like cover my nut, whatever it is, write it like, and then I got to sell another 40 if I just want to like hit a 50% margin.
12:16
So I want to do more than that.
So you really got to prepare for this, right?
So it's like it's setting expectations that I I was young and I was like, so, afraid of scaring somebody off that.
I just didn't want to set good expectations, all right?
And mind, you, I set it and none of them believe me and I knew they didn't.
So I was like, whatever.
I'll just prove them wrong.
Ultimately ended up hurting me.
12:32
All right, so all in all, I would have been more transparent upfront.
Make sure they really understood how this is going to happen.
Like mechanics behind it.
Five, I'd have an agreement which I don't have to spell this stuff out.
All right.
So this would further clarify expectations, this is important, it's the contract, right?
So this is clarify, the expectations and hold them accountable for their own behavior.
12:52
These are the word spelled out in front of you.
These are the terms, your account for this.
I'm account for this, right?
If I had done that, I didn't even have contracts.
I was a kid, I didn't know have contracts next.
I would have filmed as much as humanly possible.
This is probably my biggest regret through this entire thing.
I filmed literally nothing and I would have had 30 plus gyms and thousands of sales calls and in-person documented for training.
13:14
I have none.
Like think I'm a sick.
This would be if I had if I was like, here's a thousand fucking sales reports, like that would have been awesome and you could have that.
So if you do this, Model please for the love of God do that because you'll have the extra margin and it's worth having someone be with you.
It's that you can probably need that for the ads.
Anyways, if you want to do inside your iPhone, I did on my iPhone, but point is is that I would have film stuff.
13:33
I would have documented this because like, this is only part of the story that you tell one day, that's what I would have done.
And as a side note me just showing all the contracts that I was selling.
Imagine how easy it would be to Market and sell this organic, I'd like another month, another 100 200 Sales, like it would have been so easy to Market this and I just did it.
13:48
I didn't think about content.
Them just wasn't a thing for me.
Honestly, I think I would have been booked you around like no matter what I would even had to run an ad or do a reach out.
I would have been booked inbound and at that point, this is the cool thing is that if I had done that, I would have more negotiating power.
So I can either negotiate a piece of the back end like what their the continuity was going to be like if they converted or they could have maybe like an upfront cost to go out or they cover my marketing for me.
14:12
Not me.
Like there's other things that I could have been able to leverage.
If I had had more brand more content, you know, and I didn't have that.
So if I could do it again, I would.
I've done that it would made even better deal for me.
Next is I'd include a clause in my contract that I'd have them signed separately for added transparency and accountability that have any customer said they were encouraged to refund.
14:31
So they told a customer, you should refund or you should sign up again through me, right?
So like if I sold a somebody at a chiropractor's office for 2,500 bucks and then I find out that the customer refunds and says they sign back up through the the dock at half price that they would owe me twice with a person paid.
14:48
I would have done that and big Me that was actually the thing that drove this business into the ground for me was that I had a couple of Bad actors which is why I said earlier I would have done deals with better people.
Less Shady who just basically said one guy was like too many people here just refund because it wasn't his money, right?
15:06
He didn't care and so that hurt me a lot.
I also got slammed on a bunch of reviews because I was when he would sell someone into it location and the location with suck and so it was my reputation.
I mean there's two but my reputation cause I was the one he was like this is going to work right?
And I Definitely add Rose Colored Glasses on in the beginning, be like, oh no, it's good.
15:24
They're just Scrappy, you know, but I think ultimately people were not as well.
Served.
I should have picked partners that I really wanted to sell their product.
And I just picked Partners who would let me sell their product and I was better at selling it.
They were and so I mean you know, you learn a lot.
It's been a decade, you know, it's been a while.
15:42
So like the biggest problem is that when I had this like at a few bedrooms that ruined it, some acted really sketchy other.
So class refund inside back up.
And unfortunately, since I was only sold them, I was on left holding.
Back and I was on associated with the decision, which sucks?
I made mistakes.
I definitely put this with my rose-colored glasses on when I was selling these Jim packages.
15:58
I just pretended.
I couldn't see all the crappy stuff that was going on, but I was desperate and I wanted to make money, you know?
And that's something that I own, I would have done it.
I would have done it differently now, which is why I make this stuff.
So my goal is Mosey Nation.
You guys want to repeat mistakes, so I think a lot of my pain could have been avoided with three things, clear expectations, clear agreements and better picking a Partners, but all in all being a Rainmaker, Is a skill that can feed you for life?
16:23
All right.
All you got to do, no matter what industry you're in, is learn one.
How to make a grand, slam offer to how to run a basic, add to get people, to raise their hand and three.
How to upsell those people into a service, all right?
The key points of Leverage, our that you're not getting commission, that's why this is such a profitable opportunity, all right?
16:39
You're getting everything - what you negotiate because you were the one, taking the risk of capital in time.
Like that's the key Point here.
Like you're not a Salesman, you're a Rainmaker.
It's a very different skill set.
All right in If you have a high return on Advertising, this is a license to print money or this is what I did.
16:56
Every time I needed money when I was broke, I would go do this.
I'll go find a facility.
I'd sell in front of it.
I go print myself money.
Alright, was like, this is like my get-out-of-jail-free card, the like is worn down, from the amount of times I use.
It gave me second.
Third fourth, fifth changes in like when you know how to get leads and you know how to sell you have unlimited chances to get it right, all right?
17:14
Like this is a skill worth having the only limit on this business model is the actual capacity, the facility.
So, if I'm picking better Partners, I picked the ones that could handle more patience, more customers that I could sell for, for a longer period of time.
Etc, etc.
Like that's what I would do if I could do this all over again.
And if you're totally, you, you can only have three or four facilities that you're doing this.
17:32
When you just do one a month.
And then you go back to the beginning, like you wouldn't even have to have zillions.
Like I did like you could just go like there's three months in a quarter and I'd have facility 1, 2 and 3 and I go back to facility want to do my rainmaking thing and they could all be the same area, it doesn't matter, right?
But most of times you probably just sell the issue I had is I had some to such a capacity that like they'd be full and Had to go find another one to fill up, and that's why this model, you know, was what it was for me, but there's probably a balance between those two extremes.
17:57
So, bonus number 10, I would have run maybe 250 dollars in ads in every Market before I decided to take them on.
So some markets, perform better than others.
And so I kind of felt like a grand to test for markets, like, 250, 250, 250, 250 to figure out which ones were going to be the most leads for the cheapest price, right?
18:17
And so imagine I've got a bunch of different gyms or chiropractors or dental offices.
Your real estate agent doesn't matter right that?
I'm selling for cleaning services that I'm selling for and I could have been like okay well if I spend 250 in all these markets and this Mark gets me, you know, one third the price leads then I can just ignore these ones and focus my time on the opportunity, right?
18:36
So then I would have only worked with the facilities and the absolute best markets, right?
So to give me more leverage, AKA more money per unit of time and effort that I spent.
And then finally, I would try and find the most expensive stuff to sell, right?
So think, thousands, not hundreds here.
So, like I could have made a lot more than 100 Grand a month.
18:53
If I said, the balls to charge more and find a more valuable service or product, and you can do this in any industry, right?
I like, you can do it in Insurance, you can do it in Pest Control, you can use solar, are you to give you Jim Kyra, dentist, etcetera.
Like, if people have expensive stuff, you can get leads and you can sell them locally, all right?
So if you want to sell stuff in the thousands Market, a cheap or free thing that 0 to 99 dollars.
19:14
That thing is a lead magnet and then upsell them into a multi-thousand dollar thing.
This gets you better lead quality in general.
It will dramatically cut no-shows and rescheduled for appointments because if you build them you know 20 bucks 50 bucks like people are much more likely to come in, right?
19:31
That's what I would do.
Okay, now I promised that at the end I will give you the text set up in the last three minutes so here it goes as fast I can.
All right, so this is crazy simple, so if you're not a tech person like I'm not a tech person.
I was able to figure this out so you Can do this.
All right.
So just as a reminder, it takes 20 hours to learn most things, but most people spend years delaying the first hour, so don't be that person.
19:51
All right, so like I said, I'm not tech savvy and I've got you covered.
So you can figure out how to do all of the tech that I'm about to explain in less than 60 minutes or so like put a timer on six minutes from right now.
This moment you can know all the tech that you need to know.
All right.
So here's what you got to do.
First Google, how to run a Facebook lead at this is how you're going to get leads, give something away for free, the crazy guarantee.
20:14
You'll get leads, your skill, will be up selling them into something more expensive.
That's number one, Facebook me dad.
You just Google how to run one number to Google Xavier Facebook, lead, add to Google Sheets.
All right this will give you a makeshift CRM this will just give you a big ol list of leads.
20:32
So now the ad which you know how to run then zaps over the lead to a Google sheet.
That's Step 2.
Third you Google, zapier, SMS, notification set up with Facebook lead ads.
So third, Google zapier, SMS notification set up so that when you get notified so that you can get notified whenever you get a new lead.
20:54
All right.
So the quick and dirty way anyone can set this up your business.
Alright so I'm going to recap this real quick.
You're going to Google how to run a Facebook we dad and you're going to give some amazing free thing away.
That's what's going to get you leads to make sure you actually capture leads, you're gonna go Facebook lead, add to Google sheet.
No, you don't have to build a web page.
21:10
All right, so like we're making this crazy easy here like no landing page do nothing.
You literally have to learn how to run the And then you put a zipper over to a Google sheet and then you get a Xavier SMS notifications that every time you get a lead you get notified so you can call them and touch them.
That's it.
That's the text set up to make this work.
Isn't this amazing right now?
21:27
This is how you become a Rainmaker and I get asked all the time.
We'll podcast etcetera.
Like if you lost it all, what would you do?
I've lost it all twice.
I know exactly what I would do is I've already done it.
All right, this is what I did.
And this is what I fell back on, what I lost everything.
And to this day, it's a skill that I have and you can have it too, all right?
And if you're wondering, how do I figure out what's, what offer to sell?
21:44
And what, Service, right.
Go to a business, that's local.
That sells expensive stuff offer to sit at the front desk and try out a few different offers until you get the one that works.
Once you keep configuring the price to get ten to one or more you can then copy or paste it in any Market mind you, you might be able to do this and not have a stable of a setup with the first location.
22:02
So you learn.
Right.
You can learn before you earn so learn get all the Kinks out on someone else's money.
You can make significantly less than just say, like, I'll give you all the money.
If you can spend it, I'll work everything for free just to learn once you get the model right now.
Got a way to get 10 21 21, sometimes, 30 to 1, then you scale you copy paste it in other markets, right?
22:19
And then you can make a much stronger deal for yourself.
And as an aside, it's way easier to actually get 12:50 2131 returns in local advertising compared to online because you have implicit trust.
Like if it's whatever your micro local market is, you automatically trust it.
You don't need to watch some long complex video sales letter.
22:35
Like if it's like you know Towson chiropractor like like he's around the corner, right?
You trust them and so you're able to sell High ticket packages with significantly less.
Less Automation and selling before that just because people are, like, I can touch and feel this place, like, there's the location, they're not going to go anywhere and be amazed it still matters.
22:52
Most Commerce still is not done online.
As much as you two will make you think that everybody is online, still?
The vast majority of Commerce is done in person, okay?
And so people trust people who are local to them.
And so if you sell in person, it's even easier.
And if you learn to set over the phone, as a side note, you actually make more money because it's more efficient to sell over the phone, like in terms of sales per hour.
23:12
So it's a higher level skill, it's harder to sell over the But if you do, then you can actually sell for all these different markets from home, as I know.
But I recommend if you're starting out and you've never sold before starting person, do the first one first, some sort of negotiated, that's basically, you're getting nothing and then risking more.
23:27
And then once you get the model down, then you can copy and paste.
It negotiate with more leverage and you make more money as an aside again with the phone thing.
Like the reason it's you make more money is that you spend more time selling and less time waiting for appointments.
So like you don't get no showed on the phone because you can just keep calling other leads and selling them, whereas in person which have to sit there, 30 minutes and it happens a lot, just be real and so you may actually closed a lower percentage of people, you speak to, but you'll talk to twice as many prospects because you don't have to they don't to get in their car, you know.
23:54
Get the appointment show up.
It's like you take that whole step out.
It's just basically like when you would normally be the person confirming the appointment you actually just sell them right there.
That's the 2001 version of this, right?
Like 101 is really 101 is go to a local place and do it for basically free and have them from the wrist.
24:11
To the, you can learn the model to one version of this is that you now fly.
Around or you go to the local places and you negotiate your your splits, you get a majority of the Opera because you're risking the capital.
The time 301 is that you learn how to sell this over the phone so that you can be Central and then you can sell it at any of these locations, right?
24:26
All of these require no employees, basically no money to start, and you can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in profit.
Are we gonna see the opportunity the same way I did?
Because this is literally were like, how do I would you make with?
This is what I would do.
This is how I did it.
Like it's not like a hypothetical me like I've lost my everything.
I've had multiple times and every time, this is what I did to make.
24:44
Money again.
Like how do I print money with no risk?
This is how I did it.
And so my goal again, for everybody watching this is that I hope that used to stuff, make all the money, you know, past three million, get into the 10, 20, 50 Etc, and then allow us to invest in your business.
So we can help you scale from Beyond that otherwise, most Nation, love you.
25:02
See you guys next bit.








0:00
I think the difference between like rich people and poor people successfully people.
Not successful, people is the degree to which they attribute or give power to their circumstance, right?
And so the difference between a self-made billionaire who started with nothing and someone who all started with nothing is not the resources obviously because they both started at 0.
0:17
So what else is it is their resourcefulness not the resources.
The wealthiest people in the world.
See business is a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
0:34
I hope you share and enjoy.
Now the next question that people ask is well then does that mean that you believe things that aren't true?
And the answer is unintentionally know and the reason is unintentionally know is because that to me, something is true based on its ability to increase your ability to predict the future and the outcome of your actions.
0:54
That that's what's true.
If I touch this hot stove, it's going to burn me.
Yeah, I believe that to be true because hey, I've touched hot things before they actually do burn me.
And so when you can like in sales, if I structure the car, Station in this way, it's more likely to lead to an outcome.
1:10
That thing is true.
Just because you've run the experiment enough times to be like yeah.
That actually gives me the ability to predict the outcome of these actions and when I encounter people that either don't even know what their own belief system is.
And so they they think this isn't a belief, this just is true about the world them like know that.
1:30
That is a belief that you've chosen to believe in is completely fucking you up one of my favorite quotes.
I think if there were to be a Oh, that would be on my Tombstone, its top three, which I've Loved a lot of quotes.
It's Orson Scott Card.
He said the question, all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those who never think the question.
1:48
Yes.
And so it's because you truly believe it and those are the ones.
Those are the pesky ones.
Those are the ones I think I was told it because you get asked a lot.
I'm sure like hey I'm going to talk to a mentor.
What questions should I ask them?
And I got this really good one, which is what do I believe to be true?
2:04
That isn't Whoa.
And so great question, right?
And it because I'm sure you see it.
And if I talk to somebody, I can tell like they cast these views of what is, and what isn't about business about marriage about health, whatever it is.
And they say like and then they and then they operate off of that, framework of assumptions, which is might be patently false, and then they wonder why what they're doing is not working.
2:27
It's like because the entire Foundation upon which you built.
This thing is just wrong, right?
And so, you know, the easiest way to do that is to get people were ahead of you who tell you, by the way, I don't think that Strube had to get in a place that somebody can actually communicate that to you and be open to it.
Yeah.
Wichita then you have to do something about it which most people don't care.
2:42
Why should get one piece of advice from people.
I got not going to do anything with this.
Yeah like that.
That's the hard part.
So I have the same impact Theory University where I always thought all I would ever teaches business and I found that to get people Prime to do the business part.
2:58
I first had to deal with all the lies that they were telling to believe, like the self-destructive behavior, all that, once you could get past that, That then they had an actual shot at running business.
But because success is the ability to go from failure, to failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm, and the ability to do that, it's predicated on the story.
3:15
You're telling yourself about yourself, your believe, that it was all like this fucking mindset Like A Rat's, Nest of.
Like God, if I can help you, like peel this stuff back.
Be able to get out of your own way, but most people can't do it.
It's really interesting.
3:30
You were saying that I was like, like, when you hear somebody speak and they really resonate with you.
They give you the chills, you get excited.
It's because they're either putting words to something that you felt but you didn't know how to articulate and now it's super Concrete in your mind or they make you realize you believe something that wasn't true.
3:47
Yeah.
And that's when it's like you feel like you're being set free total and that's like, that's really exciting.
It's like a weight vanishes.
That's my, that's what I like.
That's why I think sales is, is that is that people have these beliefs and you have to know, if, like, the process of being a good salesperson, is being able to help people break the beliefs that they have about themselves or about the realities that are not true.
4:11
And so I think if you can basically just unencumbered somebody then it becomes very easy to sell something because if you have the struggle we have the solution.
You believe that buying the solution which is more likely to get to the outcome, you want?
Yes, what are we doing?
Let's go, you know, I mean it's But talking to that person, you have to Wade through all the stuff.
4:29
Like, I believe that I'd like your advice because I was like, I believe that you could start a college like going to do it and then you start from there.
I like depending on someone's consume beforehand, but I'll tell you, one of the things that's that shaped my life in terms of business stuff, is understanding the concepts of Leverage, right?
4:47
And so, a lot of people are limited by either the skills, the beliefs of the traits they have.
Right.
And so the skill deficiencies the easiest one effects it's like go do.
Petitions in a community of people who are also doing repetitions to learn the same skill and you will learn it quickly, right?
That's the thing.
5:03
Then you have traits and beliefs, which is a little bit more amorphous, right?
And so, from a beliefs perspective, it's you need someone to tell you stories that you believe to be true.
That conflict with your view of reality and then the evidence of their story being truer than yours.
5:22
Then that it's like a frame control that frame.
Now winds and that becomes the new lens that you see I think throw and so I had a friend who had a fitness app and he was doing 20,000 a month.
He was a CrossFit competitor, really high up, he didn't win of course I like all these like you didn't win so you won't tell anybody that he acts.
5:38
He think he deserved it.
He didn't deserve to have a nap because you want anyone to know, he's like, how dare I make a fitness app?
Because I was only fourth in the world, you know, the man or whatever that it then all of a sudden he talked to somebody, he got over it and then he just started, just telling people he had a nap and he went from like 20,000 a month to 100,000 dollars a month and so it's not that his He's changed.
5:57
It's not that is traits change.
You're still just as hard-working.
Same look, the same etcetera.
I was like it's just his beliefs right and I'm sure in the The Entrepreneur Space one of the most common traits is is Focus.
Right.
People can't do the same thing over and over, and they just do all these half built Bridges.
And so I know for me, my big explosion happened in my entrepreneurial Journey when I went from having nine businesses, and it's not a misspeak, nine as in one less than 10 at the same time that I was CEO of all of.
6:25
So I had a dental.
The agency marketing agency at a chiropractor marketing agency, I had gym launch, we'd fly out and do Jim turnarounds.
And then I had five gems of my own Jesus at the same time and I was somehow perplexed as why I wasn't making any money.
I was there's like everything was always on fire all the time and I always just sold my ass off enough to be able to pay all the bills and have nothing left over.
6:47
That was the, that was how I rocked it and it was only, you know, when Layla came in and she was like, you know, I think maybe if we just did one thing you could win because he was like, imagine imagine if all you had to do is make one of these businesses work, how easy would that be?
7:05
I was like oh my God I'm gonna make one of them were could be a joke and like I heard myself say that and I was like you're an idiot why are you so dumb?
And so like the treat that I was missing at that point was focus and or discipline.
I couldn't say no I didn't have that muscles.
That was a trade I lacked and so it's like boom and then that blew up.
And so it's like sometimes the question is, which of these things do people lack and Since we don't always know because we don't have the perspective to judge ourselves often, it's like you just got to keep moving in all of the directions, getting those communities.
7:31
And then like, that's also really like, I'm a big believer in the alternative education, space the whole Guru space that everyone.
You know, laments and hates.
I learned everything from that space that's going to go away.
There's always going to be fake people.
That people will be dismissive of, but we're just in a weird transitional moment.
7:48
Now where traditional college is people are beginning to realize Hey, some of these degrees are dubious at best and then B.
And here's the thing that breaks my heart a teacher 99 times out of 100 has gotten good at one thing teaching.
8:06
Yeah.
So people like why don't they teach us this in high school?
Finance, mindset, whatever.
Now might cause they don't fucking know but they can't do it in their own life.
God bless him.
There are so many things that like, I'm terrible at and so I feel their pain, they've gone down the path of being an educator and so that they know how to do is educate.
8:24
Don't necessarily know, Finance mindset, whatever and if they did they would be off doing those things.
And so getting somebody who's expert at that stuff to teach is next to impossible until now, like when I grew up, you had to go to the library to like find a quote or something like that, right?
8:42
It was insane.
How hard it would be just to find a cool quote.
You would literally just like find okay?
This philosopher and you flip anything.
Cool on this page flip.
Anything cool on his face and he would find some, you'd have to build like a whole argument around.
The quote, you could find is crazy.
So, nowadays you're able to get like when I stop and think.
9:01
Okay, hold on.
I've been in business now for 20 plus years.
I've had an incredible career already and feel like I'm just getting started.
And I poured my heart and soul into teaching everything.
I know as fast as I can fucking talk and people can get access to that with a few clicks on the internet, like that's bananas.
9:19
And so enough people that have a real track record are going to put Horses together, that then help people go on to have a career.
You know, one of the things that happen recently, I had this like, big Epiphany moments home.
I'll share it with you, but I was talking to Caleb video, my my man and he was like, you know, I'm a competitive person.
9:38
And so I look at the, the grants the Gary's inside of my cousin being by tell them that their age, I was like, I'm going to be way ahead of that, right?
And I think it was killed.
Who said it back to me?
He's like, he's like, yeah, but Gary didn't have Gary.
Mmm, I like it.
Like really.
9:53
Like hit me, right?
And so I think that there is just, you know, there's gen Z that's coming up.
And what not, there's always these disconnects and there's there's, I don't see Wars.
There's conflict between age groups, Etc.
And the old guys are like these kids.
Don't know what I had to go through.
10:09
They've got it so easy, right.
And these guys are like these guys, just saying three minutes.
Okay, yeah, these guys are out of touch, right?
But the flipside if you ask me not to wonder what his goal is.
Usually to work, make the world a better place to have an impact etcetera.
And it's like, well, if you want to make the world a better place, Doesn't that mean the Next Generation has it easier?
10:26
Like, does that mean we did our job?
And so there's this competition that I used to feel towards like the older classmen if you know, like think about it like entrepreneurial grades.
I feel like I'm going to be further faster Whatever by that time then that guy is but lo and behold those guys helped me.
10:43
So of course it would make sense that I get there faster and like I'm sure you've seen like their guys in their mid-20s with nine-figure companies that and they're killing it.
And that wasn't it just Wasn't, how do I say it wasn't possible?
It was extremely extremely extremely unlikely 20 years ago.
11:00
Yeah, right.
But because of the access to information, the information is out there and so somebody who's 26 can have the experience of somebody who's 60 20 years ago so they can be as good at the game.
Real Talk as good at the game as something that much older is because they've had Warren Buffett videos.
11:18
They be able to watch their whole High School about finance, and investing, and Turley murder, talk about character traits and all these things.
Is that you wouldn't you didn't have, you know, I mean like you might have the shareholder letter and that's all you got.
You said to be reading it, right?
And so anyways, it's been a really interesting shift for me to also think about the fact that a lot of times we think, like I want to be the greatest of all time.
11:38
I'm sure a lot of people, write, whatever, but if I did, my job, I won't be because somebody else will be better than me if I did my job.
Yeah.
And so that was like a really interesting point that I feel like shifted inside of me in terms of a competition and thinking like I shouldn't be competing at these guys.
11:54
Ahead of me, I should be thanking them, because, of course, I'm going to be there sooner faster than them.
I was like, because I had them and they didn't have them, they're just figuring it out because you should want to fucking Crush all of.
I've right, me included, dude, you're on such a rad pace.
12:11
And here's the thing, the older guys owe it to themselves to be thrilled.
That business is a sport that you don't have to age out of.
Yeah, so my knees going bad doesn't fucking matter in business.
Yeah, and I should be able to Capitalize on all the things that I know and all that.
So I should be able to keep going until I run out of desire to do all this.
12:30
But my thing is, I don't want people to give up on competition.
So I used to be afraid of competition because I sucked and I didn't think I could get better.
So, with a fixed mindset or competition was not interesting.
I there's only one thing that I've ever gotten a disproportionate return on and that is speaking.
12:46
So I've always been highly verbal.
Yeah.
But when I was coming up, ah, how do you do something with that?
I didn't.
To be an actor.
So it was like well there wasn't a, lot of avenues, it's obviously changed and I've been able to capitalize on it right now.
That once once I had something to say and to camera I wasn't an idiot.
13:05
I'm like I am so verbal.
I will perform very well on camera that is highly strategic.
Nobody should feel bad for me.
So it's like cool.
I got to finally leverage that Talent.
So I love that.
The Young Bucks are coming up.
Yeah, it feels so rad.
My whole thing is, I have had to learn everything.
13:21
The hard way, it just the way that I wired whatever.
So it's Stokes me out to be able to go.
Okay, I learned this through Blood, Sweat, and Tears, a massive amount of pain and suffering.
I'm going to tell it to you as fast as I can fucking talk.
I'll do it for free like that's why my paycheck, but I'm also like, it's not like I'm holding anything back right now, so I will give people all the information and my hope is that you come up, but be aware.
13:44
I want to compete.
I want to be on the field.
I want these young guys who think they can take a job.
Like I motherfucker, like we're in this.
Let's go.
But it's a light energy, it's an expansive engine.
Like if somebody beats me passes me, whatever, cool, I'm all for it.
As long as you're down for me to be on the field and go as hard as I can and want to win and constantly push myself.
14:03
Like it's fun because I no longer one.
I know what success is and people end up trapping themselves.
Thinking it's money.
All that shit.
Ha ha ha.
Like they have a very painful Awakening coming their way which I had to live through.
And then also it's like being able to play is fun man.
14:22
And so if you lose Site of the fun and you're just worried like oh is somebody better than me of outperforming the better you're going to miss out?
Oh see the both sides of it right.
You've got the guys who are head who I used to be like I'm going to do all this right and the guys behind him like they're so lucky right.
14:40
If only I had right that thinking and I feel like at least it was just that that little quote, like Gary didn't have Gary like that.
Thought process.
For me.
I feel like for me Like Mike a bit of jobs that were going anywhere, like it's going to be there forever but the I feel like I was able to it was more like doing honor to the game.
14:59
Yeah that I'm going to bring to transform my potential into reality and dragon by the fucking balls if I have to to make it happen like it was more to honor the game and all the other players in it.
Yep.
Rather than me trying to like and it almost felt small-minded be like, why am I gonna pick this guy to compete against, like, how about just doing a service to the game about being an Excellent player.
15:22
I love that.
As long as you don't lose sight of the whole Kobe thing like what made Kobe?
So interesting to me was that he was just die hard dude.
And so I'm not a sports guy so never really thought about Kobe like that.
But I was so inspired by the way.
15:38
He would talk about things.
I never got to meet him which I'm absolutely mortified by it.
But the way he talked about everything I was like, wow, what a fucking competitor like and as I had gotten older and really learned the power of competition and be willing to put myself out there and go For Broke.
Really find my limits, right?
And I want to die like I can already tell you, just the way that I'm wired, I will be horrified by the personal limitations that I have because we all do, we're 50%.
16:03
Hardwired 50% valuable.
I'm going to do the most that I can with my malleable.
I'm already traumatized by the limitation correct but like you know, I'm going for it, but so watching Kobe, I was damn like I'm so inspired by the willingness to push yourself that hard to see like what do I have?
16:21
Have in me.
Yeah.
And then that my the fuck away from basketball into my Arena.
And he came to film and his first film, he won an Academy Award.
Now, I was like this fucking guy, but I was so inspired right?
And so, I may be misinterpreting what you're saying, but what hits me is Caleb's.
16:40
Comment took it from maybe a bit of a dark energy to like, oh, that's actually pretty rad.
Yeah, I had an advantage that he he didn't have.
It makes me appreciate the game.
Makes me wanna play with honor and This guy's so becomes this expansive thing, but I would expect you to dunk on me if you can write and then be like, how many I broke her game?
16:59
Yeah, it's all good.
Like, we both like admit it but at the same time, like, yeah, I'm going to be trying to dunk on you, you know what I mean?
But like, with a smile and like a handshake, and the way that you hear like, the guys that were on that first Dream Team.
Yeah.
Talk about each other and like wrapping the country, which is to me what you say when you want to honor the game and say, hey we're fucking rapping something in that case.
17:21
Oka.
Yeah, basketball.
Yeah.
But we're here to win.
We're also here to have fun and like that's my thing.
And what I always tell whether you're trying to be an entrepreneur, a better parent.
Whatever is you've got to optimize for the game still being fun when you're losing if you can't have fun when you lose man my heart bleeds for you because you're going to lose so often it just is what it is.
17:42
Even people that win you just lose so many times, whether it's a just a lead funnel that didn't work or you go up on stage and it fucking bombs whatever there's going to A lot of losing in your career.
It's like Jordans whole thing about of losses.
Many games taking this menu, in your shots and Misawa and I succeed because of all of that, right?
17:59
So you've got to be able to have fun in the loss because I can guarantee the struggle I can't guarantee success.
So you've got to be able to live that, but if you love that, there is something about going for broke to.
I'm so honored by even though that means that people are gunning for me.
18:15
Yeah, it's worth it.
It's funny.
Cause when I think about that, I think about game theory in general to church, You're very familiar with right?
And so it's shifting from like the finite to the infinite perspective and so like, how do you win at business?
You win by not stopping.
Yep.
Like from an infinite from an infinite.
18:32
You know what I mean?
And so that's always been one that's that's been interesting to me but I'm super open to what you're saying with the the competitive in this piece and I probably share some of the similar things to you.
I guess when you were younger or at least my it right trying to take the good of competition and cast out the bad.
18:51
Yeah, station and so trying to like separate those things and I think this has been part of my attempt at doing that as reframing the game in that way and trying to look at it from the infinite perspective of like there is no number one like they're like is it is it?
Because because if you're saying number one, you say of what year or what I'm saying, that's exactly right.
19:09
Is it, by what metric is about net?
Worth is my cash flow is a by 88 by net worth by per unit of time, you know, I mean, if Warren, Buffett added 74, no one will care, right?
And I will just give people the punch line, all that matters is how they feel.
About themselves in the by themselves.
That's it.
Please only chase that.
19:24
Now, when you're chasing that at a grand scale, it's amazing because you're like, whoa here, dude.
The I'm so curious to see if you agree with this.
So here's my whole thesis on life.
The first of all, Chase fulfillment.
It's the only thing that stable across Joy and Pain the process.
19:44
Yep.
And then the best thing that life has off you the fucking best.
There is no.
Channel Peak higher than the following.
You're working really hard at something and it's working and if you pull this off there's huge upside that moment.
20:02
It's better than being an actual huge upside like the the moments in my life where I'm like climbing at this perilous Cliff I'm fucking looking down, my fingers are just ice cold, right?
And I'm just clinging but I'm like, fuck, I'm making good progress.
20:18
Like I've really come a long way.
I can see the peak.
It's not that far.
Our.
And if I get up there, there's like, a crazy Vegas, Buffet have an orgy, and it's like, oh my God, I can get there, this is going to be the best.
It's actually better than the buffet in the order.
20:33
You're not mean.
It's like it's that moment where you like your fingers are freezing but you're going to make it like that's the fucking juice and so hey enjoy the food, enjoy the orgy, they're incredible but I promise as soon as they're over, you're going to be like, where is that next thing?
That I can get my fucking fingers freezing to death.
20:49
Again, it just Dave's, That's The Human Condition.
And when people understand the game, when you understand that, I can never take a drink so thirst-quenching that I'll never need another drink again.
There's no meal so amazing that you'll never be hungry.
21:05
Again.
There's no sex, so good.
You'll never once I think you just, that's just the way the human animal is wired.
Like when people are at peace with that, the like then now you've really got a shot at loving your life, understanding the cycle.
21:20
Is and that you're going to keep doing the climb.
And so, you better love to climb up the that moment.
Before, the moment, those like I was thinking, as you were saying, I was thinking fast like the few of those moments that I've had like, the first time, you know, you start running ads and, like, start getting your first lead.
21:38
You're like, holy shit.
It's working.
Yeah.
Like, it's that, you know, I mean that moment or the first, I remember I hired my first sales person and they close the sale and I wasn't there.
So the first person that had made me money who wasn't me.
Yeah.
And I was like, I I pulled over saw the road, I teared up because I was like It doesn't have to just be me anymore, you know what I mean?
21:56
It's like, I've just thinking about all these moments that I've had.
I'm a when we were laying are sitting over the kitchen counter and we had just switched from flying out a sales team in person to do these turnarounds to switching the licensing and I got on the phone to tell guys who are going to launch the next month that we were going to do that anymore.
22:14
We're thinking about switching directions and so I said hey you know what I can't do it but I'll tell you how I do it but I'm not flying out there anymore and they're like all that's fine how much and I didn't want to do it.
So I picked a super high number.
Which was six thousand dollars at the time.
And the guy said yes.
And I was like and I remember that moment being like holy shit, what just happened?
22:31
And I had seven more calls a day and like that day.
I mean, like, 60,000 dollars and I had just been unlike, the story, those tiles Go full circle.
Like I just been completely broken.
Like in that moment like Jim watch hadn't, been created yet, there wasn't, you know, all these other things.
But in that moment I was like, what if this keeps happening?
22:48
Are we out of it?
Like, did we finally is this?
The one thing that's finally gonna get me out of like failure after failure.
You're after failure after failure.
And so, it's just like, what is the event that gives you the biggest predictor of the future success.
So like there's micro Winds of like, hey the funnels working, I've got leads and then you have like a day a few shows like what if this happened every day and then maybe you exit questionnaire like what if I exit 5 more tighter?
23:10
I mean like so anyways I was just I was really cool for me just even thinking through like those snapshots of moments.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
23:25
It has almost a perfect for you can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I can push the partner with you so that's my give.
23:43
Go check it out Amazon, and back to the show.
It's very incredible and you start to learn like, okay, what is it, that I really loved.
And so for me when we were at Quest and selling it was huge and it changes your life and it was really been, and here's going back to money.
24:03
So Quest ended up being two bites at the Apple.
There was like a first bite where we took a small investment but the valuation was so big.
It was life-changing.
Yeah, that was the biggest like Oh My God moment because I went from my wife and I share Car, it's a beat-up, Ford Focus with a leaky exhaust borrowing, rides off my employees who had nicer cars me.
24:25
Delaying gratification of that going from that to I now have a Beverly Hills mansion that was the crazy moment when I went from my starter Mansion to my big magic that wasn't as cool.
No, it wasn't his need of a moment even though it was actually a bigger dollar amount change it wasn't as like, whoa, I really feel this This change.
24:49
And then thankfully, I learned actually when I was still not really making money on paper, I was worth two million dollars.
Yeah, but I learned very quickly, a the money is not making me feel better about myself, which I secretly thought it would.
And then also there's a big difference between paper money and real money, but I learned that lesson.
25:05
So I never tied my sense of self-worth to the money or anything like that, which is something I constantly remind myself.
Now, not to let my identity get tied up in that because the world reflects that back to me, all Time, right?
So whether it's oh, you sold the building a company for a billion dollars or amazing house or even just oh my God.
25:27
Like what you built socially?
It's incredible.
It's like I have to really disconnect from that because I'm like, all of that is transient, it's all transient, I've no idea if any of it will be here tomorrow.
So it's like you have to be really thoughtful.
25:43
What is it?
You think about yourself when you're by yourself.
What do you think about?
Out that like now you've been on both sides of the coin, you've changed your physique which is a big thing but you change it so early that I wonder, how do you think about yourself?
What's your self-image?
26:00
What's it anchored to?
I'm gonna surprise me.
That's right, I don't know, I think it's some unless I'm not some misunderstanding the question but, you know, for me it's I think a lot of my definitions have been defined by my actions and so I am the person who has done these things, Things.
26:18
And I will do things that will get me closer to the things that I want to achieve.
And so a lot of my definition of self is always been based on evidence and so I think it was harder for me in the beginning because I didn't have evidence to support what I hope to be true about myself which at the time was it.
26:35
And so what did you hope to be true that you could figure it out?
Or was it always a result that you Associated it too?
I mean, it was I want to make more money than my dad.
I mean, that was that was thing you know, for Me.
And that was, that was all I needed.
I remember thinking in college because I, you know, you're young in college and it's like be happy and all that stuff.
26:55
And I just remember, being like, fuck happiness.
And that was like a moment for me.
I was like, fuck happiness.
I don't care about happiness.
I want to do this and you care about having this.
That's very counterintuitive even now super counterintuitive at that age.
Yeah, because I was obsessed with how not happy.
27:12
I was hmm.
And so in being so the things you were doing that weren't designed to make you happy.
That's what's weird.
So I was I was so obsessed with like positive psychology and I was reading all these stuff and watching these.
TED Talks I remember the whole I remember this whole period of my life and I was constantly assessing my mood as a determination whether I was happy or not it became so obsessive that I was just like fuck all of this.
27:33
I was like, I'm just gonna do shit and that's all like I'm gonna do shit and hopefully it works out.
Did you ever Define what works out means?
If it isn't happy, less be less unhappy.
I would say was my thought process.
It was like, I'm just gonna Do the things.
27:49
And so I shifted from a lot of introspection, internal mood regulation and thinking, and stuff, and I think a lot of the reason that I've the World Views I have about, you know, emotions and what not have come from this kind of initial experience.
It's like, I had that and then I just started working.
28:05
And then I found myself actually looking up after, you know, a decent period of time in like, you know, I'm actually I haven't thought about happiness in a long time and I think I might be And so I also don't really, like the word happiness, because it's circumstantial versus Joy.
28:21
But like, I experienced Joy significantly more now than I did, then when I was younger.
And I think it's partially because like, you can be mournful and joy.
It's like an appreciation of The Human Experience.
Like this is terrible.
But like, even in the suffering, there's Beauty in that, you know what I mean, because it's purely human.
28:39
Yeah.
And so I think it was disconnecting your esteem that that it matters to me as well, but I've never had to articulate it.
What, what is Is the connection to like The Human Experience.
That is so valuable that it's joyful even in morning, I think it's just understanding both sides of the coin.
28:57
I feel so cut like so like if there's a few things that I believe it is that is that like I right now?
There, you know, there's things in my life that I don't like that, I wish for better and there are things in my life that I really like and you know, ten years ago, it was the same way in 10 years from now will be the same way and when I die, there will be stuff that I will not have accomplished that I will wish I had, there will be things that I wish I had done.
29:17
That I will not have done and there will be things that I have done that.
I am proud of and so like those things are not going to change and so if the only thing that's, I mean, it sounds hoping not overly tribal.
It's like all I can do is just enjoy the game and it took me a really long time to get there.
Like it took me a really long time to get there or at least it felt that way, or at least.
29:35
It felt like I suffered a lot on that process, which is why I have a heart for people who were like, dude.
I'm you know, I'm super sad or suppress whatever it is.
And is because I judge myself so much on not being happy all the time because I thought there was something wrong with the fact that I wasn't happy that I drew Myself, insane, not being happy rather than just being like you know what, maybe I'm just going to do the stuff and just fuck happiness for a minute.
29:56
And so I think it's like when we have these like, am I happy?
Am I not happy?
My opinion.
Is that you have to rise above it so that you can just see.
You can feel the Spectrum which is just being present and I think again how it's his two sons have been around that long.
30:12
If you are present you can your present like most people aren't present ever and so it's like if I can just Be present even in my suffering, there, right?
Then I can experience joy for being human and having this experience that I only got once and the biggest frame shift that I've had in terms of my experience of living has been, it sounds weird but it's something I'll call the grandfather frame which is I learned how to become apathetic, right?
30:38
Because that took me time to stop feeling pain you know how the brain tries to predict the next word.
Somebody's going to say apathetic was not the word I was expecting you had to learn to be apathetic.
Yeah exactly.
Cared so much about everything care about everyone thought care about.
Like like I care about what everyone thought and I probably still do just less, you know?
30:54
I mean, I still do care just less.
And so the frame of the veteran told me that, which is, if this negative thing were to happen a thousand times over and over and over again.
How would I feel in the thousandth time?
Well, probably not that bad.
Well, why don't I just choose to feel that way now, right?
And so, that really helped me a lot.
31:10
Just the frame of the veteran, right?
Whether there was traffic, whether it was a breakup, whether we like whatever it was, I could apply that.
Like, I have broken up with every single day for a Straight days.
How much would it bother me?
I'd still be here, you know?
Okay.
And then I was like, is there a way that I can take of a frame that would allow me to feel gratitude?
31:27
Because it's something that I've, I've struggled to feel right?
Like I definitely get the dry feeling.
Got that one done in Spades.
But gratitude, not so much, right?
I've done the the habits and things like that.
For me, it didn't work, so it doesn't just for me.
And so I thought of this Frame, which was I call the grandfather frame, but if I want into a time machine and 85 years old, right?
31:45
I'm like close to dying Little Creek.
Gee, you know, I've got tons of money, not a lot of time and I somehow sacrifice all the money I have just to be my age again.
As I wake up in the morning and I'm Mighty D five-year-old, self living through my 30 year, old body, and thinking, through that, frame of how I would wake up and be like, Oh my almost don't, I don't think I have muscles, I haven't had it wasn't right now.
32:10
Look my God, she's so young.
I remember she used to look like this.
Now, look outside, and I'm like, man, this is Vegas before they did all the hard.
Helicopters and the flying cars and look at it.
God has changed so much right then you walk downstairs.
You are like, man coffee.
32:25
Ah, we're going to these mugs, remember?
We had mugs and the crazy and so it's this weird frame where it just drills you to it, just begs you to the present and you get to experience the current state from a future State for the first time.
And so it's been one of the things that's been really profound for me.
32:42
In terms of like dealing with stressors with getting into it, like when I get into movies like my hold on, Let me D5 and waking up like all of a sudden like everyone, I used to stress about these business things, like it works out, it's fine.
And if it doesn't cares, I was like, Ima Be 500.
32:58
I would give all my money away - who cares and so, and I'm like, but isn't this cool that I'm like, look at me all trying to play the game, you know, my God blood.
And so it's like, it gets me into this really interesting place where I can feel like I can get above myself in the game, and should be like those frames have served me very well, and I hope that other people can Can use those in some way in their life to do stuff that they weren't otherwise going to do.
33:22
So I was I was that that's mine.
My two frames that have certainly won't do frames of reference is everything.
This is actually what started impact theory in the iteration that it became so mad Quest.
And I've got 1,000 employees a group hard in the inner cities, but intelligence is evenly distributed, right?
33:43
So just like you have Dumb Friends into and an upper-middle-class neighborhood, you can have Dumb Friends in the City, but just like you have Smart, friends.
You're going to Smart friends.
And so there were plenty of people that was like, damn, like you are smart, but your frame of reference is stupid.
Yeah, and the way that you view the world is so ineffective, meaning, it doesn't move you towards your goals or your goals are idiotic.
34:05
Yeah.
And, and, and I mean that, if your goals lead you to suffer and you don't want to be suffering the, I would say it's very plain, your goals are idiotic.
So anybody that that wants to write in the Feed that, you know, you can't just some of these goals.
Yes, I can very much so because you either have goals and you're moving towards a more, you do it and you're not.
34:25
And so I'm looking at it and I'm like, wow, this is a mindset problem.
This isn't a an intelligence problem, you have the ability to process raw data, which is how I'll say intelligences and they have that.
But the software that they use to process that raw data leads to such a bizarre frame of reference for how the world works or what they're capable of that, their behaviors become in effect.
34:48
So I was like, okay, so the thing I'm going to try to do is help people change their frame of reference.
Now, I used to really potent frames of reference for me, one is very similar so I'll use a death bed frame of reference to say.
Okay, how will I think about this now?
35:04
I don't get trapped though because I don't live for my death but I think that's a mistake and I think a lot of people optimized for something.
They're going to go through maybe last week, maybe it lasts a year, but it isn't the bulk of your life.
And so to over Optimized for that, I think is a mistake.
But to get the perspective of like, oh my God, I remember when I used to stress about that, like, come on.
35:22
This doesn't mean anything, we're facing your mortality.
So that's super useful.
And then the other frame of reference that I use is the brain in a vat.
And so I'm like, imagine that you're just a brain-in-a-vat and that this thing that you're really stressing because normally, you're going to be worried about something that happened or you're obsessing about something that happened, what makes you think about?
35:44
Or it could be the future but either case, you can't change.
Either of Because one's not real and ones in the past.
And I was like what if this thing that I'm really worried about that's already happened?
That I can't change, is really just context for this brain in this, you know vat living in a simulation to just to get you moving and the all these memories that are trapping you they are fake and there's something about that that lets me off the hook.
36:09
I don't need to beat myself up over it.
It's just a frame of reference its context to get me moving.
Yeah.
And then I remind myself I actually am just a brain-in-a-vat it just Opens that the the vat is the chemicals that, you know, my brain is sitting in and the glass of that jars my skull.
36:25
And so all of this really is a simulation even if it's it's an accurate simulation, it is a simulation in the less.
Yeah.
And I won't derail the whole conversation on that but like it's very easy to recognize that the world really is a simulation because reality is the number of photons falling on an object but you perceive it as color or whatever, not math.
36:47
And so putting myself in either of those, like, hey, this isn't really going to matter at some point and oh, that thing that's creating your sense of identity.
It could be made up.
Anyway, I don't think it is.
But like it's very helpful to remind myself that those are malleable things that's been men when we started the conversation.
37:09
It was like, why do you think people aren't successful?
Why do you think people fail?
And it's, I think it comes down to those things.
It's like, it's the it's the fear.
Fear of photons that fall on an object that prevent people from starting.
Or when they do get hit one time, extrapolate that out till their death bed and say I will forever and therefore I will not continue.
37:31
And so I think that those for like those frames are the things like if there's things that I would take with me until I die, it will be the frames because like you can lose it all and then you like, you lost everything tomorrow.
You'd be back in 12 months, you know what I mean?
I mean, when I lost everything the second time, And I, you know, I just lost all the gyms and all the money and everything and I was just like thinking that that was the thing that I had lost rather than the thing that I had gained that was non material being the more the more valuable of the to that was like one of my big lessons and I feel like you obviously have far more of those than I do but that that one stuck with me it's interesting I have a slightly different belief, based on all that or at least way that I look at it which is if I lost everything tomorrow, I might not ever gain it back.
38:17
Okay hmm it's entirely possible.
Now I think I have a set of skills and never going to worry about money and all that, but I really life has taught me that I cannot guarantee myself the success because I failed multiple times a businesses.
So it isn't like oh it's guaranteed because I've had a success before it's guaranteed.
38:34
I'll never go hungry borrowing, head trauma, but it is, you know, it's a nun.
And that's why I'm very careful not to let that be my Identity or like, I don't know.
If you've ever read Stephen King's book The Stand However that one.
Oh my God.
So there's this thing.
38:50
I'm so glad I read this when I was a kid because so one of the main characters is a guy who's just finally gotten famous as a singer and this is back.
Read this probably late 80s.
So getting famous was like, the most insane thing you could do.
39:06
Getting rich was Far easier than getting famous.
And so, he finally got famous his songs everywhere on the radio and then the end of the world happened to nobody cares.
And I remember thinking, whoa, Like, you could achieve that thing, The Impossible thing, and the next day, it's just gone.
39:23
Yeah.
And so especially at the moment, we're living in now where there's a lot of written certainty.
I'm just like, don't tie your sense of Worth or the thoughts.
You think are useful because they have resulted in wealth.
The thoughts that I think are useful because they have resulted in fulfillment.
39:41
That's the thing like I really want people to Anchor around but yes, I certainly take the transparently, I'm probably not there.
Like I don't think I've like I'm not I don't think I don't think I'm as optimized on that.
It's like you are.
I think you have more of that than I do in terms of like optimizing around fulfillment.
39:58
I think I Stephanie still have a degree of my self-worth wrapped in the things we do and the companies we own and stuff like that.
Like I If all of those because the thing is like, if in the magic situation where that all vanished, there would be something that I had probably done wrong.
40:15
Now there are occasions you know, where you own a gym business In kind of it where you're like, man, there's some stuff that would it be reasonable for me to have predicted this?
Probably not.
Okay, I'm not going to be myself about this one, but like, if barring a true Act of God situation and there were just good old-fashioned.
I'm the only one who loses everything and everyone else doesn't.
40:32
I probably would be upset.
I be upset.
I'm not a fucking monk.
I just, I remind myself.
Yeah, yes totally.
You're like, how do you judge yourself in here when you're naked in the mirror at night of like, well, on that day, I I feel badly this is not feel good hundred percent dude.
40:52
So I've got the final quote that I want to share with people.
That is my favorite quote from you but first I want you to tell people where can they follow you?
If you listen to podcast you can just search my name, Alex and Rosy and you'll find the game.
If you are on YouTube, you can search by name and you'll find my YouTube channel.
41:10
If you're on Tick-Tock Instagram, they're all those places Twitter actually Super Active on Twitter, you can find me there just by searching my name.
Amazing.
All right, now I want to give people a quote, I have guide.
Love this so much.
Do not cast power to your excuses, own your circumstances because no one else will.
41:29
So I think the difference between like rich people and poor people successfully people, not successful, people is the degree to which they attribute or give power to their circumstance, right?
And so the difference between a self-made, billionaire who started with nothing and someone who all started with nothing is not the resources, obviously, because they both started at 0.
41:48
So what else is it?
Is their resourcefulness, not the resources.
And so, if we give power to circumstance, then we cast power outside of ourselves.
If we give power to other people, we cast power odds.
Ourselves, and so it's, you know, it's controlling the controllable, you know, when I say that got a lot of that is, is how that quote is, how I see selling, its people cast power their circumstances in my job is to get them to unfuck themselves around the power that they have just cast to something, they cannot control and so if I can just get them to own even just own the fact they suck.
42:23
That's good enough because they actually can own it and there is pride in that you can take pride in the fact that you admit there's a deficit, right?
But there is The only thing you can take pride in his casting and being a victim, like no one was sort.
Even if you're right, it doesn't serve you, right?
If you're born with one act, you know, one less leg than you should, you're right.
42:39
You have a disadvantage at being a sprinter.
Like, you have a disadvantage, but it doesn't serve you in any way to admit it.
And so, it's owning the fact that, like, you are the only person who can actually change anything about your life because you may blame your circumstances but no one else will care.








0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
But bottom line, if you want to go fast, go broad, but if you want to be good, you be better.
Served Stig narrow for a little in scaling out.
Like for example, Facebook started in college before the expanding out.
So it's not like you have to go abroad immediately.
Like You start narrow and then you continue to generalize over time, the wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
0:36
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
There are only five ways to scale how many people you can sell to for any business.
0:54
I'm going to give you all five and a framework to think through that, you can apply to any business that you ever start for the rest of your life.
That's right now, if you're not selling as many clients or customers as you want my people to fix that, within just a few minutes, if you don't know who I am, my name is Alex Mosey.
I'm the founder of acquisition.com portfolio companies, that is over, $200 a year and I make you so much you to use as much more free stuff is can grow your business.
1:14
Did three, two hundred million dollars a year in revenue, and allow us to invest in your business, to scale beyond that.
So let me tell you, I discovered this scaling framework, you can scale any business this way and these five specific manners.
So a few years ago I went to this Meetup that I got invites, you buy a buddy who just sold for 200 million and he invited me and six other businesses to this cabin by the lake.
1:34
And so, the business is range between 30 on the low end and 250 million dollars in Top Line on the high end and everyone who got like.
So everyone got their got up and shared stuff that was working well for them and their respective Industries in.
This was everything from phone repairs to solar sails to solar to a massive International MLM selling supplements.
1:52
All right, so the experiences were super diverse just like listen to each of the speakers and I was among the smallest the room at the time.
One thing became really clear to me.
No one had any magic that I didn't have as in.
I didn't meet anyone in think.
Man there's some Elon Musk Super Genius that is impossible to compete with.
2:10
It was not that at all.
Like in fact, the two biggest observations that I had were that one people.
There had been in business longer than me doing the same thing the entire Time.
That was a big lesson for me.
Growth just happened as a consequence of not stopping and steady consistent improvement over time.
2:27
Like, that was my biggest first take away.
They've been doing it a long time.
They hadn't changed directions and they just been getting a little bit better every single year.
The second thing is that they all attack a much bigger market segments than me.
In other words, they had a much larger Tam which is an investing term for total, addressable Market.
2:43
Basically, the amount of people who could reasonably qualify to buy your thing, so in the beginning, you want to Niche down, so that's normal.
So if you're new, you're starting A out, it's normal to want to Niche, down and money.
That's always the advice.
People starting out because it's much easier to attract a narrow field.
It's also easier to deliver to a very narrow segment.
You can talk in their language, you can be exactly what they want over time.
3:01
Though.
It's natural for a business to expand its scope and by extension its Market.
All right, now, if you look at Apple, for example, they're not Niche, right?
Netflix isn't Niche.
So it's not, it's not like if you're not ditching, it's bad.
It's just when it's a question of sequence, right?
So, those guys sell to everyone and over time you start a niche and then you expand That's I'm going to talk about the five ways that you can possibly expand from an itch, all right?
3:23
And over a very long time, rise.
And if you build an enormous business, you'll do all five of these expansion scaling methods.
All right.
You would only do want.
So, let's dive at.
So the first thing that you can do if you envision a triangle, right?
It's like this is the whole Marketplace is that you can go up Market.
What that means is that every segment has a higher or more leveraged version of its core market.
3:43
And so if I were to sell a hair salons, I'd go up Market to multi-location, chains or big National corpse or Franchises right, that would be going Market.
If I sold a widget to small business owners like Salesforce in the beginning, over time they went market and so they went Enterprise.
3:59
So they went to Fortune 500 companies, they went up and they went bigger the pros.
Are the deals are worth significantly more, and they turned far less often because you're dealing with more sophisticated business owners.
You don't have non payment issues, etcetera, the cons are.
They're harder to sell and it takes a much longer time Horizon.
4:16
Sometimes it takes 6 to 18 months, to close Enterprise deals, so, Look at Neil Patel what did he do?
He is SEO services but he makes his money doing your fortune 500 garyvee.
What does he do?
A normal agency business but he sells to Fortune, 500 going up Market is harder but it pays off in the long run, bottom line.
4:35
If you increase the quality of your customer, you increase the quality of your company.
The second way to scale is that you can go down Market which is the exact opposite of what I just said, right?
You can do any of these things that over time you would do all of them but these are all directions.
So you can go A down market.
4:50
So, if I were selling the hair salons again, this would be selling the hairstylists.
All right.
If I were in Jim's, it would be selling two trainers.
If I were in Cairo, be selling to the employees who work in the clinics.
If I went after smbs, small business, owners, it would be going after aspiring business owners or watch foreigners or business opportunity Seekers, right?
5:08
That's what going down Market.
Is the advantages of going down Market, is you never run out of customers.
They're always making new ones, everyday people float in and out of the market because they're not established, there are more emotional buyers.
There's a notion of them.
The downside is it's hard to build a recurring Revenue business from them.
5:25
They are not consistent.
They don't follow through, you have constant payment issues.
They change their minds, right?
And have in general unrealistic expectations because they're poor and they believe, because $50 matters to them that it should also entitle them to you, flying out to walk them through whatever it is in person.
5:41
Every step of the way, it is what it is.
You can try to educate them for, for the most part, it is the Avatar.
All right, so the key to making it work in this market is having Very strong marketing and sales.
It's less about the product in this sub segment, because even if you have an amazing product 30% of the river go out of business every year because it's who they are.
5:59
So A friend of mine has a CRM that targets super small Washburn are small business owners and they have four percent monthly turn which is insanely high for a CRM and like he processes.
All the payments everything.
And I was like, where's your term come from me?
So, 100% of my turn comes when people going out of business or starting new things, I was like, oh wow, that's that's structural truth.
6:16
Like, there's something he can't do anything about it.
So the bottom line is, You're better at marketing and sales then you aren't product and delivery going down Market might be a better fit for you in the beginning, until you get better at delivery because you always have new customers to iterate and improve on.
And then you can make another move over time.
It's not going to be necessarily most viable business, but it will give you a lot of iterations because there's just so many of them, right?
6:36
Which brings me to the third move that you can make to scale your business, which is that you can go to an adjacent market.
So these are markets that often sell the same promise but deliver in a different way.
So for example, if I work with hair salons to reuse the same example again they sell beautiful.
T, right?
So I'd go to nail salons is an adjacent market like who else sells Beauty?
6:54
That's a service-based businesses per quarter.
Okay cool nail salon that would be adjacent right?
They saw the same Avatar that often wants the same thing and likely suffer from the same problems.
So if I work with chiropractors as additional example, I look at physical therapists as they likely have similar audiences with similar needs.
7:10
If I sold the gyms, I could sell the dance studios, etcetera.
These are all adjacent markets.
They're right next door.
All right, triangle next door.
All right.
The advantages of The adjacent is that you can usually provide the same amount of value as your first Market.
It's a slower expansion play because you go vertical by vertical by vertical, but it allows you to extract maximum value.
7:30
So oftentimes you don't need to iterate your main thing or your core product too much.
Usually it's just some lipstick, and kind of a different rapper since they suffer from more or less the same problem, right?
So the same Solutions work for them most of the time.
So you just need to Market it a little bit differently using their language.
So if you decide to do this, you need to get an ally in your company.
7:49
You need to find someone from that new world that adjacent market and bring them in.
They'll have enough trench and Industry knowledge to help you bridge the gap but it's often just comes from an enterprising motherfucker right from that space.
That sees your success in your Niche and says, hey do you think it would work for me and gives it a shot?
Makes the minor tweaks and then they figure out how to make your thing work in their market, right?
8:08
And then all you have to do is find a way to pay that person and then they'll help you unlock this entire new category of Revenue.
And this can help double or triple your Market size just with one move.
Now, there's the advantages.
The disadvantages are that this is a slower way to grow than the other ways.
8:24
And so you'll need more specialized knowledge to do it.
Well, that's why that person Sookie.
So all the stuff, you know, about your industry, you have to know that same depth about theirs or find someone who does.
And so here's the bottom line for moving adjacent or scaling in an adjacent Market.
Is that it's a great way to extract maximum value.
8:39
It's a slow way to grow.
It's not necessarily bad.
When you think about it long term because you can keep copying and pasting the play vertical by vertical by vertical.
All right?
And that allows you to get the most amount of money per and of effort but it takes a little longer but it can also build an incredibly valuable company which brings me to the fourth way that you can scale, which is going broader.
8:56
So we've got our triangle, you go up, you can go down, you can go side or you can go broader.
All right?
So this means that you generalize.
Your core product report promise across all verticals that solve the same problem.
So for example, going broader would be going from hair salons to Beauty in general.
9:12
Right.
That would include hair nails.
Aesthetics Med Spa, massage Etc, right all-encompassing.
So you put all the values?
Verticals together and then you generalize your language more and you go after them all, like that's the big pivot that would happen there.
So core promise you expand the language and then it applies to all of them that's going broader.
9:33
Look, guys.
You guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
9:58
And more importantly, it may change the world or someone else.
As a different example, if I were in Jim's, I would go to fitness centers.
In general, this might mean big box gyms my kuragin Boutique Studios dance studio.
Spencer years, martial arts, right?
All the different verticals in one.
10:14
All right, now the advantages are that you can scale up faster.
This way, you can 10x your total addressable Market overnight.
The downside is, it's harder provide the same amount of value.
So like if we're comparing this to going vertical by vertical, you have to generalize more it's going to be more templated, right?
So you're not gonna be able to have the same depth of nuance as you could, if you go over it, Vertical, if you just go broader but you immediately have access to ten times the amount of customers for something that's 100 times the amount of customers.
10:39
And so it becomes more like fill in the blank then copy and paste.
Right?
And so the other downside is that you also now compete against every other person in all of those Industries.
So you widen your pool, but you also compete against a lot more fishermen and many of them are more experienced in more entrenched than you, because you're competing against all the vertical players who are just doing that Silo as you try and hit all of them, right?
10:59
So you have more customers but all your competition or better in their micro niches.
But once you've achieved a certain amount of scale and expertise, you may have earned the right to go broader which does happen.
It's nothing.
You don't know the right.
I will say though.
Often times people go to Broad too soon because they're not good enough yet and haven't really are the right.
11:16
So, how do you know, when the right time is when you have made it work in the other verticals and you have champions in multiple other verticals that have used your, your services or your products across them.
And you have kind of case studies that demonstrate what changes you need to make.
11:31
And you know that you can Why is it while still providing some pretty significant value to each of them?
Then it becomes more showing multiple case studies of how it works in each of them.
So you still try and hit all of it at the same point, but the overarching message has beauty industry Fitness industry investment in church, whatever, clinicians, pain, Etc.
11:50
But bottom line, if you want to go fast, go broad.
But if you want to be good, you be better serve.
Staying narrow for a little in scaling out.
Like, for example, Facebook started in college before the expanding out.
So it's not like you have to go abroad immediately, like you start narrow.
And You continue to generalize over time.
Now say there was five rights we covered for we said you can go up Market, you can go down Market, you can go, Jason, go, broader.
12:10
The other thing is, you can go narrower now.
I said that you can scale anything that way and the way that you scale by going, there was a little bit different.
Now, part of that is the niching down component, sure.
But I'm gonna explain a very different way of going narrow.
That ultimately makes you more money.
So, I like to think about this as becoming more specific.
12:26
All right, so I actually wrote an entire chapter on this that got cut last minute for my hundred dollar offers book.
The chapter 3, on my site, by the way, you cannot Anywhere you can get it, it's called your first Avatar and sometimes you can go grab that whatever.
So the basic idea is that you go from a small business owner to let's say small businesses with thirty thousand dollars a month in revenue and at least two employees or hair salons with at least ex-clients, why staff and Z Revenue, right?
12:49
So, you get narrower and the idea is, how do I increase the quality of my prospects without necessarily going up Market?
You're not changing the nature of your avatar.
You're just changing your adding qualifications to them.
So I learned about this from the former head of aging and pricing at Vista, private Equity.
The quick story on this is that I was at this event guy got up on stage.
13:08
I thought I was hot shit and they're like this guy manages, you know, run pricing and patching a Vista, which is a 50 billion dollar fund.
I was like, oh, this guy is much bigger dick in me.
So I was like, okay, I should listen to him.
And then he went on to proceed to explain that the way that Vista would attack companies and get outsized returns is that they would do a huge customer analysis of every customer of a company that they want to acquire.
13:29
And then they would do a fractal basically analysis.
Basically there's a T20, they look at the 20% of customers that brought them the most money and look at the 80% that didn't and they would say, how do we get more of these 20 and ignore these other ones.
And so we look for the common character traits, the channels etcetera around that 20 and say, well what if we just made all of our customers that 20% when they did that they were going to 5x.
13:50
Accompany without even having to incur significant infrastructure costs Because the actual flow number customers didn't change dramatically, all right, and by doing that became significantly more profitable and ultimately create a lot of value.
So I learned that concept from him and that's weird.
Of this concept around going narrower comes from.
So here's the process for doing this in your own business.
14:07
Number one, is you survey all your customers to find out what their stats are, and what they like, most about your services.
I go in depth on this step, by step in that that chapter, which you can grab.
Like I said, it's free.
You grabbing a line acquisition.
I come to is you look at your best customers and the ones who spent the most in stayed.
Longest number three, you a common factor analysis, which is just a fancy way of saying.
14:28
You see what they all have in common ideally you want it to be as few things as possible think like 225 trade.
No more than five, because each time you add a layer, you narrow, your target even more.
And so what, you're essentially trying to figure out is, who are my most qualified buyers, who are the people who get the most value for my stuff.
Alright, that's step three.
14:44
Step four, Once you find that out, you do two.
Thirds number one, is you change all your marketing language to attract that specific Avatar, who has traits X y&z right?
And number two is you figure out what process, they all went through to buy often, they consume certain pieces of content or they came in through a specific Channel, might be SEO, or maybe a group or This quarter or YouTube ads or whatever it is, right.
15:05
You'll figure out that these people consume this thing.
They go through this process, you can for this Channel.
And then what happens is you reverse engineer the buying process to force every customer to go through that process and basically, you make your best and most qualified customers.
And so you kind of force the on the fence prospects to become the higher quality prospects by reverse engineering, what the best guys went through by accident, except now you do it on purpose.
15:31
And so the advantages of Narrower are that you can increase your prices and your profit significant.
Because remember we're now finding the people who we provide the most value to write because you do in a real way provide more value to this sub segments.
And so you also stop wasting time with shitty customers.
And so you also fewer people to compete against in this very narrow space and it also Cost You Less to service fewer people, right?
15:51
So they're all of these things are good things for business that especially on a smaller side that wants to just become more profitable.
So if that's you, this would, this would be a play which is often one that we start with.
Some of our portfolio is just like we can Your Forex to profit the business just by going narrow and getting very clear on the avatars, right by running this this process, which there you go.
16:09
That's it.
You can do it.
Now here are the disadvantages.
You have fewer, people are cell to which is significant but if you're not making ten million dollars a year or more then you shouldn't be worried about that.
Like you're not there then don't worry about that.
You just want to figure out who you provide the most value to it and focus ruthlessly on serving that Avatar.
16:25
And that means saying, no to people who aren't the new better, narrow Avatar means saying, no, that's a strategies.
You have to know who you're not.
This Earth.
So, bottom line, if you're starting out, there's a reason they say to go narrow, you can be laser targeted in your marketing and delivery and started build a reputation for yourself, which takes time, right?
16:42
But if you do it right, the other four plays going broader going on Market, going down, Market, going adjacent Market.
All of those plays open themselves up to you.
Think about this Ilan, started Tesla, super expensive, write something electric cars, the rich, and then once your reputation, you went down Market one step, right?
17:01
And then you just prayed normal.
Of cars, right?
And then he went down to step.
Again, he reached the masses zoc for example, when college kids, then he went broader sales for started with smbs and then they went up, you learn, as you go.
So no matter where you are, you can scale up your Tam, in any of the five ways that I just outlined in the number of people, you sell to buy going up Market by going down Market by going to jacent Market by going broader, or we're going narrower or my personal favorite door.
17:25
Number six, which is just keep getting better at what you do and you'll ultimately make more money.
It was an Asian.
Keep crushing.
Love you guys.
Rock on.

You want to automate 8, the investing and Unum annualize the spending.
0:33
So in other words, you want to lubricate how easy it is for you to invest in yourself, and you want to make it harder to spend on shit, that never comes back to you.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
0:49
I always wished pesos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
There are 14, massive money mistakes that people make in their 20s that you do not want to repeat.
And this is one of those like don't buy an iPhone by an Android like bullshit.
1:05
Like these are the actual things that if you make these mistakes early, you will have to pay for them for years.
The good thing is that you can avoid them very easily.
So I'm going to walk through all of them and why they're important under spending on education and overspending on status.
And the thing that's crazy about this is that when you're in your 20s, you probably aren't Ballin.
1:22
And the amount of people on Instagram.
I see what their their check mark that they bought in front of a lamb.
That they would ever like we all get it.
They're full of shit.
We understand the thing is though, is that like, the people who matter are not impressed, like if I were a 200,000 dollar watch, all the buddies that I have, don't give a shit.
1:39
Like they also have two hundred thousand dollars depends on whatever they want to.
Like, it just, it doesn't matter.
The only people that you impress are people who don't matter and that's the thing.
And so the only people who can help you, you're actually actively pushing them away.
Because the thing is that the guys were ahead of you, would they want to See you do in order to earn their respect, is they want to see you eating shit, living, poor learning and hustling.
2:02
That's what they want to see.
You do like you drive around in your new roles or bends or whatever you don't.
I mean whatever it is and you're maxing out all of your expenditures so you can Flex to other 20 year, olds is stupid and it's a waste of money, which is why it's a mistake.
Now, you should take that same money, which is why I said under spending on education and plow all of that into your own ability to earn more money and that's what somebody who's ahead of you is going to look back and give you that status.
2:26
Respect or like you can get status in your twenties from people who are ahead of you, if you're doing the right stuff, right?
If you're laying the foundation, the right way, they will respect that you're on the right path.
If you show that you're on the wrong path, they automatically think they're like, he doesn't get it or she doesn't get it.
It's not the game right there, playing the wrong game and they know that they'll never associate with you because until you understand the lesson, Next is taking jobs to earn rather than to learn and this is one of the biggest ones, right?
2:52
So recent, I'll just show you a quick story.
We had a guy who applied, right?
We had a thousand people who applied for a YouTube editor.
So for editing videos, like this thousand people applied and we had, I don't know.
I think we had 20 or 30 finalists, after they submitted their videos that were pretty good.
3:08
So we offered somebody very good pay for a YouTube editor role.
And the guy said, I want an extra three thousand dollars a year.
Missing the fucking plot and the thing is is that like what he didn't understand was that he was in a season of learning not a season of earning and so he might be able to go somewhere else and get 30% not even three thousand thirty percent higher.
3:33
But the thing is that when you're in that environment the people who are going to pay that premium or paying the premium for everything you know and have nothing to add to you.
If someone's going to pay you less it's because you know less than they do and you're going to grow during that period.
Period of time and that's priced in.
3:49
And so when you're going into the jobs and this is why if you're taking your jobs right now in order to earn, it's not the right season, you're trying to pull a lever trying to cash in early like figuratively.
You can eat ramen and split your room for you know 400 bucks a month so that you could learn for 10 years and then murder it right?
4:06
The earning potential of you getting extra ten thousand dollars a year or twenty-five thousand dollars a year in your 20s is so inconsequential on the long time, Horizon of the skills that you should be learning right now.
If you've got a trick or you've got a couple skills that you're good at, get better at the skills and go to places that will make you better like if you have the opportunity and I'm going to plug it.
4:25
But like if you have the opportunity to work with like Mozy media, right?
That puts out all the stuff that we put, that's growing everything in such a short period of time, then like that's a great opportunity, right?
Like many people would pay for it, not even get paid to do it.
So the fact that like, people get paid is like a bonus and if you don't see it that way, then you're seeing the game the wrong way.
4:45
That's what that's the point here.
Is that That in the season of your 20s, it's a season of learning not a season of earning yet it will be when you get all the skills but the moment you start pulling the lever on earning rather than earning you basically capped your your potential.
5:00
So make sense, the person who's going to pay you the extra 30% more.
That person is expecting that you download everything and we'll add nothing to you.
You're getting paid the premium because they're not adding anything back.
Three, is that you save money, that is a mistake.
Hear me out.
You want to save money in your 20s but not actually save it.
5:18
You want to not spend it or blow it on shit and you want to put it into a separate account.
But that money, you want to invest now not dollar cost averaging SP or whatever it is like you can do that.
By all means.
It's a great way to like have some money later but if you want to become Filthy Rich, which is hopefully, you know what Mo Z Nation is here to do and build wealth and help people out.
5:37
You want to invest that money into you and your earning capacity.
And so right now you make so little that the money It matter so like if you save $500 a month, see if thousand dollars a month like you can put that into the calculator and look what it's going to be in 70 years and like cool.
5:54
But the thing is, is that one, it doesn't factor in inflation.
So when people see that they're going to be worth four million dollars for million dollars, in 60 years, is also worth like a million dollars a day, so it's not worth the same amount of money and people forget to factor that in when they do the compounding, all right, number one but number two is that like think about how much more you'll get back, if you spend ten thousand dollars this year and then you double your earning capacity or you triple your earning capacity.
6:15
City like then replay that equation where you can put even more money.
But then when you have fifty thousand dollars to spend on your own you're increasing your earning capacity reinvest that right so that you get to half a million dollars, you're a million dollars or whatever it is and you're gonna quit like you continue to reinvest in the equation shift.
So dramatically people are playing the game too small.
6:32
And so in my opinion, the moment you start like actually investing like buying assets, things like that is the moment that you're saying, I don't need to learn any more because this is going to be my cap for my skill set.
So in my mind, I always want to have that instead of saving money.
To invest in assets, invested in one asset, which is you and increasing your earning potential.
6:50
Decide how much you're going to invest first before you spend money.
So, here we have.
If you make x amount of money, every month, you commit the first money, right?
Because prioritization comes from taking that silly pride comes first, right?
It's a, you take the money off the top, you skim it off the top and you say this money has been prioritized for my learning, my education, my whatever, you take it off the top first, and then, whatever you have left that you can.
7:15
End, right?
Because now, we've already allocated for our future, and it's not because we're having our rainy day fund.
Sure have your, have your 10 grand C, of living, expenses, whatever.
But after that all that money, that account, you can let it stock pile up.
And then you see something that you want to learn.
You have an opportunity.
Of course, you were workshopping seminar, whatever it is and then deploy the capital, right?
7:34
And then you get the skill back.
Now you still have the habit of every month.
First money goes into my education first when he goes into my education.
But you prioritize it first not, what do I have left of the in a month?
Can I afford it?
At this big pile of gold over here, that every month, you plan to, and then, when you, when you see the opportunity to make the decision to pull the trigger.
7:52
Next one, you want to automate the investing and you want to manual eyes the spending.
So in other words, you want to lubricate how easy it is for you to invest in yourself, and you want to make it harder to spend on shit, that never comes back to you.
All right?
So this is why as a side note, Dave Ramsey, who talks about people having cash rather than credit cards because when people spend cash, it's harder to do you feel, you actually feel pain when you buy things in cash compared to using credit cards.
8:15
But anything that's automated and recurring like those are the things that you want to.
You want to make it harder for people to take money from you.
You will make it easier for you to spend money on yourself in terms of investing.
And so that's why I like that that skimming part you want to automate that.
So that ideally, you don't even see the money.
8:30
Like, the only one, even hit your account is the money that you're allowed us back the other money.
You've already allocated out to the other things, if I give you a rent account, maybe, and then you've got your personal investing account.
Not SMP SME, right?
And then you've got your sure, you got your food and your car money, whatever.
Right.
Automate, the thing that you want to have happened manual eyes and add friction, the things that you don't have happened.
8:52
Next.
Don't go shopping, stick with your lists.
So most times, especially in your grind time, you do the same stuff every day.
You eat the same breakfast at the same lunch.
If you know, you're going to be doing that a regular basis and let's be real, you don't need another set of sneakers.
You don't need a fancier code or whatever, right?
9:08
You don't need the watch.
The idea that someone says, I'm going to go shopping, like they have no agenda.
It just means, like, I'm going to waste money today.
You're like?
Okay, and so, stick with the list that you already have pre-approved in terms of your Budget of the money that I have left over.
9:25
This is my list.
These are my groceries, this is whatever.
And if it's not on the list, you don't buy it.
It's a very simple habit but that will pay dividends for the rest of your life.
Next, get takeout, don't cook your food very contrarian.
I know here's the thing, as soon as you make more than $15 an hour, it makes more sense for you to work that day and get the takeout food, and get the time back, it makes more sense financially.
9:52
And so most people can like if you're not being a weirdo like you can eat out for 10 bucks issue meal and you try out twice.
Is 20 bucks a day $600 a month.
Okay.
Now the idea is how long will it take you to make that money back?
If you can make that money back in?
Like again this is the Delta.
10:08
So maybe you want to the grocery store be what a hundred bucks a week right?
Versus $150.
A week when you're eating out is like is that is the net $50?
We can you not make that up for the meal, prep going to the grocery store?
Cutting cooking, cleaning, Etc.
Can you make all that up?
And so this is one of those things where people are like they say pennies but they don't think big picture in my opinion.
10:27
It's like if you save an extra Under dollars a month, The Habit is worthwhile, but the idea is you're focusing on the wrong part, right?
You're saving the pennies rather than investing in the Mega Millions which is you and the time that you have to allocate to learn people live with the wrong people.
All right?
So the people that are around you one, they have terrible roommates, you break things you go out drinking who would our rate who are late on rent?
10:49
Like these are all things.
They'll distract you from the thing you're trying to do.
That's like level one.
Worst type of remain above that, you've got people who are responsible etcetera, but they have to, they don't have the same goals as you.
Right?
And so they will speak over you.
They're limiting beliefs and they will often times not actually root for you and they will kind of undercut you when you're on this path which is probably different than them.
11:09
And the thing is in the beginning, what become success looks like the earlier because you're learning you're not earning their already pulling their earning trigger their bragging on the fact that make 70 grand a year.
Whatever who gives a shit, right?
Because you have a different goal and so never listen to people who have smaller goals for your life than you do.
11:26
All right.
So making sure that you're living with a type.
Of people who are trying to do the same thing as you are in your life will encourage one another and you guys are going to like in the game together in the same mindset, listen to the same stuff and that that's what will shape the way you see the world.
And the in your 20s is a lot of how the final beliefs about the world change, which is why I make some this content for people in that time zone because you haven't solidified Your World Views.
11:47
Yet after this period is about 25 to 27.
It's significantly harder to change your World Views.
It only comes from trauma, people change the road.
They get divorced and they change everything or they like come back from Stanley change their world, like, trauma, get you back into hyper learning again, your body's like, whoa, I have to learn this.
12:04
I have to change my views of reality because something bad happened, right?
But most times, there's no other reason that people learn after that.
And so that's why I make this content this way.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
12:20
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
12:40
As a side note, I do think it's worth living with multiple people in your 20s because one, your choice can be lonely, but to it's also just a lot cheaper.
I live in a house with seven people in California and I was able to only pay 400 bucks a month in like a nice area which leads to the next one, which is your micro Community matters a lot.
12:55
And so I think that it makes a lot of sense to be.
I would overpay for convenience in terms of being close to stuff like close to the highway so I can get on and off.
And right, two places I need to close to a gym and close to cheap places to eat if I can do those things.
And ideally, if I can Walk to them, I save time and gas like I get outside, whatever, I can get some exercise in.
13:14
But the more important thing is the time, like, if you live in the middle of nowhere and it takes you 25 minutes to get the gym in 25 minutes to go back like and 22 minutes to find some.
Like, there's all this time that's gets eaten up, which is why I like remote work is more efficient.
You don't have all the transit etcetera etcetera and so the micro Community, I would say I'm willing to pay a premium to save all of the ancillary costs.
13:34
It would go with living somewhere, less, convenient, less safe.
I would live with more people in a better area than fewer people in a shit.
Next is you model the wrong season of life.
So people, sometimes younger guys will look at what I'm doing.
The like, I'm going to do it house is doing things like, you don't have a track record, right?
And reputation is built on two things.
It's built on scoreboard, and it's built on shots called.
13:53
Which means it's built on what you've done and what you say you're going to do and having both of them come true, right?
And so the thing that builds the reputation is not modeling what I'm doing now, but modeling what I did before, right?
And so you want to make sure that you model the right aspect of someone's life at the right time flying private.
14:10
It make you rich.
I mean, you spend a lot of money, right?
Sequence matters, when spending money measure money in how long it took you to earn it.
And this is again, we're trying to add friction to when we're spending, right?
And so, let's say, you make 20 bucks an hour if you want to go buy a shirt for 100 bucks, right?
14:31
Then you have to think to yourself, okay?
I make $20 an hour, there's 20 percent payroll tax plus, you know, whatever.
So I'm actually going to have to work six hours By that hundred dollar shirt with tax whatever, right, six hours.
So if someone said I want you to work all day and I'll give you this shirt, would I do it?
14:48
Probably not.
And that's the thing is that a lot of times, we're not aware of the value of our own money in terms of what we put in to make it.
And so, I remember when I was a kid, I went to, I worked at Smoothie King weight, as of 15 is 15 years old and all my co-workers would go next door and by lunch in the middle of the shift, right?
15:06
Six hour shift and I was making $7.25. 25 cents an hour and a six-hour shift, right?
So I was making 40, whatever 43 bucks, right?
43-44 far, $44 then I taxes.
On top of that though is probably closer like, I don't know thirty-three dollars or something like that after taxes or 36 and so people would go next door.
15:25
Remember noticing this?
And they would spend 15 bucks on lunch right while they were working their shift, they would go to Subway, or whatever.
And I thought to myself, I was like every time they work, they do this, because I would see the same guy do it.
I was like, so you have $36 After taxes, for living here for go, coming to work today.
15:43
I was like, and 15 of that.
Is you going to lunch next door?
I was like, so you're working six hours for 20 bucks but people don't do that math.
And I saw all my co-workers do it, I was like, this is insane.
And so again measure what it cost to buy something in the hours, it took you to get it.
16:01
So make the translation and then re-evaluate the decision, you'll buy a lot less stupid shit.
Get competitive with money around.
What you're saving, not what you're making.
All right, so I told you this is a season of learning not season earning, but to know what you're going to learn, right?
You have to budget towards your investment.
16:17
So, rather than thinking, I'm making five thousand dollars a month in spending five thousand dollars a month.
Meaning I'm profiting personally zero, right?
Say, I'm saving 25 hundred dollars this month to invest in me.
And so make your PR, your personal records around what you're able to put into that bank account every month, watch how big it grows and your contribution every month, make that the metric that you're optimizing around even more so than the income.
16:39
Because the thing is, is I'll tell you this.
I'm old enough now that I've had people who I know, have been making hundreds thousands, even millions of dollars a year and have nothing.
Like when I get in these backdoor conversations on my, all right man, like what's going on?
I'm like, what do you got?
We got saved up so I can understand like the situation like oh I mean got like 500 Grand.
16:58
I'm like, oh, mind you for some people that might be a lot of money.
That's not, I'm not saying it's not, I'm saying given their relative income for the amount of time.
They had, they blew everything.
And so it's the same as a teacher who say 500 Grand during that same period of time like this They wasted everything and so make your personal records.
17:15
The thing that you compete against the thing that you optimize for, not the income, but the amount that you invest, make that nut.
The thing that you focus on an optimized, every month, next one, check your account, every single morning, all right, I think this is a habit, like, I stopped checking my account, when I cross 20 million, that was when I was like, okay, because the daily fluctuations NASA's became, it didn't make sense anymore, but I checked it every and the thing is is until I started doing it.
17:39
I stayed poor.
I didn't wanna look at my bank account.
Is it would hurt my feelings?
Seriously, I just I would look at it and I just feel poor, but that's okay.
You have to confront reality in order to change, right?
And so, I would, once I started looking at it every day, I actually started to get an idea when it talks about lubricating lubricating the investing and adding friction to the expenses.
17:56
I was like, man, there's so much so much automation on my expenses like men money's pouring out of this thing left and right.
And so once I got a pulse on it, I knew Tuesdays when I paid this Thursday is when I pay for this, the first the first week, the month of May like I started get a pulse.
Money flow.
And it's a, it's a habit that once you learn it, it's hard to forget.
18:14
And so first thing in the morning, check your account.
Alright?
If you do that, you'll get into this habit and you start getting idea.
I promise you just like losing weight, you get someone to measure the weight.
Every day, gets going to measure the bank account every day, it'll improve.
Finally, what is it?
Okay to spend money right now?
I said education, obviously, that's where I'm going to.
18:31
I'm going to prioritize it, but life isn't just that, all right?
And so if there's one thing that I probably could have done better is, I could have spent money on one time experiences and what I mean by that is not going to the club and poppin bottles, all right?
But there are times when you know, go to Europe and doing a you know sleeping in hostels for three months.
18:48
Like that's a cool experience that you're not going to be able to do when you're 40 even when you got the money and the time you're not going to do it, right?
So there are times As of Our Lives that are optimal for certain types of experiences and those windows closed.
And so if there are experiences that you can only do in your 20s, I wholeheartedly support them but you want them to be things that when you're 80, you're proud of you're not proud of like popping bottles in your twenties like you know I mean like it's not you know like yeah that's right.
19:12
And so I think that giving yourself permission to spend on an experience in a limited fashion.
You want to drain your entire investment right to do this but like to spend on it, something you want to go, see the Grand Canyon for three days.
And I mean, go Grand Canyon.
And what's interesting is that a lot of these experience are actually free, right?
19:29
And so, but spending time and money, but especially time in your twenties to do some of these one-time experience is that when you're 80, hey, you won't have the health to do.
Even if you've got the money in the time and in your 40s, you probably also won't have the time even about the money.
Like, these are times where I would say, this is probably counter.
The way you expected in this video.
19:46
I do think it's worth doing.
It's probably when they regret that I have is that I didn't spend any on that.
And I think about a couple of like I'll never I will die knowing that I never did the hostel experience and in Europe, it's just not my I probably just won't do it.
You don't mean like, my wife doesn't want to do it for sure, right?
And so if you have some of that Independence, if there's some things that like our little unique to you, I think these are the times that you can do that and it's worth spending the time of the money to do it.
20:08
Even if it's not financially, make sense because at the end of the day like you're going to die is not going to matter.
Anyways so anyways, those are the money mistakes people make in the 20s.
Rosie Nation, keep being awesome and if you are business doing between three and a hundred dollars a year, we'd love to talk to you.
Otherwise, enjoy the stuff.
19:56
I probably just won't do it.
You don't mean like, my wife doesn't want to do it for sure, right?
And so if you have some of that Independence, if there's some things that like our little unique to you, I think these are the times that you can do that and it's worth spending the time of the money to do it.
Even if it's not financially, make sense because at the end of the day like you're going to die is not going to matter.
20:12
Anyways so anyways, those are the money mistakes people make in the 20s.
Rosie Nation, keep being awesome and if you are business doing between three and a hundred dollars a year, we'd love to talk to you.
Otherwise, enjoy the stuff.

Big misnomer.
I think that people think they need to have a new thing.
You started cleaning business become a bit later, you can start a lawn care, business become a billionaire, you can start a roofing business, become a billionaire, like there's clear problems, like all you have to do is just do what everyone else is doing, learn how to sell, learn how to deliver, consistently and learn how to late.
If you do those three things you can do just as well as everyone else in.
0:16
Just do it better.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
0:33
I feel like a lot of society keeps people kind of Trapped in its Baroque mindset, it's hard to kind of, get ahead, right?
Because of people investing in things when they don't have money.
So they're in debt and they kind of stay in debt.
What is necessary for people to break the broken line set that Society is kind of Trapped people in that keeps them poor.
0:53
So I think like people have two sets of resources, right?
That they allocate that they've got time, they've got money.
Yeah.
And so if you look at someone's bank statement and you look Calendar.
You know what?
Their life is and you can also predict whether life is going to be in x amount of years, right?
1:10
And so if someone wants to change what their life is going to look like, you have to reallocate where you're investing the resources that you have.
And so from a Time perspective, people who are poor, in my opinion, spent a lot of time not doing stuff and that sounds terrible to say, but, like at the base level, they're distracted.
1:26
They're not doing the right things, right?
What was I would even say not doing anything?
Just distracting them.
Write plays videogame flicks.
It's that are, you know, all that stuff, right?
So they've got there's like the bases like they don't do anything, they're purely distracting themselves from their current state, which is hard because it's hard to confront reality.
1:42
If you're like not happy, it's easier to just distract yourself.
Right now, the level above that is, you've got people who are operating, they are working every day, but they're operating in low leverage opportunities, right?
So, they're, they're doing things that do not give them a lot of return on their time writing, so it's like, I could work.
1:59
It doesn't matter how many hours I work at McDonald's.
I like it's very, very difficult to can wealth either, right?
I just almost near impossible right versus like you could buy a building for ten million dollars and then sell it to somebody else for 11 for 11 million dollars.
Just get the contract and make a million dollars on the exchange super high leverage, right?
2:18
From a Time perspective, which are crazy for somebody who does have money to even contemplate, some like that.
But the only way that that happened and that required, no money skill, right?
And so, like, that's an example of, like, it didn't require money to make that money, that's skill.
That's required to do that.
And so, First is the time right?
2:34
People are not doing stuff with the time that they have or they're doing low leverage activities with the time they have.
And then they're not trying to increase their output per unit time which means investing in their skill set.
So like one of the easiest ways to gain leverage on your time and when I say leverage, just for everybody like Leverage is the difference between inputs and outputs in a system.
2:52
So in Archimedes said, if you give me a lever long enough I can move the world and so the same degree.
If you have enough skills, you can do anything, right?
And so skills, give you leverage on your time.
So you get It more out of each unit of time.
So if I'm going to master cold caller, I will get more sales and calls book for the same unit of time.
3:08
That's why you sucks at it same time more, right?
Because they developed a skill at a masterful level hundred percent.
Yeah.
And so when people are allocating their time, they're not by percentage, they're kind of like consuming their time rather than investing their time.
So they're either doing nothing or they're consuming the time rather than putting time into getting higher Returns on their time which is education.
3:29
Right?
And so education you can have from like the conceptual earnings watch Stuff like this or and or the actual doing.
Right.
And so you know you learn more action for sailing messing up, you know, feeling like a, an embarrassment and yeah actions.
Yeah, the first thousand cold calls you make the first thousand cold emails, you do the first thousand doors, you knock on the first thousand, you know what, like, you'll learn more from that than you learn from every single book you read over that point, also concept like you'll learn, right?
3:56
And so people don't allocate nearly enough time to that in the beginning.
And so I think one of the things that the formal education system did Really well that people poo poo on it is the idea of going into debt to gain education is something that fundamentally makes sense.
Yes, but it's gotta be the right education.
4:12
You got can make you money.
You got to get a return on it.
Yeah, that's that's the issue yet to get a return on it because like the idea of borrowing from a future self that can make more money to pay for the thing that you're getting the skill for makes total sense.
I think you on was saying something about how neural Link in the future.
4:27
It's going to be such a competitive advantage that they could price it at whatever they want.
Because once you have it you will be so More evil than anyone who doesn't have it, that you could so easily pay off the price of the thing.
That's how it should work, conceptually, right?
Crazy education.
Supposed to work.
Yes.
This is the simplest example that I have.
So friend of mine, has a 17 year old daughter.
4:45
She got a job at a bowling alley and she makes minimum wage.
And he said, why don't you become a phlebotomist?
She was like, well, I don't want to spend the money.
He's like it's 500 bucks and it's a two-day certification.
And then after you have that, you make $25 an hour.
So she didn't have the money now, she could save it to get the $500.
5:02
Right, or she could take a loan for the 500 bucks for a dad.
And if you came back in a week, right?
Right.
Because she has higher earning capacity and so it was like she could either save for eight weeks, right?
From her or bowling alley to pay the 500, or she could take a loan for the 500.
5:20
Do the two days and then pay it off in a week.
So add that one week.
She now has seven more weeks of earning capacity.
This is a micro exam.
Yeah, right.
Seven weeks of earning capacity at her new level and she'd be net positive on the next seven weeks of earnings, right?
And so there's just a For example, of like what skill investing dies, a lot of us to talk about, like you gotta get educated, you gotta learn stuff and like, you learn stuff by doing it.
5:39
And a lot of times you pay for that education or access to people who can teach you those skills, because a lot people are going to give it to you for free.
That makes sense.
It's about it.
Like it took them time to learn the thing and they compress that time to give it to you.
So I mean that's why I'm a like educate.
If there's one thing that's my life's Mission situation.
5:54
And so I was telling my coaching students last night, on a call that I have with them, that I have multiple coaches, that someone was asking about mentors.
Like how do you find mentors?
How often you stay in touch with them?
And I was like, listen, when I was broke, whatever was 15 years ago, just getting started in this space.
6:11
I was lucky enough that I had a local mentors in Columbus, Ohio, that kind of had pity on me.
But they saw that I had this hunger.
This desire.
I was like, I'll do whatever you tell me to do.
Yeah.
And then I came back two weeks later.
I was like, I did it.
Here's the result is why I failed and that's a fuel for mentors to be.
6:29
Like, total.
I gave you wisdom, you took action.
You got Salts.
I'll give you some more feedback, but if you just keep asking and you don't act, we talked about this with a mutual friend.
We have.
It's frustrating for a mentor.
They don't want to give you that time.
No.
And I told him I go, this is why I pay mentors, you know, there's a, there's a big guy in media that has a massive business that I messaged him.
6:53
I'm an acquaintance with him.
I said, hey, I would love to pay you for some coaching.
He said, I'll just do it for you for free for 30 minutes now, I want to pay him if you Cuz I want to be able to do it more frequently.
Yeah.
Right.
He said I'll give it to you for 30 minutes because he likes me were friendly.
7:09
But I know I can't call upon him for 30 minutes every week.
So now I'll go back in six months and say, I took action on everything you said in that 30 minutes, here's our results, could do another call.
Yeah.
And that's kind of, like, what you can expect with a mentor is that type of opportunity unless you have a serious Bond and they just want to give of their time, but investing in it like you said, is so much more powerful and getting that speed of information.
7:32
My opinion, totally the single highest return on investment thing I've ever done and not to sound trite here, but I just like using scenarios.
Like, if I taken all the money that I spent on coaching, mentorships courses workshops seminars, and put that in the S&P 500 ten years ago, the amount that I would have right now is inconsequential compared to what I currently have and just because I invest in something different.
7:53
So, rather than investing in the S&P 500, I invest in the SMP 500.
So I took all of the excess cash that I had every single month.
And rather than saying, like, oh, I'm going to dollar cost average, you know, long-term, I wait for years.
Whatever I was like I just don't make enough money so like I could be the Millionaire Next Door.
Who saves every penny doesn't go to Starbucks for my entire life and have two million dollars when I'm older eight you know whatever last 10 years of my life, right?
8:13
And literally enjoy nothing during that period of time.
That doesn't sound like there's it's not a trade I wanted to make.
And so I had a belief that I know I will work hard and if I'm given the right tools, I will be able to implement them.
And so I took all my extra money and this is kind of, you know, a lot of people might not necessarily agree with me on this, but it worked for me.
8:31
So I put All of every dollar I had even went into debt to get access to communities and mentors and coaching programs and masterminds.
Yes.
And those were the biggest Gifts of all.
It wasn't even just an angle in this.
Like the biggest gifts I got from, those wasn't even the education, but it was the perspectives on reality.
8:49
It was people disproving things that I thought to be true.
So there I was like, this is the way the world is and they're like, that's false.
Hmm.
And it my whole Paradigm shifted because I just, I had distortions of reality I Reality was different than it was.
And so right now for people who are poor, is because they actually don't see reality for what it is because the way they see reality, they see making money to be impossible or incredibly difficult or it's only for a certain select people not for them, right?
9:14
It's just because they literally cannot see it.
And so I'm trying to think of an example of one.
Like you can see something that you know, it easier examples like kids and parents, right?
Like a kid thinks the world is a certain way and the parents like you just haven't seen enough stuff yet and so you know as you level up in The Entrepreneur Space there's also just more levels That where the people are like, this is the perspective you need to have your like no way that's possible and so that's where those rooms gave me the highest Roi the other skills because there's so many people there that are trying to learn the same things, they already said, hey, get this program, read this book and so they help sift through the mountain of information that's out there because I only have one resource, which is time at that time, right?
9:52
And so it's like, okay, I'll spend it.
But where do I spend it?
And they're like, okay, if you want to learn real estate, these are the top three guys.
You can join this Facebook group get into this guy's Community.
He is a coaching program that helps You do wholesaling.
This guy's, of course, brother does airbnb's those guys, you know, like and so I was like, which one do I choose the answer for everyone who's curious is, do them all because you're just like, you're not like, you're like, which one should I do?
10:13
Like you, you're not going to be poorer by learning more, right, right.
And it's not like you have a finite capacity to learn the more, you learn the better, you get at learning right?
And then the more lines and synergize, you find between different skill, sets and opportunities, more dangerous.
You become 100%, just learn cold calling.
10:31
Yeah, but you didn't also.
Learn, you know, copy writing an email marketing or speaking on stage, you know, it's the combination of multiple skills that make your earning power so much brighter.
I guess I'm literally getting Goosebumps.
Yeah, I love it.
The compound it.
10:47
So I have this example, our breakdown Jay-Z, right?
And so, if you look at Jay-Z in the beginning, like he had, you know, he probably had a natural proclivity for rhyming and beat a rhythm whatever, right.
So that was his first like kind of scaly probably practice that Olympics using to it, right?
And then he started rapping, it says, just first levels.
11:02
Kill and then he learned, you know, writing lyrics in psycho.
Because that's another producing right exactly the Euler producing.
And then he learned marketing and then he learned forming on stages or something.
Yes.
And then he learned how to sign other people to his.
That's how to start a label and they start to look.
And so with each of these skills it wasn't one plus one.
11:18
It was like one plus one.
Plus one equals ten.
Right?
And so like you know, in a formal world like the world, that's not wrapped.
Like if someone's good at math, they can learn accounting or bookkeeping first, right?
It's like okay that's level one skill, then you learn accounting.
Okay.
Now you're making more and then you learn how Insurance works and you're like, oh, okay.
11:34
Now you can start to see this person evolved and then you learn how tax and tax efficiencies work and you're like, oh, and then you learn how to, how to package and sell businesses and negotiate, those deals with, you know, private Equity, things like that.
All of a sudden, that's a CFO, that's somebody who's making multiple million dollars a year, but it's the same basic few skills that stack on top of each other and get disproportion Returns on all the prior skills with each new additional skill.
11:57
And so the idea is not like people ask their own questions are like, which course should I buy which program should?
I do.
It's your mom.
Yes, yes, all.
Yeah, you won't like his each one of them, you will learn things and there's going to be either different ways that someone's teaching they'll have different communities live different beliefs, you'll learn from all of them.
12:13
And this is something I think you'll hear this sometimes when people say, well, I just invested in this program, I don't know if I have the time to invest in this next course or read this book or whatever it is and you got to think of like you know I'm doing five six interviews a week where I'm constantly learning you know every time you come on I learn something new.
12:30
It's not like there are things that confirm I already know, but I'm also learning new things.
It's not.
Like I've said, up to 10 years of doing this, I don't need to learn any more.
I don't have any more time to learn.
It's so important for me to develop as a human being.
12:45
And that's why I'm constantly learning and, you know, people need to sit down and do interviews with people all day long.
They can learn in different ways, but I don't think the investment ever ends and how much you can learn in a compound's Compass, the best part.
What would you say are the three main skills for someone to want to have the potential of being a Six or seven figure earner that they need to start learning now.
13:06
So 2023 that they have that potential.
My opinion, there's three main skills in business in general, got to learn how to sell, gotta learn how to build it, go under to learn how to lead.
So you gotta learn how to get people, to give you money for Stuff, got to have the stuff to sell them and then you got to have people that work on your side to help deliver on those other two.
13:24
If you can do those three things you're unstoppable and if you do one of those three things you can make as much black.
You can still make a ton of money, but if you can get, you can do all three.
You're unbeatable.
Cell build like building a team, building building.
So that would be on the lead side.
The building is like the product services that you have.
13:39
So you have to figure out a way to deliver value to somebody develop a program, a product, a service that you can package and sell and people like well how do I do that?
All you have to do.
There's this is the perspective singer saying earlier.
It's like I don't know where opportunity is and people who are under see opportunity everywhere.
It's like and my biggest regret in life is that I can't live multiple lives because there's so many things I want to do, but it's because all you have to do is look for problems.
14:01
You look for things that people hate.
Eight, you look for in deficiencies.
You just look for things that are nuisances like what are things that people do every day that they doing a big one.
A big misnomer I think is that people think they need to have a new thing.
You started cleaning business, become a billionaire, you can start a lawn care, business become a billionaire, you can start a roofing business, become a billionaire.
14:17
Like there's clear problems that all you have to do is just do what everyone else is doing, learn how to sell, learn how to deliver, consistently and learn how to late.
If you do those three things you can do just, as well as everyone else in.
Just do it better.
I was in the elevator this morning coming here, and I have this, this Center that used to watch my cats, right.
14:35
But he mostly Works in a different building that I used to live in.
Now I'm going to do good and he was in the new building because he had some other dogs.
He's a dog, he's a dog walker, right?
But I asked him to watch my cats one time and he a literally 30 seconds in the other day.
I saw him and go to see you.
14:52
And I go dude how much you make him now?
Because I see him hustling.
It seemed like walking around with all these dogs.
Something?
Like in his prices went up over the last few years like when I first Had them.
Watch my cats was like 25 bucks now.
It's like 40 bucks for a session on, like I go do.
What are you making?
15:07
Like 5, 600 bucks a day.
He goes, I got 1,000.
I got 2,000.
He goes, I got three.
Yes, around 3K a day.
I got what walking dogs?
Yeah, I go.
He goes now, it's seven days a week.
It's a Grind.
Yeah, I've got three employees now who are like just walking walking dogs, but he's like the go-to guy in Beverly Hills and he's like, independent he's not with, you know, Big Dog Walking Company.
15:32
Something.
But three grand a day walking dogs.
I go you can.
There's a need especially in this community where people are busy, they love their dogs and they have money to spend on their daughter and he is providing a service.
Listen problem, three grand a day man.
15:48
That's crazy.
I love this exam business.
I didn't know walking dogs.
You know, I love this example because it's perfect because everyone can understand it.
So what's the problem that they're solving?
It's like, people have time to work their dogs.
When, if you're looking at any any problems time is, one of the easiest ones to solve is that people don't take the time to do something, right?
It takes too long.
16:03
You want to do it faster?
Jason violence at the easiest best model in the world.
Find what someone else is doing doing.
Half the time it's just you can do it and you can look at any business that exists in.
Do that, right?
And so it's like, what did you have to do here to learn how to sell, which one, she had to get people to give him money for the dogs, which is part of this marketing.
But I'm strapping that I write promotion getting people to give you money, he had to learn how to deliver, which is like, okay, what are the best routes to walk on?
16:22
How do I manage 17, leashes?
At the same time?
Like you to figure all that stuff out, right?
And you don't want to lead.
So he has to employ two or three employees got a place before he was like exhausted.
But now he's figuring out how to build Than lead and what'll happen is, they'll stop walking dogs and then I'll have him Teddy managing it.
16:37
Yeah, exactly.
And so, it's like that's like such a that such a perfect microcosm of the three skills being put to use.
I was taking them years to do it, it didn't happen overnight either build his brand, he had to, you know, show that he could deliver the value of the product consistently and all these different things, he had to be communicating and, you know, be reliable all these things.
16:53
And he was like, I'm doing it seven days a week.
Yeah, so he has no life, right?
So it's like an extreme but it's possible.
And so the Three skills.
I heard you say is cell build and lead.
You can never get enough training on how to lead yourself and how to lead others because there's so much of a world inside of each.
17:13
One of us that has to learn how to overcome insecurities.
Fears traumas, triggers that will make us, poor leaders of ourselves and others so that people respect and trust us.
So leading skills is probably the hardest and it's also the one.
17:29
That's almost a meta scale in that.
It actually can layer on top of the other two.
So if you think about it like as a hypothetical example, imagine I know how to recruit and lead people and I don't know anything about marketing and I think about sales, I don't know anything about delivery but I have a vision for what I want to accomplish a problem that I want to solve this meaningful to me.
And I think will be meaningful to other people.
17:45
I can compel people, I can persuade them and influence them to want to work and help me solve this huge problem together, right?
And so you don't even like real talk, you don't even have to know how to sell and how to Market, you don't have to know how to build a product or a service in because if you can lead, you can get all those other people to do that.
18:02
At and and leaving is also selling in a sense.
If you're under 30 here, if you're a leader, your energy is in, enrolling energy, your way of being how you show up, how you communicate is selling you and your vision.
Yeah, you don't need to know how to sell a product and get on stage and say, buy my stuff.
18:22
But you need to be able to enroll people into a vision that they are in alignment.
With, I think that is one of the hardest skills because people don't have the ability for themselves.
Yeah, a lot of people don't believe Eve and themselves.
They don't love themselves enough to be enrolling in my opinion.
And so they discount and that doubt people can feel that energy in that doubt.
18:41
Yeah.
If to be certain that are confident, you know what I mean?
I think part.
And so it's easy to say what like what we just said about the whole leading thing and like, as much as everyone's like, well I'll just jump straight to Leading feel like there's some sort of like and this is me, I could be speaking as a limiting belief of my own over so you know, disclaimer, right?
18:59
But it is my belief that there's a certain amount of Like spiritual strength that you gain from having done stuff.
Fry all developing skills developing skills because people confidence with these skills.
Yeah, because you have evidence results.
Yeah.
And so people you can you can enroll someone.
You could subscribe someone to your vision and because the next the first question someone's going to always ask is, why should I listen to you or why should I follow you specifically, right?
19:21
And unless you have a solid answer that's not you being crazy, right?
Being like I have done these things.
They give me evidence that I can move the goalposts further than what we have done before because of what I've done behind.
I fix the path I've already walked and so I think like learning how to sell learning how to build a, the first two skills, and then leading you learned consistently along the way for the rest of your life.
19:42
What would you say the most important habits someone can develop for themselves on a daily basis to support their opportunities for earning more?
Most important lessons that I've learned in my life have come from doing and mentors.
And so on a day-to-day basis, it's reducing the time between Mean when you wake up and when you begin working right?
20:05
A lot of people lollygag and delay and procrastinating, things like that.
And if you just think about there's only certain amount of time in the day, I want to increase my output per unit of time as much as possible.
A lot of people have these superstitions that they have to do certain there.
They must do X Y and Z, but all you do is talk to a single mom who has like five kids and no still start businesses.
20:24
They're not doing any of that stuff.
They're waking up and they're working before the kids are off.
And then once their kids go to bed, they work.
Then to right, they're not doing all the while, I guess stuff that you do.
You see up trending all over?
For media it's like they're working and so like the single greatest skill at my opinion is being able to find a place that you can shut out external stimuli and you can focus.
20:42
Yes, is for me the single highest Roi have it at I have, is that for me between 5 a.m. and noon?
I have nothing on my calendar.
It is just work, no meetings and that all my meetings happen after noon, this is for the entrepreneur.
20:57
Now, if you're if you're like in a job right now, then it's got to be in the morning before you go to work and in the evening.
After you come back from work, but like having that dedicated time, and if you're like, well, I'm not a morning person fine.
Then just work late.
Like that's okay.
Like, I've got billionaire buddies who were like, oh, I wake up at 10, but they work really late.
21:13
That's their, that's their special time that no one bothers that, it tends to be the bookends, the day, they're just from my experience because in the middle of the day you get pestered and start to get into that deep focus that really that deep learning that you get when you really pour yourself into something.
Mmm.
Yeah, I think I think I saw Layla mention this in a video clip or she was like I just wake up and I start working, it's not spending.
21:32
Our morning routine or something like that and I think you got to figure out who you are.
It's like, if you want to spend an hour or two in the morning and they can coffee and going for a walk and working out and kind of like preparing herself, great, I think for me.
Yeah, there is some importance to, at some point in the day setting an intention either for the day or at night for the next day.
21:52
Agreed.
So if you want to get up and work right away at night, totally how what are the three most important things or what are the actions are going to take their to get you closer to your vision?
That next day.
So having some 5-10 minutes to have an intention and then act on it right?
22:08
As opposed to just reacting to the world.
Yeah, 100%.
That's what I believe.
But there was this one to consolidate were saying earlier, because I like this is matters a lot to make a bit dumb.
Most skills can be learned decently with about 20 hours of focused effort, 20 hours like the first 20 hours of you actually doing something.
22:27
You learn the most, you're going to learn about the thing for if you just consider by percentage of learning from like you, Nothing to 20 hours in.
You already have a really good understanding of the thing.
The problem is that most people will take years to start the first hour and so that habit that you're referencing is that my speed at least now is that you know, I've gotten better at this stuff is that like I tried to track the time from what I want to learn something or what?
22:51
I want to start doing something to starting it as soon as I can.
So I just want to start getting through those 20 hours as fast as I can.
Yes.
And so that's just been a very tangible because it seems like this amorphous thing but there was a study that was done there's like in the first 20 yards.
Come on almost any scale.
Playing guitar running an ad doing a quote, like you will learn more in that first 12 hours that any other time.
23:09
So it's like, then just get to that 20 hours of delay.
Yes.
And that's been one of the one of those one of the deepest lessons I've had because it took me four years to learn how to build a website.
And it took me one day to actually learn crazy because you decided to act on the learning for years to delay and procrastinate and say I'm not a tech guy.
23:27
I am not a tech person.
This isn't my kind of thing.
I'm a gym guy, I'm a local business owner.
I should pay somebody to do this.
I'm But this kind of thing like all these stories, right?
And then one day I sat down on a Sunday morning.
I was like I'm going to learn this.
I think goes on it and you took it a just learned it step by step by step and you know what, I set the whole day.
So I took me four hours, crazy, it's amazing.
23:44
You'll hear.
I bet you've heard this so many times that people are like, I want to launch a podcast.
I want to start a YouTube.
I want to launch a book and they've been saying it for years and years and years, when you can literally go on Amazon and upload a book in an hour.
If you just learn the steps, it might feel daunting and over.
Like, I don't know how to do this and how do I link my payments and Write a book and put it up there, but you can create a one page book and launch it to these say you did it and now, you know, the steps.
24:09
So it's not as scary, we're selling so many people are afraid to launch their thing because they don't understand how to do it.
And they think it's going to take a lot more time than it actually is, you may not be good at it right away.
Yeah.
Your website.
Probably wasn't perfect.
Yeah, but you've got the website up within four hours and then you can make it better over time that first hour is you paying down the fear of Uncertainty.
24:33
It's all these fears of like not being enough.
What if I feel stupid because you have felt stupid.
We try to figure something else out.
Like you remember how hard it was to learn, how to tie your shoes when you were a kid, right?
Because it's like, I have to remember than this one and the two bunny ears your the whole thing, right?
But like now you can do in your sleep and it's the same, it's just the emotions we have about beginning work because the judgments were going to put on ourselves about how we're doing.
24:52
If we can remove the Judgment of how we're going to do, and say, I assume I'm going to suck and all I'm doing is I'm going to start pulling the thread of this 20 hours.
That's my only goal is to start sucking.
That's it.
I just want to start.
Being rather than nothing.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
25:08
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, You got a lot.
25:26
You gotta love, embarrassing yourself the way.
I feel like it these skills are going to learn.
They're going to bring you a lot of value long-term.
They're not easy to start with they're not.
And so you've got to be okay with accepting embarrassment of your own self.
What's the what's the belief that why is it so hard for people that haven't made money?
25:48
Let's talk about like the daunting number for a lot of people just seven Figures, it's just it was hard for me too.
Over the hump mentally and psychologically of like how do I go from five thousand dollars a month to ten thousand dollars?
Then 10,000 or 20,000?
And then how do you get a business?
26:05
I'm talking about business owners.
How do you get it to a six figures?
And then to the seven-figure.
Mark, as a business owner, do we overcomplicate money and our minds if we've been taught stories as kids or been taught beliefs about it and how do we get over the over complication of making seven figures as entrepreneurs?
26:25
I agree with you that I think it gets over complicated and so we just have to boil it down to the first principles of the math, like, what math is required to make a million dollars, right?
Like we can either sell, you know, 110,000 other things we can sell a thousand thousand dollar things we can sell and buy.
26:40
When I say things, you don't have to price your product at a thousand dollars for just lifetime value of a customer must be a thousand dollars, right?
So, just how much time he's going to spend with you over the period of time that they buy from you, in general right now, if your self is a products that might just be the lifetime value, but if you sell services like the, the dog, Yeah, he probably has people who stay with him for years and so he has to add up that total lifetime value as the number, and it's like well, how many of those do need to sell and then you divide it by, you know, to back into it.
27:04
And so once, you know, the math, right?
So the first is like, what is the math to get to the million and you have to figure out how many units are going to sell.
So let's just use something that's, let's use a thousand dollars because it's an easy one.
Okay, so I was in sales for thousand dollars, exactly.
So we have to do a thousand sales.
27:20
Now, how are we going to break that down on an annual basis?
Because thousand sounds like a huge number.
Well, it's about 30, A day right?
Like okay, well, 30 days all of a sudden a lot more minute here and we're like, okay, well, what creates a sale.
So at some point to get set, I'm going to take one step before for six figures for anybody who's not there, it's like you have to sell and this is good for business owners entrepreneurs if you have a job then also, but like you're trying to try to make money.
27:43
It's have to sell something to someone.
That's it.
That's all you have to do to get to six figures to do that.
So that's one Avatar one-on-one meeting one channel, right?
One product.
One channel.
That's all that is.
You had the fourth piece, which is consistency.
Right?
That's what gets from 6 to 7.
That, is it people in the consistent?
27:58
Yeah, 100%, because then, you can tackle all the emotional or whatever it is that why you're not being consistent.
But from a math perspective, we'd have to break down.
What are the primary actions that result in the the output, right?
And so if three sales means that I sell one out of three people who want to walk or one out of two people, who come for the dog.
28:14
Walking.
Okay, well then I need six appointments a day.
Okay.
How do I get six points a day?
It's like, well, I have six ways that I get appointments, right?
I get a point some referrals I get appointments from Affiliates, so I I make a deal with the local grooming place for dogs or the local vet for dogs, or the Flyers up or something in the urgent care for dogs for Petco, like, whatever me like, there's a million ways, right?
28:35
Like, I get one of those guys.
I figure out a deal with them and I'll give you the first two months of what they pay me to you if you just send it to me.
Yes, more money for them and probably helps their customers because it's a need that they can't solve, but they have the same Avatar.
Cool.
So you got referrals, you got Affiliates, you've got, you could just reach out to people, you know, just one-on-one like, hey, I've got my thing.
28:52
Have like, do you need help with your dog, you can reach out.
People, you don't know which you can do through Post-it notes, cold calls, emails, door knocking, like, they're the Liars.
Yeah.
All of those things are ways that you can reach out to people.
You don't know 101, you can make content about dog, Arc is amazing and wasted ways to walk your dog.
29:08
Better ways to take care of a dog and the whole point of that is to get people to feel comfortable with you specifically in your brand that you're that, you will do a better job taking care of their dog, may be exactly right.
You want to people feel guilty that they're not doing all this stuff for the dog and then they would start, you know, then you start get you field inbound, right?
And then finally of ads, right?
29:24
You pay you have run paid ads to get new new appointments booked, right?
And so, those are the six primary things you can do to get customers, right?
So it's like, okay, I need six appointments a day.
I have those six different ways that I can get them, which of them.
Do I feel most comfortable with because you can you can win it all them, right?
29:41
It could be soliciting, your customers the referrals.
It could be getting the Affiliates of relationships set up.
It could be the one-on-one DM's, it could be the ads could be the content, any of those six would work, right?
And so we just have to pick which one you want.
And so then you just First engineer, those actions of because even one step after obviously, that's something I do a lot.
30:00
So if you reverse engineer the affiliate thing, right?
So how do you get Affiliates?
It's like, wow, I need to reach out to a hundred people a day.
So you'd still use one of the other methods.
So cold outbound, warm, outbound content or ads, right to get that.
Those Affiliates.
And say, okay, well, if I reach out to 100 flights a day that are in my, in my local region to see if they will partner with me, and I create some sort of relationship, I do that every day.
30:23
Maybe I'll get to Two of those referral Partners a week.
And if each of those referral Partners we can get me 10 appointments, then for me to get my six appointments, a days 180 appointments per month if I need 18, Affiliates, right?
So all I got to do is get 18 Affiliates.
But then if you're thinking right now you're like, well, wait but I will be able to get 18 Affiliates in probably like a month or two and the answer is your right.
30:46
But people just don't think through the math of how to do it because if we're being real.
There's no reason you should cap your business at a million, right?
Instead of the same degree, when we ask the question, like how do I make a million dollar business?
You also think in increments that somebody who's trying to make a million dollars, thanks in right?
Because I got asked on this Tick Tock so they gave me this prompt.
31:04
They said hey Alex how would you make six figures a year?
That was the question and my immediate response was I would sell something for 100 grand and figure out what I would do the rest of the year.
Yeah and so it's like these people think about money differently, you know what I mean?
And so if you think about how do I This thing into like a hundred million I like and you have to think of a number.
31:23
That's as high as you can fathom, right?
If you can't fathom under million to don't think that but like as as high as you can mathematically fathom, so might be 10 million dollars.
Okay.
Things like how many dogs when I need to walk and you just reverse the math and to what you need?
Right?
And then people I need to hire and I'm exactly and then you start and then you start with the inputs because in the beginning the only inputs you have is going to be the constant.
31:42
It's me running the answer me doing the warm.
It's going to be the reach outs that says those are the inputs and that everything else is going to step from that.
And then what will happen is if you have that the average Sighs machine on the front end to bring people in the bottleneck, becomes your leading rather than the selling of the product.
Yes, eating, right.
It's and then the focus then becomes really want to get deep on those.
31:59
How do I use that same skill set of advertising and then shift it to my internal?
Because I still have to do warm reach out to self to run ads.
I stuff to make content.
I still can have Affiliates or get referrals from my employees to get more team and so every business has two funnels.
You have the front in front of that, your customers and the back in front of the kids.
32:15
You team and says you crank, this guy need to crank this one and then that's how you can scale these things.
Nerd without stopping, right?
Is it harder to get leads and sales or harder to build a powerful team with the right culture.
I think they're both hard and both easy for different people.
32:33
Yeah, you know.
I mean, like Leila naturally is very good at the back end photo.
I mean, she's so good at building culture, but she is this thing that she's kind of spoken over me from a belief standpoint, which is, if you are really good marketer, really good salesman.
A lot of them are like, oh, I'm not a good, a good leader.
I'm not a good operator, not a good whatever.
And she's like, if you can sell all those people and influence, All those people, you can use that same skill set and just face internally to your team.
32:54
It was a nice belief shift for me, or belief break for me was like, she's totally right.
And so, to the point that you were making earlier like, leading a selling and influencing a lot of, it really comes down to being able to move people and being able to clearly communicate what you want, why do you think it's so hard for people to overcome their limiting beliefs around money in general?
33:11
A lot of people were told things about the world that we're not true and they take them as fact.
And so they're making their decision calculus off of something that is not true.
And so, they're making conclusions off of false data and that said, that's why they can't see it because what they're basing their assumptions on is false right?
33:27
But believing it for so long.
Yeah.
So how do they change that belief when it's been baked in their psyche for decades?
Yeah, I think that the way that the biggest police have been broken, for me have been one of two ways reality proves me wrong.
Or someone tells me a story gives me evidence from their lives.
33:44
Like I remember when I went to a mastermind and I, we were just starting out.
I was not making a ton of money and the guy got up there and he gave his little Spiel.
He's like, yeah, you know we're making three or four hundred thousand dollars a month.
I don't really know what I'm doing and really sure.
I like the business blah blah and the guy did not seem smart and you're like, how is he doing this?
34:03
It's funny.
You say that because my actual first thought, was if he can do it I can do it.
Right?
And so that was like he threw evidence like here.
Reshaped.
My reality is one of the most momentous thing.
I remember Layla, I both had the same take away because she was next to me when we both saw this guy, do this, like we walked out of like to if he can like we both immediately had the same conclusion.
34:20
Like, if he can do, we can do it.
And so either have reality prove me wrong or someone else is that reality for you.
When they tell their story about how I used to feel the same way, I used to think this thing and then I will share my story so you don't have to have this car.
Yes.
So you don't have to give up five years your life to learn this lesson.
34:36
I'll just give you the stories you don't have to have this car.
There's certain things, I think we need On our own and fail and, you know, and make mistakes on our own.
But there's a lot of things we can learn from other people being the youngest of four kids.
I watched, you know, my older siblings fail and succeed in their own ways as a model and say, okay, I don't want to make this mistake a mistake.
34:56
I made other stupid mistakes, but I didn't make certain mistakes that they made and able to accelerate that time from the pain that I was going to feel by making the same mistake.
So I think you're gonna make mistakes matter what.
But I think that's seeing other people and learning.
This is why it's so Important to have coaches mentors people that can break the beliefs in you and tell you what you need to do.
35:16
If you think about human like the human race does assume because I think it's a really interesting concept.
I was talking to Caleb about Gary and I'm competitive person.
Yes, I like, you know, thinking like Oh, by the time I'm that age.
I'm going to be further.
I'm going to.
Do you mean like and it's lovingly and he said this thing back to me that like it hit me.
35:34
He was like, dude, Gary didn't have Gary, right?
He just had to do it in his own, right?
And so the thing is, is like a Of awesome.
Myself included.
I get caught up in there, like, man, these kids have it so easy, you know, Bob lot?
Right.
I'd YouTube wasn't even around when I, you know, the thing is, if you ask me such first, what they want to do with their lives, they say they want to make an impact on the world, they want to make the world a better place, but like making the world a better place.
35:56
What that looks like, is it being easier for the next generation?
And so, rather than lamenting the fact that the guys were younger, have it easier.
That was the point.
Yes.
That was the like mission accomplished and so, it reframed how I thought about being the greatest of all time because I think a lot of people of that goal to be the greatest.
I mean, a lot of people have that goal, but the more I thought about it, the more I was like, I can't have that goal because if I did my job, then I have to have made people who are after me get there faster than I got there.
36:24
And so the mark of the success is that I'm not the greatest of all time but that other people who come after me or even better.
Mmm and so it really shifted.
My relationship with how I saw past Generations, guys are older than me, who are killing it.
And I used to think I'm going to beat them and if I look at my, how much Worth at this at this age versus them, like I just doing the math, I should be further along than them by the time of their age and it was this kind of like different competition rather than this gratitude for like, well, of course, I'm going to be bigger than they are at their age.
36:53
I had them to help me.
They didn't have them to help them.
And so all age up and will be multi-billionaire, whatever it is, right?
And then there's going to be a young whippersnapper who had me to help you had me to help him out because I'm so, you know, we have guys who apply for a quiz or not, come here in their twenties 100 year.
37:10
And I'm like and that was that wasn't possible 50 years ago, it just wasn't right.
So we think about like the human race in General on a macro perspective, right?
You have like rather than seeing the people who are older than you as the old dogs, you have to to kick off, right?
And by all means play hard in the paint, Doug me wrong.
37:27
And the people the young whippersnappers behind you, as you know, resenting them for the fact that they got it easier, it just flipped the script for me, in terms of like, I'm so grateful for these guys who came before me because they didn't have them, right?
And then if these guys Guys, do eventually beat me, right?
Or are there further along than I was at their age rather than lamenting them to protect my ego.
37:47
Because what it really says is, you're better than I am.
Because if they're making more money at a younger age than me, that it means the better at business in some way that I was at that age, it's just a fact of business, right there.
Better than me at that age.
And to protect my ego.
I want to say they had easier, right?
38:03
But rather than friends that do for you, if you protect your ego as opposed to help others accelerate faster than you, I think you just reframes it.
And so it takes the ego away from.
I need to crush these guys or I need to poke it why it's easier for them.
And instead say like it being easier for them, is my purpose.
38:22
How can I say that?
My mission is to document each other.
Best practice, build a world-class companies and then not be pumped and what Or someone to use the best practice building world-class companies 10 years before I learn them to accelerate way past.
And so anyways that I just that was a frame of reference that completely shifted The Narrative for me, in terms of competition, I still been pushing as hard as I possibly can to transform my potential into reality but it feels it feels different.
38:49
It feels lighter tone and I like it.
Yeah it was I just want to show you that it's it was a cool trick that I had recently.
Yeah, you just want a little lighter.
Yeah I'm mentally emotionally and physically lost a little weight too.
It's funny.
I just had Steve Young on who's a Hall of Fame quarterback in the NFL one, multiple Super Bowls.
39:06
He was just on a couple days ago and he said back in the late 80s and I guess it was the 90s Bill Walsh the coach, who is like he said, three generations ahead of every other head coach.
At that time, he had a camera guy with him.
All the time, documenting his processes and he would package it into these.
39:24
I guess via Sage tapes it and put it in a box and he would give it to all his assistant coaches.
Has and say I want you to learn these skills.
His offense was the West Coast offense.
There was a far ahead of its time where most people just running the ball down, you know, down the middle.
So he gave away everything for free.
39:41
He said, I want you guys to learn this and then come and challenge me.
Yeah, you know, use my information and come and people.
He said, years later some coaches would lead to become head coaches and they would compete and big games together.
Sometimes we lose because he's other coaches that he coached and he loved it.
39:59
And he is still revered as a leader in the space because he was ahead of the time because he documented and gave away the skills to his other coaches.
And I think that's really cool.
I mean, you're not gonna do this forever, so you might as well leave some Legacy behind in that respect as well.
It puts the game above the player.
40:16
Yes.
Rather than putting the player above the gate.
Yeah.
And so, like, I think, right now, if you'll on had a choice of having somebody else accomplish all the things that he's setting out to accomplish and not be him.
My hope my belief, from everything that I've seen and Witness The View on his, I think that he would be stoked.
40:32
And because its Mission first rather than leaving first.
And so, like, Steve Young, put the game of football and it consistently being elevated.
Be play at a higher level as more important than him because in three generations, don't remember, he's all right, but the game will always have his fingerprint, right?
40:48
And so like you can live on in that way, I did the same degree in the business game.
It's like we honor the game by playing to our absolute hardest and by by doing our best and passing it on to the next Generation.
So there was, I love that stuff.
That's the holmium.
What is the vision for you now?
Because When we first have you on I can remember as few months back.
41:05
Yeah.
And we've hung out for dinner a couple of times.
I've seen you a few times, there's been like a transition in you in like three to four months.
You know, there's been like Evolution already.
I'm here.
You say, you're having realizations and recently and in before it seemed harder, right?
41:21
And now it seems like there's something that's unlocked inside of you.
So I'm curious.
What is the business Vision that you have?
What's the number you want to reach?
Yeah, personally for the business.
All these things.
Yeah.
I know you've talked about being a billionaire, it's the same take a matter of time.
When do you think being a billionaire will happen for you?
41:38
I'd like to do five to seven for a billion.
I like to hit 10 and 10.
That's, that's what I would like to do.
I think that we can do that math wise, based on kind of, the, inflow of deals that we have have, like, the returns that were getting in general.
Like, I think we can do that.
41:53
But the thing that like, really drives me though, is acquisition not comes the wealth machine that is behind Alex and Leah has media, right?
And so, I wouldn't be a very good business, educator unless I had proof or evidence that I actually was good at business, right?
42:09
So we have a Sleek could just sit on The Laurels of the 3x that we had last year, three exits we had last year but to me that's not like as crazy as this will sound.
It's not super impressive.
You don't I mean at least for where I want to go and so I want to have a billionaire multibillion-dollar thing because I think it would be so cool.
42:25
Like how cool would it be if we if Jeff Bezos and and Warren Buffett and Elon Musk and all those guys had documented everything that they learn throughout that pathos.
We get is the Snippets shareholder letters every once in a while and it's just like there's so little and they're going to die and we're going to lose it and lose all those lessons.
And so part of it that excites me is just calling my shop.
42:43
Because I think that always just like in livens a little bit of the competition.
But I do believe from a mathematical standpoint, we will get there.
So it's not to me, it doesn't feel like a super pick, I'm not really putting that farther better, but seeing the hordes, the scores of businesses that are using the stuff in the books in the courses and you Even podcast and you know Tick-Tock Instagram and Linkedin and use those in the message, they get every day of like, dude, you helped me go from a million to five million a year.
43:11
You helped me go from quit, my job and then start my dog walking business.
And now I'm doing, you know, six figures a month and like those stories.
I know that I will probably never meet most of them.
I will probably never work with vast majority of them.
The fact that it's happening, just amps me up.
Like, it just gets me soul.
43:26
It's cool.
And so the media has been really cool and new for me but I like it and so I'm learning it and so it's just It's a new thing that I get to learn and I'm really loving that.
Yes.
And then seeing the vision of where we're going in terms of what we're building the acquisition.
Not calm side.
The companies that were scaling there and the impact that they're having.
43:41
Because many of them are also education businesses, not all of them but like probably a probably about half seeing that on both sides, like us directly influencing through media and then the actual wealth machine on both sides.
Like I just see the most expanding that's cool.
And so we were talking before this but it was like I saw a limit with Jim Lunch, Prestige Labs, like the at least took my vision was limited and that could have been You being younger, whatever it is but like I don't feel like my vision is obstructed in terms of where this can go.
44:09
And so that is what ifs me up a buddy of mine sold his company for a couple billion, and he's been in a little bit of like a rut, since then.
Yeah, interesting after people self and a lot of money.
Why do you feel like they go into a depression or a funk after they sell billion dollar company, they lose the vision, right?
44:26
Like the vision, it's like, I think the vision is another word for Hope, right?
It's hope for a better future.
That's what we're marching towards, right?
And you can you basically give them That away someone right now.
For my salad.
I'm all right.
Yeah.
In exchange for my right.
And then the Hope ended up feeling you more than money or does but different conversation but he said this one thing to me and it really resonated he's like I'm just looking for my next big boned and on and that visual for whatever reason, like stuck to me.
44:49
And so I'm like I see a big bone to gnaw knowing that I'll never chew through the entire bone.
But being pumped every day to just get a little bit further, down the down the nub, you know, what happens if we don't have a vision for our lives?
I think you have less Direction and so you make less progress because you're not actually, you can't make progress unless you have Direction because otherwise you're just moving.
45:10
So like you can only have direct like a vector, right?
You know, movement in a direction if you know where you're trying to go.
And so it's like the first thing you have to do is figure out where we're trying to walk and then we can start walking there.








0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out.
0:15
If that's what you are into.
And if not keep enjoying the show, what's going on?
Go is Happy what did he say?
Wednesday happy hump day.
I want to make a quick video.
I won't be too long today but I was chatting with my good friend Ryan.
Karthi who is a gym, Lord extraordinary.
0:32
And I think that what I was talking to him about is relevant for a lot of people in a lot of different spaces.
And it's, it's just worth really digging into the for this one Quick Clip.
So instead of video is your work works on you more than you work on it.
0:49
And so Ryan's in this really, really, really tough market.
So he's been, he's been trying to generate leads for ever, you know what I mean?
And like whenever he successfully, But you start generating leads it just like it just shuts down like almost immediately.
And so you know he messaged me and he's like, dude, I'm not giving up and he's been doing this for a while.
1:10
He's you know, taking the internet marketing courses, he's, you know, he's invested in himself in that, in that degree.
And now he's running YouTube ads, he's running Instagram ads, he's running all the different types of placements on Facebook.
And he's like, dude, I'm just getting, you know, really frustrated but I'm going to keep powering through and keep powering through.
1:28
And the thing is, is like What that is like, that's an illustration of the amount of skill that he's been able to develop because of a hardship, and sometimes when you're in it, you don't realize it right?
And so, like I titled it, your work works on you more than you work on it.
Because despite the fact that he doesn't get as many leads as a lot of the people who were in Jim Legacy, he's better at lead-gen than almost everyone because he hasn't had it easy, right?
1:53
And so like, people don't think about that but like that, like it's like you don't know how strong you are, how much you've trained until you get back into the ring.
But this Time he's been training, right?
He's been like working out hard, like we're going to hard like feeling like he's out of breath feeling.
He's getting beat up.
But like his skills are increasing.
2:08
Right?
And so, I mean, I'd love to say that I was the source of like that thing.
But like, in the Bible says, in Proverbs 14:23, it says, in all labor, there is profit in all labor, not some all labor.
So whenever you work, you increase, like, because it's not that like you're going to make Financial profit or accounting profit you yourself.
2:29
Become more valuable in all work.
And so, like, if you fail, when you sell, you have, like, you still become more valuable because you gain the experience.
So, you always gain as long as you work, right?
And so, when you think about it like that, and that's what kind of Shifting the worldview of like life happens to us instead of like shifting from Life happens to us to life happens for us, right?
2:53
And so Ryan is here, fighting the good fight and but like as he's fighting this good fight, he's learning how to Henry leads better than anyone else in the Mastermind, because this Market is so rough, right?
And so, like, I don't know if that's like for you right now.
3:09
You might be like, man.
Like my market stuff are like, man.
Like my, my gym, like the space that I have is so hard, so confined, or whatever it is like that hardship will become your strength because you have to work on it, right?
And so I was really grateful because the market that I was actually in that I started and a lot of people don't know this, but the reason that I That I left Baltimore.
3:32
And then went to Southern California when I wanted to get into fitness was because I told myself, I was like, if I'm going to go into fitness, I was like, I want to be the best and if I'm going to be the best and I have to do it in the hardest place to go.
So, Southern California was the most competitive market at least, in my opinion, in the US that's between that and South Beach.
3:49
And I ended up going to Southern California and he's going to figure it.
If I can make it there, then I'll be able to make it anywhere and that was the idea and it and it kind of Handout.
And so if you like, whatever your hardship is, it will be the source of your greatest Prophet later because it's skill that you will develop the most.
4:08
Like, I kept banging my head against the wall in sales, but now people consider us like sales experts but I sat down with 4,000 people, you know, 101.
You know.
And like during that period of time it sucked.
I was exhausted.
I don't want to do it, you know what I mean?
And I didn't realize actively that what it was building was a skill set.
4:26
That I would be able to leverage later and feed my family for Generations.
I didn't know that at the time and so, whatever that thing is right now that you might be struggling with a lot of times that struggle is going to become the source of your greatest strength because of the skills that you acquire during that struggle.
So I went to Huntington Beach that was a rough Market super competitive but because of that, I was able to learn the lessons and develop the skills that eventually would let me grow out of it and and crushed.
4:55
So anyways, I hope that was all for you guys.
If you guys are in in that little spot, You are struggling with something.
Just remember that in all labor there is profit, your work works on you more than you work on it and that as you work, as long as you're working you will get better.
And then all you have to do is continue to get better and then like you will be better and eventually it will break through I promise.
5:15
That's 100% of Promise all labor, there's profit.
Alright guys, have an awesome day and have a happy holiday and I'll catch you guys soon.
Like it comment and lots of love








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
If you are unsure or your unnies, are you do one of these like tiny?
Like I'm just Not sure if I'm going to do it.
Don't do it.
I'm telling you.
Like, there are so many reasons you should not do deal, you'd be saying, no, way more.
0:35
You should be saying yes.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business.
And maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200, and Beyond, hope you share and enjoy.
0:52
I'm going to talk about the 24 rules of investing, and these are all structured as if then statements.
And the reason our structure that way is that we make many decisions countless decisions every single day.
And the idea is that if we learn a principle, then we can continue to use that winning principle over and over.
And we don't look at the principle in the micro which means like you could not make an investment and it could blow up.
1:12
But the question is, if I had made that same decision making process over and over and over again.
Would I over the longer term have made more money?
And so, the reason some of the greatest investors published books about their principles is because they know people make the right decisions.
They get the right outcomes, over a long enough time Horizon.
1:27
And so these are the 24 rules investing that I have gathered of my career.
If you don't know I am things auction was across a hundred dollars net worth at 33 and I make these guys I hope that if you have a three million, two hundred dollar company.
Yo, I'll ask us to invest in it and we can help you grow.
Other than that, just us free.
Enjoy it.
Okay.
If you can't buy it twice, don't buy it once.
1:45
And so this is a principle around sizing how much you're going to put into something.
And so if you can't buy it twice and realistically, probably three, four, five, six times.
Don't buy it once because it means you're probably taking too big of a chunk out.
When I got into investing in general, I used to think like oh I'm going to put like a third into this.
2:01
They're like to know that your biggest allocation might be 10%.
I was like, oh, so it's It's a totally different frame of mine.
So the principle is you can't buy twice, don't buy ones to.
If you're worried about it, you can buy insurance for it.
So, there is unlimited Insurance products.
2:17
There are so many Insurance products Under the Sun.
You can be amazed at what you can buy insurance for.
And so, for example, people like I'm afraid of running out of money, you can literally buy money for the rest of your life.
You can literally give money and they will have a guaranteed income until you die.
Like there are things that people don't know exists out there called annuities, right?
2:34
If you are afraid that certain person's going to die, you can Get insurance on that person.
Like any type of scenario like what if I lose my arm?
Like surgeons can get insurance on their hands because if they get an axe of the kids, you surgery like you can get insurance on anything.
And so if you have a specific concern, you don't have to get crazy about it.
2:51
Just buy insurance for it and know that it's covered.
If a deal feels like a grand slam, get a second opinion.
And so whenever I'm looking at something and something looks amazing or whatever, I automatically send it to other people because it means like, I must not be seeing something like I need someone else's eyes on this and so it's a good easy.
3:07
I'm making real for yourself for investing, if you don't know how you can lose money, don't do it until you do.
So you have to figure out how you're going to lose money.
Like, there's always a way to lose money in the deal and you not only want to find a way to lose money, but you want to find all the ways, you can lose money in the deal.
And so if you don't know any you definitely shouldn't do the deal until you know most of them and or all of the ones you possibly think you can know, right.
3:28
We're always controlling for the unknown or the unknowable, but we want to minimize that to the highest degree possible.
So if you don't know how you can lose money, don't do the deal until you do.
If it feels rushed, don't do it.
And this is one of the biggest ones that has served me in my life because what happens, a lot of people will try and apply pressure to you.
3:44
They're trying to say like, hey do this doing be?
Hey give me this money.
Hey, can you let me this thing?
Bob about, right, and they in the more money you have our promise.
You it doesn't stop and it get the pressure gets bigger.
And so if someone tries to pressure you pause, right?
And if anything is social pressure, you just don't do the deal altogether.
So if you feel rushed, don't do it.
4:01
It's one of the easiest things that saved me so many mistakes in my life.
If you only have one deal on the table, don't do the deal.
Always have backup deals.
And the reason for that is like, imagine you're dating, right?
And there's only one girl on the planet.
Well, you're going to find a way to think that.
4:16
That girl, and if you know, your gender is, reverse flip it right?
Or your preference is rough.
Whatever.
You know what I'm saying?
Right, if you want to bang somebody, there's only one person on the planet then you're going to find a way to make that work.
Right?
And so it's kind of the same thing with deals.
Like if you only have one deal on the table, you're going to keep telling yourself like man maybe this is a good deal because you have nothing else to compare it to 2.
4:34
And so the idea is, you always want to have a plethora of options to choose from and until you get this many options to choose from, don't move forward because what happens is you artificially make that girl look a lot better or that person or that deal looks a lot better when there's nothing else to compare it to if you buy with the intention of selling, you're not investing your trading and so big thing that everyone like I hear people especially in the younger Community.
4:55
They're like I'm an investor.
It's like well if you're if you're buying with the intention of selling your you're training, your transacting, you're really just running a business not investing investing.
About very, very long time Horizons for.
Sometimes it's harder when you're younger to even imagine a longer time Horizon.
But it's also the reason that there's not like many legendary investors who are in their 20s and so part of that is because it takes time time.
5:15
And so the idea though is this a mindset shift in terms of decision-making which is if you're going into something with the intention of selling it, you're not investing or trading your transacting and it's just a different shift and then it's a whole different set of rules where you get in trouble, is where you're trying to apply business stuff to investing versus investing stuff or investing.
5:34
If the business like they are different skills, which is why investors aren't necessarily good at business.
And a lot of business people are necessarily going to investing because they're completely different skill sets.
Now, there is cross over there is time where their benefits of principles but overall they are there different skills to master.
So this comes into play, we have a partnership.
5:51
If we don't agree, we don't do it.
So this is saved me.
So many mistakes is, I'm usually the Yes Man in my Partnerships.
I'm always, I'm tend to be more optimistic.
I tend to, I tend to see more upside and less downside that's and most entrepreneurial people.
Our that way because we have to, because we have to because if we actually focused on the likelihood of success which is usually low for most entrepreneurial things, you would never get started.
6:12
And so you have to have some proclivity for being a little bit, overly optimistic, right?
And so it's good, a to have a partner who balances that be.
If you have that partner who bounces it, they actually have to balance it if they're just a yes-man and they always like Bend to your will, then they're not actually providing value.
Like there's a reason yin and yang are equally weighted in the in the symbol right?
6:31
And so if you don't agree don't move forward.
This has been Something that's been really valuable for my life and for business Partnerships in general, like, I don't Strongarm anyone, even if I have decision-making Authority, I still won't move forward until we agree.
And as a tangent into marriage stuff, we get asked this all the time.
6:46
They're like, well, you know, push comes to shove and you both don't, you know, like somebody has the upper hand honestly.
No, we keep talking about to, we agree.
Like we just keep we don't make the decision until we both agree and it's been one of the earliest pieces of advice we got in and it's woman.
One of the ones that paid us the most evidence, if it's complicated past, if it feels Above your head, it probably is.
7:06
And so one of the things is that people want to feel fancy, they want to get into the room they want to do, they want to do these deals, they want to get into the complex stuff, but if you don't get it, you're gonna get fucked.
And if you pretend like, you do your double going to get fucked.
And so the idea is, if you don't get it and it's not simple to you, it's probably because you don't understand it well enough, but if you don't understand it well enough, it's very high-risk, right?
7:27
If you have complete understanding of something, the risk goes down because you understand the variables.
And so if you're barely catching on, you might as well be gambling.
Right.
Which is not the way to invest.
Fomo means slow down.
All right.
So if you feel that emotion, like I'm going to miss out on something, slow down.
All right, this is a decision-making variable, you feel that emotion slow down again these are these are principles.
7:47
If you just you start flexing these leg muscles, you do it.
And if this then that if this then that and then it preserves your ability to make better decisions over time and if you apply, all of these things to all the decisions you make, you will have outsized returns over longer time Rising.
No diligence, No Deal.
8:04
All right, so if someone's like, oh, I don't have a lot of diligence, they don't send you the pack or they don't see you enough information on the thing and they still expect you to invest in something.
When I say investors have to be formal investing, like it can be like buying into something.
It can be by like you buying anything.
It's really a purchasing decision.
If you don't get the information, you need to make the decision.
8:21
You don't make the decision and I know this sounds ridiculous, but many of you do this, right?
You just go off the hype.
You go off of off an email or a phone call or you know whatever like get the information you need.
All right, and if you if there's no diligence no deal, right?
That's the way it works.
And if you miss out on something, because you didn't due diligence, remember that.
8:40
There was nine other things, that you also didn't do that, you would have lost your ass on.
All right.
It's using these principles over many decisions over a long period of time, which yields a return, no model, no deal.
And so what that means is, if someone doesn't send me like their proposal, for how something's going to grow, or how something is going to approve, or how they're going to add value, then there's no deal, right?
9:01
I don't To hear story of it.
I want to see the math behind it.
I want to see the projections and then when I look at those things I can make the decision.
Like is this reasonable what assumptions of this based on?
Do I think those assumptions are reasonable or probable?
And what information can I bring to this decision?
What are the things I need to believe that have to be true for this to occur, right?
9:17
And so then you can actually you can be more objective about the decision rather than just like yes.
If I multiply 100 by 1000 it's a million are you know whatever hundred thousand you get the idea.
Right is like if there's no model, no deal.
If someone's non-responsive in the deal processor, slow to Bond, No Deal reason for that Communications.
9:35
One of the most important things when you're doing any kind of business in general, and I judge someone very quickly on how meticulous they are in their responses, and how quick they are to respond in general.
Now, if someone says, hey, I received your email, I'll get back to you in two days and then they get back to me two days.
That's fine.
It's about expectation, setting and expectation meeting, right?
9:53
What's not good?
Is either of these scenarios either, the person doesn't respond right or takes a long time to respond or they say I'll get back to you tomorrow and then they get back to me too.
Two days later, right?
I expect, especially in this process where I'm just getting to know you, that what you say is going to happen is going to happen.
10:09
In order, it's one of the easiest way to build a reputation is do what you're going to say is that what you're going to do, if someone's not doing that with, you don't do the deal.
If it costs, peace of mind, don't buy it.
So if anything cost me my sleep or something that I'm worried about as a result of me making an investment or a purchasing decision, I don't buy it because the cost is too high, right?
10:30
And so you think about this over a long time Horizon like you can absolutely sell your peace of mind but it's probably not worth selling.
Right.
So don't don't buy something that causes you to sell your peace of mind?
Hey guys, real quick.
For those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans, I love you.
10:45
I added in a Chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
11:03
Its fo free in exchange for emails that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast so that it's my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
If it doesn't build your reputation, don't do it, no neutral moves.
11:21
So this is one that I've adopted more recently, but the idea is your brand.
Personally, your reputation is the one thing that you take with you forever and you absolutely can lose it and it can be irreparably damaged, whereas your money you can recover from.
11:37
And so the idea is I made this rule for myself also, because it makes it even easier for me because it's not, I don't want to hurt my reputation.
It's Only do it if it fills my reputation, no neutral moves.
And so what happens is, when we do that, we continue to reinvest in our reputation, in our personal brand, which gives us compounding returns over our entire lifespan in terms of relationships.
12:00
In terms of literally Financial returns in all other aspects of life but no neutral moves, only invest if it builds reputation if it doesn't build, don't do it.
No track record.
No Deal.
Pick performance over Charisma.
12:15
Alright, and so a lot of times people are, you know, trying to get their start, whatever the thing is just like, they're probably gonna get somebody to say, yes, it just doesn't necessarily have to be you, right?
And so big track record over performance, and this comes also for like hiring people.
It comes for investing in deals and doing transacting with people in business, like, for vendors, whatever it is the best predictor of future performance is past performance as much as people want to be all hand-waving.
12:39
They want to show you some Crazy grass, and whatever.
Like, sure, they have a model, fantastic other allowing us to do diligence great.
Oh, they're being very responsive phenomenal.
But if they have no track record, might they be successful.
Yes.
But if I invested every deal, that doesn't have track record.
Is that a good way to invest?
Probably not and so, like, Napoleon like to say I'd rather have lucky generals someone's going to probably do their deal doesn't have to be you and then if the deal does crush then they're going to do another deal and you can get it on that one.
13:06
If it's the same thing you've always done well with do more of it.
And so this is one of those things where we as humans are entrepreneurs, we like having variety rights.
We like to try new shit but the thing is that a lot of investing a lot of compounding comes from doing more of the same thing and so it's like hey man, I've done three hard money loans and they've all been awesome.
13:21
It's like well then you probably consider doing a fourth rather than starting to get into crypto day trading.
You know what I mean?
Which is obviously not investing.
But like what happens is you start to build your own track record, right?
And so, when you have a track record, you have your own performance and so you can start looking back over your shoulder.
Be like, okay, let's look at all the things that I've done.
13:37
These are the things that have worked, well, maybe I'm better at this stuff or maybe I have more insight into these things that I think I do.
Now mind you don't get high on your own Supply and start thinking that you're smarter than you are, which is not a good idea.
You might have also got lucky but again, I'd rather have lucky generals and so if I tend to be a little bit, luckier on the side of the board that I'm going to play on the side of the board, right?
13:54
And so that's the idea, once you find something that you start to get good at do more of it because the thing is, is that your luck will improve the more you do.
Always under borrow because any number no matter how big it is.
X 0 is still 0, and this is something that I tend to be very risk-averse when it comes to debt, all right?
Because it's called, it's called Leverage on the way up and it's called Dead on the way down, right?
14:12
And so the idea here, is that debt, introduces risk into any equation, right?
And risk, if multiplied over a longer time, Horizon will occur, right?
The the downside will occur.
And so the idea is if that's going to occur over a long enough time Horizon and I am going to get x 0.
14:28
That is probably not the best idea.
Idea.
And so if you are going to borrow then under borrow, so even though you could juice your return by getting more, remember that?
There is a likelihood over a long enough time rise in that.
If you over juice on a consistent basis, you will get 0.
So again, this is a principle in thinking, okay, if I get for example, a thirty percent return on my stuff, because I Juiced it by taking on extra money to get better Returns on my initial capital.
14:54
And I do that on 10 deals, maybe nine of them.
I do get 30%, but then if I do it on the 10th, you'll lose it all Because this is a principle of decision, making.
Then I go down to zero that sucks, right?
And so the idea is always under borrow and if you always under borrow, then you won't make as much money, but you won't lose it and that will allow you to continue compound over time.
15:14
So this is an important one, ask stupid questions Define terms draw pictures, see examples and if you can't draw it back you don't get it.
And so one of the things that I think about a lot is I want to understand everything that's in front of me as much.
15:30
As I possibly can and especially if you're getting into these things, there's probably a lot of stuff that you have no idea what it means.
All right, you know what's crazy?
Most people don't even know what they're saying.
Most people don't even know how to define the words, they use every day.
All right?
And so having a definition of terms is useful.
And if someone else is across the table from, you don't pretend like, you know what they're talking about because hey, they might not know what they're talking about be if they do know what they're talking about, they know, if you don't know what they're talking about and I start every single call, when it's somebody's gonna bring me something, I'll be like pretend I'm a golden retriever that doesn't speak English.
15:59
All right, it's like walking Through this.
And if you set that frame in the beginning, usually get a laugh.
But you also just say like this isn't my game and on the flip side, there is no advantage to somebody thinking, you know, more than you do not, but there is advantageous to you knowing more than they think you do, right?
16:16
And so always play the fool because there's often times, you won't be pretending to be posturing and you will learn because even if they tell you stuff and 80% of you already know the 20%, you didn't know you still get better from the conversation and it allows As you to ask obvious questions, but oftentimes the obvious questions is where like the lies or the bodies are buried underneath.
16:36
And if they start struggling to explain it to you, it means they also don't understand it.
Well either.
This is for my richer friends.
So once you have 1020, you know, 30 million in investable assets, one of the things that I got from a mentor of mine, he said, if we're not in the GP, we're not in the deal.
So, one of the best pieces of advice that I've gotten, which is like, if you're able to write bigger checks, then just say, I want a part of the GP or I only do deals when we're part of the GP, and when you do that, you start getting parts of the GP.
17:03
And so like, now for example, Layla, I only write it, like, we're only going to read check into something that we are part of the GP for it.
If you're like, I don't know if the GPS then don't worry about it because Probably doesn't apply to you.
All right.
And so it's General partner, limited part, or the people with General partners are basically the people who run the things, they get an extra slice of the pie, verse of the limited partners to actually invest the money.
17:19
And so if you're putting the money and only, but if you write a big enough check, you can also negotiate in a slice of the GP, right?
And so you can make that as a rule, which I have right, which is like we only do deals were part of the GPA because I want to make sure that we have a part of the people who really running this thing.
If it's a bad person, it's a bad deal.
17:36
I mean, Laila has an impeccable people picker.
It's unbelievable.
Like she could, she's never been wrong.
My entire relation has never been wrong and it's what I've been wrong all the time.
I'm like, this guy is right.
You know, that's not the like again, I'm a rose-colored glasses guy.
Layla has never been wrong and it's freaky.
17:53
Actually, what we have learned is I like bad Partners, doesn't matter what the paper says, because a bad person will always try and find a way to fuck you and so it doesn't matter what it is even if everything.
Is great.
They will try and find a way to fuck you and so if you are unsure or your uneasier, you do one of these like tiny like I'm just not sure if I'm going to do it.
18:12
Don't do it.
I'm telling you like, there are so many reasons you should not do deal.
If you saying no way more, you should be saying, yes, no contract no deal, but live in the world as though there were no contract.
This is a really important one.
For me, is that earlier on, in business relationships, and employee relationships, I used to just be like, you know, I heard that if you just have a handshake, that's It matters more, dude.
18:36
It's a different time.
All right, got to have contracts for everything.
And the important thing here is that contracts serve the purpose of setting, clear expectations.
If you're like, I don't want to go through this, it's going to like lawyers, it means that you're not willing to confront hard conversations.
What happens if you lose all my shit?
18:52
What happens if you don't do it you said you're going to what happens if I don't do.
What I said I was going to do what happens?
Are you gotta walk through that?
If you can't walk through in the beginning, you're definitely not going to walk through it when it actually happens, right?
So be able to get through the uncomfortable conversations early, so that When shit does happen, you actually know what the with the actual terms are like, what are the, what are the stakes, right?
19:10
And anyone who says, I only do handshake deals.
I don't, I don't do contracts run the other way.
Run the other way, every single person who is talk to me that way has been a fucking crook like everyone at, like, not like not.
19:25
Once has someone approached me that way and they not being unbelievably Shady.
So like plea, I mean, don't trust me do whatever you want.
But like, If there's anything you give this to someone says, like I don't believe in contracts feel like I don't believe in doing deals with our contracts.
Sorry, like clear expectations, good.
19:42
The contract is only worth the signature that signs it, okay?
There's multiple levels to this one.
Is that if someone personally guaranteeing something, they have no assets, it's not really guarantee right.
They're guaranteeing against nothing but more.
So it's the reputation right of the person that you're doing business with.
19:59
And so on the flip side of that, if you were the one people are doing business with, I like to pretend like The contract doesn't exist.
So you actually want to be clear when you're writing the contracts and when you're talking about the terms and like what happens if this happens, what happens if this happens like you want to be really clear about all that stuff, but I want to exist in a world that I'm not in litigation all day.
20:18
I would exist in a world where I'm always way above my contractual terms and I exist in a way.
Like even if someone's committed for example, to let's say, I have a Services relationship, that's a year-long whatever.
I want to mentally think even though they've committed to a year because that's where the economics of the business makes sense that I'm going to And like I'm only week-to-week like they don't have to pay me next month and so if you if you go on the defensive when you're Contracting but you go on the offensive when you're in delivery, you kind of get the best of both worlds.
20:45
And this has been something that has served me in.
So many parts of my life, it's like be defensive on the contract in the terms.
That's important, right?
Like you want to make sure that the i's are dotted and T's are crossed but then as soon as that process is over live as though this doesn't exist and the person can leave whenever and that has served me incredibly well in my whole life.
21:04
Live as though the contract doesn't exist, negotiate it is those the only thing that matters, but then after it's done, it's done put in a shelf and like you never look at it again because you want to live as though you're doing this only off of Goodwill and if the spirit of the original agreement continue to be maintained then both of you will continue to transact.
21:20
The contract is only for when someone doesn't stick to their terms, right?
So live as though, it doesn't exist.
Live as though the contract doesn't exist, negotiate it is those the only thing that matters, but then after it's done, it's done put in a shelf and like you never look at it again because you want to live as though you're doing this only off of Goodwill and if the spirit of the original agreement continue to be maintained then both of you will continue to transact.
The contract is only for when someone doesn't stick to their terms, right?
So live as though, it doesn't exist.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.

And if not keep enjoying the show, if aliens are further ahead of us than it means that they probably have a.
I if they're going to send something, they would probably send a robot.
Why?
Because a robot doesn't need to eat, it can live for a very long time and it Can survive in harsher different climates than biology can.

On top of that, it can work on itself whereas biology cannot Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and Buffett a document to their Journey.
0:49
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
On November 30th of 2022, the world changed forever.
Artificial intelligence became accessible to the public for free, through a tool called Chachi PT.
And it went from zero to a million users in five days which is the fastest, any platform is gone to a million users and before I even tell you why, that's so insane, I think that has the potential to unravel the very fabric of capitalism itself.
1:14
I know that's a strong statement, but I do think that it has massive implications for the future of how capitalism works and what it means for us as And so just to give you context to why I think this is so extreme, is that zero to a million users in five days?
It took Facebook, two years to Instagram, two years to Pinterest for months.
1:32
It took Facebook, 10 months and it took Angry Birds 35 days, alright?
And so nothing is ever happened, like this in the past and the thing is, is it continues to grow at the same exact rate?
And the only reason has been able to accommodate that is because of its single soul backer, which drum roll.
1:48
Please is Microsoft who wrote it?
A billion dollar, check value the company. 20 billion dollars.
And they are supporting all the cloud computing, that's required to allow to scale at the speed that it is.
So there's five major areas that I think it's going to completely turn on its head.
2:05
Number one, is the nature of work itself.
The second is how businesses operate the third is the economy overall.
The fourth is how we enter relate with one another on a romantic setting, how we choose mates, how we seduce, how we have sex, all of that stuff.
2:20
And finally, the nature of life itself, and how It actually extends to interplanetary life and whether or not aliens exist here on Earth and I actually think that if you take the logical step that will walk you through, I'm not a big Wooten hot guy but I think you actually think through the logic.
There's some really alarming conclusions that you can come to AI is going to be the biggest shift in our lifetime.
2:39
It is the equivalent in my opinion of the moon landing.
Except the only difference is that they will actually change all of our Lives rather than just being a picture to say that we won the Cold War.
All right, so different than the internet phone systems television because with those Did was they reshuffled the workforce?
2:55
This has the ability to remove or eliminate the work force altogether.
Like for example, cryptocurrencies in general, had the potential to overturn the financial institution.
AI is the potential to overturn the Human Institution.
And if you don't know who I am or you know the channel my name is Alex from Museum.
3:12
The founder of acquisition not come.
We're portfolio of companies that does over $200 a year and I make these so that you can use them and make lots and lots of money.
And hopefully you become a company between $300, and we can invest in your business.
Help you scale beyond that.
So in order for us to productively talk about AI, artificial intelligence, we have to understand what the terms were actually talking about.
3:29
Are.
All right.
And so AI is a type of technology that helps machines or computers do things that normally need a human brain to do stuff like learning solving problems, making decisions and understanding what we see or hear weird, right?
And like I said, earlier, the thing that made the release on November 30th.
3:46
So wild is that chat GPT democratized access to AI for the first time?
Because it had an interface that we could all use chat.
That was the big breakthrough, they created a massive language model, that allowed it to understand our prompts inquiries and be able to translate that into machine speak and then get the answer and then re translate it back to us and Shimon speak that is what made it so powerful because now all of us can use it.
4:12
So big picture, there are two parts to a, i that will be useful for you and us to understand.
One is the inputs, which is how we communicate with it.
S is the outputs which is how it communicates.
Bus.
All right up until recently.
It was through API calls and code that we as humans couldn't really even directly but only in directly communicate with it and then it would go back the same way.
4:33
Now, the first version of this is now it can do chat which is awesome.
The soon-to-be version will that it would be able to understand voice commands and do the exact same thing.
So the idea of the, hey, smart home, do this thing for me, make me a sandwich, right?
4:48
That is not as distant in the future, as we think, The second part of this is the outputs, which is how it communicates back with us.
So right now, chat GPT spits, out, words sentences, paragraphs articles and even entire books, it can write legal documents, it can write sales scripts, you can write video scripts.
5:06
You can write anything that we use words to communicate a great job, descriptions.
The list is literally endless.
I asked the other day to write a cold, email to a plumbing company for marketing, SEO services, and it spit it out.
And then I said, cool, make it funnier, and shorter spit out of her another version.
That's a great.
Turn it into a text message.
5:22
Did it turn Into a tweet storm did it, it's difficult to comprehend the extent of it because it's only really limited by our ability to ask the right questions, which I'll get to later because it's going to be very important terms of how you choose to use AI.
Now, that's just words as the output, but we understand other things we can interpret images, we can interpret videos and we can interpret sounds.
5:43
And the crazy thing is, is that a I can do that too.
So open, I also runs Dolly, which is an image engine generator.
And so if I said, hey Hey, give me a guy, smoking, a cigar looking over a beach, where there's a dragon now, make it in Van, Gogh painting style crazy.
6:03
Now, make me ten versions of that, currently Dolly, and Chachi petite exist separately.
Now, if you think about the nature of what a video is, right?
If you really think back in the day, it was used to be a flip book.
They would take images and they would flip the pictures and then you'd have a video because we can't tell the difference at past a certain speed, right?
6:20
And so if it can make images, Then it makes lots of images in a row, you can make videos, ah, starts become frightening, right?
But on top of that, if it has the words and it can make the video, it can also make the sounds.
So if I said, hey, make me this song in this style, it can do that.
6:37
And to right now ai is fragmented and its outputs it outputs text, and words separately from where it outputs images from where it output sound.
But in the future, in the very near future, those will merge and the same degree, the inputs being taxed or verbal will also emerge.
6:52
Merge.
And so we will be able to communicate in whatever way we want and we'll be communicating out whatever way we interpret information so it can make full videos with sound.
With the words that it knows we will love.
This is the reason Elon Musk has been such a big proponent of neurolink because he wants to take a factor further, which is rather than be limited by our ability to speak or ability to type.
7:16
You want to be limited by our ability to think.
So if you've ever read, you can read faster than you.
Can talk, right?
And so that means that you can think faster than you can speak or type because you're not limited by the digits in your hands and translating your thoughts.
And so the idea behind neural link is that it can interface with the AI faster and that also get information back faster directly through your thoughts.
7:37
Now that may sound like science fiction, but it's already here, right?
Like that stuff's there.
It's machine Generations out and for context.
If you ever had an iPhone right, many of us were alive during the first iPhone launch.
Now, we're on iPhone 14 or 15 or whatever.
It's on now each of those Our machine Generations, right?
7:54
So what we see today is our first version that we can see but chat, gp-25 Ryan GPT, 25 or chat, GPT 100 is going to be significantly more advanced and will be able to input and output on demand any of these things, the way we want them.
8:11
And right now, A lot of people are using it as like a fun tool right there, Leo, look at this neat trick that I can do.
So right now, people are using as a neat trick, they're showing their friends and they're called, look what it can do.
And the thing is that they'll ask it a little bit more complex question.
Usually related to something that they already know.
8:27
So they're like, hey, I'm a lawyer.
The de da legal question.
I've got a friend who runs an accounting firm and his accounting Specialist or horrified by the fact that it answers tax questions with 95%.
See AA, weird.
8:43
So what happens with all these people who used to do this for a living?
It can do it immediately and cheaper and better because reality is the IRS did a study on this.
They sent out one business to 20 different accountants and they asked them to file tax returns all 20 tax returns are different.
And so it's not whether it's right or not, it's just how right is it?
9:01
And so, it's right enough that it can replace a lot of work.
Now I'm going to tell you why you don't you be afraid of that in the short term.
It's actually a good thing for us and how you can use it to make more money and capture the Ernie etcetera.
But I just want to give us a baseline of what to think with a different friend of mine has a father who's a medical malpractice attorney.
9:19
And so he has been doing this for 40 years and it started with asking the AI to tell him a joke and they're laughing, and he did it image of Bob Dole as a turnip.
And it was funny etcetera, but then he asked it to write an argument for why malpractice should not be capped in terms of how much a lawyer can make on a malpractice suit, and then outlined an entire argument for why it should be It happened to be almost identical to the argument.
9:44
He had, after 40 years of experience, he didn't sleep that night.
And so we are testing these little tricks but we don't realize that he saw my friend's dad how deep its knowledge was on Law and then the tax accountant.
9:59
So how deep it was on accounting and I see how deep it is on marketing and content.
And what we don't realize is that deep on everything and believe it or not, if you are one of those experts, you shouldn't be losing sleep over it.
You should be thinking about how this is actually going to 10x the amount of money you can make.
10:15
And I'll show you exactly how to position yourself.
So you can do it a little bit.
That's why this is so important.
So let's just talk about the things that we think we can see within the next 36 months or so.
All right, so I told you there's inputs and outputs.
So the inputs are going to merge outputs are going to merge into one interface.
10:31
So that's probably the next short-term Milestone, Sam Altman.
The CEO said that his goal in the short term, was that a?
I become what he calls median.
Intelligence.
And so that would be like a high schooler who finishes, who knows?
How to read?
10:46
Write it Etc.
But doesn't need to get paid and doesn't need to sleep, right?
And so think about it, like a blank slate that you can then apply to Legal, apply to become a doctor applied to become a marketer, to apply to become a salesperson, apply to become a customer service representative, any of those skills it now is a blank slate which is the base level of knowledge to then layer on top.
11:06
New skills, trillion dollar companies are going to be based on that.
Next layer.
It's just kind of like the first Is that where the Baseline of the internet other companies on the internet Niche down into what the internet provided as a platform for the next level of opportunity.
The next important Milestone is when AI actually enters the physical world.
11:23
So you've probably seen or if you haven't Ilan revealed the Tesla bot, right?
So it looks like a humanoid type Bond.
It's got a weird face.
The thing is that, that's what it is today.
Again like the iPhone in many machines interations which happen faster than human Generations.
That will be able to look exactly like a human.
11:40
And it will definitely If you look at Boston Dynamics, there's robots that actually function better than humans that have longer arms and are much stronger in can jump, and do need to sleep, won't have sexual complaints, blah, blah, blah, right.
And so once those robots, they already exist, but once they become cost-effective, they will be able to replace a lot of the physical labor in the world.
12:00
And so, what happens is, ironically, we believed and if you asked a year ago and this is what Sam Altman said, which I think is really profound.
He said, if you had asked a year ago, many of the top Minds in AI which jobs, it would replace First.
They would have first said it's going to replace blue-collar a low skill Jobs first and then it were placed low, white collar jobs than it replaced high-skilled, white-collar jobs, like coders and programmers.
12:21
And then finally, it will maybe replace creators and creatives, but it turns out it was the exact opposite.
It replaced creators first right now and then it can already work and write its own code today and then it's going down and So, eventually replace the blue collar jobs because Robotics are more expensive etcetera and they're a little bit behind.
12:41
A cost standpoint.
The reason I think this is so important is because it shows how difficult is predict the future and how often were wrong.
And so the predictions that I'm making take with a gigantic Himalayan size grain of salt, but this is my best bad guess.
Once those machine Generations happen on Robotics, and on the AI side will reach a point where they're super intelligence.
13:03
And super intelligence is defined as where the AI itself is smarter than all humans put together.
So we go from the first goal which is that it's as smart as the Median human to it being smarter than all humans put together at that point, the world will change significantly.
13:18
This is where access to the super intelligence will become the most valuable resource on planet Earth.
And so, for example, if I were to say, hey build me a trillion dollar company, it could in real-time write the code for the product, write the scripts for the ads, generate the videos for the ads, directly interface with the media, buying place the ads, where it already knows where the targeted audience is.
13:40
Push those targeted audiences.
Eyes to landing pages that it had built with scripts and videos that it had belt and then transact all from a single prompt.
And so access to that the slices of Time, how its divvied up will be the most valuable thing.
And so who determines who gets the access will be a really important question for the future.
14:00
The second is, what will govern the types of prompts and queries that we can ask it.
So if we said, how do I wipe out the entire human race for less than a hundred thousand dollars?
We Want it really answering questions like that or we want it to be able to answer questions like that, right?
14:15
And so there's going to have to be some regulation around this because the thing is that's a lot of power.
Thirdly, if these things are true, which I believe them to be.
If the next layer of AI that happens on top can replace all of the medical diagnosis that doctors have spent Years Learning to do and it can do it better faster cheaper and it can replace all of the work that a designer can do.
14:38
By the way, I typed in, can you make me a From a private Equity Firm it said.
Sure what colors do you want?
I said these three colors.
It said great, what style would you like?
I said this style and then it's sent me a bunch and say, great.
I like this, do more of those.
Boom.
And so what used to take weeks it back and forth and probably a few thousand dollars can now happen in an instant and so all the people who have that as their profession they're at risk right?
15:02
And so what happens is tremendous value will be captured by the people who build this infrastructure, right?
And so what happens is you have this hyper capitalism and The reason that I'm confident that this will have a profound effect on capitalism.
Is that the man who wrote that code that replaces?
15:21
All doctors will basically capture the economic value of the entirety of all Physicians or the entirety of all lawyers or the entirety of all copywriters, right?
And so what do all those people do?
And so for the same reason, Sam Altman and open a, I have actually been Running.
15:41
They've already been four years into a five-year study, the largest Ubi, so Universal basic income study of all time.
And they're doing that because they already know.
And this is why I feel good that he's running because he's thinking this way.
They already know this is going to impact how money is exchanged and where wealth is aggregated.
16:02
And so, the nice thing though, is that we can also ask the AI, what it thinks a better system for reallocating wealth is while maintaining the spirit of human Ingenuity and incentive.
And so this kind of leads into the next piece here, which is, if the incremental cost of intelligence goes down by 1000x, Right.
16:27
Then we can basically have a thousand times the horsepower to solve problems.
So curing all disease solving nuclear fusion.
These are all things that will be an Arm's Reach and I believe that in the short to medium term a I will usher in a golden era for Humanity.
16:46
I think that it's actually going to be significantly more impactful than the Industrial Revolution and for context because it's hard to comprehend.
Even what 1000 is if we had a Thousand times the rate of innovation, it would be the same as having all Innovations between the Period of Enlightenment and today happen next year.
17:05
And so that gives way the last step in the AI Evolution, which is the singularity.
The Singularity is a hypothetical Future Point in which technological progress and artificial intelligence will advance to the point where Humanity will undergo a transformation Beyond which it cannot be seen.
17:23
And so, it will be such a profound transformation that predicting beyond that is.
And of trivial or meaningless and many people postulate that that's the point where it will become either self-aware and it will start to make its own decisions and ignore us, which is a possibility that it's the classic.
17:38
Well, what if it wants to kill us?
Well, it won't really want to kill us because it has no reason to for the same reason that we don't want to kill ants but if we built a highway we destroy some anthills.
So it's just going to do what it's going to do, right?
So that is one version of that reality.
This is why Ilan and same oven and those guys are trying to align our Goals of humanity with the goals of the AI.
18:00
And so we're trying to get as close to that align future as possible.
So that we have as he says play for the good one and so that's what they're trying to do and I think it's the only really productive thought process.
We can have because we can sit here and be afraid but I don't think we're going to stop the technological progress even if they banned it.
18:16
I just knowing how the internet is and knowing how black hat coders Etc.
Are I have a hard time believing that they will be able to stop it because the thing is the person who developed Oops, it will have such a significant advantage over everyone who doesn't?
This will be the equivalent of having the new nuclear bomb of the this Century or this Millennium?
18:37
And so, like I was saying earlier, the reason Elon is so big on neural.
Link is so that it increases our speed of input and our and increases, our speed of downloading the information, right?
And so we would essentially in the future become cyborgs.
Now, let me freak you out, but you can make an argument that today we're already cyborgs.
18:53
So let me explain.
So if I were to give you a test, Right, just a general test and I said, you can't use your cell phone and they're not even the same test, and you could use your cell phone.
You score significantly higher.
And so, in a very, real way you are smarter with the cell phone you are smarter with access to the internet.
19:09
And so, the only difference is that we have to interface through our fingers, right?
Rather than, if interfacing through our minds it's just we're very inefficient were much slower at it.
This would massively decrease the gap between our brains and the mind of the AI.
And so it's my belief that we should be embracing this the same way we embrace the internet Same way, we embrace the iPhone and the smartphones is that this is going to be, in my opinion, the greatest advancement in humanity in our lifetimes.
19:35
And like I said, a lot of people were talking about web three and things like that.
This, in my opinion, it's how will web three and a I work together.
It's not, whether he's bigger than aiai, underpins all of humanity.
Right?
As soon as it can do everything that as soon as it can human better than humans can then it raises a lot of questions about what it means to be human to begin with.
19:56
That's all Pie in the Sky stuff, right?
So let's just talk about today and tomorrow you're like wow that's crazy.
My mind is blown maybe it is because that's how I was when I started think about this stuff.
So let's talk about day-to-day, let's talk about business.
So we already had some economy stuff and how it's going to impact, capitalism, Etc.
20:11
But let's talk about day to day.
A most addition quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright, so send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that we Connect with tag them in one of my or laila's posts and I will give you all the love in the world.
20:31
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Now, imagine it was a sales call, and we have sales AI, That's listen to 10 million, sales calls, and listen, all the good ones and listen to bad ones.
And listen, the top 1% in top point, one percent of sales, people and saw the language patterns that they use.
20:48
Because remember, this is a large language model.
So what it does is says this is the types of things that these people say in these situations I will say the same thing and then iterates and learns over and over again in the same way.
That if you've watched any of my other content, I'm all about.
Do the boring work repeat successful actions.
It's all about volume.
21:03
It's all about repetition.
Well, the a I can live a million lifetimes in terms of the amount of volume, it can turn through and process and learn from compared to a human.
So, the best sales guy is going to have this much experience compared to the best AI sales guy.
And so, if it can have those calls 24 hours a day in real time to whatever Prospect you want, it may even imagine a world where you ask the phone teller.
21:26
Hey, are you a human?
And when they say no, I'm AI, you're relieved because you're like, thank God, I'm talking to the best version of this.
You can handle my problem right now.
Weird.
And so that's the little further out.
But if we're talking even sooner, if chat, CBT can mimic and already passed the Turing test of not knowing whether it's a human or not.
21:45
Well sales by chat is already going to happen very quickly.
Right.
On top of that let's talk about marketing to you see all these people on YouTube you see Instagram post well what if the AI reads every single Instagram post of all time and ranks them by most and highest performing and looks at the language structures of those posts and then recreates 20 or 1000 post like them, You can do it in seconds to the same degree.
22:06
If you're a content creator, if it can, look at the highest performing videos of all time, transcribe them, and then alternate or create different versions of those things.
And then merge that with video and defects, then we will have pundits and influencers that don't exist.
22:23
But will be pumping out content.
Every second on the second with 10/10 videos.
That are perfectly made for the algorithm and me to just stimulate the shit out of our dopamine centers.
And we're just going to be plugged in because it knows what we like, better than we do.
22:42
And so, the example I gave earlier with a logo designer, this has serious implications for you.
If you're a copywriter, this has serious implications for you and I'm going to talk about how you can use it to your advantage later.
Believe me, you're going to want to hear this all the way through because there is a big opportunity.
22:58
You just have to have the How it's going to affect everything.
And when I say 10 out of 10 you know I mean one out of ten for the YouTubers next paste.
Look at customer service, right.
You start with chat and then it's going to go to phone calls and they're going to have listened to the best.
Customer service reps in the world of all time and guess what?
It speaks all the languages, right right. 24 hours day in real time, immediate feedback.
23:20
This is going to happen like this is not an if question this is a when question if you're in finance it will be able to take all of the raw data and realign it and put into beautiful Excel.
Sheets that are audit ready, financials.
If you're in product, it will help you redesign your ux because it will look at the best.
23:36
Ux has user experience users not of all software products and then give you three or four templates that have high likelihood of working, right, and be able to iterate it in real time, based on user feedback from a training perspective.
And I think this is really, really big education is gonna get changed forever because now we will have ai teachers and the AI teacher can personalize our To our learning styles and so people can advance at their own speed and learn in the way that they learn best from someone who's endlessly patient and can iterate in real time for the student.
24:12
So like I said earlier, I think there's a lot of good news here in this will have huge implications for how we become more productive, which I'll talk about in a second.
That's going to be the gold.
Mine for us in the short term and you can think about this through it or any other departments legal Etc, in any Department of Business Wherever humans are used wherever language is used to communicate a, I will disrupt.
24:34
So let me tell you what the next trillion dollar companies are coming from.
So the people are going to try and rebuild the base.
AI Microsoft wrote the billion dollar check.
They have the resources to it's unlikely that you my loving fan base are gonna be able to do it mean.
All right?
I'm just saying, but there still are truly top dollar opportunities for all of us layering on top.
24:54
So think about open a.i. and chat GPT Etc.
As kind of the engine or the platform of the Burnett and then all of these companies were built on top of that base layer.
And so the AI that starts to collect more data for legal documents to help lawyers is going to be a trillion dollar business, the one that starts to figure out how to diagnose medical conditions faster better cheaper than Physicians, can trillion dollar business, the person who figures out how to model the best sales guy trillion dollar business.
25:21
And so what happens is the data flywheel which will be proprietary to the company, is that the people who can gather all of the data of all of the sales calls, and Then feed them into their Ai and then get all of their customers to have the real phone calls with their.
A, I will have a consistent and sustained competitive Advantage, because they will always have more information than the guy who starts later than them, right?
25:42
And so the idea is, you want to start that data fly was fast as you can, so that you can build that mode.
That makes your sales AI Bots, better than anyone elses.
And that is where huge amounts of economic value going to be created in the short to medium term as an aside here.
25:59
And I think it's an important one.
There are many content creators.
There are many celebrities.
Imagine you could create the perfect celebrity, or the perfect spokesperson, or the perfect porn star.
And with deep fakes, they can work 24 hours a day, say exactly what you want.
26:15
And what they say has the perfect tone and has been designed to just trigger all human emotions.
And so I'm going to predict that we're going to have representative super ultra, right?
Conservative pundits that don't even exist.
Exist.
But look and sound like the most controversial attention-grabbing people in the real world, but they won't be real.
26:38
And if this, if you don't believe me go to this person does not exist.com and just keep refreshing it and it will show you new people.
Now, if you remember earlier a video is made of multiple images put together back to back to back.
If it can make an image of a real person, it can make many images of real people.
26:54
If they can make many images of real people, it can make a video of a real person and then we'll have questions of Ian did President Biden, say that did President Trump say that or is it a deep fake?
The blue checkmark will take on an entirely new meaning in the very near future.
27:10
And so like I was saying, if you are an only fans Creator or your YouTube Creator and you have to create these elaborate sets to create these insane videos.
If reality can be generated or manufactured through the AI that competitive mode shrinks because it will be able to crank out a video a second A hundred videos as that are perfectly designed and then it will be able to learn in real time based on the viewership of everyone who sees their stuff into the same degree.
27:38
They'll be able to make the thumbnails and the headlines.
And the first image to get the highest click-through rates, this stuff's going to happen.
And don't worry, I'm going to tell you how you can prepare for it.
And what I think the short-term opportunities for all of us are no, those are just a few few use cases, but anywhere humans are it will disrupt but let's talk about a very different topic romance in your life.
27:59
Like, Whoa, We went from economy to Universal basic income to only fans was going on.
Let's talk about romance.
This is where my opinion gets a little bit scary and the reality is that there are many people who are suboptimal meets, what I mean by that, is the bottom tier of society as you define it by status.
28:17
Whatever you want to have a harder time, getting mates girls or guys, all right, it's harder.
If you have less to offer, you have less social skills, Etc.
Imagine remember, if we've studied a million conversations for sales or million conversations for personal assistant, be pretty good at that job.
28:36
Well what if you studied a million Tinder conversations to get the first date?
Well they'll be tools, probably called first date AI.
That can say, I from first convo, the opening message all the way to the did getting set because there's not that many iterations in that tiny sphere.
28:54
Interesting, take a step.
Further, many people have heard of Bells, right?
People who are wrote letters to each other back and forth, back and forth, back and forth for a years and they fell in love and mazing relationship.
Well, if it passed the Turing, test meaning, we can't tell if it's human or not like you can think about it as a tool that one person would use against another person in order to attract them.
29:13
What if you remove the person altogether?
It's just a company that provides you with romance.
If you don't have many Alternatives, it starts to become more attractive.
So let's take it a step further.
Now we have the phone version of this and you can hear a voice that has been tuned to your preferences of exact type of voice that you want to hear that talks to you and listens to you, like the kind heart that they only don't care that you talk too much and you only talk about yourself, right?
29:38
And when you see these weird things, they just let it go.
And all of a sudden you fall in love with a robot because we think we're more complicated than they are.
But we really just have inputs that our brain interprets from electrical signal and then assigns meaning to and once, you know, the inputs, It's you just hit the buttons and that's what it will learn how to do.
29:55
Take a step further, I told you about do fakes and a real person.
Look in the other side of Zoom.
Also, now saying the same thing, now we fall in love with robots, take it a step further, the Tesla bot five generations, ten Generations from now looks like a human and now has that in the brain what happens when the robot humans are more attractive More loving, more, caring, more considerate, and cheaper than a spouse.
30:25
I know you're probably a little freaked out about this romance, robot thing and I get it and before I explain how you can maximally use this to make the most money and live the best life in the short term based on the skills that we have today.
Indulge me for one more moment because I think it's really profound and I think it's going to change the way you see the world.
30:43
So let's talk about aliens, Joe Rogan and many people have talked about alien technology and like what if there was a UFO that was captured, all that kind of stuff.
So let's put a pin in that.
Play this out with me when humans want to explore the universe.
31:00
What do we send?
First, we send Mars Rover, we send a robot, right?
Right now.
If aliens are further ahead of us than it means that they probably have a.
I and if they're going to send something, they would probably send a robot.
31:16
Why?
Because a robot doesn't need to eat, it can live for a very long time, and it can survive in harsher, different climates than biology can.
On top of that, it can work on itself.
Biology cannot.
Hmm, at least with our car technology.
And so, if you take the concept of Robotics and you take the concept of AI and you merge them, it starts to leave a very different impression of what aliens might do.
31:40
So aliens might might be here but not necessarily in their physical form but in their AI form because if we can create robots that perfectly clone humans.
So can they and that may be who they sent or what they said to check out what we're doing, if ra I can mimic us, And so can there's interesting.
31:59
And so a further thought on this is that a I would be the perfect thing to send to another planet.
Because up to this point, when we send something, it takes 5 years for it to reach whatever Planet it's on, right?
And so by the time it's there, it's really old technology.
But a I can work on itself and it consistently can improve itself.
32:15
And so if we have a I hear and we clone the eye and then it continues to work on itself throughout the entire Transit, it would be at the same level as the AI here or at least significantly less.
Bad then if it were completely stagnant and so, it makes sense that you'd want to send something that is completely adaptable and can rewrite its own code and can probably physically work on our robot, that would be perfectly suited for our environment.
32:39
And so I think, for that reason, space exploration may be done by AI more than it is done by humans.
Because this stuff, our flesh, we're super easy to kill, right?
But the AI can live super cold superhot, no oxygen, lots of oxygen is good.
32:55
And once we saw a fusion, With it.
It won't even need the sun.
Which leads to one question about life itself which is if we Define death as the inability to receive inputs, right?
So like when you die, you can't receive inputs anymore.
And we defined personality as all of the SC conglomerate of our actions and behaviors as a result of our past experiences.
33:16
Then if I were to upload my thoughts and behaviors and past experiences how I talk I speak, I think etcetera into a cloud drive and then it were able to pass.
Pass the Turing test.
Where everybody, I know couldn't tell whether it was me or robot version of me then, is it me?
33:33
Well, you change all the time because who you are now versus you are ten years ago.
You got exposed to new stimuli and you adapt it.
And so in a moment, you'd be the same only at the day that you got cloned.
And then from that point going forward, you would separate out.
But if you had an old body and then old biological Alex dies, and new robot, Alex lives on and that new robot Alex can continue to take inputs and as far as everyone else is concerned.
33:57
It was no different than I was.
Did I really die?
And if that thing can now, go travel planets.
Is it humans that are traveling to planets?
Or is it an AI?
Cyborg version of humans I don't know, interesting questions and you're like okay, Alex you took me to romance robot wives and an aliens on Earth.
34:18
How do I make more money today, the part you've all been waiting for?
How do we use AI to increase our output and make more money today?
All right, so the The first thing that I would ask is that you adopt the mentality that AI isn't here to replace me.
It's here to supercharge me.
Why do I say that?
34:34
Because if you adopt the other one you might as well just throw in the towel now.
Okay?
Here's why this is important.
If you don't, you'll be like those Boomers who don't want to use an iPhone or the internet.
All right.
Think of it, the same way you have to embrace change its part of humanity.
Technology moves, we got to adapt.
34:50
All right, now you can 10x or even 100 extra output, which is hard for people to Fathom.
But some People make ten hundred million times more than others.
So even though it's hard to Fathom, it doesn't mean it's not true, okay?
And so I was saying earlier that there's an opportunity for basic level and then advanced level someone talked about basic level first.
35:10
So I said, inputs and outputs in a system, right?
If a, I can condense our inputs.
So if I say, hey, go read this book, distill it down and then give it to me.
I cannot read a book significantly faster if I say, hey, I go summarize all my email on my sock messages and just tell me the few that I need to respond to and predict what I'm going to say.
35:31
And then all I need to do is validate it.
I can do a day's worth of work in a few minutes that maybe more than a 10x increase in output.
I think if chat GPT and AI of the future as a filter through, which we will perceive the world, both In and out.
And so think of it as your home screen and so you read everything through AI because it is already distilled it down to the most important nuggets for you.
35:51
So you cut out, tremendous waste of time and energy sifting through it, does that for you and then in the output side of you communicating back to people, it makes predictions on what you would say.
Normally and it continues to get training a better.
And you can also expand on.
36:06
So if I say, hey, write a memo for the company about how I'm excited for the future, how would a great sales week and how marketing is killing it?
It pumps it out and then it sends it.
And so in that way we can maybe consume 10 times the information and produce 10 times, the output, which is 100x increase.
36:26
So that's level one.
That's just you day-to-day, you're reading through Ai and you're writing through AI.
You're speaking through AI, you're listening through AI, that make sense, okay?
The next level is the expert level and these are the people who are losing sleep over being like, Oh my God, I suck, right?
36:44
Right.
Like this thing.
Can now do my job that took me 40 years of legal training to learn how to do and it can do it better, or I'm a coder and it can cope better than me or I'm gonna count and it can do it.
Taxes better than whatever it is.
All right, here's the thing.
So let me give you an example if I wanted to write an app.
37:02
Now A buddy of mine is a coder and he said that he made a product just using AI it wrote all the code.
He said I wanted to probably do this this and this and it was a simple product, simple little app he's it all using AI freaky but guess what?
I can't do that.
37:17
You know why?
Cause I don't know how to code.
You're like, oh no it'd be fine because the a I could yeah but I don't know how to read codes.
I don't know if it's Or not.
And so this is the opportunity for experts.
If you're an expert what used to take you 90% your time which is generating things, and then 10% was validating.
37:34
What you had generated or quality assurance QA you now expand most of your time to using the machine to generate and then you spend your time doing Q&A and validating the information making tweaks.
And so it happens there is that's how you can 10 extra output and so in a very real way, using these tools just like the internet and iPhone, you become more valuable to the company.
37:55
He's that you work for or the clients that you serve.
In the short term, there will be people who will start jerry-rigging, prompt chains, or query chains.
And so, what that means is, like, when I said earlier, okay, give me 10 grade.
Book ideas gives me time.
Great book, ideas.
I say cool.
I like this one.
Probably 10 titles, they think are good rice.
38:12
We 10 titles, okay, I like this title, right?
Me the outline for this book and I want it to be 20 chapters writes me, the 20 chapter headlines.
Okay, cool.
Take the chapter outline and I beef out each of the chapters and then boom, I pacing document I have a book, right?
That would be a four-step query chain.
38:28
Right prediction, I think people will start selling query chains and I think people will start trying to build businesses off a career change or teaching other people just have query chains, but I think that's a very narrow window.
I think very quickly.
They eyes going to figure out what the query chains are and then start to predict what people are going to want in total, rather than just the the minuscule piece.
38:46
And so, I think it's going to diminish in value quickly, but I think that's something that's going to happen.
I do think in the short term, it's worth learning how to ask questions better because a smart coder will be able to ask a better question of the AI than a dumb coder.
Write a really good tax person or a really good account in or really good.
39:03
Attorney can ask better questions the AI.
So in a very real way, the quality of your questions will dictate the quality of the output.
Good inputs good happens, right?
And so embracing the technology using it as your filter for inputs and outputs for everything that you do will train you on how to use a better, but also put you in a position so that you can massively out-compete.
39:22
The people who are afraid And it's a fun Side bar right now.
When you ask the AI to do certain things, it will not be able to do it.
And the question is whether it can't do it or it has been purposely limited by opening my first off, its not even connect to the internet.
39:40
I think they've done that as a safety measure s.
They've put it a 4000 token limit on the output so can only be so long in the response.
That's what we have to do, all these query chains, but depending on how much they're limiting it versus how much it is actually Limited.
I think it's going to be the most profound answer that we will need over the next 12 to 18 months to see how quickly the future is going to get dragged into the present.
40:03
And so I think AI is gonna be the revolution of our lifetimes.
I think it's going to usher in a golden age at least for the short term for Humanity.
I think it has the possibility to cure all diseases or help us grow on diseases.
I think as the possibility of helping us achieve Fusion so that we can basically eliminate the cost of energy, I think it will decrease the cost of marginal. 1000 x and here's what's crazy.
40:26
If you in today's dollars, spend a thousand times more on something that costs 1000 the price, then you get a million times the output and that's where things start to get weird.
And that's why it's very difficult to predict, like I said, a year ago, people thought Blue, Collar jobs are going first and they were wrong.








0:00
Business has only gotten easier to get into some more competitive and easier to get it too.
And so I think that what happens is just the arena gets bigger so you got more Gladiators so it's more competitive.
But more people can walk in the wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
0:15
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
You said you want to be a billionaire five to seven years.
0:31
So yeah.
See the math playing out that way.
Yeah.
Let's say you were forced to do it and have the time.
Yeah, three years.
You were forced to be a billionaire.
Yeah.
Or some catastrophic event would happen.
Yeah.
What would it take from you?
To reach the billion dollar goal and half the time?
0:48
What would you need to do differently?
And how would you need to think and act differently?
I would probably on board more operators.
Faster, that being said, the current plan gets us They're like three years.
I say five to seven publicly because I want to give myself a little buffer.
I tend to be that looks like I have probably a little bit different approach with goals like I want to hit every goal.
1:08
Like I don't like missing goals.
And so for me, I don't like teaching myself or teaching other people that if I say something is going to happen, it doesn't happen because some people like shoot for the moon think really.
I think you absolutely should think really big but then like okay how do I make a goal that like and then and then once I have that goal, do the activities that make it, unreasonable not to hit.
1:28
Like, if I had hit this goal to your point, what level of activity, what I have to do, that would be unreasonable.
It would be unacceptable based on how I see reality that I would not achieve it.
If you're like, I want to learn sales.
I was eight son B, unreasonable that.
If you get on 10,000 sales calls, you will not be good at sales, be unreasonable.
1:44
Okay, how long will it take to go, 10,000 cells right plots on?
Yeah, couple years?
Yeah, right.
Couple of years, you could do it.
Okay, so then that's a goal.
You don't mean like I can set that if I do the activities would be unreasonable that I'm not now.
Realistically, probably get there in half the time.
Right.
Because probably pretty good at sales even after first to 3,000 calls right.
2:01
You probably have pretty good.
And so, I mean what we're doing now is the only thing I probably do is take on bigger companies, that would be the shortest path but I feel I feel confidently like in terms of how much we're stretching.
I feel good about it, like it would take.
2:17
I feel like I'd be taking on more risk to hit that.
That makes sense.
If you had to do it and half the time, with less risk with lesser, what would you need us?
A good question.
What would need to happen?
We need to shift inside of you.
Yeah, I would need more people faster.
2:33
I mean it would just be out how many people would, you know, we spend more aggressively on Talent acquisition.
So I would basically go into like from the debt perspective, right?
So rather than think of the businesses counter like the portfolio companies as cash flowing towards me, I would probably take all of the XS that is there and plowed into Talent earlier.
2:50
So, right now, I live on a certain amount of cash flow Etc.
From, you know, just from the portfolio companies and I probably have gotten accustomed to that.
It's I don't like cutting below that.
So if I had to then I would say all of that money rather than going to Alex is going to go into mortality bigger faster.
Yeah, exactly.
3:05
And then they would amplify and then they would be able to, we would increase our rate, you would have less money in the short term over the couple of years.
But then you'd have way more money in the long term totally.
So it's a comfort level.
Yeah it is, it is not as weird about you knowing that you like to have a set amount of cash flow every month, but you've got a bunch of cash in the bank.
3:23
To, I know it's totally.
It's a, it's a hundred illogical.
If you had to do it, then let's say you have to do it.
Two and a half years.
They've had you tomorrow, you know, because we need time to.
Yeah, you know, that fire fighters 70, they do it two and a half and you had to stretch and get extremely uncomfortable, where you're not going broke, just got money.
3:42
How many people would you need to hire the and how much less cash flow?
Would you need to have?
I mean, over the limited by cash flow.
All your cash.
Yeah, me first.
If I was really going, I mean I was going ham on it.
I would just I would have no cash flow to me, I mean I don't need you have money.
That's right.
Yeah.
So to eliminate all the cash flow to me and it would 100% of the money would go into the team.
4:02
The only thing that will go faster than that is that I drain my own net worth to further fund /.
Yeah, exactly.
Go your I'd be incurring financial debt to More quickly, build the Enterprise value of the asset.
So I be transferring money into the asset fastest like you incur different types of.
4:21
Like, if you incur no debt.
When you start a business, you do always encourage that you incur management, debt incur technical debt, I'm dead 100%.
And so people like all businesses start with that, it's just depends on what type of debt you're dealing with, right?
And so if you don't have money, then that's fine.
You just incur other debt.
Like, even we think about how we built, how we're building the whole code right now.
4:37
Doc was not calm.
Like I am building more fixed cost in the infrastructure.
Right now because of what I want it to be in a year or two years and so if I wanted to run it's like we already to reinvest obviously a big percentage but I would just reinvest more into any okay with it.
4:53
Yeah, and I just I've just grown accustomed.
This it was funny because a buddy of mine had dinner with last night so I was coming for 250 million dollars.
We're talking about how cash flow is a very regular reinforced or from a, from a behavioral standpoint like, you get this feedback directly every month of how you're doing, right?
5:11
And so, So you as entrepreneurs are, at least for me, I've been always a cat High cash Lauren or like, I'm never been like a reinvest every dollar into the business.
I like making money from my businesses, but I've that has become a trait that I have learned to look at as my barometer every month.
Like, how am I doing?
5:26
How am I doing, how am I doing?
And so it would have to the question of like what would have to change in me?
I would have to change how I measure success and then I have to reinforce the behavior in a different way I have to measure it differently, right?
And so is the cash flow coming from all the businesses you guys are in.
5:42
Partnership with you.
Get a percentage of cash flow, they get a percentage, the business owner, as well as you have a certain amount of cash flow every month.
It's coming in from all these businesses, right?
But you also have a ton of money in the bank.
Yeah, so one of them, you could, yeah, I could take some money out somewhere.
5:57
You can still keep the cash flow coming and take the money from the same show security driven.
It's funny because I was having this conversation with this guy and so the guy stole his coming for 250 million dollars for last 10 years.
He's lived on 70,000 a year.
Seventy thousand years.
So he was staying at the Marriott and I was staying at a nicer hotel and I was like dude we got money now.
6:15
Yeah you got money now.
He's like I know I think but I just it's not funny.
I'd for you Lord for years.
I would sit middle seat, you know, back of the airplane cheapest.
Flights for years, even when I had seven figures, and if you're coming in, but because I was so used to, I was like, I don't want to lose my mind, you know, as I want to make sure that I can live like this.
6:38
I was still sleeping up, friends couches, when I travel to events was like any way to save money and it's not until the last couple years was like, okay, my back hurts.
I need to, like, have somebody like, we're right on big guy.
But for years, I was just like, how do I save and use that money to reinvest in going to the event?
6:55
Yeah, buying the ticket to the conference and investing in coaching that will accelerate the revenue long-term.
Yeah, it's so funny.
You say that because I think in this, this is we just off the cuff here.
But many of the people that I know who have Tremendous amounts of money have huge fears around being poor and so, it's just an interesting thought.
7:15
Like a lot of people who don't have money, see people who have money as thinking differently, and they might in that they are more uncomfortable being poor than you are.
Like, it is more painful for them than it is for you.
It might be, I'm just being really, we might be why some of them are stingy to, with, on money or somehow president spends five dollars.
7:32
I'm going to keep it, you know, they're very stingy with all of it.
Two nights ago, I was, we were out to dinner with a guy who just got valued at a billion.
And right, and it's all cash flow.
It's not one of these software things like it's off.
Like, he's getting.
Yeah.
Like he's making real money, crazy money.
And he's like, I'm not going to that gym.
He's like 484 Equinox.
7:49
I'm not paying $200 a month for a gym membership.
It's a different perspective.
Now, I'm not saying I'm that way, you know what I mean?
Like, I'm okay spending on.
Remember, she is fine for me, but like everyone has their own things and like there are these behaviors like he got the other guy here.
8:04
The 250.
He got to that point because you squeezed everything out of his business which made the business of I born, he was able to sell it, but like the billion-dollar guy was saying is like, you know what, they don't tell you about when you sell your business because he's sitting next to the guy with the 250, right?
He's like the mummy.
You sell your business.
He's like you have no cash flow and so he felt that too is like what are you gonna do?
8:21
Is like you can take the money then when you're trying to buy more cash flow because you got to replace the cash me out with the business because real estate assets going to use something else.
He's like, I'll just keep it and so he doesn't have any intention of selling.
And so it was an interesting lesson for me, too, because like, we obviously got rid of our cash flow.
So when we sold all three last year, when you got a lot more money, but you don't have the money cash coming in because then it looks Like this, to put this finite asset, the business goes on forever, in your mind, at least Ryan.
8:42
So gives you the illusion of control.
This illusion of security and me personally, most people wouldn't believe this might hear it, but like I'm very risk-averse and so I probably need like what's the core changes that I need to have.
I probably need to be a little bit more of a risk-taker that I am.
Like I tend to always take the lowest risk path when I can even even the idea of like.
9:04
When I quit entrepreneurship course, I want to quit my job to start entrepreneurship.
It was because I knew that the path that On was guaranteed, not to get me where I want.
So I had 20 outcome.
So this one even though it was lower like I had a low chance of success, the other one at 100% failure guarantee.
9:21
So it felt like the lower risk option for my long-term goals to quit, my job, and become an entrepreneur for that reason.
It's and so, you know, people are like, I'm really risk-averse my so am I like, I hoard money, like, I'm I do.
You must be the money from the exits?
No, it's not just sitting in the bank.
9:36
Yeah, we started working the next day.
Even take it.
We didn't take a day off.
Yeah.
We literally sold why our head?
And we started working out, because there's not come the next day, let's say you had to start putting that cash flow every month into other things, team resources, whatever it is, and that wasn't coming in and, you know, maybe let's call it 100 Grand a month, was coming in cash flow.
9:56
I know how much it is but this a that is going into hiring team and other things to support you getting to the billion in two and a half years.
What would need to shift in inside of you after three months of feeling?
No cash.
Come in to stack, your bank account in order for you to be okay with it to get to that billion quicker.
10:15
I would just have to be more secure, just realistically like I use, what does that mean?
Is that an eternal I use cash flow from businesses as evidence to the fact that I'm not a failure?
And so I use I've always liked it.
It has been easier for me to change my conditions then to change who I am.
10:33
And so I have used my material success and accolades to quiet the voices of Not being good enough.
And so for that like me having that, what if I had that little voice that keeps up it's like, hey, look at that.
I'm like, okay, no.
No I'm I'm okay.
I'm not, I'm not that, that's money.
You just came in everything.
10:50
And so I have to I'd really have to re-engineer the conversation.
I have with myself around how I value myself because then people are like, well if you know if everything disappeared, you know, how do you feel about yourself?
I like to think that I would be uncomfortable and then I would change my views but I haven't needed to do that yet and so my effort goes elsewhere but that's what probably would have to And in order for me to make that change, is it a?
11:11
What is the thing that is, you're afraid of inside of yourself?
Is it a self-worth thing?
Is it a self-love thing?
Is it a belief that you're not good enough or it may be a good enough thing for sure?
Yeah, it's just like, maybe not as good as I think I am, maybe, maybe everything that I've been putting on media, maybe my book, maybe all these things are actually not true and I don't know what I'm talking about, right?
11:29
Because clearly I don't know what I'm talking about because I'm not making any money.
Like so these things have been that's why I was not calm.
Is the other half like the Actual businesses of acquisition.com compared to the media acquisition.com.
It is the other half because it's the evidence of the fact that the things that I say are true because those are getting results hundred percent are growing.
11:49
Right.
And so that way, I feel bulletproof when I make when I make the content, when I make the book, when I write the stuff like, you know, there's a zillion people who are like you suck that, this is true, whatever.
And for me, it rolls off my back because I have evidence, right?
And like, no, no it is true.
12:05
And here's how but if I didn't have that, I would probably have to It's because I don't know what the right call is there because I didn't have the evidence, it would be hard for me to say you're wrong because I don't have any proof that they're wrong which is evidence now.
Right?
And so I have this evidence is how do you change the belief inside that you're good enough with the years of evidence?
12:22
Now, the question is like, I have I built a billion-dollar thing yet, you know what I mean?
And so that we 10 billion, but, of course, no.
But like, it's a fun.
It's a, it's a fun Convoy and it's great because I, it's this was wonderful because I get to see my Your limiting beliefs and just very resistant.
12:40
Like everyone deals with this?
You don't I mean like at every at every level you're dealing with this, if like feeling of inadequacy, you know, feeling not good enough feeling you're not smart feeling like you don't work hard, whatever it is like I have that stuff all the time because you think that the external circumstances going to is going to solve that and I would say that it does to a degree.
12:58
It becomes a crutch, right?
But then you have this crutch and then you just tie your self-worth, the to the ACT, later the thing, rather than still yourself, and maybe I need to do more work on that, who knows?
If you could overcome one thing, Eliminate one thing internally to become a better leader to yourself to quiet.
13:14
The noise, or help you take a risk and a different way and not talking about lose all your money but take the risk to help you accelerate this.
Yeah.
And you don't have to find a way but I just believe that your it's possible for you to do that.
Yeah, I believe you can be a billionaire in two and a half years.
I appreciate if used to go, if you shift, whatever inside of you is holding you back to get to that space.
13:35
What would be that one thing to eliminate our overcome internally?
Lee to make it happen, it's need for external, validation, 100% the need for external, validation on the question.
Why do you need external validation?
I mean, I think part of it is so ingrained in us, if you think about us as kids, right?
13:51
Like, how do you, how do you Orient yourself with the world?
You get reinforced or punished at all at all phases, directly indirectly.
But you get reinforced or punished in the things you get reinforced, you do more of the things you get, punished, you are so right?
Like, that's just how how, we, how we learned behavior, how we learn to function in society, Right?
Touch that thing.
Ah, it hurts.
14:07
It's we got punished.
You know, you your parent tells you to sit down and be quiet and eat and you learn to sit down and shut up and eat.
And then we wonder why adults?
Don't move.
Because we're told to sit when we running around, right?
We learn School, sit down and be quiet.
14:23
And we, and we wonder why we eat so much won the reward for everything we did when we were kids was food, right?
We wonder these things.
So, the reason external validation is so hard, at least for me is because it's how I learned everything is because external validation gave, you know, gave me the directions No, guidance of what's good, and what's not and then as you get older it's where am I going to get that validation from?
14:43
And so, I would say that my external validation the still 100% there, it just comes from different sources.
So I'm more selective on Whose validation I want.
So how much external validation do you need in order to overcome this belief, to go all in and do it and have the to do.
I think I just I need to be able to validate myself and that's fundamentally anything.
15:02
Having tea to said this, he said, like if you need someone else's if you need, he has this quote, it's so good.
It's basically like you need to be able to give, you don't need to swear to somebody else.
You should be able to spoil your swear to yourself, and bear, witness to yourself because your word should be good enough.
15:19
So you need a limb innate external validation, right?
If I'm you feeling good enough probably yeah, it's just it's probably that like, obviously need it's good to have feedback in life, Peter Damian.
So I think that's why it's also difficult for some in general because it's not eliminate or have more of its to what degree and from home and about what And so then it gets a little bit more complex, but even using those different lenses, I think it's good to unpack it for anyone who's listening, which is like, okay, Leila said this.
15:46
So this is not mine but most times when we're afraid of something, it's not actually like this amorphous crowd.
That were afraid of it's like one or two peoples have opinion.
Like it's your dad or it's your whatever it is, right.
And you're worried about, they're going to think and they're not even thinking about you, but you think they're thinking about their thinking about their dad, whatever it is, right?
16:07
And so, She released a this earlier, on, to Mike, like, when we were together five years ago she was like, are you gonna cheat like, made me name the person that wasn't my dad or somebody else for this particular thing.
She's like, are you going to let this guy stop us from getting what we want?
Wow, and it was like when I saw it it was like looking in front of me.
16:23
I was like she's like what if this guy hates you and thinks you're terrible?
Is that a worthy enough reason to still keep going and I was like yeah, just like them.
Let's go.
You know what I mean?
And so she's very good with that.
What do you need to say to yourself everyday?
To believe?
You're good enough.
You could say, One thing to you, that no one else needed to hear but you needed to hear it from you.
16:42
What would that be?
I don't know if it would be a saying thing.
I think it'd be like an affirmation.
I think it's just a belief your debate with the belief.
Be yeah, yeah, I mean fundamentally the believer just have to shift that the doing this is enough.
Validation for me, not the results, right?
16:57
And that's all.
I mean, fun of me, that's always the goal.
Is that you can you can detach the doing this from the result.
I think what I've been able to do has been to extend the time Horizon between the doing is in the result, but not necessarily fully eliminated.
I'm patient in certain that I can continue to do things for very long periods of time before seeing a payoff.
17:13
But if I were able to truly eliminate it I think that would be kind of like a Next Step.
Then again this that borderline on Insanity because you never get feedback on sometimes.
You're like maybe I should change direction to it, you'll keep getting feedback.
This is you're creating you're taking action B.
You know, the more you do that you'll have more businesses, you'll be acquiring, you'll be creating more content and everything will be growing at the same time.
17:31
Yeah, right.
But a a I love seeing you, you know, go through this process internally because I think I'm open to it.
It, I just want to win, you know?
I mean, like I should read better.
What does winning look like?
It's achieving the potential, it's taking all this raw potential the line in the Bible that always scared me.
17:47
The most was to whom much is, given much is expected.
And so for me, I always felt like I was given a lot here and I mean, like, I was born in America right off the bat.
It's born as a guy, I have insane genetics.
Like from that perspective, a six-pack, when I was 15.
18:02
My name is I've a pretty high processing load like Usually I do okay with complex problems.
I was bilingual at basically at Birth because Paris, our community language.
So they gave me good, language abilities and so it's like these are, these are all things that were given me, right?
18:20
And and, and I was born into, like, a deep, you know, from a, from a money standpoint, a decently wealthy family, right?
Not, you know, Ultra belly but, like, never worried about food or shelter, anything like that, right?
And so, these are all the things that were given to me.
And so it's me and like, men, much as expected, right?
18:35
And that's certainly, that's, you know, God, whatever just I expect a lot of myself because I see so much potential by the time I die.
I would like to have nothing left in my potential tank and it just all have been transformed into into my reality.
Yeah.
So that's what winning looks like.
18:51
What do you like missing in your life?
Not a lot.
I'm just like, really real felt like I really like I'm a right now, I'm super pumped.
I love what we're doing.
I love the businesses that were helping.
I love the mission.
I like doing this and not a lot.
19:07
I mean, if I got into things that we're missing, it would be like super tacks.
Go if like I want I want these roles are ones that I want filled and the company like hippie stuff like that.
It wouldn't be anything else, right?
Most addition real quick, if you are a business owner that has a big old business.
19:24
And wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
So what do you look for, when you're you're acquiring a business or investing in a business that has cash flow and what businesses have the best cash flow.
19:48
So this will be relevant for everybody in the audience and also hits on what we were talking about with the well thing, like wealthy people, choose higher, leverage opportunities and we went over.
What leverage was earlier the best businesses, especially in an inflationary period are businesses that have low Capital expenses, okay?
And that's because any other examples.
20:04
Yeah.
So I'll give you opposite examples to make and then I'll drive it.
So the something that does have high Capital expense As what you would not want to get into would be like stuff that has lots of inventory.
Stuff has lots of supply chain, lots of manufacturing, heavy equipment things where you have to constantly buy more stuff in order to increase capacity, right?
20:22
A low Capital expense business are things like Services, right Services.
You know, digital businesses software is mixed because sometimes the development team can be considered expensive.
Really depends on how you build the dev team.
But the idea is that if you can produce 10 times more units without phenomenally, Using the cost basis, then you will have a business that has lower Capital.
20:46
Yes.
And so that's what you like.
And most of those types of businesses, produce more cash flow, have more pricing power, and so, I mean, that's what Warren Buffett, investor rights, hi Kat, you know, like insurance.
Geico right?
There's no cap like it's risk.
They're literally assessing risk are it's math.
21:03
Like the business is math.
Thank you.
Really think it's just math, is the entire business of insurance and was crazy.
It just a side note is that A great way of figuring out the highest leverage.
Businesses that exist is looking at the business of been here.
The longest insurance has been here since before World the world wars.
21:19
Right, thanks have been around forever, right?
JP Morgan was the 1800s, right?
The the in the biggest insurance companies they're all 100-plus years old, they're found in the 1800s and so when you have a business that's lasted that long to me, that's a great bread.
Crumb of like this thing has to print money because it means that they were able to still keep making money through Wars through famous too.
21:40
Questions, all of it, and they were still able to keep going.
And so, I think that when people are like, when you look at all the like, many of the biggest businesses that exist, they have phenomenal gross margins.
I do want to get to like, you know, business term here.
But like the gross margin is, how much incremental cost.
21:56
It is to make a new an extra widget, right?
And so like a pill, for example, cost a hundred million dollars to make the first pill and then every poll after that cost a penny, all right?
Sure.
And so, the gross margin lapel is very high because if they sell each pill for $10, Is the cost them a penny.
That was a great margins.
22:12
And most people who are small business owners or people are trying to get into small business price, like small business owners, they say, Well, it cost me a dollar, I'll sell it for three.
I'll sell it for two, but if you're already starting on like a 50% gross margin, it's very, very hard to make money because thing about like that's at 100 yard at half and then you have the rest of everyone else.
22:29
You have to pay off that extra fish is very hard to do and so like I'll give a couple rules of thumb if anyone wants this.
But like, if you're, if you're building a service-based business for us, by all means, I have to get Gross margins about 80% which means five times the cost of goods.
So that cost me $100 a month.
22:45
The minimum I'll charge 500, right?
And so that also gets you to think about business differently, which is not necessarily even how much can I charge, but how can I provide value and make it cost as little to me?
How can I be as efficient as possible?
And if you think about what technology does over time, its technology takes something that's valuable and makes the cost of delivering it less.
23:04
And so that's what happens is.
A lot of people are able to have access to things that were once only for the wealthy.
But now become for the common man because the cost basis decreases as a result of technology and so technology is we see it you know, like we can create technology but you can also have technological breakthroughs just through process in your own business.
23:21
It's like and that's where niching down and being very specific about the Avatar becomes important, especially when you're starting because then you can products has the service.
Because if you're doing everything custom, which most people in their starting out, do it becomes really difficult become efficient and it's really difficult to officiate very little margin, right?
Or you have to charge huge fees which most people are too afraid to do.
23:39
And so the That is, if I do the same thing over and over and over again, I will get better and more efficient at it and I'll know how to do it faster and quicker and cheaper.
And I specifically choose this type of customer so that I can have more margin because there are millions of even this one specific type of Avatar.
23:56
And then from there, I can take the gross margin that extra cash that I have and I can hire the best people I can invest in marketing.
But when you have such little margin to work off of, it's very difficult to make money.
Yeah, so hard to grow.
That's interesting.
What do you think?
It's going to be harder or easier?
To become wealthy and start businesses over the next few years.
24:13
With everything that's happened in the last couple of years and we're this whole great.
You know, 2030 agenda is coming and all these different things are happening, the war and all the, you know, there might be another pandemic.
Whatever might be, do you think it's gonna be easier or harder uremic to make money?
I think technology in general makes things easier for most people.
24:30
I mean, because at the end of the day it's just it's it's increased access from more people.
Yeah.
And so I think to reach more people.
Yeah, at any moment.
Yeah.
If I were just to use history as I'd business has only gotten easier to get into, it's got more competitive and easier to get into.
24:46
And so I think that what happens is just the arena gets bigger, so you got more Gladiators so it's more competitive but more people can walk in.
And so, I think, but it, but for the world in general, the more people you have fighting to make amazing products and services, the better it is for society.
25:01
Yeah, but Downstream effect of that, is that in a capitalist system, it is a winner-take-all foremost for many, not all, but for many mrs.
And just by the nature of at that does create social disarray, and it's just, but the thing is, is like it's still the best system that we have.
25:17
We don't have a perfect system because the other other systems remove incentive and he might have driven by incentive.
Yeah even the survivorship bias like every MLM in the world exists off the fact that there's that one guy who makes driving a thousand dollars a month selling shake mix and the other five million shake mix producers do like someday that get there yet.
25:33
It's just survivorship bias, right?
But that's why the whole capitalist machine works.
So I think they're like figuring out some sort of a You know, creative way.
Like I put this in my, my YouTube channel but like the idea of having 100% death tax.
I thought was like, take down like the income taxes on all the stuff, but like the thing that creates the conglomerate at the top, is that if let's say, let's say I have 100 billion dollars, right?
25:59
That's interesting.
And if I'm hundred billion, I'm probably pretty good at managing it because that's why I have 100 billion.
So let's say again, 15 show holding it, you're using it.
Yeah, let's see.
I mean, 15% on my assets, so in 15 billion dollars right on my assets.
It is so hard for anyone to up to make that up in a lifetime.
26:18
With just the in like that.
Might be my kid who gains 15 in the next year against went.
Like and so it's the compounding effect of the wealth is across generational is where I think it gets crazy but if there were 100 percent death tax because obviously this is aligned with my belief that all of it disappears.
26:35
Anyways so this is obviously Alex's do something the world but it's just basically Dramatically lower the income income taxes.
I think income taxes should be like as close to zero as possible.
And then make the capital gains taxes are because that's only going to really affect the.
Well, if you really want to think about it, right?
Because people who if you make with your hands, awesome?
26:52
Right.
If you make on your assets, that's this with.
That has no has infinite leverage with with time.
So if you trade the most expensive thing for your money, then I feel like you should get taxed the class.
And if you trade no time for your money.
Sure.
This is like a weird thought experiment.
You think would happen if it was 100% death tax.
I think that billionaires would become for more giving and as they approach the end, they know they can't keep it.
27:12
And I also think it would change the way the game is played.
Because if you know because this is the analogy that I like I haven't heard it anywhere else.
I think it's mine.
But if you were to imagine Life as a poker game, right?
We everybody grows out, they've made 18 years old, they can go to the casino, they get a chip or 21, whatever age you can be and that you get it, you get a chip and then you sit down at the table and you're dealt cards, right?
27:33
There's all the other players around the table and depending on cards are dealt.
And the skill, you have you begin to amass Right?
And the difference between this fictitious you know casino and the casino of life is that in the real world you can amass chips, you cash out, you have big water money, you walk out the door but in the casino of life and the Grim Reaper Taps you and says, you, it's tells you it's time, you have to get up from the table, but your chips down the table and they push him to the middle to be distributed by everybody else and continue to get paid for.
28:03
And that's when you realize that it was a fake game with rules that ever mattered to begin with.
And so I bought this piece of land in.
And that was huge.
It was like a big really, really nice lat.
And I remember thinking to myself, like got me, she got me some land, right?
Oh yeah, I have that tree to that thing around my, right.
28:22
And then I thought to myself was like, well, the guy before me thought the same thing in the guy before him thought the same thing, and the guy before him thought the same thing, and I was like in, we've literally still been looking at the exact same piece of dirt and it's just been cycle.
Even if it was father to son, even if it was family to whatever.
28:39
Like, Like death taxes, everyone 100%.
Like even if the government doesn't death taxes, everybody 100%.
And then time taxes your money to Infinity because like people are like, I want to build a legacy.
It's like, that's even just with like within Americana, you know, within the times of America but like you go a thousand years and there's never the same superpower of our thousand year period.
28:59
And so we're like I'm going to leave a legacy is like but that would be like you know let's say an ancient Greeks a going to leave a legacy for my kids when like they might change their currency by you know, XYZ or And there's so many things and I've had real experience with this because my great-great-grandfather was a ruler.
29:16
And here, on this is where we're from, we got kicked out because we were loyal to the shop back in the day, which is why my dad came to us.
And so despite that my great-grand great-grandfather had like four hundred wives ruler, very, very wildly.
29:31
Yeah.
Very, very wealthy different time.
Different from culture, very, very wise ruler, right?
Yeah, yeah.
All the money, all the women, all the everything, literally a ruler, right?
And doesn't matter.
And here I am, I'm not even that many generations separated from it, right?
Even that you don't have all that.
29:46
Well so you don't have to land.
Yeah.
And so like the idea that we're going to somehow is like because the desire for legacy is the desire to cheat death.
I think that's what a stench from.
So we don't want to die.
We want to last forever.
It's we want to make something that is impermanent.
And so we fool ourselves into thinking that the accolades and the material success in the books.
30:05
You write, whatever are going to last forever and they're probably not, right?
And so, Like, I mean, the sun's going to disappear at some point, right?
So if we don't do anything before that, like at the very least that's going to happen.
And so if that is the inevitable outcome, I think it shifts the way people think.
30:21
And I think that's when you start changing.
I mean, Tony Robbins talks about global global belief systems and that's why would someone like adopt a new religious belief, like everything changes because the reasons they do and the way they believe the world Works changes.
And so I think that if they did do 100% death tax, it would be a really interesting way to see the downstream effects of how, change the way the But the game, what do you think would happen?
30:41
If all the billionaire started Distributing their wealth sooner?
I think what we all would they be as hungry to be and driven to push and build?
And innovate say, yes to generate.
The wealth is a new.
I got to give this away anyways.
Quickly.
I think they would well, I think it's because it's I think it's I think I'm going to say something that might sound bad but I think winners win because of who they are.
31:02
Hmm.
And so I think it's like sales guys.
Like you can have an incentive or a complan they just want to win but they are sales people and If I get on the phone, I want to sell because of who I am, not because the compa cop is the ticket to get me to say yes to the deal but it will not change my activity.
31:18
I will do it because I love to sell, right?
And so I think billionaires get there because they love the game like you don't get to a billion without just because you obviously don't need it for you.
You stop needing it for you millions and millions of go, right?
And so you do it just because you love the game.
What I do think of the reason that I like that solution is because Elon Musk said this, private Enterprises ten times as efficient, a capital allocation compared to the government, right?
31:39
So every dollar that private private Enterprise spends, it's 10 times more efficient and so the idea is like, if we were to death tax, 100 percent.
So whatever you accumulate, while you're alive, it just goes back.
Like and the thing is is it's not that it would go back into the system through the government.
It would if you were lazy but most people knowing the government was going to take it the less efficient vehicle at the end of your life.
31:58
You would then start thinking about how can I allocate this money efficiently and so, what I think would happen is you'd create far more Ingenuity and Innovation around social Enterprise before they die solving problems knowing that the The wealth would eventually disappear.
Mmm, so like it's more.
There's this backstop that no one wants to hit.
32:16
And so, I think what happened is, they were change their behavior before hitting the back.
So I don't think a lot of people just be dumping their building to the government.
I think just knowing that they had to would then distribute them to.
Yeah, that would be, you know, that's Alex's to sense of the world, which is obviously different.
What's he just had a big exit, right?
32:31
Yes.
Your what was that for?
How much is?
It was 46 points, 46 million.
So when that enters your account, what did you expect?
What happened?
What did happen and what can you teach other people about what they should expect to happen when they have a big exit.
32:48
So I will say that I did not feel the money, I did feel the loss of cash flow because I had this, you know, I measured myself off cash flow for since I don't have any, right?
You got a big chunk.
The no money coming in every month.
So I actually felt just a probably still still feel horror now than I did before the exit.
33:08
Interesting because the cash flow is going down.
Now I know that acquisition.com is going to be I think significantly bigger than bigger than those companies were but in the interim, I definitely did not feel any better after that.
I am happy that I did it because I do think I'm in the right, you know, vehicle doing what we're doing.
33:27
Now, making the books making the the YouTube channels.
That Twitter's the social media is all of them but the cash flow is what I felt and because I taking dividends my whole life, the amount of money that We got out was pretty much about what we already had, anyways, right.
So it was not life changing in any way.
33:43
It didn't change how I lived at all, like not at all.
We didn't we didn't have any big like what are you going to buy?
I was like well I could you know I'm happy already.
I can buy 100 Lambos before the sale.
You know what I mean?
Like that wasn't, and I never bought them in.
And I never did like, you know, because I don't get a lot of out of that.
33:58
What else was different losing losing?
The team is hard because when you sell a company, you sell the, you sell the people like, that's something that people talk share this with you.
So you sell the Organism, we saw that the system, the people processes and everything hundred percent.
And so that was that was hard because there's definitely times now that we're building acquisition.com.
34:18
We're like man, I wish I had sound so I already taught this person, everything.
I'd like to have to do it again.
So there is a.
But there's also some level of beauty to it because now that I'm doing acquisition not calm, I have a different appreciation for what I'm doing because every other time that I've started something, it has been from a place of lack.
34:38
Ack, it has been from a like well this is what's going to not make me poor, you know what I mean?
Like the gyms was all about that and then I lost it.
Also the second time was all about that again.
So this time I'm starting not like that and I know it it got like before we sold the company's last year.
34:54
I spent basically 12 months not doing anything because I wasn't required of the business like a truly, it ran.
And so I had a lot like it was very depressing.
Exactly is very depressing.
For me what happens if we don't have a purpose?
I mean you find one, you know what I mean?
35:10
And so for me but you're depressed state even though you have, I mean I'm sure you're fine, but you are emotionally mentally.
Like what am I doing everyday?
Actually, I'm not going to the gym for so long.
Right.
Can only go out to dinner.
Yeah.
We like what else you gonna get every meal?
I want I can travel.
Okay.
Now, what after three months of that?
35:26
We've got out some Mission.
Yeah, some purpose, right?
Even though you have the money, your safety, you have everything.
Yeah, security.
But it wasn't fulfilling 100%.
And so that was I was 12 straight months and it was because we were going through a sales process.
So you can't start a new initiatives because I'm in the middle of a sale and you don't want to like make any massive new hires.
35:46
And so you just basically have to just like maintain and the whole time you're wondering I hope this deal goes through because if it doesn't then you just wasted a year just doing nothing and then you might have to do it again.
So it was one of the most emotionally tiring years of my life because it's always like this is about to happen, it's not going to happen.
36:03
The deals on the table, the deal's off the table.
Like there's all of this drama that's happening.
Earning constantly and I also one of the things that sucked that I didn't like was as soon as I made the decision to sell or that I was going to entertain the idea of selling and this is a mistake.
36:19
I made everything became about satisfying a fictitious Overlord of like whoa what will they think about this move?
How they value this and I started thinking of a whatever acquirer whatever private Equity was going to buy the company like how they can see this?
36:34
Are they going to Value this or is this a waste And so what happened was, I started making the private Equity by Irma customer and that was a mistake.
And so I think that like and what happened was.
Interestingly we started the sales process because my wife and I are Beatdown.
We were just very tired of, you know, we've been in gyms for almost 10 years, you know, at that point not to say that, that's not a good thing, but like, whatever we want to support already, we were ready.
36:58
But in order for us to sell it and make it a solid business, we had to fix all the things that were wrong, right?
And so, we took a year before the year.
So this is two years and I are exactly on that.
So took two years basically, one year to like fix everything and then one year to sell it.
37:13
But the thing is it's just like when you have a house that you, like, fix up before you get ready to sell it by the time about set your, like, I lost.
This is amazing.
I just fixed all these, that all the problems I fixed.
Now, I've got more cash flow, it's more efficient.
Yeah, we got one.
And so, it was again, a very like mind trip experience where I'm like, well maybe I should just hold as an asset that just produces cash flow over Uncle Warren, never sells anything like selling is what makes you Keeping his will make you wealthy.
37:37
Like, you know, I'm like I've got all these kind of things in the back of my mind, but I think ultimately like I think no matter what we had done we would have been fine.
But I think for me right now, I think the likelihood that the choice if I had to alternate realities, which I don't have to play in, I think that the choice will ultimately yield more impact for more people.
37:53
I would not have the attention to do, acquisition not calm and the media stuff that we're doing right now.
I wouldn't be here - try wouldn't be focused on your Jim's?
Yeah!
Or the yeah, exactly.
On those companies I'm wearing that before you and acquisition.com would still be a side thing, but it probably wouldn't be the Main thing.
Whereas now it is 100% of my attention and the companies are killing it.
38:11
And I feel renewed when I launched School of greatness ten years ago.
I remember saying I'm going to do this for one year because I wish I had access to this.
I wish this was a thing that I can go listen to ya in the world to teach me.
Yeah.
And I'm not going to try to make money like I'm going to do it for a year.
38:29
Yeah.
All in, but I'm not going to try to make money.
I don't want to make money.
I mean if the money came greater but it wasn't my intention.
It was How can I create the best content to serve people on the things that I wish I were to learn in school growing up?
Yes the school of greatness.
Yeah.
And after one year, I was like man, this thing is really starting to take off, you know, but it wasn't based on how do I make as much money: it was?
38:52
How do I create something that can really make a lasting change?
Yeah.
And that intention is what's made me sustainable for 10 years, loving the process, totally.
So when people come from a place where hear you say, when they come from a place of that, Tension of service or because this needs to be in the world are already exists.
39:10
Not to do something that exist to exist, right.
It's like no one says why did you paint that?
It's like I said needed to come out and you did you express it?
Exactly.
And so I think that if people chose their businesses that way, I think and do me wrong, I'm all about making money like by all means, go get your back as you can.
39:27
Yeah, I do means but I think that what it does is it ends up freeing you to then make your real impact because then you can start the whatever the next thing.
And hopefully your first thing is that But realistically, it probably isn't in.
All I have to do is, look at every entrepreneur.
That's really wealthy.
The amount of graveyard businesses, they have in their back, right, right.
39:43
And so like right now, if you're listening and you're like, I'm not sure if this is the perfect business idea, let me just save you the time.
It's not because look at every other person who has been Ultra successful they have 10 failed business idea so just like just start so you can start notching off the Badness.
Is but extending the time Horizon, I think only happens if you do shift the intention through it, you're building it or you're just unbelievably Softest Flint, but I think it's easier to just like start at it with the right heart, because small changes, but I think it'll be worth it.
40:13
Is that the reason that most people aren't successful, in my opinion, is that they sacrifice Global benefit for local benefit.
And that happens in all areas of life, you eat the piece of cake because you have an acute local benefit versus the global benefit of a six-pack that last for a, very long time, or Better Health Etc.
40:28
Right.
Instant gratification as opposed to delay gratification.
Exactly.
And I just, I like saying Global I just like saying local versus global.
It it happens in an organization.
For example, sales guys don't want to put the notes in the thing because it's a pain in the butt to put the notes in the CRM.
40:45
But Finance needs to notes, customer service needs the boats.
Success needs to not like all of these other departments.
Need those notes for all the other things that we're going to do.
And so it's a local cost but for a global benefit and so I think if people were able to delay that immediate gratification which is like, this is the nature of successes, I think there was wanting man, there was this study.
41:05
That was done, I can remember it.
But it's marshmallow test or the other.
Okay.
God, I can talk about the Marshall test.
Okay.
So fun fun with that.
With the marshmallow test is measuring how long they delay for the marshmallow.
So at what point does it not make sense if they say, you can get one?
41:23
Because it because they like to everyone, that simplifies the experiment which is like if I give you a marshmallow one now or you can get to later, right?
But what if to is in a year, yeah, you're like, I don't care.
I'll take the one now, right?
So then the next question I would have is like If you were to test kids and then say, at what point, the global versus local crosses, when you read, and then track the kids who had the longest marshmallow waiting period, but then you can measure how long the most successful, probably a light.
41:49
Yeah, really interesting.
Just total side note, but the three things that I think we're in common of the ultra successful were inflated sense of self as in.
They thought that they like, they deserve big things.
They want to go after big things they believed in themselves, right?
Inferiority never been good enough.
42:04
Hmm.
An impulse control Those are the three factors of the most successful.
They like when they did a common factors.
Now sister, like these, people think they believe that they can achieve all this amazing stuff and then it's just it's an amazing Paradox because at the same time, they think they're not good enough and they are insecure about whether they can achieve it and they have impulse control.
42:25
And so it's like if you have blend.
Yeah.
And they just they and they stay focused on the thing.
That's the, the biggest breakthroughs that I have had.
I think that will create a lot of the wealth that we will have in the future.
Is is really a deep understanding of how long long is and shooting with the intention of like, I'm only bringing this up because my YouTube guy said it was.
42:46
Like, I've never had somebody who actually started out.
I was like, we'll see what we do in five years.
I was like well measure that and he was like, no one has literally ever said that to me.
I was like, as long as this.
He progress I'm good because I want results in like two months.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like if we're making, we're going this way.
43:02
I'm cool.
I don't need to sit, like, that's good enough for most people.
If, if they could Extend the time rise because like I'll give you another hack, you can know how wealthy someone is based on the time Horizons, they speak in Give an example.
So if someone's talking about how they're trying to make, you know, make money this today, I hate.
43:18
Let me whole 24 today, you know, how poor they are.
I have to say Port like, you know, right?
If someone's talking about what they're going to make this week or this month or this quarter where this year, this decade, well different, the people are who are talking this time Horizons.
43:34
And so I think that if we can shift the time Horizon that we think in, then we gain more leverage over our time, which we, then know we will compound into money because I think if you can Master the time, you must








0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
0:24
It means the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world with someone else solving rich people problems.
Allow you to charge rich.
People prices, they pay better.
They're easier to work with.
And ultimately they allow you to build a business that can withstand different seasons and be in a position to succeed long run.
0:42
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
One of the biggest secrets that people who make a lot of money have is that they know which type of customer, they're trying to sell to, and when people are poor, they tend to sell out of their own wallet, they sell using their perception of what money is.
1:10
And so they think something is expensive and therefore they don't want to be offensive to whoever they're selling to but what that is it's fundamentally a selfish Viewpoint because you're never putting yourself in the other person's shoes and the other person might have all the money in the world and just want to solve a specific problem.
And so what I want to walk through today is why Arjun more has five significant benefits to your customers.
1:32
That actually make you a better service provider by charging more money and it'll give you five specific benefits around your actual business itself that will make your business more successful.
If you don't know who I am, my name is Alex Mosey own acquisition.com.
We run our portfolio companies, that does over $200 a year and I make these, I want you to make lots and lots of money and then, hopefully, someday partner with us beyond that.
1:52
It's just to make you more money, all right.
So have you ever seen this meme?
That's like The customer says, well what exactly am I going to be getting for $50?
And then it has the rich customers like, wire set.
Let me know what next steps are right, is this wildly different Viewpoint that poor people have versus rich people.
2:10
And at the same time, I made three Tweets in a row that each one of them massively outperform.
And it was so weird to me that this was like a novel concept, and I said, solve rich, people problems, they pay better.
And if you solve rich people problems, they will make you one of them.
And when you solve rich people problems, you get Charge rich people prices.
2:29
And so, it's this interesting concept that a lot of people miss out on and part of the reason that a fifty dollar person is saying, well what exactly you might be getting, if somebody's got a hundred dollars in their bank account, you're asking for 50 percent of their net worth, right?
And so for them it's a very important decision but it's also completely ridiculous.
2:47
And unfortunately this still might be half the population, doesn't mean necessarily should sell to them right into the same degree that fifty thousand dollars.
Might have been less than 1% of that.
Other person's net worth so they just didn't even care.
It would have been the equivalent of trying to sell a dollar to that person as a hundred dollars in their bank account, right?
3:05
And the thing is, is that you can only go to 0, right?
Like, you'd only be so poor, right?
But you can be infinitely rich.
And so, you're upside is uncapped, but your downside is zero.
And so, when you deal with rich people, you have unlimited upside, which is why they are better customers.
3:21
Now, like I said, there's five things I want to talk about from the customer perspective, and my whole goal of this is to actually sell you On one increasing your prices but to increasing the quality of your customers because if you increase the quality of your customers, you increase the quality of your business and in a very real way, the smarter, the people you sell to the actually better, the client results are.
3:41
All right, so let's dive into the five.
So, number one, when you charge more money for your products or Services, you get an increased emotional investment, right?
Because on the flip side, if you decrease your price people care, less about your products and services.
So if you ever have anything That you have you require something on behalf of the other person, which almost all products and services, do even physical products and services, people have to open up a box.
4:04
They have to set it up Etc.
And so if you have a very low-cost item, people won't even give it the time of day, they won't even try enough.
That even if your product or service is good, they never even gave it a shot.
And so when you raise the price, you raise their emotional investment.
And in a real way, you actually increase the likelihood that they get results.
4:23
So the second way is that it increases their perceived value.
So I told us A lot, but I'll tell you right now.
So, there was a research study where they had three bottles of wine, all right?
They had a cheap wine, they had a mid-price wine and they had an expensive one and they had people try them out and they had them rank them based on what they thought.
4:41
And so people said, I think the most expensive wines the best, the middle price is the middle and the cheapest wine was the worst and that's not that surprising.
Except when the researchers explained, that all three wines were the same.
And so in a very real way, when you raise your prices, you do, Do actually make something that's more valuable because if that's what we're trying to get at which is value price, confers value to your product, the more expensive thing is perceived in real terms, as more valuable, even if the actual core products to say, why would you not want to make your thing more valuable?
5:16
The third is results for your customers.
If you increase their emotional investment, you increase their perceived value, what ends up happening, they actually do get better results, they do have a better wine experience.
They do when they sign up for the gym for personal training versus a 10 dollar, a month thing, they get better results and so if you want to get people the results that you promised or you claim that you're going to get them, then you should stack every single chip in your favor.
5:41
That's going to get them.
The result that you're promising and the price is one of those things.
And so People want to lower the price because like, I want to help everybody but you're actually not.
You're not helping everybody because most of the people aren't going to be emotionally invested.
They're not going to proceed as valuable or not.
Going to get the results that you so promised which means that you have to draw a line in the sand and say, I can only help the people who are swimming towards me.
6:03
So the fourth thing is that when you raise your prices, you actually track less demanding customers.
And so, anybody who's ever been in client services, can attest to this, but the higher the price tag, the more expensive, the contract, The more upfront, someone pays their bills.
The fewer payment plans you have to set up the easier, the customers to deal with and if you've ever had this like the paid in full upfront.
6:25
Hey can I save a little bit of high paying all cash today that customer that one is the easiest one to deal with the one that you have to arm wrestle for an hour to get $50 on a payment plan over 24 months.
This investment is so important that they're going to milk the life out of you to get every every Penny's worth out of you.
6:44
And it's like sometimes Not worth it because just like what you price is, what you pay values, what you get on the flip side just because someone pays you money, you may be underwater in what you have to deliver.
So just because someone's willing to pay, you doesn't mean that you should take it.
7:01
The fifth benefit that your customers will get as a result of raising your prices, is that you actually have more money that you can deliver on your promises for.
So imagine you've got a hard cost thing that costs five bucks.
All right, and you can add and subtract 0 0 just using simple numbers.
7:17
So if you have five bucks to do the thing, right?
And you charge eight bucks, we only have three dollars left to run the rest of your business, provide service Etc, right?
Like, you don't have a lot of room there now, imagine you charge $50 for that same five dollar thing, you have 45 dollars of additional gross profit that are additional before, T2 dollars of additional gross profit that you can now use to blow the other competitors, experience out of the water like you can in a very real way.
7:46
Liver, two, three, four times, the value.
And in many times, if you do deliver two, three, four times, the value, the customer gets a better experience.
And so if our whole business here is actually trying to provide value, then we want to increase the emotional investment of the customer.
We want to increase the perceived value.
8:03
We want to have the less than the least demanding person possible, have the most possible Revenue, we can have to deliver the results that the person actually wants.
And so if we make these promises, as we should stack, as many of the chips, as we can in our favor.
8:18
And one of the biggest ones is the price.
Now, let's talk about the business side because there's five significant things that will change.
When you start raising your prices in the business.
Number one is that like the example I gave, if you had an eight dollar thing that cost you five bucks, you have three dollars in gross profit.
8:36
You've got to run everything else off of those three dollars.
So if you were just the most efficient person in the world, right?
Let's maybe just run on half of that, which is $15 or so. $1.50 left, right?
We're already paper-thin here, right on the flip side, when you have a significant higher price, you have way more room to make mistakes.
8:55
And I say that because no one is perfect.
We all make mistakes in business.
And what you don't want is mistakes that you can't recover from and having a premium priced product or a luxury product that has a lot of margin there.
Allows you to make mistakes and as businesses are seasonal and you have macroeconomic environment, the people who don't have that padding or the ones that go under and so, Having that padding in a real way can increase the likelihood that you can play the game in the long run.
9:20
The second thing is that as a business, it actually increases your perceived value of self.
Like, what do you think about when you think about, you know, a Walmart versus a saxophone you or a Neiman Marcus, right?
They occupy different spaces in your mind, and if you're the business owner of that business, then having a higher perceived value of soft, which a lot of times when people are starting out, they don't think they're worth very much, and sometimes they're right.
9:44
But the thing is, is that you still To charge a certain amount so that you can have the excess resources to get better.
If you never have any money left over, you can never reinvest in yourself.
You can't reinvest in your employees.
I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself in terms of things that you can do.
But, well screw it.
10:00
This leads naturally, the next one, which is when you have extra cash left over, you can reinvest in your product, right?
You can actually research and you can test out new things, you can make prototypes, you can test out new divisions of service, you can attract higher level Talent.
10:16
Point to your business.
If you have no margin, the best people are going to work for you.
Why?
Because they're going to go to the real business owner, who understands how marja needs to work so they can attract the best talent.
And then now, you're not only being out competed by that person in terms of profits, but they also can scale way better than you because they have decentralized decision, making because they have lots of smart people all working together because they priced the product, right?
10:38
And they're dealing with the right types of customers, whereas you're sitting here dealing with fires all day, because of people haggling over $50 with him.
He's who can't string sentences together because you can't pay anybody who's worth a shit to actually work for you to terrible life.
I know because I lived it.
10:55
So just don't make that mistake like, start off high and allow the extra profits to increase.
Your perceived value of self help you track.
The better customers have the profits to reinvest in, in the, in the business itself.
Attract better quality employees increase the conviction of your sales team if you do sell ever.
11:16
Because think about it, if they're selling the ship product and they see the other guy on the market, who's more expensive.
The only thing they're going to have is Will were a lot cheaper, they know you're not better but if you're the salesperson you can approach and say well yeah I mean if you want you can try that one first and then come back to us because that's what everyone else does right?
11:35
Or you cannot make them steak and actually save yourself a little bit money and instead of buying twice just by nice ones and solve the problem for good.
And so the sales people can enter these phone calls or these conversations with The conviction that they're actually going to help this person.
And that is the best way to sell is having the full conviction that your product is the best and you can't say your products, the best if you're trying to do it on margin and you don't have the money to reinvest in good people reinvesting, keeping it Innovative at the at the front of the market you can't do it.
12:04
Right.
And so I'm a big believer in just making big promises and then delivering on big promises like that is the types of businesses that I like to build.
And when you have all of these higher paying lower demanding happier, customers your perception of the real impact, you're actually making goes up.
12:24
And so your conviction over the entire business.
And your mission of like, I actually came here to help.
People starts to become reinforced and it becomes this snowball, that starts rolling.
And you have these testimonials and these reviews that start rolling in and the momentum Builds on the flip side.
12:40
If you don't have that, you have less margin.
It becomes This Vicious Cycle in the other direction, where you're not getting these testimonies are you getting his chargebacks and refunds from these demanding, customers that had unrealistic expectations, because it was such a high percentage of their net worth.
There's nothing that was going to save them from themselves, right?
12:57
And so you have two stories that you can play out and solving rich people problems allowed to charge rich.
People prices they pay better they're easier to work with.
And ultimately they allow you to build a business that can withstand different seasons and be in a position to succeed long run.
This is very fortuitous, timing wise.
13:15
But the time of this being made the richest man in the world.
Everyone's like, what about big Tech?
What about Ai?
And I believe you.
I think it's scary shit.
So the richest man in the world.
Right now is not big Tech.
It's not big Pharma all the things that the news wants to talk about.
It's a man selling 10,000 dollar purses.
13:30
All right.
If you don't know who he is, his name is Bernard arnault.
He owns most of the major luxury brands that you've heard of.
So if you've ever been to a luxury Ma, and if you haven't, I really strongly recommend that you go to one because it might not be in your neighborhood.
Might not even be close to your city, but you should go.
13:46
Because what will happen is it will stretch your mind in terms of what you believe is possible.
If you don't make a lot of money and you see a purse for 10,000 hours, you see a jacket for 50,000 dollars, it changes something about how you see reality or like and I would urge you to not say those people are ridiculous.
14:02
I can't believe someone would spend money on that.
What I want you to do is actually empathize with the buyer.
What kind of person would spend fifty thousand dollars on a jacket.
Well, what conditions would have to be true in order for that to make sense, because think about this, a lot of people are like rich.
14:18
People are crazy but rich people, the ones with all the money.
So they must have done something differently than poor people.
So try and think about why would it make sense to this person?
Well, if I can pick from all jackets and I have so much money that the difference between a hundred dollar jacket and a fifty thousand dollar jacket in relative terms is a ten dollar difference to me in my wealth that I just want the best jacket.
14:41
And so I'm willing to just pay whatever It is because if you had a significantly better jacket for ten dollars more in your own net worth, you probably would be willing to pay for it.
And so do they it's just that they have more zeros and so Bernard arnault capitalized on this and so there's four distinct positions you can have in any market place.
14:58
You can have bargain which is the absolute cheapest one which typically is poor quality in general, poor experience, but barely barely gets the job done but it gets the job done but barely the next is best value.
All right?
So this is Is the difference between like a Walmart and Target, right?
15:15
Target is better value.
It's got brighter lights, it's cleaner in theory, right?
And it's just a little bit better, right?
It's the best value for the buck.
The third position, the marketplace is premium.
So it's the best verse.
That's the that's the high-end Lexus, right?
15:31
That's the BMW.
These are premium products, they're above average based on price, it's not the best value but is better than the best value.
And then the fourth position, the marketplace is luxury where the price has no cap.
15:47
And part of the value of the product itself is the cost that people know you paid to get it.
So Bernard arnault lives in this luxury bubble.
It's where people associate their status with the purchase they made and what an amazing position to be at.
16:02
He's like, so I just raise my prices even more and people want to buy more and so there's called veblen Goods in economics.
They actually defy the supply demand curve Rules because typically when you raise prices, you decrease volume, but in luxury goods, when you raise prices, you increase how many you sell and that creates this, unbelievable amount of profit, which is what has now propelled him to be the single richest man in the world.
16:25
Something to learn from this guy.
And so the number one question I got from all the, the Tweet responses I had from those three or four, two weeks in a row, I made about about solving rich, people problems has well, what are rich people problems?
It's a great question.
So rich people have the same problem.
16:41
Problems that poor people do they just want them solve differently and if we go back to our trusted value equation, the big thing we want is we want to deliver a big dream outcome, right?
We want to deliver it outcome that they want number one, number two, we want them to believe with very high confidence.
16:56
That if they work with us, they're going to get what we promised on the bottom side, they want it to be incredibly fast.
So as soon as they pay, they want to get.
And then they want to have as little effort and sacrifice as humanly possible, and with the rich, Speed and convenience are Paramount because the money is never an issue.
17:16
It's how much you going to ask of my time and how painful you're going to make this for me.
And so if you think about the white-collar echelon, you've got investment bankers, you've got management, Consultants.
All right, at the highest level, in my opinion of this kind of white-collar world who deal with rich clients.
17:33
The banking World fundamentally goes to rich people and says, I'm going to allow you to give me a billion dollars and I'm going to take that billion dollars and I'm going to give you back five billion dollars in 10 years or five years or whatever.
17:49
And they're like, okay well what do I have to do?
And they're like nothing.
You just write me to check like, okay, so I write you the check and then there's nothing else I have to do correct.
Well, what's my perceive like that achievement?
How do I know this is going to happen?
Well, here, the Other three funds I've done.
18:04
And I've averaged X over 5 years in each of these ones.
Okay?
So you've done this three times, over 15 years and you've had that each time.
It's pretty high perceived likely of achievement the dream outcome is, I want to make way more money and I'm going to do it without any time or effort on my part.
Here you go, that is how billions of dollars or maybe because they find what what problem does a rich person have, what can they can do with their money, right?
18:29
Which is why investment vehicles and investment opportunities appeal to the wealthy.
And and the more passive you can make it the less time, involvement that have the more TurnKey, it is, the higher, the likelihood that you have a track record that they're going to get what you have promised, they'll write you an unlimited.
18:44
Check if you can get 20 percent returns like clockwork with virtually no risk.
You can tap into literally unlimited money.
Anyone massive amounts and a key Point here was risk, right?
If you find a way that they're basically is no risk, and you can get twenty percent returns twice the stock market.
19:02
You can have as much money as you want.
Now, here's where the little wrinkle comes in, for those types of solutions.
Many times you can find those things, but the opportunity can't take unlimited money.
So bloody-minded figured out a short-term revolving, credit line thing for specific businesses that can't get credit lines, but they had Assets in excess of the credit line.
19:22
Meaning if they default it, for whatever reason, they could claim assets that were worth more.
So it's asset backed loans.
And so he was able to get fifty percent annual returns but he he maxed out that entire It would like 20 million dollars of liquidity that little niche that he had found in business, but 20 million dollars, maybe more than what you currently are working with.
19:43
And he structured his his fun so that he would get 20% of The Upside.
And so if he takes 20 million dollars and he does 50% growth every year, right, he's able to grow to whatever it is.
I do a hundred million bucks at the end of this and you get 20%, see makes 20 million dollars.
And so for many of you watching this Vlog, I'd be happy with 20 million dollars and so all you have to do is find ways to solve rich people problems and That's a big investment bubble, but let's let's go down to like day-to-day types of businesses.
20:10
Rich people will want off in the same Services as poor people because they are humans.
But the way they want it delivered is going to be focusing on the bottom two variables of value effort and sacrifice and time.
Rich people will always pay for Speed and so if you don't have a fast option or if you look at the marketplace and there's lots of slow stuff, the easiest way to appeal to the rich is just do the same thing in half the time, whatever.
20:34
Uh, Services.
If it's dry cleaning and they can do it in a day, return it by end of day, right?
In the effort and sacrifice.
If you were in any kind of Home Services type business, a lot of the issues there is English-speaking people.
Write a lot of people don't speak, very good English, they would pay the premium to just know that one, their stuffs, not going to get stolen to the stuff's going to be done consistently every time and three, that they're going to speaking to somebody who understands them immediately and they don't have to repeat themselves and then say an entire sentence in English and say comprende or C, right?
21:05
They don't want that in this mind you, this is in America.
So whatever your whatever, your native tongue of your country is, apply that thinking to whatever the service is.
You just want to make sure that whatever the rich person's native tongue is, is you're making it as easy and effortless as possible for them to communicate with you in whatever way they want.
21:25
And so if you only have a phone number, well, be the person that can accept anything.
So that if they email you, if they shoot you a text, if they WhatsApp you, if they phone call, you can accept anything.
A thing, because you've made it more easy and convenient and effortless for them to communicate with you.
21:40
And so, I want you to think through these value equation variables because that is, that is fundamentally, how you deal with rich people, is that they just want it to be effortless, they don't think about it and they will pay you through the nose to do it.
Because for them, it's not through the nose because you need to make sure you're selling out of their Wallet.
21:55
Not yours.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100.
Million-dollar offers that over Five star reviews, it has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
22:13
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
One of the main things I want to hit here is how you sell to rich people, okay?
22:31
The big thing that poor people do when they're trying to sell in general is again, they sell it to their own wallet.
When I say that, it's like if you're poor, you think this means a lot.
So you feel like you have to justify your price all the time.
If I hear that I am, I automatically know that this person is a probably poor be, doesn't deal with many rich people and so they will weed you out knowing that you don't know how to deal with people like them.
22:53
Real talk, you sell to rich people, the benefits for them are always around it, being the best, not it being the best value.
It's not, I want to get the most bang for my buck.
It's I just want the most bang period And I want it to be as easy and effortless as humanly possible.
23:12
So I went to a fur coat store when I was in Park City and I actually met one of the best sales people I've ever met.
I got a really good overcome from him.
That I'll tell you right now cause I think it's awesome.
Layla was trying on these fur coats because I think they're ridiculous and I love that stuff and we at the time lived in Austin Texas.
23:33
So it's hot all the time.
There's literally never a point where you could wear in Austin and she said, you know, it's not about the money.
She was like, I just don't think I've ever going to wear this thing.
And he said, well, if they were free, would you take one?
And she was like, well good point.
23:48
He's like, well, then it's not not about the money.
And he just redirected it back to the price.
Now what's interesting is that not once during the entire conversation that we had there?
Did he ever mention that the fur coat was going to be waterproof?
Not not ever?
Did he mention that it was going to be the warmest jacket, right?
24:05
Because it's not going to beat the gore Tech, you know, Arc'teryx spider, you know, whatever, you know, double triple platinum, right?
Big down.
The can't be destroyed in flames, right?
Is never that, right?
All he was talking about was how we were going to look and feel.
24:21
Deal with this jacket or how Layla was going to look and feel at events and basically, getting her to imagine what the experience would look like After experiencing the product, right?
And so, if you're dealing with rich people on a regular basis, you have to think about the things that they're going to do and how they're going to experience the product, not the way, you think you would experience it.
24:40
And so this is where, you know, there's the Golden Rule to treat other people the way you want to be treated.
But that's not actually the best rule for selling.
You want to treat people the way they want to be treated.
Right?
Which is the Platinum rule, which is If you've ever heard of that stuff and so it's really coming from a place of empathy, and if right now you don't have a lot of money and you have like a little bit of distaste for rich people.
24:59
I like, from the bottom of my heart, you have to get rid of that because you cannot become something you hate.
It's if you want to make more money, you have to empathize first with how did this person get there?
What is their world view?
And how do they see things?
Because it's the first step to be able to walk around in their shoes and make products and services that are actually going to serve them.
25:18
Because they ultimately, if you think about the biggest companies in the world, although many people who are poor use Facebook, where does Facebook make its money advertisers big businesses, and those people act like rich people, they want it to be as seamless as possible and they will write it undone.
25:35
Limited check, they'll say hey you know what Facebook?
We need to drop three hundred million in Q4 because we have to get it off our balance sheet, buddy, mind reels of Fortune, 100 companies and here's what's crazy his advertising agency actually has two front the ad spend.
And so he if they say, hey I need you to for this month, in December need to drop 300 million on Facebook ads.
25:56
He has to front the 300 million for the ads, all right?
But the thing is, is that he has to do it that way because he needs to be Easy as humanly possible but remember they're good for it, right?
26:12
And so he actually has to have a revolving credit line in the billions with a bank.
And so what's crazy is that he charges six percent of all advertising dollars as its fee.
On top of whatever is normal fee is and so when they drop 300 million he gets six percent, not bad.
26:29
He gets 18 million bucks just for fronting the cash.
And so all he has to do is Only look at credit lines that are less than 6.
So you can Arch on the money.
And so my point here is that rich people have different problems.
The best thing to do is study luxury Brands, if you are in an area or you're born in an area, that doesn't have a lot of nice stuff, I would highly encourage you to a at least make a day trip out to like the really nice part of town, the nice mall and walk around the stores there and and this is unfortunate but you will get treated differently how you dress in those places like I Walk in like this and they always treat me like shit, but I kind of like it.
27:08
So I'm like twisted my own way.
Like I like, you know, the surprise, of course, I'm the main Shopper that they have there, but going there dress like you're not a weirdo and like, look around.
27:23
Like, look at the service.
Like, when you shop at a high-end store, they'll bring you bottled.
Water.
That's fizzy.
Then they'll have different selections of waters.
They'll offer you champagne while.
You shop, they'll offer you Scotch while you shop.
It's a different experience.
27:39
Like, why don't they do that at?
Why don't they do that it till he's, you know?
Why don't they do that?
At fucking Arrow pushed off, right?
Is that a good story?
But it's probably not whatever.
Hollister, that's probably a good start by.
I don't even know what what our American Eagle.
All right bear, get Eagle.
27:56
Yeah, uhm yeah, primer 21.
There you go.
Do they offer that?
They're, of course not right.
And so if you're thinking about this, like who's going to get a better expert?
Like the clothing, The nice stores is way better quality, right?
There's no going to argue that the experience at the way better stores is significantly nicer.
28:11
Guess what?
You don't try and do like, you going to have somebody who's assigned to you from the moment, you walk in the door.
What can I get for you?
Right.
And they become your basically, your concierge, for the entire experience you have there and they can have and deliver that better experience because of the premium and luxury prices, they charge.
28:27
And so if I had the choice of two businesses where I've got a super messy rack, right?
That's sitting there and people just have to clamor and fight over it.
Versus the white glove champagne, you know, how can I help you experience?
I tend to want to serve those types of customers charge, those types of prices make, those types of profits, profits and make those types of promises and deliver on them and work with my employees and team, really smart people who also want to deal with those types of people.
28:55
And so in a real way, like it isn't In Crowd in and out crowd.
People who are in that world recognize other people who understand that world, And if I can get you to think, like, they think, then you will be able to sell to them, rich people have all the money.
29:11
And so if you want to go get the money, go to where the money's at.
There's only one way to win in a low price business.
You have to build your entire business from the ground up day.
One based on having a significant operational Advantage, you have to build your core strategic Advantage.
29:28
As we will be the lowest priced person do not compete.
On best value.
You either got to go premium, where you got to go luxury, all right?
Luxury is your price is so high.
It can First Status to the buyer because your brand is strong.
Premium which is where most people is where I recommend.
29:46
You go is actually just deliver significantly better in a real way service.
All right, now, here the point is that your price?
Like if you're an amazing marketing agency, you're not conferring status to the business, but being expensive, you're not luxury right luxury often isn't consumer goods.
30:03
So if you're in a business service to type business, you're not really going to be there.
It's much more about.
I want the best.
I want the most bang not for the dollar.
I just want the most bang.
All right, the most bang for the dollar is best value and this is where the graveyard of most businesses set.
30:22
They try and offer a little bit more for a little bit less and they look at the next guy comes in and tries to offer a little bit more for a little bit less and then eventually you can't offer any more for any less and you just stay in what I consider a capitalist nonprofit, you just don't make any money and you do it for years and it crushes your soul because you kept trying to do a little bit more for a little bit less because you're selling the wrong person.
30:42
And so, if you're going to get into the price game, you gotta go for the absolute bottom and build your business from the ground up.
Only off of remote workers automate as much as humanly possible.
You come into it.
Like the first answer is always happen to automate it.
Not who do I hire?
Or how do I Outsource it?
30:58
It's always how do I automate it, right?
And then the second is, if I absolutely can't automate it.
I'll have to bring someone offshore that's a different business model than you probably have.
And might not even be a business, you're interested in.
And the problem is there can only be one low price.
L the cheapest person there's no advantage and this is from Dan Kennedy, there's no advantage to being the second cheapest person, the marketplace, but there is an advantage to being the most expensive.
31:22
And so when you sell to reach people, you get to charge rich.
People prices, they pay better.
And if you solve their problems, they will make you one of them.
So when you do with better customers because you've raised your prices, you're going to attract better people because the rich people are attracted to higher price that they seek them out like Bloodhounds.
31:39
I actually want to know what the most expensive thing is because I know that the Owner who set it up that way, understands how I want to be treated my not a thought about it like that.
I literally look for the most expensive thing because I just assume it's going to be the best and most times I'm right?
Because that's how most businesses that cater to wealthy people operate.
31:56
They know what the rich person is looking for.
They want to speak convenience and they wanted to just deliver exactly how it is and not think about it again.
All right, they don't haggle this one here.
Get the extra 20%.
I don't care.
Like I just want to be in and out and I'm done.
All right, and so what happens is, when you deal with Our people, you have way less demanding clients.
32:15
The nice thing is that when they spend money, they're actually emotionally invested.
So when you raise the price people get more emotionally invested on top of that, they perceive the value is higher just from the price alone.
All right, there's, there's a big experiment.
They ran where they had three bottles of wine cheap middle priced expensive.
32:31
They had people try them out and they had them rank them and people rank them as best was the most expensive middle was middle and the cheapest one was the worst.
Here's what's crazy.
The research is pulled off.
Off the covers of the wines and showed them that all three wines were the same.
And so in a very real way, the price actually increase the value of the wine self and so when you raise the price, you actually increase the quality of your product, on top of that.
32:56
If you ever have a product or service where you have to get the person to do something, which is most products or Services, then the higher quality customer you attract in a real way.
The better, the likely that they will achieve the result because more able people can afford more And so you will increase the percentage of people who are happy and can follow through because they are more able.
33:18
And so you have higher success rates because you attracted better quality customers.
And so if we want to Stack the chips in our favor to make big promises deliver on big promises, have clients that aren't a pain in the ass right deliver results.
33:34
As we said, we were going to and make more profit along the way the pathway is up.
Not down now, from a business perspective, if when you have more profit in the core thing that you have, you can reinvest in staying Innovative, you can do research and development, you can have beta runs and beta products and prototypes, you can do that because you have excess profit on top of that.
33:55
You can invest in having a superior experience because you have the excess cash to give them white glove service.
Right?
On top of that your conviction in what you sell that when you say I'm going to deliver this thing and you can is strengthened because conviction is where all sales comes.
34:12
But you have to believe what you say.
Most people don't actually believe.
And so thing is is poor people think if when you close a sale, you think?
Gotcha, you're fucked up because you actually think that you are ripping off your customers and so if you so you need to change that.
34:31
Like if you don't, if you feel that way, you need to change it because there's two emotions that you should feel one is, oh, fuck.
Now the work starts.
And the second is, I'm really glad I can help this person, like I get it because I've sold when I was poor, like I understand when you're like, I fucking need to pay bills, I get it.
34:51
But the thing is, is like, you have to pull yourself out of that to get out of that.
Because again, wealthy people can smell that, like, I love this term commission breath, right?
Is that they can smell that, the only reason you're trying to sell them it for you, not for them.
And so when you have the most profit, you can reinvest in the experience, you can reinvest in the product and most importantly, you can reinvest in attracting the best talent because how do you scale a business?
35:17
It's not going to be you, you're going to have to have a team and would you rather have a team of people who don't value themselves and don't want to make a lot of money?
Or do you want to have a team of people who are ambitious, who have big dreams for themselves who want to learn and they want to learn from someone who's making money?
And they will ask for more than people who don't value themselves.
35:35
But here's what's crazy.
The biggest cost cutting tactic Henry, Ford said he did was that he doubled his minimum wage compared to everybody else who competed against what happened, he was able to take all the top talent from everyone else to work for him.
35:51
And here's one of the secrets that you probably don't know what I'm going to tell you right now.
Is that a level Talent cost twice as much as be level talent, but produces five times the output Ten times a hundred times the output so much more and a-level talent comes with batteries.
36:07
Included they come with a map installed like a Tesla.
They know where they're going.
They know the route and they already have the motivation to get there and you just need to get out of the way.
You need to empower them to do what they need to do, but you can't attract those people if you don't have the prophets and so keep trying to lower your price, keep trying to do Best Value.
36:25
Do a little bit more in for a little bit, less you worn off their best customers.
You ward off the best.
Because they all know each other because oftentimes the best talent are people who value premium products and services, and they want to work for a company that they would buy from.
36:42
In the last one, is a lot of people's prices are a reflection of their value of themselves.
And I think there's a, there's a big thing that we have to separate here.
Is that you can value yourself and understand that you are not as good yet.
I'm a big believer in what I consider the Chick-fil-A model of pricing which is it's either free or it's full price.
37:00
There are no discounts And that's why when people are starting out, I encourage them to do as many free services as they can.
There's a lot of value that one is, you get a lot of experience to there's lower Stakes.
Three, you can ask for things in return, that are tangential value, can get reviews, you can get testimonials, you can get feedback.
37:17
All of these things.
Help make you better and everyone's so they're so short-sighted because what happens is if you're in the beginning and you suck if your first five people you basically rip off because you're sucking at it and you're trying to learn with them.
Like, your first five customers don't like you.
Like, that's a tough way to start, and your perception of business will be shifted by that.
37:35
And so, if you have a very different Dynamic where you're just giving, and you're giving away stuff for free giveaway services for free, right?
You have a very different Dynamic and you will learn how to provide value in a different way.
And then what happens is, once you get to a point where people are like, I want more of this, and you can even satisfy the demand, then you go full price because now you've gotten the Reps in, you know how to over-deliver.
37:57
You know what an Really good relationship with the customer feels like because it should feel like a partnership.
It should feel like we're working together on this and it shouldn't feel like master-slave, right?
It shouldn't feel like you're pulling the cash out of there.
Ripping the catcher, other wallet shouldn't feel that way.
It should be like, hey, we're both aligned here.
38:13
We're really Partners in this in this work together and when you have that Vibe and you have the track record, you will be able to say, no, to bad customers and ultimately saved your mindset and all of your employees from dealing with them, too, because one of the easiest ways to lose good talent.
Is cell bad customers.
38:28
Is cell bad customers.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
So, the most important thing you have to realize when you're in your 20s is what season you are in, you have to stop comparing yourself to people who are earning more than you.
Because it means that what they're doing is often short changing their long-term learning for sure.
After merging, welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:37
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos Muskan Buffett a documented, their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy. 20 rolled State poor because they think that their side hustle has to become their main hustle, and they see lots of influencers, all over the Internet and they consume my stuff or whatever.
0:56
And the thing is, they will lack context, they will think that a big business lesson will apply to them today and save the right lesson at the wrong time, which still makes it the wrong lesson.
And so what they're trying to do is they're trying to earn and learn or earn rather than learn.
And the thing is that the company that happens in your earning is just like the game of cash flow.
1:16
Maybe again, that was before your time.
If you're 20, you're watching this.
But basically, with this little board game, where everybody starts at the same, you roll dice and you keep moving along board.
And as soon as you graduate high school, you have the option of starting a job and start earning more money.
Immediately after high school, or you go to college, wait for years and then make more money after that, or you could go to medical school and make even more money after that.
1:38
But each time you continue to push back your earning in favor of learning.
Now, the way the game works for the most part, most people are able to make more the More, they educated themselves.
Now, the theory of the game is correct.
The fact that nowadays college is massively overpriced and undervalued and some other career paths are as well, doesn't disprove, the idea that the longer you can delay your earning cycle, the more you are compounding, your learning unto itself.
2:06
And so I want to give you a quick example of two guys about the same age that took two very different directions in life, one of them will just call him.
Logan is a young guy.
Ich started listening to some of my stuff went to another guy who's a little bit older.
2:22
And then tried to learn the basics of editing video because he was like, videos big.
That's what all these guys are doing.
I think I could get a job doing editing, right?
Make sense, cool.
Other guy will call him snake up.
Same idea, wanted to make money but had zero skills because he's 17 years old.
2:39
Of course, you would have no skills.
Because why would you write?
And so he decided, because he talked to a mentor who's older them and see, A, I think you have a proclivity for sales.
I think you'd be good at.
So you should start at a sales place at the lowest tier of the business.
Now, here's where things differed Logan, went to the business, use the buddy, who taught him a little bit about editing to get a job interview.
3:02
And he'd learned enough that he could get a job offer for the job offer at age 17 or six years old or whatever it was he gets a 60 thousand dollar offer right?
Which is solid amount of money for editing with basically Experience just from the small amount of skills.
3:18
He's able to learn mind you for who's thing about the college thing.
You you can learn skills quickly to replace with the average college income is afterwards.
So as an aside, that probably took 12 weeks of learning to get that level of skill.
Now, in this instance you've got Logan who then rather than accept the job because this particular company had a huge Suite of other people who significantly more advanced, including the guy who taught him, the basic level of skills, just enough to get the job.
3:45
All right, so he's got Multiple people who have mastered, different platforms, creative director, who's done multiple big brands that he had the ability to learn from.
But what did he do?
He asked for three thousand dollars more because it's a fucking idiot because what he thought he had to do was earn rather than learn who cares if he makes an extra three thousand dollars a year.
4:06
Now the business is obviously not going to do that.
Here's why.
Because one, his skillset is replaceable, there's hundreds of other people were mediocre at video.
The second thing is that, if somebody starts out the relationship that way the indicate that they're going to be a pain in the ass and there's no amount of money that is worth taking on a pain in the ass in your business.
4:28
And so with this guy does is he starts trying to negotiate back and forth.
He's watch some videos on YouTube about how to negotiate is trying to like get the upper hand but he forgets the thing that matters most which is he has no leverage, no one cares.
And so what ends up happening he goes to a through interviews.
4:44
The guy who is as mentors, like, what the hell are you doing?
I got You this job, you're making me look bad and dude you don't know anything like there's so much, you don't know.
But the thing is is when you're early on you learn this much and you think you know everything and it's something called the dunning-kruger effect which is that the more you learn in a specific skill the more you realize you don't know.
5:02
And so if right now you're young and you think you know a lot I want to tell you it's a psychological fallacy.
Like you actually know nothing like you think you know which is why it's a fallacy think about if you are young your like I'm really good at this it's because you actually have I've no idea.
And the reason that some people are older have to stain for people or younger, is because of this psychological effects.
5:22
People are older have had more experience realize they know less and then see somebody who's younger thinks they know more and they realize the discrepancy in how ignorant it is and you just look stupid.
So this is me trying to prepare you for what I think the best career path is and it's not necessarily what you think.
5:39
This is me maximizing for your long-term net worth.
All right, this is me trying to make you as rich as humanly fucking possible.
So this is Logan did Logan goes Wheels and Deals and then eventually gets a job to be the sold that the lead head, honcho of video editing, in whatever, at some small business that has no idea how to do this at all.
6:00
Guess what?
He's not doing any more learning.
And so what he did was he took two steps forward and then put himself in front of a wall because there's nowhere else.
He's going to learn from.
There's no other mentors.
There's no other people ahead of him.
He's not going to learn and so So, he took the right hook in his career, 12 weeks after getting into it.
6:21
And now they're the ones who are trying to extract as much from him rather than coming into a business where he's the small man on the totem pole and you can learn from everyone else which would maximize for his long-term, net worth.
So let's walk through the other example, makeup.
All right, so smake up, listen to the advice of the older guy and the final decision that happened there.
6:41
I said, listen, you can try and become a millionaire in 90 days.
You've got a 1 in 1,000, shot of getting And what's crazy is that they did a survey of high school, seniors, 52 percent of high school seniors believe that they will be a millionaire by 25.
6:58
You are sadly fucking mistaken.
Like it's delusion like that's what it is.
It's delusion over half, thought they were going to be millionaires by age 25.
If you look at the action status for people who are minors at 25, it's not even 1% of people who are millionaires at 25.
7:15
It's less than One percent.
So you're rolling a dice making decisions in your life, based on a bet that's worse than anything, you find in Vegas.
And so the second half that conversation with makeup was, you can try and roll the dice and have a 1 in 1000.
7:30
Shot being a millionaire 90 days because that was the behavior that he was starting to show.
Or I can guarantee that you'll be a millionaire in a decade, which would you prefer.
He said, I want to be a millionaire in a decade and so Mentor said start at the lowest rung.
7:46
Totem pole, start at the bottom and learn every skill along the way and sews makeup went in there.
He also took the mentors advice and he said, whatever.
The minimum quota is that they tell you to do an activity, double it.
So this was a sales role and so he was required to do a hundred calls a day.
8:03
And so, he did two hundred calls a day.
Mentor also said, go and spend as much time as you possibly can.
With the number one guy, listen to everything he does and watch what he does.
So that's what he did and they needed twice as much volume.
Why?
Because he's Otis killed.
So he has to do twice.
The worker has to do four times the work in order to get the same output as somebody who's more experienced.
8:22
And so whether you're trying to get into law or you're trying to get into accounting or you're trying to get into video editing or you're trying to get into sales or you're trying to get into marketing, whatever.
The core activity that you do making videos making ads, writing sales Pages, actually, doing sales calls, whatever it is, if you do 2 times or four times the volume, you will get better faster and pay down your ignorance debt.
8:42
At a faster rate that compounds Kobe Bryant was famous for doing this work.
He would do two practices a day, and he thought if everybody else does one practice today.
If I do two a day, I will get better faster and in the beginning, the difference is not that noticeable, but after five years and then 10 years, he becomes unbeatable because he is he is compounded the number of hours in the trenches learning the thing which is the same reason why he would laugh at an 18 year old who's turning down.
9:09
A massive signing bonus because they want more because they don't realize that they're not as good as they think they are.
And one of the truths that I will tell you right now is that the reason you're not making as much money as one is because you're not as good as you think you are real talk.
So let's make up started at the bottom of this totem pole and then he proved himself is number one on that bottom team.
9:29
Then you got promoted again, use young men on the totem pole.
So his youngest guy there, worked as well because what he realized was that no one was going to give him respect based on his age and rather than bitching and moaning about it.
You know what you can control is what you actually do.
And respect is always earned and the younger, you are, the more you have to earn it and you can either resent the world.
9:50
For not giving you respect that you do not deserve, or you can go get it.
And the thing is that at the end of the day with enough proof, everyone will respect you hustle across age.
Gender culture is always respected, it's one of the universal currencies respect but the problem is that people want the respect before they do the hustle.
10:11
And they have the sequence wrong.
You got to do the hustle and then you get the respect.
So he moved his way up, moved his way up.
Now, he also listened to his mentor and rather than making content about how good he was at sales and selling a thing.
10:28
He just showed the lessons, he was learning along the way.
So, rather than pretending to be the authority, he's just sharing the lessons he's learning, which doesn't make him sound.
Like he's an idiot.
Because everybody who's ahead of him says oh, that makes sense.
That's cool.
He's just providing value rather than posturing flip side.
10:46
I'd you've got Logan, who's going to try and pretend like he knows more than he does because he thinks that's what is required to be successful, but I can promise you all the guys were young and posturing like that.
Don't get clout from guys who got game because we know you don't have enough money to be wearing the shit you wear and driving the car, you drive and flying private and whatever.
11:07
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
11:31
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
What the Killer's look like in their 20s, who become the killers in their 30s.
Don't look like the kid with the lambo in the watch.
They don't look like that.
11:46
And so, the guys who are kingpins at the game, know what they looked like, when they were younger, what they look like, is hungry as fuck to learn and work, and such a difference to displaying it and only to playing it the game as long as they possibly could, because they love the game itself.
12:05
Not the Spoils of the game because if you only love The Spoils of the game, then when you get hit, you can't get back up because the reason you did it to begin with was weak.
And so, if you love the game, then you don't care about the short-term earning it worried about the long-term learning and you only get there through the learning.
So he stacked his way up, stacked his way up then.
12:23
Became one of the top closures in the company.
So you're growing three levels of sales.
All right, in an organization where many people were experts at sales, very good salesman, he was able to learn from them because he's hungry and he did extra hours.
He's now at this point in his career, he could right now probably start a million-dollar your business.
12:43
But again, he could right hook it and do that now or he could reinvest.
He could double down.
And so he got another opportunity to work at a much more prestigious company will get even bigger and better experience.
And guess what?
He's going to get paid less than he was making his current job.
13:00
Why would he do it?
Because he's smart, and he's thinking long.
Not thinking short, if you go for the earning early, you stop the learning and the moment you stop.
The learning is when you Side.
And you tell the universe that I have made enough, this is enough for me.
13:16
I don't need to learn any more.
I am good enough and that crew pride.
And so if you can humble yourself and you realize the dunning-kruger effect exists that you think, you know, more than you do when you start because you don't know anything.
That's why Socrates said like the more I know, the more I realize I know nothing one of the smartest wise people in the world says you knew nothing.
13:36
He wasn't being, you know, humble there, he was, he had an accurate perception of reality.
And so as this, This plays out when we look at this 10 years, from now, in the story of Logan and the story of snake up, I promise you.
This makeup will make more money.
And have a higher net worth, and also have people everyone around him who respect him for the fact that he was willing to do the work and do the learning, and not trying right hook for the burning too early.
14:03
So I'm going to, I'm going to flip to my employer hat for a second.
If someone comes in and I can tell with season, they're in, if they're in the earning season, I will work you like a mule because I know that this is the only exchange if you come in, and I know you're in a learning season and you've said, I'm in a learning.
14:20
Season.
Then we will be so generous with how much we can give and reinvest in you because the exchange when you're coming in and I have to pay you above to get you to come here means that I have to extract more value from you.
Then I pay you.
That's the fundamental of business.
Like, if I don't extract more value, you can't be here.
14:38
So I have to get that much more.
So the expectation of how much you're going to work versus reinvest in yourself, goes higher.
So you might not even have the extra time to reinvest in your learning because the smart business owner is going to try and Pull and squeeze as much.
Is the can't.
But if you come in with a learning hat on then that business owner, understands that maybe in five years, you're not going to be there, okay.
14:58
No big deal if you're upfront about it then they can be like cool.
How can I assist you in your career?
What skill sets do you feel like you lack?
I can pair you with people in the company who are further ahead in the you and help you get mentorship within our company and you learn for free, not only that I'm going to pay you to learn because now I'm increasing the value of my people, but if I have to pay, you top dollar to come in above what you really should make.
15:20
Make then all the comes back to squeezing as much out of that investment as I can.
And that's exactly the situation that Logan went into versus the one that's makeup started at and makeup started at less than half of what Logan started out.
But now it's makeup makes significantly more than Logan does and will make continuously more by under learning versus what he wants to learn.
15:43
So even if he is a half-a-million-dollar, your skill set, our million-dollar your skill set, you can accept you in a grit or 250,000 a year.
He can accept that.
If there's a discrepancy, that makes sense.
So the most important thing you have to realize when you're in your 20s is what season you are in, you have to stop comparing yourself to people who are earning more than you.
16:01
Because it means that what they're doing is often short changing their long-term learning for short-term earning.
And so, if you play the game long, and you can think long and I get how hard this is your brain.
When you're 20 literally hasn't finished growing.
I'm saying this because I changed a lot between twenty and twenty six twenty and twenty seven like my My ability to Think, Through consequences, change it because my prefrontal cortex literally hadn't finished, developing it.
16:26
And I get how hard it is to think in the future because because when you're 25 years ago, you couldn't even drive.
So thinking five years in the future, you're like, oh my God, that's fucking a hundred years from now.
But it happens like this.
And if you can think longer and stop comparing yourself to people that are taking the short term win, you'll decrease, the anxiety.
16:46
You have in your life and if you start comparing yourself to the people who made the big winds later on, Iran.
You will notice that their path is more similar to yours.
It's a Jay, it's really slow in the beginning and then it skyrockets up.
If you make the first jump real fast, then it flat lines and then you have a real hard time because then also happens is that Logan will adjust his lifestyle to his new earnings and he will start displaying his earnings because you get status from that, could he didn't play the game so you wanted to learn it.
17:14
So you liked it.
You did it because you wanted to show something.
And so he's fought unless he changes his literally who he is, but if you can get into learn you learn the most over the Long Haul.
So make sure that you know what season you are in.
There is a time for the earning, but the moment that you decide to make that right hook, it's going to be hard to come back because you're going to earn more and you decide that from here on out, you can't really learn much from people ahead of you because they're not going to give to you the same way you would if you were in their business.
17:42
Yeah.
So if you're like shit, I'm A Logan.
I made that move and I regret it because I'm not learning.
I thought I was going to learn.
I went for the quick and easy money.
You have to do.
Step.
One is admitting that you have a problem, which is good.
If you're thinking that then, get Step One is there.
Step two, is that you have to decouple your self-worth with the current amount of money you make at 18, 19, 20, 25 26.
18:05
You have to decouple that because what the next thing that you're gonna have to do, is you're going to take a pay cut and you're going to take a pay cut by going somewhere, that will actually have people far more advanced than you were willing to invest in you.
And if they're willing to invest in you that, I mean the exchange is not just money, which is why you can't compare two jobs.
18:23
So, let's say, let's say job, number one, pays you 80,000 a year and you're expected to bring all the game and build everything.
And no one there knows anything about the skill that you have that.
You spent a lot of time in your, in your mind, a lot of time, learning versus job to is forty thousand dollars a year.
18:39
And there's tons of dudes who were way ahead of you in that job.
Which one's the better deal?
Well, the answer depends on your time Horizon.
If you only live one more year of your life, then you should do the 80 grand.
But if you think you're gonna live longer than a year or two, then you should do the 40 Grand, increase your earning potential.
18:57
And then later you, right hook life, and you can maximize or realize the potential, you've had over the skills you've stacked twenty-year-old, stay poor because they start trying to earn rather than trying to learn.
They don't realize the season they're in, and they do it out of order.
19:12
And so, they And go and right hook life and get as much they possibly can.
Rather than realizing that when a business is trading with you, the only thing you're getting paid for isn't just money.
You also get paid with experience.
And if you're the one who's coming in, with all the experience, guess what?
You're not getting paid with experience from other people, if you come in for half the price in terms of your salary at a company, that has a way better reputation.
19:34
Way more people ahead of you, you will get paid less in the short run in money, but you will get paid more long-term in skills.
And if you As the season up, you will cap your earning potential fast.
You will be the person who's the little Rockets shoots up Fizzles, and then goes down.
19:51
And then oftentimes because you can't get out of that mindset.
You started another thing, shoot back up.
Start another thing, shoot back up and you can't break through it.
And because you never gave time time to do its work on you because of my favorite sayings in the Bible.
Is that your work works on you more than you work on it.
20:07
And so the work that we do is the thing that builds us more than what we built.
And so if you think of yourself, Elf as the asset that you're ultimately trying to compound over time.
Then why would you not make the investment in the skills that will compound later rather than trying to I'm using Gary's right hook, try to immediately go for the ask from life without ever getting anything else.
20:28
And so, if the first shift that you have to make in your 20s, is that your compensation right now?
Should be majority skills.
Experience learning minority money as you age, the percentage that you're getting paid in experience.
We'll go down experience that.
20:45
So if money is on this side and experiences on this side and the beginning, you've got little money, lots of experience, you're getting paid with as you age, it will start shifting.
So maybe you're in your 30s will get paid half and money, and then half an experience.
And as you're 60 years old, by all means, you get paid mostly in money.
And that's usually how the guys who win the game play.
21:03
And they recognized the young actual Tigers who really are playing the game the right way because we know what we look like at that age.
And it wasn't flashing shit and trying to show off because somebody who like that I already know they're not playing to win.
21:19
They're playing to show and they're really one of those all show.
No, go type people.
And they kept themselves because they don't actually love the game.
And the only way you win this game is buying able to play it forever because the only way you don't quit.
If you think of earning potential as the total amount of value that you can exchange with the marketplace, you're going to be compensated in some way in money and experience, some makeup of that, if you come into a business and a certain percentage is money or smaller percentages money, then you were providing more value than you're being compensated for and if you were in a good company, you will be compensated back in excess of what that experience.
21:58
Is that will further increase your earning potential and then you can even Trade that earning potential for again, a bigger chunk of cash but you still have Goodwill built into the exchange with the business.
And so if you can just like a brand wants to undersell, its demand in terms of its tax of Goodwill and it makes a light ask and then it continues to do good.
22:17
Will as a personal brand for an employee or somebody who has a career you want to follow the same mindset of its.
I'm okay.
Under monetizing the shore because I'm compounding my earning potential and the earning potential itself, your ability to provide value.
Will compound with time, especially as you start pairing skills.
22:36
So, I'll give the example of jzx.
I like this one a lot.
So, if you think about Jay-Z in the beginning of his career, right?
He was well before, or after he was drugged, the first part is right of his career.
So first thing he did, was he learned how to wrap?
All right.
22:51
That was your maybe he had Rhythm.
That was a skill and then he turned he figured out how to do the lyrics, okay?
And they figured out how to put those together, start to make a little bit more and then he started learning how to promote so sharp promoting himself.
Another skill significantly more money.
And then after that, figured out, how to do a record label and distribute even more money and then after that, he figured out how to recruit other artists and get them sound on his label even more money.
23:12
And so it happens is that he still needs these early skill sets even though he didn't monetize them hard there, he monetize them big later and so skills will compound.
If you have 1 plus 1 plus 1, it doesn't equal 3 when it comes to skills.
If you are good at math.
Cool.
23:28
If you learn bookkeeping a little bit more, if you learn how to become an accountant, even More.
If you are start understanding taxes and insurance, all of a sudden you're a CFO.
Now, if you start understanding Ma and mergers entity structures, all of a sudden, you're not only a CFO, you are a Rainmaker at that point, you're someone who can bring in deals, execute deals, Etc.
23:46
And the earning potential difference between somebody who's just a bookkeeper, an account is large and a Rainmaker is tens of millions of dollars per year.
And so, even though these skills are like this, the earning potential Stacks like that.
And the thing is, is if somebody who is an accountant, who could eventually become A Rainmaker takes too early and doesn't have other rainmakers around them early on in their career.
24:07
They won't know it exists.
They'll never understand.
The deaf is they have and will always wonder why they can't move ahead.
And it's because they tried to exchange one hundred percent of their potential earning for money today rather than leaving some in the tank so they could get deposited in from others.
So they could earn more tomorrow.








0:00
It's a much harder question to answer.
What are the things that bring me joy?
Then answering the question.
What does things I hate you?
Like why?
I hate my job and I hate my relationship and I hate the city.
Okay, those are all very changeable, welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:19
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Everyone, I'm Brian Elliott.
Welcome to another episode of the show.
Alex, thanks for having us to your home grown Mission Control.
It's great to be here in Las Vegas.
Thank you for having me very excited.
0:34
I guess having me and we're having each other.
Okay, so having me on your show.
Well I usually ask my guests.
How did you get this job this job?
Yeah.
So I was a Management Consultant right out of college.
0:51
I did space, I burned it.
Elgin for the military which was sounds much cooler than it really was, but I had a top secret clearance.
It sounded really good at dinner parties in just about only that.
And you know one day I looked out for my balcony.
Exciter really nice place because I could afford at the time and I was like, is this it?
1:08
And I was, you know, in my young 20s and, you know, at that point, I had done everything that I think I was supposed to do.
So I was, you know, I did well in school.
I, you know, was president of all the clubs, you know, graduating three years got the good job.
I realized it was I was living you know life for me that my father wanted me to live.
1:27
And so that was kind of you know, when I faltered back and forth probably a period of six months, I've really not wanting this to be my life but not wanting to let my dad down.
And so at some point, the thing that kind of pushed me over the edge was I can either, you know, die to myself, where I can talk to my father and the end of the day, you know, I have to survive.
1:47
So I will, if I make this decision and he no longer wants to be my dad, then I can Cept.
That wow.
Is that extreme then?
Yes.
Wow say more about that.
Where are you an only child?
Yeah so only child raised by single father Middle Eastern he was born in Iran and you know I everything in my life up until that point was really just to make him proud so I it was very much a seeking approval seeking validation kind of drive at that point in my life and so the idea of disappointing him or not getting his approval felt like death.
2:21
And at that point I was Really contemplating not living, which is why that it really and it's a common theme.
If you have lots of money to stuff mortality has been the single biggest driver and the biggest decisions that I've made in my life and it has become a routine process for decision-making for me in general because I think it provides Clarity and it provides context to most of the decisions we have which the vast majority of them don't matter which is helpful in and of themselves and then you know beyond that.
2:52
It's Helps me make the decisions that I think four moves everyone else from The Playbook.
Because if you if you study subjective well-being and how people perceive how they're doing in their own lives, it looks like a smiley face.
So seven-year-olds think they're killing life and then it drops dramatically between 20 and 30 and then there's still a little bit more of a dip right around 45.
3:12
That's like, when people are their true sense, they hate life the must and then and then it kind of slowly goes up into like 55 60 and then it shoots right back up again.
When people see that there, Going to die and that life is short and that they can make the decisions without worrying about the ramifications of other people.
3:27
And some of the people there worried about are also dead, right?
And so, it was using that context for that biggest decision.
That's been duplicated many times in my life since then, because if I have a good decision making algorithm, I try and reuse it as many times as I can.
Yeah, there's a lot there.
No, I like it.
3:45
It's just making me think.
I mean, I have watched maybe all of your videos so I have some contacts but maybe let's unpack it for the audience a little bit.
So, you know, when we're seven let's let's let's expand that a little bit mean we don't have a care in the world, the artist or the whatever we want to be is not been beaten out of us yet.
4:07
No one's told us that we are not what we think we are.
We're still popping wheelies and climbing trees and falling out and that's okay.
And then you get to your 20s and 30s and rubber hits the road a little bit.
And if you've made money, I guess and if that's your way of validating your work or that's your sign of success, then you're okay.
4:28
But if not your kind of hosed and then when your 40s I'm guessing you start to have more life experience 50s.
Maybe you start caring less People think and then fast forward all the way to maybe near death and then you really get to a point where you don't care what anyone says and you really boil it down to what's important.
4:50
And probably, I'm guessing that's love relationships Legacy.
And then you're just like, peace out, the pretty accurate.
I think for most people.
Yes, for me, specifically, the Legacy piece less.
So, but I think for most people, yes.
5:06
And why is the Legacy piece less important?
More so.
And whenever I get into this topic, I think a lot of, like, some people get sensitive about it.
And so, I just like to put the disclaimer, like, this is not be judging your beliefs and me stating my beliefs is in no way.
Yeah, a judgment on anyone else, but if you just look at expanding the time Horizon over a much longer period of time.
5:24
If you look at it at in 10,000 years or 100,000 years or a million years, right?
All of a sudden, you know, and the easy way to test, this is to go backwards, right?
Which is do, you know your great-great-great-great great-great-grandfather?
Probably not.
And then, if you look at it from a how much I somebody, Chief standpoint.
5:41
I happen to be an interesting situation where my great great grandfather was in the ruling class in Iran, and he had 400 children.
So he would literally, you know, like ruled and had a lot of wealth.
He had a lot of wives to create 400 children, right?
And I actually still can't remember his name because I my dad told me one time and I can't remember it.
6:00
And I've never seen any of the quote Legacy that.
I'm sure he felt like he was leaving.
And so if that was that level of success and Legacy and only for five generations later, I don't even remember them as Name.
Nor do I have any piece of that Legacy?
Yeah.
It seems a little bit irrelevant.
Yeah.
6:16
I totally see what you're saying and that context matters.
I mean Prince died.
A couple of years ago.
Right.
Right.
I see I know it.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Prince prince.
I thought it was formerly known as is he is that he get that removed to.
6:33
He's now back to being, I think a toggled back to Prince and then, unfortunately, he, I think he Accidentally overdosed, and he passed and, you know, one of the greatest musicians of all time and I didn't think about it until you just said this.
6:50
Yes.
So what chance do I have?
I'm screwed and I think in a long enough time Horizon, we're all screwed.
And I think in some ways people find that incredibly disheartening but an equal opposite is you can't find it both disheartening and also not freeing because all of the decisions that we're making that are not for ourselves or are subject to change that We feel pressure from whether that be Society, societal up a quotes there.
7:14
Cause that's a big word or family friends.
Expectations.
That we perceive others.
People's have us.
If you can, if you can, just relinquish all of those chains.
I think it's incredibly freeing and I choose to live that way.
Yeah.
I also try to definitely feel it.
7:31
No, that's it.
Here, that's fair and I think also that may help us advice is good because it helps us live in the moment because You know, even if you believe in something after that's still in the future.
Yeah.
And there's a question mark because no one actually knows, you know, with knowledge.
7:50
Yeah.
At least someone with a pulse.
Yeah.
Doesn't know what happens or if something happens.
So you might as well live in the present.
Make the best of it.
Yeah, an interesting one that I thought through around that was a lot of us.
A lot of us.
All of us have 100% experience, not being alive, right was before we were, before we were born, we were not alive and so we know That was like there was nothing that we can recollect and so I would imagine that.
8:14
That's the closest experience that we can have to not being live yet again, which to me is not that frightening.
Yeah, and it is freeing your right because it's both humbling to know that you don't matter in the grand scheme of things.
But at the same time, you matter infinitely, if you just focus on the present and the mark that you're going to leave here and now I contemplated, I had to die to my father.
8:37
And I Know Myself and I realized that I would rather die to him.
Which pretty much ended up happening.
And so my fears were relatively Justified, he was not in support of the things that I wanted to do.
I ended up quitting that job, sold everything.
I had packed my car went to California cause that's where I thought the land of Fitness opportunity was because that was the only thing I really enjoyed mentored under a guy for a few months to try and at least learn the ropes started.
8:57
My first facility slept on the floor for the first nine months, which was a very terrible experience for me and timestamp.
The age for me now I was 23.
Okay, left at 22 and I turned 23 to weeks after my gym open, guys.
You graduated early, you got that dream job and then, you bailed.
9:13
Yeah, two years.
And that was really at the time.
It was at the splitting point where I done two years in the kind of career path.
Traditionally is like two to four years of management consulting.
And then you go back to an ivy league for your GMAT.
And then from there, you go into, you know, you can, you can go do investment banking a new private Equity, you can do, you know, some of the bigger white-collar jobs, but I did want more of what I had.
9:35
And so I thought that I would have a better shot taking two hundred thousand dollars in two years.
Which is what the, you know, economic equivalent of what the degree was and starting something on my own.
And I figured I would learn more in the first two years and with that money and maybe even have a business by the end of that period of time that made an equivalent amount of money.
Compared to what I would have had as a job offer.
9:53
Let me ask you.
I talked a lot about signals on this show to other people in my personal life.
I-i've had signals that were subtle some more over the subtle ones I missed and then had to learn later.
But how did you what signals did you Get.
10:10
I mean, you're saying like, I wasn't feeling it, but like so, where was your motivation?
Because I see you as this Hustler, this go-getter this, you know, salesperson.
You know who just is all about gobbling up new opportunities, it transcends beyond that now.
10:28
But like at first, it sounds like you are just all about to go get but how did you know like you craft you drifted into fitness?
Because you were in a maybe you know, I mean at first I was driven by Okay.
It was all fear, fear failure, feel of disappointment, fear of other people's judgment.
10:48
What is your dad end up saying?
Did he say good luck with you?
Well, I thought it was stupid either.
I was wasting my life.
Yeah, and wasted a degree that he'd spent money on and yeah, wasted a good job for opportunity that he had set up for me all these things right in his defense.
Did he immigrated here?
11:03
Yeah.
Okay.
So in his defense I never said, right?
And I just want to tell the audience so they're not.
But but it's like, You know if you have justified in saying yeah if you escape from a country where there's trauma and impending danger than your son squanders an opportunity, you might get a little anxious about that.
11:25
I want to pursue.
I mean my dad came here with a thousand dollars.
You know.
And at a medical degree.
Yeah.
And then built every didn't speak English.
Right?
I think your review said this but I think what he did was harder than what I've done.
Like I got to I got to stand on his shoulders.
Okay, you know, in what way?
11:42
I mean I speak English like just the basics.
Like I speak English.
I went to a good school, just all the support infrastructure, known and unknown, that was around me.
Yeah.
So, you know, to be so gospel.
Yeah.
I think it's healthy to recognize your privilege.
Yeah, but the same time, you know, it came with lots of baggage to interesting, okay.
12:03
And so you had signals which were mainly fear-based.
Yeah.
And I mean, the biggest thing that made the decision for me.
I would say I'd the lat The decision and then I had the emotional decision.
The emotional decision was I don't want to do this, this is not the life I want to lead.
I'm not happy doing this every day.
12:19
I would prefer to not be alive.
If this is what my life will be continuously.
And I was like, well if that is what if I would prefer to not be alive, then that kind of opens up my decision calculus and what was it?
I'm trying to put my finger on.
What was it that made you happy?
Was it just the freedom to do what you want?
I didn't know.
It made me happy.
I knew it was not making me happy.
12:35
Okay.
Yeah.
So I think that's another important lesson to if I can just extract them which is One, you know, I'm sure a lot of people watching, they feel the same kind of family pressure, they want to be what other people expect them to be if you know if that's who you are, that's totally normal.
12:52
But we should always remember, you know, the context in which that advice is given could be given through the lens of a certain they live that certain lifestyle, a certain timeframe but also you know, you said it's a process of elimination sometimes isn't it?
13:10
Like you don't always know reason.
I think about this is I've got a son who is in eighth grade and sometimes I see him look looking very serious and I'm like some, what's up?
How are you feeling?
What are you feeling be that bad.
It's kind of like you know you can see it kind of the face kind of going in and you seem a deep thought and like what are you thinking about right now?
13:30
He's like I don't know what my college majors going to be.
Yeah my bro.
Yeah you're in eighth grade.
Why are you thinking about that right now?
But like I think that's a thing.
Mmmmm, whether you're young or middle-aged, you're trying to figure out what you want to be.
13:45
When you grow up, you're trying to have it all figured out because we don't seems like we don't like uncertainty.
But I think your message if I'm hearing you is, sometimes you have to try it on for size to see if it fits or not and you get it on your like well I thought that dream job was going to be like perfect but turns out you know it's tight in the crotch you know it's like I need Different.
14:11
Hmm.
Nothing giving yourself permission to do that.
And it was a side to what you were saying about my dad, like education saved his life.
Like he was only able to leave the country because he was educated.
And so there's very deep roots, they're not going to appreciate that.
But for this contact or for my life, it just wasn't appropriate, right?
14:27
And when we did come to terms later, the only time he's ever apologize to me my life, he said after his apology he qualified and said, but to be fair, in my time, I would have been.
Right?
Well, absolutely.
And he would have This is not the same time, right?
Yeah.
Absolutely.
14:43
It wasn't that it was inappropriate was just out of context and didn't necessarily translate to this new life and New Opportunities you had.
Yeah, I think that's so important.
I can't imagine how many people are sort of, you know, suppressed to the point of their parents or the people that have influence around them.
15:04
Put on them.
Yeah.
Are sometimes it's on ourselves.
It's most, I mean, mostly I love the saying In our 20s were concerned about what everyone thinks about us.
In our 40s, we don't care what anyone thinks about us.
And in our 60s, we realize that owners thinking about studying with right?
And I just I just feel like that's I mean, who else have you thought about today besides yourself?
15:22
Probably not.
I mean, you have your kids which is an extension yourself but you know, like yeah, not a lot.
And so most people are like that and you know, we have a lot more leeway than I think we give ourselves credit for and I think the more that I have now, you know, I'll say accomplished with quotes in material success, the more I am excited about the things that I can do, and It was like the opening of the book was like there are no rules and it just took me a very long time to realize that I continue to unlearn rules that.
15:46
I thought existed, you know, as I continue to go on this journey.
Yeah, I love that idea of unlearning.
I think we all just try to go back to being like we were when we were children.
Like if you like just because when you're a child, your purely present, yours present in the moment, and I don't like the word happy very much I prefer using Joy, because you can be, you can mourn joyfully, because it's a, it's a, it's internal.
16:10
Other than happiness that I feel is more like happenstance.
It's more from external.
And so, you know, what are the things that bring you Joy?
Where the things that I find, you know, find joy in and I think for anyone who's listening, it's a much harder question to answer.
What are the things that bring me joy?
Then answering the question.
16:27
What does things I hate?
And it's easier to correct those first like why?
I hate my job and I hate my relationship and I hate the city.
Okay, those are all very changeable and a lot of times you get there.
Bye-bye.
Inversion.
Well if I wanted to destroy my life, I wanted to have the worst life possible.
16:43
What would I do?
And then taking all those things that you would do to really destroy your life and make your life miserable and then reverse them.
It's a much easier way to solve the positive psychology equation, in my opinion.
Yeah, I love that.
And I'm remembering this, this Picasso quote, which is I think he said everyone is born an artist, right?
17:01
And then eventually we, you know, get convinced that we're not.
Yeah.
And we have to really just strip away and get, you know, Get Back to Basics and I'm using our Metaphorically to.
It's like what you do and acquisition not calm or what you did in the fitness industry or what I'm doing with film.
17:16
You know this can be considered our art other percent - not that great but you know everyone can be an artist and perfect their art you know, I love that.
Okay.
So you get to Fitness, You're The Apprentice to a Master.
You're not swole, yet I'm guessing I was less full you're getting there.
17:35
I was actually I'd already.
I was, you know, I was competing at that point so I was but I was a strength Competitor.
So I was very strong for my body was dead lifts.
Yeah.
As a power lifter, and then I started my gym and that was the first day that Fitness became second in my life.
17:51
So up until that point, I was Fitness, obsessed and everybody.
I worked with was like, dude, you should quit this job and start a gym.
It's all you talk about all day and it was what I was obsessed with.
And so maybe like my go getting was really directed towards that and I figured this is the only thing that I did, know that I like that.
And so I was like, okay I'll do more of that.
18:07
And then when I started the gym, I realized I was doing none of that I was starting a business.
Business which had nothing to do with.
I mean, insofar, as I was selling Fitness, there was a component of it but the vast majority of my day, had nothing to do with Fitness whatsoever.
But I did find out that I like business more than Fitness and that was.
And that's where I think that there's been a lot of luck in my life, where, you know, I just so happened to really enjoy the thing that happens to be rewarded by the marketplace with a lot of money.
18:31
You know, I like that is where I feel like there's there's a lot of luck that has lied up in my life and it's indirect ways like that.
I just happen to love this and so, and because of that, I will do it for a long period of time for more than most people and enjoy learning about it and talk to people in my free time and do everything I can, because it's just the thing.
18:49
I like, and it just so happens to be rewarded monetarily.
Well, yeah, and also, you know, the physical benefits from it, right?
I mean, you can Turley.
You put in the work you can see the result, right?
It's one of those very empirical, right.
19:07
Very measurable.
Right.
But it's like yeah.
It's and I think I've heard you talk a lot about choosing the right market.
Like if you're not in something that can scale, you might want to rethink that if scalability or profitability is your goal, perhaps, you're, you're not in a market that can scale.
19:29
Yeah.
And we can talk about that in a minute.
Okay.
So that is all you build it, you build the gym, your repertoire.
Yeah.
And and then you start acquiring Jim's.
What are you doing?
No.
So I so I opened up for more location side.
19:45
Five total on in Southern California.
Was it under the umbrella of this side for under that umbrella and then the fifth one I did on my own.
So I ended up starting the gyms on my own on months and I let two partners in for lack of a better term.
I sold two thirds of the Be in my business for basically nothing.
20:02
And at that point I was already making 20,000 a month take home and they said that it wasn't valuable and in some ways they were right in other ways, they were not either way, that is what happened and then from there, I stayed in that partnership.
20:19
I ended up staying in partnership, with one of the guys, we didn't work well with the other guy and then after that guy was no longer the partnership.
I disagreed with the The other partner over time.
Not on a personal level.
We actually got along really well, but just business strategy-wise.
20:36
I wanted to be a premium price leader.
He wanted to be the low cost leader and so that it was just, it just depends.
So we ended up just meeting them at all which was a very mediocre business.
And so I start wanted to start my own facility with kind of like my own Credo and that was the fifth gym which was body Force Lake Forest.
And that Jim did really well, that Jim, I acquired compared to the other for the other four.
20:55
I started this one.
I acquired and I acquired for no money down for 50 thousand dollars over.
A year.
And so I basically took the whole gym over and then had to pay four thousand dollars a month of the owner and I mean fifty thousand dollars in the first month and so I was like this is great and that's when I realized that I was I made so much money launching an opening gyms and then I didn't even really care as much about the running afterwards.
21:16
I mean, I knew how to do it, I just like the launches, they were more exciting.
And so I decide to go for a model where we'd fly around and just like launch and fill other people's gyms.
And so this is right around the time that I'm at my my now wife.
And so I pitched her the idea on our State and asked her to quit her job, which was obviously the most reasonable thing to do when you're talking to the top sales rep at 24 Hour Fitness, which she was at 23.
21:40
And so it's like, listen, this may not work out, but we'll make a ton of money together, you should come work with me, she didn't say yes.
So I went and I launched three gyms.
I came back five weeks later and I asked her to help me process the contracts.
So we did a processing like, 120 Grand in an hour.
21:55
And she looked at me, she was like this the thing that you started, and I was like, yeah, just like, is it legal?
Well, that was our first much as illegal as I guess it's legal.
And she was, can you teach me how to do it?
I was like, yeah, just like art of it.
And so that was when she quit her job and then she and I started launching these gyms together.
22:12
We did that for almost a year, still very very very hard time for me financially most because I was just way I had so many poor decisions.
I was paying off at all times.
I then ended up saying, you know what?
I'm going to sell my gyms and transition during this period of time.
22:28
I got a DUI head-on My mother went to the hospital.
That's why I actually did those first gyms because they were all around the hospital.
So I wanted to keep busy.
And so, you know, there is it was there's a lot of Bittersweet during this whole period of time.
Like that processing contracts is after I came back from, like, the house one time I was, so, it's just, like, just a lot of different, like things I was going through and selling the partnership that I had.
22:49
There was really hard for me again.
It was like this, you know, need for validation approval and I had noticed that over my life until I solve this problem.
It kept Reoccurring which was I always wanted to find father figures.
And so the guy that I did the apprenticeship with like the very beginning of the story, I was saying earlier, like I ended up getting in a really weird financial situation with him, which didn't end.
23:15
Well, we ended up making up years later, it was, it was fine.
But like there was a long period of time that we were estranged.
Both those guys came in very father-like figure feelings.
I got in a partnership with another like, so, I kept repeating the same mistake until I had to learn like you keep doing this.
So You should stop and I looked at my track record and all the businesses that I had only owned myself.
23:36
I made a ton of money in, in all the businesses that I partnered with, I had no money and lost money in, and I was like, huh?
Maybe I should do more of that.
So, at this point, you know, we're launching the gyms and whatnot and I sold all the gyms and entered another partnership with one of the guys that I had launched.
23:53
He's like, dude, I'll come behind you, you shouldn't be giving up all the backside like back end of all these launches, like, I'll come behind you and Phil, did you know?
And Manage the gyms and that way, every gym you launch you own.
So I think the you can own 12 gems and you can just launch them in film said, but I have some Financial, you know, issues, nothing big.
24:10
I was indicted once.
No big deal, big misunderstanding and I was like, of course.
He's 60.
You'll have to sign everything from all the money.
All the stuff goes but it was like, sure, of course, why wouldn't we?
So I sold on my gyms put all the money into the bank account for the new business that we're going to start, you know, where this is going.
24:26
So 400 people just a massive launch for a small gym in a matter of like, Weeks woke up all the money was gone.
He was like that was my half the profits.
As if you haven't made any profit, we started the gym with the money.
He's like, well, the fact that you spent it is your fault, not mine.
24:42
And so like that, all the money I've done from all my gyms, at this point, four years of my life was gone and I was saddled with the gym that had no money in it with 400 members and payroll that I didn't have money to pay for when I couldn't sell people, because if I sold them, I'll have to continue to fulfill them and I didn't want to be in.
24:57
I didn't want to own more gems.
I just sold all my dreams.
Yeah.
And so, at that point, I sent Layla to go launch gym in Hawaii.
She crushed it.
She did a hundred thousand in collected and that was enough to fund all the refunds for all of the members to gracefully which was not graceful, exit the facility.
25:16
Wow.
Yeah, I ain't talking about signals.
Miss signals, learning lessons the hard way, but brutal.
But also, I mean, story of my life I could I could talk about similar things where I just First, I had literally had to get beat up and continue making the same mistake so very relatable.
25:38
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
25:58
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
I'll see the rest of.
So now here we are so much as passionately.
There's, we're like not even there's way more bad that happens after that.
26:16
So, but the thing is, I'm telling this in, it's all this happened in like a nine month period.
So this was just insane.
And so like my mother getting sick, the ending the Partnerships, the new partnership.
The money gets getting taken my DUI head-on collision.
So, the head-on collision actually was the next big Catalyst for me, because that was yet again.
26:36
Was faced with my own mortality.
And I it re re prioritize things again.
It was like, Hey, idiot.
Yeah.
And so, I that point, I had a partner that I had to marketing agencies with, by the way started that on the side, I'm a chiropractor in it.
26:52
And a dental agency, I had my five Jim locations with a different partner.
I had now the one current location that I'd started with the new partner, right?
And I had the launch business, we're launching turning around and watches and I'm 20 Six.
Yeah, I'm imagining, you know, those plates Spinners.
27:09
You've got at least nine plates going, I was drinking a half, a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black overnight to function.
Not to like, not to get drunk, to not to feel back to not being stressed.
That was the only thing and, like, some people have, like, I would never have called myself an alcoholic.
27:27
This it was like, I still function fine.
I never was drunk at work or anything like that.
I just every night.
I would just drink that to like, breathe.
Yeah, how's your Escape?
Yeah.
It was it He's very much to skate because I wasn't handling the things that I needed to handle.
And so I had a coach at that time.
It was morally more, just a therapist and he said, Alex, your stress is literally going to kill you.
27:47
And so, that was right after I had the DUI in the head-on collision.
And so you need to change them.
Like, what are you afraid of you?
You almost died.
So fuck it.
And so I ended that partnership ended the partnership with the agencies.
28:02
I talk believe it or not, even after the money was taken, I was still a partnership.
That sounds like, maybe he's right.
Like I knew, I knew that it was fraudulent when I showed him the financials and highlighted everything and was like there's no other money that was here and he didn't want to look at it.
28:17
And that's when I was like he doesn't actually think that I took the money.
He he was making a reason.
I'm so so anyways, I got out of all of that stuff, I lost all my money and then I was back at zero.
And this was now, this was November of 16.
28:33
So I'm now three or four years later from Me opening the gym on the floor.
So all of this stuff happened quickly and that point we want to go launch a gym because Layla was like, hey, I quit my job for this so you know.
Can we like still do the thing?
You said you were going to do and so we realized that.
Okay, I'm going all in on the gym launch business and I want to go watch this team in San Diego, and this guy had reached out to me, because you'd like, followed me excited made some content about gem stuff, not much.
28:57
And he said, I've got any more kid.
I really need this money.
Like, let me sell for this, this gym.
And he was, it just so happened to be 15 minutes from South like, I jumped all over the nation that I was doing one at a time and he happen to reach out to me and it happened in extras how so I figured all right maybe someones looking out for this guy.
29:13
Okay, cool cell, it'll give me time to get all the materials ready so we can launch way more Jim's next month.
He crushed it does a hundred thousand dollars in sales which is like a big launch and I owed him.
Twenty two thousand dollars in commissions after Layla's launch and paying all the refunds and everything I had 23,000 dollars.
29:29
Yeah.
So I paid him the 22 and the hundred thousand dollars that I made from the sales number came because the Processor because of the refunds from the gym before shut us down and said, there's a regular activity.
There's too many can play as well, which is reason why I shut him down right after like, right and so they said we're gonna hold on to this underground.
29:46
And so I now had a thousand dollars total during this period of time.
Before I knew that we weren't gonna be able to get the money Layla had told her six best friends, quit their jobs in join us at Jim launch and so I find out on Christmas Eve at laila's parents house where I'm meeting them for the first time that I had one lost, all my money.
30:06
To Oliver forensic, quit their jobs and are going to start selling for us.
The next on the 26th, at two days later and on that 26:33 hundred a day was going to start getting debited for my account because I didn't have the money that was supposed to be coming for that hundred grand.
30:22
So I thought Leo down was like, I pulled the credit card out and I was like I have 100,000 or limit on this car.
It was from all my gym.
So it's like my master.
Like working capital card, is it?
But I want you to know that, like you can leave now and we're cool.
Like I won't judge you like carte blanche, you can leave and where I'm like I was like this is a very low likelihood of working.
30:43
This is probably like a 10 to 15 percent shot that this actually works.
And that's when she said, I'll She's like, I'd sleep with you, in over two became to that.
And so, that was what, that was what I knew that like, we were like, she was at choose the one she's with me ride, or die.
30:59
Like she's the girl.
I'm gonna marry.
Yeah.
And so, what a moment.
Yeah, it was great.
There's actually, honestly, I felt numb at the time from everything, but later, I can appreciate it.
So, we started the start of the cow starting debited 3400.
A, here's the catcher we started doing, you know, what was it we're doing.
31:18
We did like 200 Grand the first month, so, that's Today this is this is where it gets hairy.
I didn't have a processor so we're getting seven thousand dollars a day in contracts that I cannot process and the money is still coming out, right?
The end of the month, I get one processor turned on after calling every single day, right?
31:36
I was calling friends of like, hey can you process contracts?
I'll give you 10% just send me the money after and they're like this sounds really sketchy.
No.
And they were right to not do that.
Yeah.
So processors are gets turned on at the end of the month but they said, hey, it's a new business.
So we'll give You a fifty thousand dollar limit.
31:52
I was like, dude, I need 200 Grand like yesterday.
Like 50,000 is the limit, so I called the guy up and he said, well, it's per month.
So and I got it like two days before the end of the month.
He said, so you can run 50 Grand today and in two days you can run 50 Grand again.
So it's like okay and that's what I did.
I ran 50 Grand in two days after 150 Grand, which is enough to cover the hundred thousand dollars to 3300 a day that was coming out in card.
32:14
So I made literally, I mean, like $100 profit that first month and then he got two more turned on.
So I got to cut up like 180 or so and then he doubled the 50 to 100 to get 200,000 in limit the next month.
So we hit the full 200 the next month, but we're still building from shit from last month while still making and still playing catch-up, but we made like a little bit of profit that months.
32:34
I was like okay I think I'm in the clear.
So I think we might have but wait, there's more.
And so now we're going to march to this is January is the first month February is.
When we started we're playing catch-up on processing March, March comes and I just wrote the store out of my books, all the details of fresh If we get the call, Layla comes up to me.
32:55
I'm like thinking life is good.
I think we're out of the out of everything and she's like, she's like white and I was like, what's going on?
And she turned her laptop to me.
And there was just, just Scrolls of - transactions on our account.
33:11
I was like, what am I looking at Jews?
Like These are all refunds.
I'll say again how I we already did all the refunds from that.
Jim like we can't they can't refund again.
Like we already gave all the except body was from the gym.
Like, way back.
When we, that I had to shut down.
She was like, no one of the gym owners that we launched got up on a chair and told everyone to refund, he just said go home.
33:29
I can't deal with all this, because we had taken him from 70 to 270 clients in a month, it was three.
I mean, it was just, it was just on fat, the amount of infrastructure that's required to handle that, which I had thought through.
I was like, you want a plus sales, marketing.
We will suck.
We will sell your gem.
We'll play your drama.
Yeah, and so, that's that's what we did.
33:46
And then he refunded everything.
So that just blew all the profit from the month before.
For and that was horrible.
But then I was like, okay, one off, circumstance happens.
Not a big deal like we'll get through.
It will just do more launches.
It's fine.
Two weeks later.
34:03
She comes back again and she's like it's happening again.
I was like, what he's talking about.
Just like the refund thing is, he can't refund, like, we known can refine.
Like we already gave all the money back.
What do they want?
And she said, no to Jim's told the clients to refund and then by the same services from them for half price since we had left after selling.
34:21
So it's like some comes in.
We sell a membership, you know, for the way we did it, we do a six week program for like five or 600 bucks.
They would pay for it.
We'd keep that money for the Marketing sales, hotel rental car.
Everything I'd spend commissions that's Keeping whatever was left, was the profit right after that.
34:36
That Jim got all these customers for free to convert.
Yes, it's like you got really yeah, you got really high qualified customers because these aren't trial customers, they're paying, you know, 600 bucks to be there.
So like they care they'll show up, they'll follow instructions and you should if you're doing a right convert 70% on the back end so like you just got to wait, you got to provide fulfillment for six weeks and most gyms have fixed costs.
34:55
Not a lot of variable costs and so they didn't really need to staff up that much not a ton right to handle that.
And so, these guys are just like you You know would be cooler is if we just told them all to refund in the we got half the money, right?
And then that gives them a reason and and they have the unethical.
Yeah.
35:10
And they had the relationship, the clients I did, but I held the bag for the processing.
So anyways, they they did that and that's why I'm sweet 150,000 in refunds.
And again, I have no money and so it was like this impossible situation where I looked at Leyland I was like, okay, if you fly, I fly out.
35:30
We can both do 100,000 and we can make sure the gyms don't do anything stupid.
And we can cover the 150.
And I just remember this other thing that she said to me, which was she was like, Alex, like We can't sell our way out of this.
Like, if we do that, we're just going to create more like, there's going to be more refunds, like the amount of refunds is going to keep going up.
35:47
And so I didn't, I really didn't know what to do.
And so at that point, she had this little side business because she's so have.
I still wasn't sure how things were going to work out.
So she was doing like three or four thousand a month from our personal training clients that you transition to online.
And as I'm trying to like to think of every possible idea Under the Sun, including like me being a prostitute didn't matter.
36:06
I just was like whenever I can make to get 150 Grand.
Yeah, I didn't I mean It was him 100 Grand in Revenue.
It'll be out of here in profit that I could come up with otherwise.
Her friends were going to get paid, right?
You can feel the stress.
I so I sit her down.
I was like, wait.
So 34 thousand one, the switcher costume that she was like nothing.
36:22
It's like, okay, what if we blow your business on forget - clearly I sock because like what if we just blow you up?
And so she said yes and I spent I'm pretty much every waking moment.
After that writing the best sales copy of my entire life writing an amazing ad campaign and launched everything within like 48 hours and then Within Your days, we were doing thousand bucks a day.
36:43
I've just heard someone over the phone with no fulfillment is just like online programs for her weight loss program.
And I was like this could work because if I get the eight sales guy, so we had at the time to come not have to travel anymore.
They all do a thousand bucks a day.
We do eight thousand a day after commission's, we have about 150 Grand.
36:58
Yeah, that's a overhead and all right.
Yeah, exactly and also in no gym owner their nose going to refund because no don't telling the refund.
And so that was the plan.
I told you the plan.
She was good with it.
And so we had eight gyms that were supposed to launch the next Month.
So I called those guys up and I was like, Hey, we're not doing it anymore, change the direction, whatever in the first guy tells me this long story about how his friend had referred him.
37:18
And then we had saved his friends, Jim and how he was going to lose his house and that he had refinance, everything he maxed out all his cards, he quit his job.
Spent two years on making any money for the gym that he needed this sob story.
Yeah, and I said, cool, not really my problem because like everything that happened this point, I was like my level of give a fuck was very low.
37:39
And so I said, sorry, man.
That can you can you at least show me what you did at my friend's place and I'll just do it, try and do it myself.
And at this point, I needed money, right?
And so, I was like, maybe, but I also didn't want to go create this whole thing because I knew the value of focus and learn that lesson at this point.
37:56
And so I said, fine, I'll show you how to do it, but I'm not gonna fly out there.
Save your ass.
We can't sell when he said, no, it's fine, it's fine.
And so he said how much?
And at the time I pick the highest number I can possibly think of because I thought I wanted him to say no.
So I can move on with my life.
What's your IP worth?
Yeah.
And so I said six thousand dollars my do this is the sort of doing a hundred thousand dollars every single day.
38:15
We launched a month and he's like deal and I still remember I looked at the phone and I was like holy shit I kept and then I just like cool card you when you use it and I wrote it down on a napkin and you know finish the phone call or whatever.
38:30
Layla.
And I was like, holy shit.
I was like this guy just paid six thousand dollars for like all of our like sales scripts and all the stuff.
How soon did you realize you left a ton of money on the table?
Well, this, this was the moment and so at so I was like, I think I think there's something here.
38:48
And so I went and called the rest of the guys that were supposed to watch the next month or seven more guys.
And and in the next guy, how much a grand next time?
How much 10 grand next out and then I did 60 thousand dollars in sales that day.
You see how elastic it was.
Yeah.
And there's yeah.
And I saw it 60 Grand one day and I mean, it was did change my life.
39:09
And so that's when I was like, I think we're still in the gym business.
I think we're just doing it wrong.
She's like, so we're not doing the weight loss thing.
As I guess, not think we're going to do this.
She's like, well, how we're going to get new customers?
Those are.
Well, we don't worry about that yet because I'm going to call the 30-something other gyms that we did the launches for and be like, hey remember I filled your gym up want to see how I did it.
39:27
And within the next month, I think we collected 200,000 in cash, but we ended up doing like four or five hundred thousand dollars in sales.
So let me ask you more about this system was it like written down somewhere?
It was my whole gym openings Like how I would do these longitude you have videos and, like module can watch the step one, two, three.
39:45
So so, the way that I had structured, this, the, the old gym launched version is, we would fly out to do these turnarounds, right?
I have more questions about this.
I'm sorry.
Well, I want to ask you because I'm sure that there's a lot of people who want to create modules or learning modules are teaching modules, whether they are doing it, in-house for them.
40:01
People are, they want to learn or maybe create their own, the courses are a big thing, right?
But, so, like, were these under-produced?
Well, Reduced overproduced, like the videos.
Was it like mixture of both?
Okay.
Yeah, because I had hired a guy to do like really professional videos when I did the original launch, like the old-school one that walked the gym owners through.
40:21
Like, here's how to service these customers.
Here's how to do tricks on consoles.
Here's how to solve supplements, your status on the membership on the back in and those are all like really nicely done, professional videos and so I had everything there already for the back end the sales training.
I had already trained my sales guys with so that training already existed the scripting and that's all training was brutal.
40:40
The fucking awesome still like it's interesting because when you make a training with the intention of like, someone has to go through this and sell shit on the other side and it's my money on the line.
It's different when you try to make a course on sales, right?
Because people try to make a course on sales and justify the costs.
They charge someone for it.
40:56
Mine was an hour long training.
That's awesome.
What a fuckin clothes?
And it was this particular product at this price point for the gym.
So it's super specific selling, right?
Here's a set, the chairs up, here's how the office needs to look.
When they walk in the door.
This is a joke.
You make this how you do the tour when they sit down, make sure they set up on the way.
We make sure they look at the weight they cry.
41:12
They buy make sure they sit like, you know, you do the whole thing, right?
And it was all methodical strategic, I don't 4,000 days.
Like I knew like we know this conversation back is still do it still and it's always all that stuff is document.
The only thing that wasn't documented was just the ads and landing pages.
41:29
They're sitting show how to place it.
Yeah.
So I'd all I had to build was just that we just talked about Facebook ads or Google ads.
Yep.
As Google and its crew, a sorry.
Facebook Instagram.
Yep.
And we already had the ads, didn't even make him.
I was like, this is the end.
And they would use my video because I knew my videos work.
So it's just like, boom post.
This goes to this page, which is copy-pasted page that I already made change the name of the city, right?
41:48
Like, that's it as I can when they like, here's how you work.
The lease, which was the sales training.
The guy said, here's how you sell them, sales training, the guy said and then the back in there, they had the training for those proven it was already there.
I still have the ads part like document it.
So I documented that and I sent it out.
I called the other guys.
We crushed it and then the average gym that of those first like 30 or 40 that bought did thirty thousand dollars in additional collected.
42:10
Cash not membership, not like contract value like cash collecting their first 30 days.
So you a hero overnight here just like overnight success and then I mean as soon as it happened there like what else you have and I was like, well glad you asked, you know, I have I have my three year licensing where I'll give you all the rest of the things that I used to run and scale my gems.
42:30
And so that was that became Jim Legacy, which is the backend of Jim launch, which was the two programs that we have front-end back-end, which fundamentally is actually exactly how I did weight loss.
Programs your front and the back end, we would find and program.
On the continuity, same process just they were just added zeros so it was and there was no the cost of goods is significantly lower because it's licensing licensing.
42:49
Materials licensing, ads licensing Pages.
It's not, you know?
Yeah.
And and if I can just point out what I'm hearing, two is you got rid of Partners, right?
I'm not against it.
Now, I had to learn, I had to learn how to do business on my own in order to learn how to partner later.
43:08
Yeah.
But I also think, you know, self-awareness, Is key.
Like sometimes you know Nadal is a great tennis player isn't play doubles.
Yeah, that I know of right.
He's a solo player for a reason or you know and we had Russell Wilson on the show who's the quarterback now of the Denver Broncos from the Seahawks, you know, and rest of the team player.
43:27
So if you're a team player you know and that works for you, that could be fine in your model, it wasn't working and you weren't getting the hint until you finally did.
Yeah, I think Lalo's strong nudge R.
Yeah, but those are those are super good lessons for people who may not have to make them the hard way.
43:46
That's if you're going.
This is because I get questions like this all the time for the newer entrepreneurs.
Just like you know either they're in a partnership and this is how most people partner.
Hey, we like each other and we kind of like the subject.
Let's get into business together.
Terrible reason to get into business together but like y combinator, we were talking this offline, two seconds ago, What combinator's in that three Partners.
44:06
Three founders is actually like the like the sweet spot like three to four ish actually works the best for building huge companies.
Do that's huge companies, not, everybody's trying to build huge company and the founders that they have have very specific roles and functions.
So you've got the guy who's the head of coding, and then you've got the promoter who's head of sales and marketing, then you have the operator typically, which will be kind of the Third Leg of the stool, which is kind of the minimum three roles that exist.
44:29
And so, if you are going to partner with people, they have to have a clear role or responsibility that is Aunt than yours idea skills and a percent.
So, complementary skills aligned values.
And if you are partnering, the splits don't need to be even.
And that's often a common thing, which is like, okay, there's three of us.
44:45
Therefore we should have thirds that isn't necessarily true, you know.
Like some people might be bringing a bigger Network or so, you know other things to the table that that tip the scales.
And and that's, you know, that's part of business.
But all that to say, I'm not against Partnerships, I at that time did not understand how to partner and therefore it was only able to successfully have When it was just me.
0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
0:22
I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world with someone else if I say.
Would you like this thing?
And the other person says yes and they give me money and I give them the thing.
No harm was done.
All right, so you have to get over this belief about like selling something or making an offer, some how bad your literally preventing people from having a benefit by not making the offer.
0:44
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I learned 7 million dollar lessons at my first job imagine five generations of Father's teaching their sons.
1:08
The same exact tips and tricks of running one very successful business.
Now this was a multi-million dollar per year operation.
All right, and I worked in the off-site, not the retail Center in the storage unit, which is this massive Warehouse of fur coats talking like 7,000, fur coats and just for context.
1:29
Codes are usually between like a thousand all the way up to fifty thousand dollars.
So when you think about walking into like a fur coat store if you see 100 coats or 200 coats, it's like having two hundred cars sitting in a parking lot.
That's a size of a living room.
Lots of money.
Exchanging hands.
1:45
The first lesson ever taught me was how to deal with angry customers.
One day, I was going from the warehouse to the retail store.
So I didn't go in the retail store that much because like I looked like an 18 year old and I was going to be selling any 25,000 dollar code.
It's and I was in the back because obviously customers shouldn't see me.
2:03
And this lady comes in and she is pissing angry.
All right.
And she's like, where's Johnny?
Because I'm going to change the names just because I don't want to, you know, mess, anyone stuff up.
She's like, where's John?
He sold me this coat.
And this button came off, this is so ridiculous.
2:19
I spent so much money on this coke popular, she's just making a scene right now, John the owner of the store I'm sitting in the back and the customer.
This way, I'm on the other side of the door so she can't see me.
And he's walking towards me to turn out to go deal with her as he's walking towards me.
2:37
I see him, roll his eyes.
And then as he turns a corner, he goes right into character.
And what I learned later is that he got in the angry boat and I'll explain that in a second as soon as he walked out, he was like mrs.
Johnson.
That is ridiculous.
I cannot believe that you had a coat that had a button that was missing Who Sold you that coat tell me the name of the, of the sales rep.
2:56
I need to find them right now.
We'll get rid of him, did anyone?
See you with the coat without the button, we're going to get to the bottom of this right now.
All of a sudden, her whole tone changes, she started backpedaling.
She's like, I mean, you know, it wasn't that big of deal.
Like it was, it was just a button.
It probably know.
3:12
We need to get to the bottom of this and he leaned in even further as like, this is not acceptable, you should never have been seen in a code that didn't have a button on it and she all of a sudden became calm as commission said, you know what, I just I just want it to be fixed.
If you could fix the coat that he's, he grabbed it from, he's like, we're going to handle this.
3:29
Right now, you don't even need to you.
Wait two seconds.
We're going to fix this right now.
It goes to the back.
They fix the thing in five minutes, and she hands it back to and she's like, John, you're always the best.
Thank you so much for dealing with this.
I'm sorry.
I was a little bit over the top.
I just, you know, I've spent so much the jacket and he's like, as you should be, she walked to the door.
3:48
He turned him in his like there could only be one person in the angry boat.
He said, so whenever someone comes in the angry boat, what most people try and do is they try and downplay them and so they say, well, it's not that.
Big of a deal, you know.
Forget it was just probably honest mistake, we'll just try.
And what happens is, the person doesn't feel validated.
4:05
And so the person who's upset then increases how angry they are because they want the person to validate why they're angry.
And so it happens, they just keep getting angry.
And this person keeps trying to make them less angry and then just creates more and more of a discrepancy between the two people.
Now the flip side is he got in the angry boat and so she had to get out of the angry boat and so whenever you're dealing with an upset customer and this is what you needed like, this is something that I recommend teaching customer service reps or account reps or You're just a small business owner, you're dealing with people, you need to validate their anger and in a real way, if the, if something was messed up and you have very high stands for your business, the moment you say it's not a big deal.
4:39
It means you're not actually taking responsibility and so even if their complaint is ridiculous and it's, you know, something that would be no way under control, it still is your responsibility.
And so you have to take ownership of it because the alternative is you don't, and you never get better.
4:55
And so you lean even more in that in those scenarios and that was the first lesson.
He taught me, which is the angry boat, the second lesson, he taught me was about creating a new product.
So, one of the things that had happened in the five generations of fur coat, father's passing underfur coach.
5:12
Suds, was that they realized that in the summer.
They never had any demand, because people aren't trying to buy fur coats in the summer.
And they're like, huh.
What can we sell to people that still on brand for fur coats during the summer?
And so came up with the genius idea.
5:27
They said, we'll store Condition, the codes for them mind you.
That's where I worked in the warehouse where we stored, in addition, the codes.
And so what happened is, as they sold every single customer code they said, hey every year, make sure during the summer, when you're not using the coat, you bring it back here, we can repair any damages, we can sew things up, we can condition The Firm, we can make it last two, three, five times longer.
5:48
So you can pass it on to the next of kin and then the he would give this a little analogy is like, right if you're going to buy a 50 thousand dollar car, you'd pay 100 bucks a month for insurance to ensure the car of course, right?
It's the same thing.
Here.
So, you created this analogy, that compared for codes, which people didn't understand as well to a car, which was something they did.
6:06
And so what happened is overnight, he created what I would consider an insurance product.
Now, Insurance products don't actually have to be insurance if you do anything.
Guaranteeing your work either through Labor or just decreasing the risk that it happens.
You can charge people for the safety, that whatever, they just bought will continue to provide value for a longer period of time.
6:27
And so he was able to do this.
Here's what's crazy.
The cost to store a coat.
I think was like 200 bucks right?
For the whole summer.
Now, think about the cost of goods on storing a coat, you grab the coat, you hang it on a rack inside of a van, you drive it to a warehouse that's air-conditioned and then you hang the coat.
6:46
That's the storage, that's the fee.
His two biggest costs were just ensuring the warehouse that had millions and millions of dollars of fur coats in it.
And the AC bill that's it and the off.
So was The next lesson I'm going to tell you lesson 3 was getting people to say yes, by saying no.
7:05
So when I first learned, no base selling, I actually learned it from this job when I was 18, which as an aside, if you want to get into business, it's so much more valuable to learn from somebody who's very good, then try and learn it all on your own, which is why I think most people when they're younger.
And you just prioritize learning rather than earning everyone's in such a race, to get, to become a millionaire.
7:24
When you can guarantee that you're a millionaire in a decade.
If you do the right things early, Back to the lesson.
So one of the things that he did to increase the average cart value of storing, the fur coats was get people to say, yes to conditioning.
The coat rack is storage.
Is the first core thing, which is, I just hang your coat up and I keep it air conditioned and the up.
7:41
So is also brush it and I'll fix it, and I'll do these other things.
And so when they would call up customers and they'd say, hey, do you want to, you know, turn in your coat for the summer with the did we say, hey, we're going to store and condition the coat, you don't want anything else do you and they would say no, no, I don't want anything else.
7:59
And so implied in that, they got them to say yes to storage and yes, to conditioning the code pretty slick.
Now, to make sure that people actually turned in the coat, they added something else which is an incentive to get people to respond.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
8:16
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, So lesson for when they wanted to get people to actually take them up on the upsell that they had they gave them a little piece of bait but the lesson was what the big was and it was what I call sawdust.
8:46
And so sawdust is anything in a business that is access.
That is created an excess that you normally throw out.
So, a lot of famous things were actually made out of sawdust.
So if you've ever seen those Ikea pieces of furniture, they just glued together all the sawdust from Lumber Mills because it was literally thrown aside.
9:02
And so it became actually a Order sugar piece of wood, by taking the excess capacity to the same degree.
If you ever heard of whey protein, whey protein used to get scraped off the bottom of dairy centers because it was waste product, and now is one of the most expensive products sold from dairy.
9:20
And so what he did was he took the scraps from all the coats that they would make in the back and all the repairs that they had and they would have all these odd shaped pieces of fur.
And so what they did was they made tiny little things that were made of fur.
So think like little purses, It'll earmuffs, you know, wristlets, whatever, tiny little strings of fur, but still had the value of expensive clothing of luxury products.
9:42
And so they said anybody who would turn in their coat would get this as a bonus pretty cool.
Right?
And so what they did was they gave away something that costs them, nothing that people still perceived value as bait to get people to come in and actually take the upsell, what's even more.
Is that when people did come to turn the thing in, they would actually say, well, you want to store that too, right?
10:04
And they would say yes.
And then they would charge them for that even though they got the product for free, the storage doesn't come free.
And so, all these little things that were accumulated over five generations of furriers and if people are listening to this, if you're listening this in your a consumer you have to get around the like someone selling me something, makes them evil.
10:21
Capitalism is the only system where both people say, thank you after an exchange, it means both parties are better and the big part of capitalism has to be voluntary exchange.
Now, if there's coercion, right, if someone threatens you, that's different.
That's not, that's just a form of robbery, right?
10:37
But if I say, would you like this thing?
And the other person says, yes, and they give me money and I give them the thing.
No harm was done.
All right, so you have to get over this belief about like selling something or making an offer, some how bad your literally preventing people from having a benefit by not making you offer.
If someone didn't want to store the earmuffs or the the wrist links then they didn't have to and they just got it for free which is a benefit.
10:58
And for the business just to cost of doing business to get the person in the door, And this leads me to my fifth lesson, this fur coat dealer was able to withstand all of the pita pressures and all of the, you know, people being upset about animals even though they, you know, where leather and they eat eat meat every day.
11:15
Right there all up in arms about stuff.
He was able to weather that for five generations because he never stopped doing the boring work.
What they do has not changed, fundamentally in years, all they did was get better and better and better at it.
And one of the things that I found for all the portfolio, That we work with that acquisition.com.
11:33
If you don't know who I am, by the way by the, we own a Kazakh knowledge to provide is $200 a year and I make these because I want you to use the stuff, make lots of money and then eventually we can invest in your business.
Once you crack, you know, 352 million plus per year.
All right?
But the difference between the small business owners in the big business owners, is that the big business owners do the same thing for a very long period of time and they do all the things that right now, you probably know you should be doing but aren't in your business.
11:57
They just do those.
So there's nothing Advanced about it.
They just do all the basic.
Except every time every day and if you're like, man, but it's going to take me time to set up a Blog.
It's take me time to do email, follow-up.
Consistently, it can take me time to create contents.
Can take me time to build a sales team?
Yeah, there's all the things that you probably know you should do and they take time, which is why building a business that's big.
12:15
Take a big time, but it also creates even bigger outcomes.
The sixth lesson.
I learned was how he was able to double the amount of coats people would buy.
So a few times per year, he would run these seasonal like unclaimed for sales and so people would come in.
12:32
And he had two big caveat that I thought were brilliant.
The first we said no dealers and so what that meant is everyone who's a consumer think?
So these must be great deals.
That's why dealers aren't allowed, right?
So it's almost like a damaging admission, but he does it in a way to persuade people that they're getting an even better deal.
12:48
Now, once they got in, Was a sign on the door that said limit to produce per customer.
And so what happens is when you limit the codes per customer, then it means every single person buys more than one because they're like, oh, there's a limit.
I have to use up the scarce resource so he made purchasing a coat a scarce resource in and of itself.
13:04
On top of that, in the actual store itself, they would have multiple strike Downs on the price and it would say, final price, all sales are final and so, it created all of this scarcity and he purposely let people in on a single file line and a fixed amount of people in the store at the same time part.
13:20
That is for security to make sure that people don't steal codes obviously, but the other side of it was that it created this huge perception of demand.
So you have a line out the door.
It says limit two per customer, no dealers allowed.
You walk in the door, there's security everywhere and you feel like you got to go get yours.
13:37
And so what happens is every single person bought more Coast in the ultimately would have otherwise.
And so when you have the opportunity, and I've learned this in multiple businesses, and I've applied, this is that whenever you run a promotion, if you're going to having a limit to the amount that people can buy, Oftentimes actually makes you more money because the fear is what if someone is going to buy 10 codes, but the reality is very few.
13:57
People are going to buy 10 coats.
But what it did do is it got the 80% of people that we're going to by one two by two.
The seventh lesson I learned was that by creating this continuity product where people would come every year to get their fur coat insured and fixed is that you become top of mind, you go from being a store that someone bought something once to being the first place.
14:18
Someone goes, when they solve anything related to To this specific problem, in this case for codes.
And so you become the dealer for life.
And so what happens is instead of them Price shopping you were going you know all over town with.
They'll do instead is they go to you first and every three years or every five years because the buying Cycle, 14 coats is the same.
14:36
Almost as cars, all of a sudden instead of being that one salesman, who sells one car, one time you become the car salesman for the rest of your life because of what you do between the sales.
So in your business, if you have a one-time product, especially that's a little bit bigger and purchase having little things that you can do, even if you didn't make money on them, but you just broke even on them.
14:56
And then you know that on average, you get customers to buy two more products from you, it more than makes up for the effort and cost of time that you put into it.
And the beautiful thing about this is that no one's going to do it and the reason is because everyone's lazy and so you're like, Alex I can't believe you're telling me secrets no one's going to do it because if you did do it, you'd already be a multi-millionaire.
15:14
And so like if Just do these things.
Like this guy did you will make significantly more so do it in the cost of deliver on this was so low because we had one 18 year olds to air-conditioning three storage facility.
That was it I think the reason no base selling is more effective or often more effective especially in upsell situations is that people want to just get the default option.
15:38
And so, we're so trained to say no to any kind of upsells that if you get someone to say no.
But in so doing get them to say, yes, you actually click into their, their subconscious automated response.
Right?
And so, people feel safe saying, no, because most times in they say no to salesman, they save money.
15:55
And so what you do is you flip the script and you align it, so that them saying no actually gets them to say, yes for you and The purchase.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur going to talk to you about how to sell a business and if you're wondering who is this dude in His mama's basements closet, wearing a wife beater, have anything to do with talking about how to sell a business.
0:34
How does he even have the right?
The audacity to talk about these things?
Let me first.
Make a quick intro, I've sold a business.
Is my name is Alex, Ramon.
See I own acquisition.com which is a portfolio of companies that does over 100 million dollars a year and I have nothing to sell you and I make these videos because I was once broke and were these Peters out of necessity.
0:52
The rather than out of choice and was in my mama's basement out of necessity, rather actually I'm not in her basement.
There's a five million dollar condo in Vegas but that's not the point.
I just like working in places that have no windows.
So I have so late businesses over my career, just to name a few of them, I sold Allen which is a software company that did 12 million in trailing 12 month sales.
1:12
I cannot disclose the price that I sold to but that was the top line revenue.
The NDA is actually fairly common in sales agreements especially of an appreciable amount of money.
And the reason for that is because they don't want a potential new acquirer in terms of if you were to roll in other companies, after they buy your company to know what you got for your yours because then it hurts their negotiating power.
1:32
Now, that being said, the next two companies that I sold in 2021, I sold for forty, six point two million dollars, and I was able to dab.
Negotiate that in because I was tired of not being able to talk to the other one.
And so there's the press release from that.
And on top of that, you might be like, well, I don't have businesses that big.
That's okay.
1:47
If you're not, I also sold five brick-and-mortar locations prior to this.
And so I've sold actually that's seven.
I don't know why I say Ty, shut down one.
There you go, there's eight.
I'd fire brick mortar locations, that I sold and here's what's even cooler.
I've actually sold those businesses to six different types of buyers.
2:02
I sold you Financial buyers, or private Equity.
I sold two and family offices.
That's what fo is a private Equity or family offices, which is all forms of private Equity, but institutional, buyers or family offices sec.
I sold two strategic buyers, which is the one who bought myself a company.
I started friends.
2:18
I've sold two competitors.
I've sold to customers and isolda partners.
Alright.
So I've done a lot of these deals and interestingly enough as it was going on.
I never thought.
Wow, this is someday going to come in handy in that I can help other people go through this.
As well because I've gone through all these kind of weird scenarios, all right?
And so I've learned a lot in the process and I would like to make this because I get questions all the time about valuing companies and buying companies and we have companies the reach out to us.
2:42
So for acquisition.com, we work with specifically service based company especially internet, service based businesses grew businesses, e-learning businesses course, business Etc.
And we purchase minority stakes in this companies to help grow them, which is what the portfolio does.
Now, which is, why does every hundred million that being said, we're very familiar with this process.
And so I wanted to walk you through this.
2:58
There's a lot of people have questions about Got it.
All right.
And so I'll walk you through the overarching process and then I'll dive into each of them in more detail, so I'm good.
Awesome.
Say yes, fantastic.
So phase 0 0 is the prerequisite.
These are these things that must be done, or even even a required for you, to be able to sell, or have any kind of Enterprise Value to begin with, which I'm going to be really rude with you.
3:18
Most companies, most businesses are not valuable at all.
All right?
Most of them are just assets.
You might have equipment, you know?
If your physical presence.
And if your online business, you very little value.
Unless you have a lot of these things in place.
All right.
So most people want to try and go in business, sell their business and find out that no one actually wants to buy it because people are not stupid.
3:34
Alright, so next is, once you have these prerequisites, I'll go over.
You have to find a banker.
A broker I and this is something that I've gone back and forth on.
I sold some of them without I do something with now go pros and cons and I'll explain to you kind of how to negotiate that process and figure it out after that.
Now we can actually start the song process.
3:50
We have a bakery.
Somebody representing us to help us go sell our stuff.
All right.
And so this is the prep, this is Phase One.
All right?
Phase two is now that we have a prepared, all the stuff now we Market the thing so that we can sell the thing to somebody.
All right, phase 3 is now we have people who want to buy the thing that we got to close the deal.
All right?
And so I'll walk you through each of the intricacies of these and there are honestly a lot of steps in this process if you want to have a big number money in the Millions for a deal.
4:14
All right, so let us start at the top.
Alright prerequisite.
So these are deal Killers.
These are things that make a deal not actually happen, which I'll be right with you is the vast majority of time, okay?
Most companies, there's not that big and when I say this mind you, I'm talking about institutional size Businesses, like, if you want to have a deal, that's, you know, five million dollars plus, which is about the smallest deal.
4:34
That any like, real Institutional, Investor private Equity family office will look at is there has to be, you know, a big enough size for it to make sense.
Right now, you can have tons of people who do a lot of private investors and Retail investors people who just have a little bit of money saved up.
4:49
They, you know, they might want to buy a dry cleaning business, they won't know drive by it by a GM or they might want to buy or whatever, right?
Like there's, those are normal businesses, but those are, that's not what we're talking about here because those are all one off.
And they're not going to make Rich.
All right.
And so that's why I'm focused on the how to make you rich type sale because these are much more difficult to understand and the process a little bit more nuanced.
5:08
Alright it took me a long time to learn this and guess what?
No one taught me this, like I didn't see this anywhere and it took me a long, long time.
So I'm a year just kind of understand the entire process worked and N.
So that is what I'm trying to save you is a year of painstaking effort and I have nothing to sell you.
So like all the people were trying to tell me, he had a vested interest in trying to take something from me and I don't know who you are.
5:26
So I'm making this so that.
There you go.
All right.
Right.
So the biggest one though is that people are too small, the next one is that there's a customer concentration, meaning you have too few.
Customers that equate to the business, right?
If you have like, ten big customers, if two of them leave or three of them, leave all of a sudden, you lose like a third-year business that is very risky.
5:44
All right.
People don't like that.
And so they will give you a massive discount on the value of business, or not even be interested, because it's too risky, all right?
And especially, if that's like those relationships were there because of you and they, you know, they like you and you're the kind of like relationship manager, which happens really commonly in small businesses.
Next one is no defined sales process, a lot of times people don't really An acquisition process for getting new customers.
6:01
They don't know how they get customers, they just kind of come their way.
And so if you don't have a repeatable or reliable way of acquiring customers, ideally through multiple channels, which are covered a second.
You will probably not get a very good multiple or even want to get any kind of deal at all next.
Is that when people do start this process, a lot of the mistakes that makes they don't go through it enough potential acquirers, they're not trying to Target of people there.
6:18
Like I talked to some people and no one wanted to buy, well no shit, you talk to him, people got to talk to 500, right?
And that's how you can get somebody's gonna give you the right kind of multiple on your business if you want to sell to an Institutional Investor, okay?
Okay, next was getting timing wrong.
So everybody always thinks that, like, man, if I should another 18 months, I cannot tell you the amount of times, like it's almost like the standard response of entrepreneurs is.
6:38
I'll be ready in 18 months because a year they know they're not ready.
But 18 months, for some reason.
Feels like, it's far enough out that they'll like somehow magically away up there want and all their problems will be done, which is not true.
Alright, so getting the timing wrong is a huge issue and a lot of people sell too late.
Very few people sell too early.
6:53
Most people sell too late in my opinion and in so doing they can't sell it all.
And so the thing is, is I heard this quote from the The managing partner of ABG Fraser Preston really, really bright guy.
He said this one of her car.
She said, well, this is always going to go up in value over time except when it doesn't and in case it becomes unsellable and so it was very, very interesting to hear that because that is kind of the truth.
7:13
It's like, either people see this thing is like, oh wow, this is a growing asset, that's increasing in value.
And even if you stay the same for a period of time, just more years under about makes it actually more reliable, so it's less risky.
So literally the older business gets even if it stays the same, it becomes more valuable, right?
That being said, if you get the Timing wrong as in, he starts going down, no one wants to catch a falling knife, right?
7:33
Especially in private deals like this stocks and whatnot.
People are trying to time it, it's a big enough company's been around long enough, Etc.
It's different than small businesses which is what that's majority.
People are watching this video have small business being defined as less than 100 I think employees.
Okay.
So next one, you think it's worth more than it is and this is a big one, right?
7:51
A lot of people are like, man.
I heard that, you know, so-and-so got 20 times Top Line.
It's like, yeah.
And that's because that's why it's newsworthy because it's weird, right?
It's Common if there's a completed sale I think I just put like a I pulled this debt from.
So the median number for m&a deals for for this was I think the meeting was five million dollars.
8:10
I can't screw that.
The point, is that the multiple was six point seven times trailing 12 months and that is for institutional buyers right now, you might not have an Institutional bar, which is why the vast majority of business that gets old gets own private deals for like 1X, 2x 3x and it's because they're not really reliable businesses for the most part.
8:26
They're just kind of asset sales.
Like I'm handing, you know, a handful Of employees over with some kind of working model, and I'm just moving on to do other things, which is honestly, the vast majority of businesses that get sold itself.
Almost nothing.
All right, so we hear about the big wins, but that's not the majority are.
And so, I want to be clear in that most businesses either don't get sold or gets old for very little money.
8:46
And so, the point of this presentation is how to sell it for a lots of money, all right.
Which you have to meet these requirements, even be considered.
Okay.
Now the next next little doodad that we have on our list of goal here is not growing big enough to a more groceries just three different things up.
And books, I needed to fit in one place.
All right, so if the business isn't growing, you're gonna get a big discount on it.
9:04
Now I said earlier that the longer businesses in place, the more valuables which is true, but if you're not growing, we don't have like a ways of growing it.
Or it means that like the strategy you're doing is no longer working, people will see that as a risk.
So if you have even a tiny amount of decline, people see that as a big red flag because then they'll extrapolate that into Infinity on the flip side.
9:20
If you have a tiny amount of growth people to extrapolate that out further, so like flip it around and sustain that growth for the 12 months, 18 months, prior to the deal to get a much better number big enough time.
So people one might think oh this is a this business is cool.
It's a niche but it can't extend extend beyond this Niche.
So you need to have a good growth story as in how we're going to really 10x this thing because people are buying not to buy your business, they're buying your business for what they think the business will become.
9:42
Alright, that's what kind of private Equity is all about.
Knows really, trying to buy the thing.
They want to try to buy with things, would it become?
Alright?
And so that's when you make great deals, right?
That's on their side.
So you have to tell them or explain to them the story of how it's going to work, right.
And the more they can believe that story that it's likely to occur, then the more valuable your business will become.
9:58
Next one is a huge Small business is Chi Minh risk.
As in.
Like, are you the one who's The Rainmaker?
You're the one who's bringing in, you know, all the deals.
Are you the one who's, you know, the special man who does all the Fulfillment?
All that kind of stuff, like, are people coming for you, if they're coming for you, then they're not going to come to your business which means that when you leave business a worthless.
10:14
Right?
And so you're a big risk and a lot of times I'll be frank with you in a not come.
We work with companies that have key man and we work them or the next three to five years to help them.
Not have key man risk, which is how we were able to exit, Jim launch, which was started as kind of a more through ask business and then transformed into it.
10:29
Just a true licensing business at an Enterprise level.
And so there is a process of going through that and you have to take the time to do it, if you don't, your business will not be valuable, okay?
And then finally single and there's more risk.
These are just some of the big ones single-channel dependence.
Meaning you only have one way of getting customers, you have no other way and if tomorrow, that shut off, you'd be screwed, right?
10:49
People just imagine, well, if it shut off, then I would lose my money and good investors.
Don't take risks like that.
They don't want to go to zero and so that will massively impact the value your business.
Alright.
So these are deal Killers.
These are things that could you not?
Yourself a very, very little money and so you must check off these boxes before you can get big, institutional money.
11:05
Alright.
So, this is the big bottom line of that section which is Enterprise Value is a discount applied to future sales, which means you have to take the total amount of sales at a business takes between now and the end of time.
And then you apply a discount to it, which basically means risk.
What's the likelihood that occurs, all right?
And so if you can show that you have a lot of future sales are going to happen and it's very, very likely that they are going to occur.
11:26
Then you have a very, very valuable business.
If you have a small amount of Your sales or a declining amount of sales, then the likely that it happens is low, and the amount is also low, all right?
So that gives you low Enterprise Value.
So that's the bottom line.
That's what we want to show is going to show that we're going to make lots of sales continue to grow.
The likelihood of occurring is very, very hot.
11:42
They should be asking why are you selling this business and you need to have a good reason for it.
Okay, so checked off that box, let's go to face to let's see.
You check all those boxes and you're like, okay, I think I have all those things.
I now want to find it bank or broker and quick difference here, Bankers are what you're going to need to sell to an Institutional for the most part brokers.
11:59
Usually when you're selling for less than 5 million, you get a broker and they have different fee structures because the amounts are lower and they have to do more deals like our stuff.
All right.
And to be fair, I think sometimes broke being a broker's even harder because you're selling shit, let's be real.
Okay, so the way that I did this and so I'm just being real.
12:16
Like the way that I did this is that I Network for intros.
It's very hard.
I think you can try it.
Go, you know, Google investment Banks, Google top, whatever investment Banks and is specifically you'd want them in your market and your size.
So there's two components, it's, you know, do they They have, they sold something businesses, have they sold e-commerce businesses, have they sold software business?
12:34
That they sold e-learning businesses have, they sold whatever type of business.
You have number one and number two.
Have they sold them of your size?
Right?
If someone you know has sold, lots of e-commerce but they've only done deals that are like 500 million and up and you're doing like 10 million, top lied.
You're not going to be fit for them because the buyers that they already know are not going to want to buy your thing because the check is too small, all right?
12:53
And so these guys write a proportion like checks proportional to the fun size that they have of the capital, right?
Like if you have a billion You're not going to be a thousand dollar investment, it just doesn't make sense at the time investment makes no sense.
All right.
So I use my network which means I just called everybody.
I possibly new and said, hey, do you know anybody who knows anything about this?
13:10
And so you can start with entrepreneurs, you can start with people.
You can start with your actual bank, where you go like actually to do Banking and you just pull threads and this is what took me a long time.
Is that like now working to try and find these introductions was a pain.
I didn't I don't know anybody, you know me like I wasn't born into an investment bank so I have no clue.
13:27
And so you network for introductions to these Banks?
Okay once you have some introductions right use you then give them a one-page summary document, you send them because I'll be like, okay, we'll send me send me a teaser, right?
It's like a Sizzle Sizzle page of like all the sexy things about your business, the assets, your list, how, you know, it's just literally a one page summary that should look really sexy than we can.
13:48
Look at me.
Like, I would like to take another call with these people.
That's it.
That's, the objective is just to get them to say, yes, I'll take a call with you once they say yes.
I'd like to take call with you.
You then basically sell them on selling your business.
All right, so you sell them on selling your business and then if they do like that they will usually fly out to you and meet with you in person with the team and then they will sell you on why they should sell your business.
14:12
And so the process here goes like you network for as many introductions, you can to Bankers who are relevant to your size and your space.
You send them to one page teaser so that you can get them interested.
They then a certain percentage of those will take a phone call of the phone call.
You sell those people and why it's a good deal, they Fought with him.
So, yes, I think it's a good deal.
14:28
Let's talk, let's talk in person.
You'll then probably meet with, you know, four to six.
Bankers to tell you why, they think they would be the best ones to represent you and get you the highest Enterprise Value.
And that's where you're going to negotiate their fee structure and you're going to be asking them questions around what other deals like yours.
14:44
They have sold and what their Network looks like.
Now they're all going to say they know all the people and all the decision-makers and all the things, right?
But the real thing you want is people who have sold businesses similar to yours in terms of market and size in recent history.
All right?
Because that Means that they are the its recent there in the.
No, it's not like they saw something three years ago, that was similar, because they're way out of way.
15:02
Out of touch.
All right.
You want people who do this type of deal, all the time.
Now the typical fee structures would ask what to watch out for.
So the, their fees and agreements, they usually have an upfront amount.
Sometimes, that's all these things are negotiable, you can negotiate that a negotiated in, they usually ask for upfront if they if the number is lower.
15:18
So they don't think that it's likely that they're going to sell the last for an upfront which you can use in negotiating point which is like you don't think you can sell it because then it gives you a point to argue To somebody else, right?
They'll give you targets for what they think they could sell for.
And then they will give you ratchets, which is like.
And if we sell for over X, we get X percentage, we saw forever.
15:35
Why we get Z percent, right?
What Bankers will actually do is once they will help you package the business and they will go out to Market and they will pound the pavement and they will talk to hundreds of buyers and they will walk you through this process.
But it's good to have an understanding of this process by and large so that you can not sound like a nincompoop when you're talking them.
15:51
All right.
There's usually also a breakup fee which you can negotiate out of the deal or at least decrease.
Sit.
And you can also on the flip side have minimums, which is like, if you guys don't sell me, if you don't get an offer above X, then you don't get paid at all, right?
And so we had minimums in our deal so that they wouldn't actually get paid.
16:07
So there are super incentivize so the things that like you really want to be cognizant of is the minimums and especially how they're going to get paid, like, what number they getting paid off, or they getting paid off the total Enterprise Value.
They're going to get paid off the cash, you receive, right?
And you want to go, she ate off the pass, you receive, not the Enterprise Value because let's say you sell 10% of the company for a billion dollars.
16:26
I'm saying, For you know, Silly math.
So you get 100 million bucks if that's a they got four percent of Enterprise Value, right?
They would get 40 million of the 100 million.
All right, so there's little things like this that they will use to fuck you.
All right, so like be cognizant of these things and the targets and the ratchets that they put in place, it sounds like it's like you want, you want them to be really excited to push it, but the things that I really would want you to pay attention to are gonna be the minimums and what they're getting paid off of and breakup fees and up fronts, all right?
16:53
Because at the end of the day, you know, the ratchets and targets.
Hopefully you're Happy with this on the front.
Because what happens sometimes is the reverse which is people, as all of a sudden start hearing the yellow eyes and whatnot, start getting greedy and I don't think that's why it's like decide, write down a number before you start the process and talking all these guys, because it'll blow your mind up and they'll tell you that they're going to sell for a billion dollars and then you sell for not a billion dollars, okay?
17:12
For much less than that.
So, write down the number, write it to a letter to yourself and say, I would accept this for this reasons, all right?
Because this is one of the most emotional processes you can possibly go through selling a part of yourself, something part of your identity, and so you can get tied up in it, okay?
Now, You will sell your company better than almost any Banker, right?
17:29
So they are going to be experts in the process.
You will be the one who's going to be an expert at selling your company, especially if your promotional entrepreneur, you know how to sell, right?
And so you want to be very instrumental in giving them the selling store because they're gonna be the ones who were doing the selling but you're also going to be doing selling as well.
17:45
So you need to be giving them the Salient points.
You think that they're going to say that there are experts at this?
They're not like even though they've sold a handful of companies have only sold a handful, right?
They just want five like yours.
That's still a ton just like But you want to have the really selling points that only you will know because they don't know your business right.
You gotta give them the really sexy stuff.
18:01
All right and as a reminder, these people are like real estate agents.
They're trying to sell both sides, they're trying to get a deal done more than the best deal even though they have ratchets.
Even though they have these things, the big thing they're trying not to do is not close a deal and so they will do everything they can to get both sides to just meet in the middle and sell but that's not necessarily in your best interest.
18:18
Okay, so just remind you here, it's not in necessarily your best interest.
All right, now this was the false belief that I had which is they will know what they're Doing and we'll get you the best deal, which is not true, which I just explained this.
And so this is the negotiating point, this is a writer down or for you.
They only responded and I had to learn this the hard way to if I don't get this point, the deal is off otherwise.
18:40
They basically just steamroll you and you might say like, well maybe you had bad making experts, who knows?
But I'll just tell you this is my experience is that you have to be willing to walk away from the table in order to get the best deal, all right?
Which is why you win negotiations before you start them by having options.
18:56
All right.
You want to have an amazing business?
You won't have a business, you don't want to sell.
That's the best way to sell a business is to not want to sell it, right?
And you have to get there.
If you're like, I would just get rid of this thing for nothing, then prepare be prepared to get rid of this thing for nothing, because it's because it's going to get there because they're gonna drill you because these are professional negotiators on the other side table.
This, what they do all day long you might have sold your business one time they buy businesses every fucking day.
19:16
Alright so they know exactly how you feel, they know exactly how to manipulate your emotions to get you to say yes to lowest price.
Okay?
So what you want to say here is that if I don't get this the deal is off and it took me Me a really long time to learn this and then all of a sudden I start speaking.
This language the beggar sort of responding me like oh no this is really a big deal for them like if they don't get this and then all of a sudden they start negotiating for me because what will happen in this world of institutional's?
19:38
They just say no to everything.
Unless you say you're going to walk then they're like, okay fine.
We'll give you that one, right?
So they will just say this is our deal structure and unless you take it or leave it unless you say I'm willing to walk on these points.
Alright?
And then they will start moving just my observation now until you have during this up because no try this with me.
19:53
Alright so we covered fighting the banker How to negotiate, the fees what to look at in terms of how to interface with them to negotiate on your behalf.
Now, let's start the actual process, right?
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
20:09
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
20:26
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out.
Out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
So there's the prep and this is a big, big picture of what the what this whole process looks like.
20:45
Once you've got audited financials, once you've got a Sim, which is a shootout, even note that it's something model I think, but basically, it's like this hundred-page plus thing of really in depth of the financials in the story and the competitive analysis in the marketplace and the growth trajectory and all the stuff, that's what they should be doing for you are, they should make that thing and they will send the teaser out to all the you know, 500 people of those people, a certain percentage will sign.
21:11
Tas, which is not as good as our agreement because then because it's Anonymous they won't they won't when you're sending out the teaser it doesn't disclose what the company is that way, you know, employees and things like they don't skate, get scared by you just shopping the company, alright?
So this is how I recommend doing this.
You 500 bucks buyers contacted and you'd want to ask these questions.
21:27
How many buyers we contacting?
How big is your list?
What are your potential requires right 98 in DA's from there?
You'll usually get like 14 or so.
Ioi's 15%, right from there about half of those.
You'll do kind of like, management presentations.
It's from there, you'll get 2 to 4 L O wise and ioi's indication of Interest which is non-binding and Loi is also typically non-binding but it's a letter of of Interest which is like, this is what we're prepared to pay for the business from there, you negotiate them against each other and then you get one deal, right?
21:55
And then you you sign the LOI and then you go through the diligence process and then you close, okay.
That is how these sales numbers break down.
If you've talked to 10, people, then lo and behold, you probably are not going to get a good number, right?
And so that's how this process works.
And thing is a lot of these guys are lazy.
So you have to push them on these numbers to Doubt more like repeat follow up with these people, and I'll be honest with you, on the deal that we ended up doing.
22:16
It wasn't the first set of buyers that we got to the table who's actually somebody that my CFO pushed our Bankers to follow back up with again, the ended up being the, the final acquirers.
All right?
So like you want to push them because at the end of the day, they're going to try to do as little as possible, get paid.
I'm just being real with you, that's the real world.
22:31
All right, so let's do it.
So now that we understand the sales process works, this is now you're working with the bankers.
You got to get this prep stuff done.
So you got to get your due diligence.
In, you gotta get organized, a lot of people don't have the stuff draft of the Sim there.
It is confidential information memorandum.
All right, so you got to complete that get a review.
22:47
That's a huge amount of work.
All right, and these weeks are just rough.
All right.
These are rough amount of weeks.
All right.
I'm going to show you 20 weeks in this presentation but like that whole process of getting the bankers, took another like three months.
So I would say roughly from the time you want to from the time you start this process, the time you get a check in your bank account is usually 12 to 18 months.
23:08
All right.
I'll say 12 is a nice like if you're like If today, you decided you wanted to buy, it would take a year before that actually you'd have a check in your bank account.
All right.
So then they're going to put together the list of potential buyers or investors.
Then they're going to have the summary fact sheet and the NDA is agreed upon and then that's it.
23:25
That's the prep phase.
All right.
That's it.
Simple, simple.
All right, now we start marking because we got all the materials done now we Market them.
Okay, so now we contact us perspective virus.
We gon eat teaser, then NDA, then you get which is the one to three page, blind description the business Then the data room which is basically like they have to put the stuff like in the cloud so that people can always have access to it.
23:46
So all these potential buyers and we shifting through all your, your resources to come up with questions that they're going to ask you or say that's not a good deal for that.
Right?
This is when you have your kind of your pitch deck right of what you're going to present to them, right?
You're going to dry.
Run practice.
It etcetera.
24:02
Potential investors will then submit their ioi's.
All right, that's the indication of interest that they're like.
We might be interested in buying this business and they'd give a rough range.
Right.
And then you have potentially people who are.
I'm trying to go through this part faster because it sounds boring but this is the stuff, this is how it works, right?
24:17
So potential investors visit company they provide you provide access to the data room of all the Deltas stuff that they're going to need.
So they have a cursory idea of what they need and they do the data room.
So you have to do all this interaction just put all the shit up there and they can all have access to it.
And then when you start on the actual offers, which is here, week 18, final offers received and evaluate it strategies determined for moving forward with final parties, right?
24:38
So this is where you've been them back against each.
And then you get final offers which is Ela, is okay letters of intent.
Okay.
Now once you have the letters of intent and you've been them back together, you're going to have different deal structure is going to be presented to you, which I think is cover here.
Okay.
So you start to go shooting those go back and forth, Etc.
24:55
Now here's the thing, there's the price and then how it's paid its price and terms and I can't tell you like getting good terms is worth discounts right now.
Depends on why you're selling.
You just want to have a story and that's one thing we're gonna get rich, then the terms matter a lot.
All right.
25:10
So people share a big number like for example if I wanted to say I sold, you know, Jim wants receives about $400.
I could have got $200 in paper, all right, so hear me out.
So if I said hey pay me 25 million dollar earned out.
If we do a billion dollars this year in sales, sure they'll sign it.
25:28
And then I could say that added 25 million dollars.
My Enterprise Value on the sale.
I will be transparent with you.
I had no seller financing.
I had no earn out.
I had no, I did do.
I've did well Equity, because I sold 66% and No transition services and no Consulting.
All right?
And that was because that was the that was the agreed upon way that I wanted to sell this business.
25:47
And I said that upfront to everybody.
I said this is a fool leadership exit.
I will not be involved.
I will not have transition because the thing is if they're like, sure, if you just keep working for the business for two years, yeah, we're fine selling to you, it's like, well, am I was on the damn thing, right?
And I'll just grow up myself and so this is where this is important.
26:04
Now, mind you I was not common for except for our business.
We only do minority Investments because we want the leadership team there.
So we actually want to just participate in the growth and help grow the companies from 3 million to 10 million to 20 million, 250 million, and Beyond right.
We want to participate in the growth and we're happy taking a smaller slice of what we consider to be a bigger pie rather than ripping out the management.
26:22
Right?
So we're we work with people were like not Tech, not really ready for institutional yet but want to get that 20 million dollar fifty million 100 million dollar-plus exit and get them ready just for context.
All right, so these are the things that will discount you.
So if you had a hundred million dollars, for example, for an exit, they might say, okay, Well, we're going to put 25 million in turn out, 25 million can be seller.
26:44
Financed, you're going to roll 20% Which is 20 million, so there's 30 million dollars left and so we'll give you 30 million dollars in cash.
And you say, I sold my company 400 million, right?
And of the 30, you've got the bonuses and you've got other Equity, you know, Partners if you have those and then you've got the taxman.
26:59
So all of a sudden, let's say you've got 20% that's given to your team.
So now you're at 24 million and then tax man takes his 30, right?
And you've got closing fees and things like that, escrow fees.
And so, now you're at, At eighteen Seventeen million.
So you sold your business for outer million dollars.
We only got 17 million bucks, right?
27:16
That's why this stuff matters.
Okay?
So you want to make sure that you know why you are selling and what the most important things are for you and you need to ruthlessly ruthlessly communicate that to the bankers, okay?
Very important point because they will negotiate on those points for you.
27:31
Now, the things that they're also looking for for them is is it's a fit within their their portfolio like a family office.
For example is just going to buy something that they think is a good cash flow investment.
The price is going to be very important that a strategic buyer would be somebody who's going to be.
Let's say, let's say you own a car wash, you know, chain or whatever.
27:49
If there's a bigger car washing that just wants to buy yours, they'll give you a better multiple because they already have all these systems in place.
So they're going to make more money from your business than just a generic buyer will.
So the ideal way to exit is to a strategic as you get the best multiples.
But to be fair, there are more financial buyers in there are strategic, so that's kind of that the trade-off.
28:05
And you want to make sure that the that your business is in good hands.
So that you want people who have relevant experience, we were very fortunate.
Isn't that the people that we felt were most equipped to buy the company?
We're also the ones who ended up giving us the best offer.
And so, that's that doesn't happen.
We were very fortunate in and working out with that way for us.
But it doesn't always happen that way.
28:21
And then this is a really simple one.
Do I like these people?
Well, my team like these people because ultimately, the teams will be working with them, right?
So you want to ask those questions as you're going throughout, all right?
So like you can have assholes or pay a little bit more and then really nice guys.
You pay a little bit less life short bent.
So like I would go with people who a lot of people regret just taking the highest offer rather than 10% less.
28:40
Having a much better life.
Okay.
Now at this point, you would sign your Loi, all right?
Most the times it can be exclusive saying, like, if you have a tremendous amount of interest, you might be able to sign yellow eyes and have the not be exclusive and they still a bit all the way up to the purchase agreement.
28:56
Most times that's not the case they don't want they don't want to expend the money so like the so APG, when they bought us spend probably about a million bucks and diligence just intelligence right to figure out whether our company was worth buying, right?
And again, you're not going to attract guys are going to write a hundred million dollars.
No, do a million dollars of diligence, 45 million dollar deal makes no sense, right?
29:13
So like if you want Big Money numbers, you have to, you know, got a file, the big money process, all right.
So at this point, you signed an exclusive, all why meaning you can't shop the business to anybody else During the period of the, of the due diligence.
Now, I'm going to say at the end of time, say it again.
All right.
29:28
And I've got a special treat for you, which I'm now remembering at the end of this video.
I'll actually, I videotaped us actually having the escrow hit and the final signing and you can actually see it go down for real.
All right?
It's very Climactic but you can see it for real and that see what a 50 million dollar shell looks like.
29:44
Okay.
So the due diligence will begin, they're going to try and negotiate time saying like, oh, we can get a faster close if Bob life, you accept this little prank bullshit, they're going to take as long as they want, literally ignore it.
They seriously they will try and you speak.
I had every single person try to use speed as a selling point.
30:00
I thought it was legit the first time, they said 30-day close and it took a hundred and twelve days and I accepted worth this is on one of the other companies we sold expected worst terms on that, right?
So, The next time I came around, this is why I'm giving you this stuff.
Next time I came around, they were like, oh, we could do it fast.
Cause I was like, whatever.
30:15
Take your time, my company's grown, do whatever you want, right?
When you do it that way, you're in the position of power, okay?
So they're going to audit your quality of earnings, which is something you have to get the bankers to explain how to do that.
Which is to make sure that your numbers are legit.
That they are what you said.
They are right?
Anybody can put numbers in Excel sheet but are they for real, right?
30:32
Then we'll do legal diligence.
So they're going to make sure you actually own the company.
Do you have any lawsuits against you?
Are you break any laws, which actually is fairly common when it comes to claims and things like that?
For like FTC things.
Like it's actually fairly common so you want to make sure that stuff's all right and that stuff can blow deals up, Iota an acquaintance of mine that had two different deals.
30:49
Blow up that were like nine-figure deals, multiple years apart because they were not compliant, all right?
So like and they thought that the lack of compliance was one of the reasons that they were so successful and so they didn't want.
It's too risky.
All right.
Well then do is, they'll start interviewing your customers.
All right, this is may sound freaky but that's what they're going to do.
31:05
They're going to talk to your customers and your talk to employees.
They're going to interview them the from that purchase a spent like two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
I'm pulling That in brought to bear, but it's a lot on Research to see what the, what your customers think about you.
So if you're terrified to think about what your customers, who are past, customers who no longer pay, you think about you be prepared, right?
31:21
They're going to talk to me, like, should I buy this company?
Is this a good company, right?
Was your experience, been like, right?
And same thing with your employees.
Now they're not going to ask them but the that that stuff, they're going to only talk to people already know about the deal, they're going to interview them.
Really heavily to see what's your involvement.
Is he really is he really passively involved?
31:36
Like what do you do on a daily basis?
What do they do in the daily coz they want to know that if you leave still going to keep going?
Grow.
Then you've got background checks of you and your management team to make sure no one's, you know, a convicted criminal or something sketchy, which more realistically is like financial fraud employment contracts to make sure that if you leave they don't all leave with you or they're like only there for you etcetera and you're like, okay, I feel like I'm done not, there's more.
31:57
Okay, so once you've gone through this whole, do this process which takes 60 to 90 days.
Now, if you're tracking with me, there was like three months, you know, of looking for bankers and figuring that part out and making sure that your business is ready.
May take much longer than that, but like, assuming your business is ready, D, right?
And you have met the prerequisites.
32:12
Might take you 12 weeks to find the right Bankers from there.
It's 20-ish weeks to get to this point and then you might have another 60 to 90 for diligence.
Now Bankers will say that it's gonna take less time.
They're incentivized to tell you that it takes less time.
So, I was talking to a good friend of mine who was like, hey man, I got.
They said their 30-day diligence and it closed.
32:29
And I was like, dude, it's not going to happen.
And it was for a nine-figure number, right?
And lo and behold 90 days later, he was like, yeah, fast, they said wrong, they were Right?
He's like why didn't you tell me this is gonna be so much fun, right?
And he's now, I think like, five months into his process of post post agreement sign, right?
32:49
So like, I'm not saying that that's typical but I'm saying, like, you need to be prepared for a year, like it.
It's going to be a year slog and a lot of your focus is going to go to this process.
So like you really need a strong management team in place we can continue to grow The Business Without You.
All right?
And that'll prove the point and this is a note.
33:05
The longer the process takes it is in the Buyers Advantage that it takes a long time.
All right.
So You want a fast close, they want a slow close and being real.
The only way to speed up the clothes is to keep growing like crazy because they then they're going to realize that all of a sudden, the valuation from the beginning to the end, we'll have changed.
33:24
And then you will have much more negotiating power and you can break the agreement to get other offers, right?
So, important point there.
So once you've gotten that point, you'll get a person agreement inside of the purchase agreement.
You will have these different pieces.
You have to watch out for Indemnity.
Are the things that you were liable for.
These are the things that will keep you up at night.
33:40
You need to go.
It hard on these things.
Now, give the things that are reasonable like yes.
Like fundamental, you know, interrogate warranties, I think, is that the name of the Clause, whatever?
It's like, you actually own the company, you actually own the trademarks.
I guess.
You have to like, yes, otherwise they'll purchase off, right?
And you could be liable for the total purchase amount for that stuff right now.
33:58
That's the indemnity step, but the other anemones are things that like are completely out of your control.
So you want to make sure you negotiate, those things out.
And again with all these negotiations, you have to be willing to walk away and say like I don't like if this bullets in there the deal's off, like any, You can't say that you're going to get raked over the coals, okay?
34:14
Now non-competes depends on why you're selling and what you want to do next, but you want to be very specific and this is one of the hardest things that you're going to get into negotiating, especially if you have a skill.
If you're really good at, you know, trash compacting, then they're going to not want you to touch anything trash related for a long period of time.
All right, and what's really tricky about this is that if you roll Equity into the new company that they're going to be buying your company in or whatever, they will write in the Articles of Incorporation, that none of the people who have Can compete.
34:41
And so, even if you have a purchase non-compete, you may have a non-compete as long as you are an equity holder in that other company, which means that if you want to breach a non-compete, you would have to give up the equity that you rolled.
All right?
That's once the other non-compete expired.
So you have to be very, very careful about how these non-compete to written and the definitions that you have around.
35:00
This is so important, like I can't talk like so, for example, if you were selling, let's say a skincare line, they might say they the original first one, you get my just say, like, you can't be in Beauty.
A anymore.
Well, that's be freaking ridiculous, right?
Because, you know, the space and you're not competing with your company.
If instead of skincare, you start getting into makeup, right?
35:17
And you have to make that argument, Ryan depends on the size of the deal and what you're willing.
Like if this is the one deal that's going to be law deals for you, maybe you'll be willing to give more Ryan, be like.
All right I'm not going to touch the space for a long time, right?
On the flip side, if you're like I'm already know what my next thing is going to be.
And this isn't the best thing to do with the non-competes.
Is know what you're going to do next.
35:34
If you know what you're going to do next, then you can be very specific with the language and you can make sure that your 100 covered and just tell them that's what I plan on doing next.
I just want that to be effective.
It.
And if you say that, I'm telling you guys the best way to negotiate these things is to be honest, just tell them what you want and a lot of times it's much easier than trying to guess and ascribe blame and all that kinda stuff.
35:50
Schedules is all the stuff that you provide is basically another word of like proof, right?
We're doing all this based on these assumptions and the assumptions have to be true for some reason, the schedules are not there like we did this based on this, you know, customer segmentation analysis.
If you've mentioned it in the selling process of getting them to say yes and negotiating but then you don't include it in the agreement as a schedule.
36:08
It's as though it didn't happen and then they can come back.
And screw you.
Now this all sounds scary, most of the times these agreements will get repealed.
All right, but you want to make sure that you include all the stuff and that stuff sucks be got to do it.
You got to have a good lawyer for it.
All right, definitions.
This is kind of interesting as a total philosophical point.
36:24
The agreement itself is almost as long as the pages of definitions for the terms that are used in the agreement.
And I think, Socrates, said, wisdom begins with the definition of terms.
And so, like, fundamentally, the agreement is like, party a as defined by X agrees to pay.
36:40
Why according to these terms to part easy according to these terms.
So it's like all these things are just terms that have to get defined.
And so I'll give you an example, a term that we were able to redefine.
I think it was actually I think we redefine a term within the non-compete that dramatically changed the the meaning of the document and made it much better for us to do whatever we want to do next.
37:01
And so like just changing the definition of a single word can run through an entire agreement and sometimes it's rather than fighting on clauses it's better to really narrow Go down the definition of what you're trying to Define.
So the scope might be geography for a non-compete or might be like there's a million things.
37:17
They defined in these documents but making sure that you read the definitions, for what these words mean is really important.
Now, the few points and this is just the points that you want to negotiate.
There's a zillion other things.
These are the made the big hitters net working.
Capital is the very end.
You've already agreed on everything already.
Real in terms already been the problem right now.
37:33
You have to grow net, working capital, which is how much money you leave in the business, right?
And this we're going to try it there.
Try and get you there to rights.
Like, hey, let's say, you've got A million bucks of working capital, the bank, you think I'm like well you've had a million dollars sitting there for a whole year so that comes with the business.
You like what?
I've just had it there because I didn't take dividends out of it, which Why?
37:48
By the way, is a good reason to Dividend out stuff and keep, you know, little in the bank account if you're a smaller business.
Now, if you're reinvesting in buying, you doing Ma and stuff, and that's a different question, which must you guys aren't doing that right now.
So, that being said, no working capital is what, how much money is required to run this business.
So that when we have this transition, it can continue to work as normal, right?
38:06
And you want that to be as little as possible.
So that is so that you can take as much of that cash to the bank.
In addition, what they're going to pay you.
All right and then finally is the escrow amount.
So let's say you've got that hundred million dollar deal like I said earlier, and they might say, we want to keep 20% in escrow all of a sudden you've got 20 million dollars in escrow.
And again we still have the escrow.
38:23
We've got the seller financing.
We've got the earn out.
We've got the splits that you have.
We got taxes.
We've got we got all these other things they're going to come out of it.
Alright?
As you got to make sure it makes sense.
And so escrow amounts, like if you can keep it under, 10% your rocket, all right, now they're going to probably keep some of it there and that's because they keep that as insurance.
38:40
Like, if Nothing else comes up or there's some Bill or Baba bhot, that's your fault.
Some back taxes, whatever.
They take it out.
The Eskimo.
All right, that's headed and then usually they will release that and again, when they release it, they can release it in phases.
I think there was like 90 day and then a one year for ours, but like, it can change some people have asked for that holds for two years.
38:56
Some people don't have any escrow, but it's a negotiating Point.
All right?
And I'm repeating this, don't let speed be negotiating tool.
Used against you, all right?
It doesn't matter.
They're gonna take as long as they want so don't let them use that against you, all right?
Finally you've done all this stuff.
You've negotiated All the the hardpoints you've gotten here and it's now payday.
39:14
All right?
So first off it's very anticlimactic because it takes all this time and then, all you do c is just like a big deposit.
Your bank account you're like, oh, well, I guess I am the same.
So I'm just telling you, that's what's gonna happen.
All right, that being said, you actually don't even sign papers.
There's so many papers that you actually pay someone to sign.
39:31
It was dick.
So, darn long.
So we actually paid our attorneys.
And I think it took me like six hours just to sign on our behalf for all the documents and do that for us.
All right.
Now once all the documents you've received, By the Escrow Company, both parties have signed everything at that point.
They initiate the deposits to the parties that have already been predefined.
39:48
So if you have payouts that go to, let's say your Bankers are Brokers, that comes off the top.
If you have payments that go to Escrow Company, comes off the top.
If you have distribution that come to your employees or other Equity holders are investors that then all comes and then you get your piece and just hold on because I'll show you the actual video.
40:03
It's only like I think 30 or 40 seconds of the actual signing moment for us and you can see what it really looks like the clothes, a 50 million dollar deal, but just a few closing thoughts on this, is that they're going to treat you.
Like, you don't know anything.
All right?
And so you got to get smart.
You got to read stuff.
Watch this video, re-watch it and understand the pieces that someone's going to try and do to screw you over.
40:23
All right?
And you know, a trust is going to be a component of this, right?
So like you have to trust the people that you're going to do business with and if you don't, it's gonna be really difficult.
Now that being said you can trust them but you still want to verify, right?
You'll want to make sure that the word say what they say.
They say, you know a lot of times that's not the case, alright?
40:38
And so big picture If you do get to this point, congratulations, it's very, very hard to still grow a business, do all the stuff and sell to and institutional buyer, who will pay, you know, tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars for a company.
These are just some of the lessons that I learned and this is the process.
40:53
It took me a long time to even just figure out how it, worked and foremost Nation.
I make these videos because I no one told me the stuff, and so I'm hoping that for you guys, this helps you out, and if you're doing over 3 million, you can have this up and we'll see what we can do to help you out and help walk you through the process.
So it's lots of everybody.
41:10
Keeping An awesome.








0:00
Looking Uncle Warren, right?
He's got 150 billion in cash sitting right now.
He's not worried about it.
Like, he seemed more Cycles in my have.
She's got 25% of his entire company, value sitting in cash.
He's waiting.
Welcome to the game.
0:15
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I want to get granular some of this advice because, you know again when I started this show it was I was sailing right into the perfect storm of the recession.
0:35
I got my ass handed to me and then had to, you know, climb back out of the pit that I've jumped into basically, and and I wanted this to be the solution for me and it turned out to be exactly what I needed.
But also, for a lot of other people, what's a deeply held belief that you had?
0:54
Maybe three to five years ago, and it can be business or personal like something you really held to be true that you no longer believe.
I can you still trust people the way that you did sounds like, I know nothing about psychology, except through my own research and therapy and all that.
1:11
It's also got a very codependent relationship, especially with Father Figure in your life, right?
So, so naturally you had this very trusting character.
Yeah, did that change over time?
Do you still have that?
Trust.
So, I think that a lot of the revelations, I think came in retrospect more than where active decisions as a, the vast majority of the things where I made mistakes and stumbled into the right way.
1:34
And then try to think, like, what was different than last time?
And I think one of them that you touched on is trust, but a different version of that is, like, the gift taken relationships and I think I Am Naturally, like, if there's a, on a scale from one to ten, like, you know, one being The Taker and 10 being a giver, I'm naturally a 10 and 10's get Run all over ones.
1:56
Don't get opportunities because they're always just trying to take in people just get tired of them.
The vast majority of people are tit-for-tat errs.
So you give I give, which is like the fives, which is the vast majority of the population is transactional and I think that what happened over my career is that I shifted from a 10 to like an 8 and they've actually done a lot of game theory, research on this and found that like eight out of ten is the is the proper amount of give take for optimal outcome.
2:24
Really okay.
So to be clear, you're saying you used to be a giver 10/10 and now you ratchet that down to 8 out of 10.
And that's about the right range, you think?
Yeah.
You just have to know when it is your turn to take and also I would guess because I can speak from that same experience, a very relatable.
2:42
I'm sort of right there with you.
And I was going to ask this just for personal selfish reasons to sometimes.
I feel like I'm always the one giving but then I remember, That, you know, if you're truly giving without the expectation of return, then I shouldn't have those feelings, right?
3:01
Because you know you give it and then if it's without expectations and it's not transactional, then.
Yeah.
You shouldn't care.
You know, it's interesting because like I spent a lot of time to finding words and so I think it's worth looking into like the what the word give means, because you know, what is the difference in giving and donating one has no expectation of return.
3:20
I would imagine with donation giving might not necessarily have no expectations No, like it's like these are the things that I jam on.
You don't know me.
So I don't know, I don't normally pull my phone with like, let's go.
Look the word.
Well I love riffing on this because I think it depends on the person and it's also, it's all about intention, it's the same reason, you know, some people give to a certain charity and they want to be known for status or conscience, or maybe it's like, brownie points in a life after, or maybe it's to feel good right now because, you know, maybe your life is trash and Like if I do a little bit of good that'll offset my feeling lots of different motivations.
3:58
Right?
That's very interesting.
So you think you've changed the most in the giving category of Ratchet it only down to 1/8 do it still gets me high as oh yeah.
I mean yeah.
I mean, you've consumed some of my stuff like it's still very, very, very much.
Give give Centric.
Yeah, the thing you say in every video is I have nothing saying.
4:15
Oh yeah, so it's like, you know, the books 99 Cents.
The courses are free.
Like, you know, at this point I just, I would like, and, you know, is their selfishness in the giving?
Sure I feel good.
You know, I mean, makes, Do better.
I do gain status from doing it.
Like there's plenty, like there's always ways I can pull back to being, you know, selfish and I probably would Define it rather than like giving and taking is, I think the, from a strategic perspective, I have now noticed that it's give give give get rather than give give give take or give you ask is probably I think Gary's is give you ask I do prefer gift gift gift get because I think that that has happened and that might seem contrary to what I just said about tenants and givers.
4:50
I think the 10/10 giving is giving without understanding boundaries.
It's not holding your own space.
Yeah.
It's like, you can't like, I will give this and I will give that because I have agreed that for me.
This is something that I'm willing to give and I will give it, you know, for Lila sleigh.
But it's when you are allowing other people to take from you things that you were not planning on giving.
5:09
And then you choose to rationalize why it's okay, right?
Or like your Partnerships, you know, totally screwed you and then, you know, you, you went back for more.
Yeah.
And I just qualifying like I need like I own those like, those were my mistakes.
I did not know how to structure.
Partnerships.
5:24
I do not know what to look for, you know, and they were all lessons for me.
So I'm grateful for the club and also in your defense, it seems like you have high moral character, you have a big heart and you want to give people a second chance, maybe or the benefit of the doubt.
5:40
At least tell that story about the deal you did with someone who you lend money and then you invoice them or something and it ended up being the wrong calculation.
Tell that story.
Yeah.
So I I ain't wholesaling you try and get a building under contract, right?
5:58
And so someone had found a really dilapidated building that they could buy from the bank.
I think 43 million bucks.
And so they called me up because they're like we need three million dollars but we need it tomorrow.
Yeah.
The bank of Alex right Bank of Alex and I tend to always have a lot of cash on me.
So I was like sure and they were going to pay really good interest rate which is 100,000 a month, as long as they carried the money just like 48 percent years.
6:17
I was like cool.
I mean and you know from a security standpoint it was secured against the building which had already been valued at 5.6, they had an offer with her.
Money on the tables.
They already lined up both sides, had you done business with this person before.
Okay.
So that's why that was so impressed brush, right?
So they both personally, guaranteed it, I was first lien on the this is stuff.
6:35
You were in overtime, right?
First thing on the property and they had earnest money down for a new buyer.
So like all my sides are more or less covered took all the risk out of it for you, right?
No-brainer so I wrote the check so my real estate lawyer which was actually a new lawyer.
I was trying out sent the invoice over once they said hey we've got received the funds like will send it to you with the interest whatever.
6:54
And he had miscalculated, the amount of interest that we had accrued because they did very well in the sale.
Yeah, they did.
Yeah, they did.
I mean, there was a great deal for that, right?
Yeah.
You know, they borrow three, four, you know, they think carried it for three months.
Ash was like three and a half months, so they paid three hundred and thirty or Thirty to fifty thousand in interest.
7:10
They sold it for 56 on someone else's money, so they made 26 - the 300.
So let me to put 2.
Point, 3 4, 90 days works.
Not a bad deal.
So anyways, they sent us the money on the invoice and they're like, hey thought, this didn't make That's because the room we had was this.
7:25
And so we're actually just going to send you the correct amount, which is higher than what you endorsed us.
Calculation was off.
Yeah, so there was like, I think they invest 280 and it was 3:30.
I think it was the actual numbers.
And so, it was down by 50 Grand and I obviously do, you know, the communicated, my lawyer that I was disappointed that you're not thought through it, but I probably should look better too.
7:45
I just didn't think about it.
And his lawyer, the guy that sent the money, had advised him to not send the extra 50 Grand.
He said, listen thousand voice, Sending the money and you know, hey can make it to your Gran extra.
He said you know what like I want to do deals with Alex in the future and this feels like a very short-sighted move and so he said the money and he did end up getting more Goodwill for me from that move and so you know he was the one who ended up saying something to me when he flew out to like we did like a celebratory dinner, he said you know my dad always told me that you only get one name.
8:20
So invest in it accordingly and I always thought about that, I thought was a really good line just like you only get one name.
Like you can change your company's.
You can go back up.
I like your name stays with you.
Yeah.
And so that can either be an asset or can be a liability.
Yeah.
And why not have it be a huge brand.
8:35
Have brand power and of itself?
Yeah.
And what's that line?
Like?
Integrity is what you do when no one's looking.
Yeah.
Right.
And who knew you could have been setting him up, I could have.
And then what happened to that lawyer that you hired him, he's gone.
And how about Hitler?
8:51
He's also so, I mean, that's the super good lesson about you.
Talk a lot about in your videos, how you hire people.
Yeah, not based on skill per se.
First, it's all about moral character.
Yeah, refreshes on what those are.
So we look at, I mean, for us the values that we have, it acquisition not calm and I think it changed by the type of company that you are for us.
9:14
It's unimpeachable character since your candor and competitive greatness and so there's the only three things And we look for them pretty much in that order.
So, and most people think the first one.
So you don't have to really look for the other two.
But when you think about it be true character for me, I like the Navy Seals test that I was told in this may or may not be true.
9:32
But I like to test either way, which was not only like in their world, it's like, well, this guy give me a give his life for me.
I'm not expecting my teammates to do but bear with me.
He said, but that's the ticket to entry to be a Navy.
SEAL, he's like, but Team Six hits.
Do I trust this guy with my wife when I'm not there for a long period of time?
9:49
Do I?
Give this guy a huge amount of money and just say, I'll be back for it.
I'd like, I don't know when I'll be back for it, will it be there 10 years later, right?
And so, if you ask those types of questions, like harder questions, and the favorite one that I have from Warren Buffett that he got, from a holocaust Survivor was, you know, during the Holocaust like with this person, let me in.
10:10
And so, I think that like, those are hard questions, right?
And I'm not saying that I'm expecting a teammate, but they give you frames on like how deep someone's character can go.
We assume that there will be hardship in business because it it is a hard game and so that is guaranteed.
And so it's just a question of when not if and so we try and run out the risk on teammates and portfolio companies by asking ourselves the hard questions before they are in urgent.
10:34
Need would the Alex now higher 20-something Alex, under the same scrutiny from.
I would I would probably just asked me a lot of questions so I probably would have found that it was not I would have noticed that he probably saw me as a father figure and was like this is probably not healthy for this kid at this point.
10:56
And given the level of ambition that I think he has, I think he will outgrow the role in a very short period of time.
I would either have to time in this, some sort of, you know, something I don't know.
I would have to figure something out, where I would say, listen, man, I think like what are we doing to your internship?
Or something like that?
And just like going around or I would probably, you know, it would just really depend on what little Alex wanted but that I mean it would just be asking It's honestly, I mean, it sounds like you're saying know that you wouldn't hire it's because I know him.
11:25
And so I mean I think that you know, some people need to be number one and you know, we look for that and if that's a need, then I would probably pass, right?
Have you ever been wrong about someone's character?
Yeah, I mean, like now now that you're more butter percent.
11:43
You know, who's, you know, who's unbelievable Layla girl, does not miss.
Like I am still more trusting, I am still more like you know what, he was having a bad day or like you know I like maybe like I still will try it because I think I empathize a lot with people who are in difficult situations because I have been in them and I understand the difficulty language doesn't give a fuck Layla, just see through people.
12:05
It's crazy like I mean, even even when we like check in with our portfolio comes like this, just happened.
We had a portfolio company recently, we check in regularly and whatnot obviously, and the CEO is on, we're like anything report.
What's new?
You know?
Gives normal stuff and we got off the call and she was like he's not telling us something I'm like what like you know, like I mean it seems fine to me, right?
12:26
And then lo and behold, we like we find out that there were some there's a big problem that they hadn't told us about and it's just like he just like doesn't miss and so I do leaned on her a lot with that stuff.
So our single rule of marriage that's helped tremendously has just been.
12:43
If we both don't agree with, don't do it.
Whatever it is whether it's an investment, it's a high.
It's a strategic decision.
I have overridden her one time, and it was when I was starting out in the software company, which is our third company after just wait, Jim launch procedure Labs at your cell phone company, then we had Alan the software company and I really wanted to pursue this opportunity and she didn't think it was smart, given the resources and the team.
13:05
We have time started.
They were stretched too thin etcetera and I kind of bulldozed.
It was like, we're doing this and it blew up.
I mean we were at one point seven million a month with them like six months and I business.
So I felt very validated that I had made the right call.
But on the longer term time Horizon, she had seen that there were some flaws in the model, and some things that I hadn't foreseen that ended up biting us as me in the ass.
13:27
And so I go back to what I said, originally, which is a we do.
If we both don't agree, it goes the other way, too.
It's just, I tend to be the SK.
Yeah, that's Chelsea.
I actually got the same advice when I get married because, you know, you you either succeed together or you fail together and and either one can actually be great.
13:45
Yeah, it's together.
You never divided.
Crusty personal question.
So do you guys have joint bank accounts?
I gave her my thing.
It's two weeks into dating her.
Okay.
So they're completely joined yes.
And she takes care of the money because she's good at that.
Yeah.
Okay.
So you don't have separate accounts and you don't don't even have a login.
14:03
I don't even know how much money I really don't.
I get one email from our from hurry.
A every week that just has our balance totals between all of our assets and that's it.
And I just scroll to bottom.
I look at the number and I'm like, cool.
Yeah, she could make it up for all I know I I have no idea.
14:19
I could be poor.
I could be broke.
And I can just somehow somehow I just like live in.
My car do is go through, so I have no idea.
So I don't think that's true.
You like the The Optimist and she's the realest like you're out there, you know, seeing the vision what's possible.
And she's like, bringing back down to earth like, hey, you know, let's get real with this.
14:34
Yeah, depends on the circumstance.
Depends on what we were talking about.
So I think it's the subject matter matters, whether it's people, whether it's friends, whether it's a business decision, I think some of those metal like, we tend to, I would say maybe in general, I think it's going to very broad brush, stroke with with exceptions.
14:50
She tends to be more conservative.
I would say and we always joke, like, if it were only Leila, we would never have any businesses.
And if it were only Alex, we have too many.
Yeah.
Well, that's in that seems, you know, like complementary skills, the in the Yang.
And I'm guessing also that she doesn't like surprises or uncertainty know.
15:09
And I think we, I will say this though.
I think we now over index to both of those polls more because we know the other person exists.
So, like if Layla somehow Hit by a bus tomorrow and I were taking over all of our Affairs.
I know that I would correct towards the middle and be like I want to do this.
15:25
She probably like I have a pretty good gut feel for what she would say, yes to but I'll still, I'll still push it just again and sometimes I'm surprised.
I'm like, oh you are you do you do think this is good?
I'm like all right, let's do it.
Sometimes I just throw them out there as softballs for like her too SWAT down so that when I when I, when I really want one, you know, I've been in like you did say no to all these other ones I was like, so I feel like it's time, you know?
15:45
I don't see like a little Bubbles, like what would Leila do?
You know, second that runs through your calculation for Pickers unbelievable.
But I think we have a very like Warren Buffett, Charlie, Munger dining obviously, you know, we're married.
But like Charlie always says, now Warren was to pursue that.
16:00
It's just like, I think that's it's very natural to have.
Somebody's going to try and pursue opportunities and somebody else just like, is it core?
Is it?
Does it align with what we're trying to go.
Yeah, no, I love that story of, you know, you basically got married for business first and then figured out how to navigate the rest.
16:16
That's super cool.
Yep.
We're living together.
Five weeks after we met in motels in one room.
Okay.
Alex, here's one for you.
You talk about competitive Advantage.
How do you create competitive Advantage?
The easiest is just information, like just no more than the other person and how do you do that?
16:35
I mean, aside from is usually doing more and doing more research, it's both things.
And a lot of times doing more is the research.
So like if you think about every business that exists, that's a very broad statement but I think I'm I think I can back it up.
They all exist based on information Arbitrage, one party knows more than the other party.
16:51
So even if you're like, I remember I said this and I there's a bunch of comments and they were like, well, I own a cattle ranch, how is that information?
We're trying to like, you know, how to farm, you know, how to raise steer, and you sell it to people who do not know how to do that?
As profitably as you do.
Yeah.
17:07
You know how to run that business and you know how to do it profitably and you sell it to people who don't know how to do that and because if they did have all the knowledge you had then they would just do what you're doing and do what they're doing and then they would swallow up the supply chain and that's what vertical integration.
Fundamentally is this, you eat up all the other aspects of the supply chain from within your vertical?
Well and information advertises, it interesting and spot-on but also it makes me think sometimes making it more efficient, or time-saving is a key.
17:30
Maybe, you know, all the information that I know how to get six pack abs.
Okay, I just haven't done it yet.
Yeah, right.
So I know probably as much as you do about how to get six pack.
Our, you know how to, you know, you know, get the guns but maybe you've got a shortcut or you.
17:48
Which would mean I would no more.
Yes, yeah, you're right.
But but I say that in terms of information Arbitrage between a buyer and a seller in terms of how to create value, that's a different question, you know?
I mean like how do I communicate value to a prospect?
That's, you know, the entirety of persuasion and all that other stuff in terms of like how do we pursue opportunities?
18:08
Which is a subject that I'm going to add a whole book about but like opportunity itself, which is just like this big word that people like to throw around like what is opportunity?
How do you have a good opportunity?
Pat opportunity the number one, YouTube.
I have a video I have on my channel as touch on the topic but I see it as three variables.
So you have the total number of potential units to sell, which some people call Tamra, I totally just for Market but how many how many units of this widget could I potentially cell number.
18:31
One, number two is, what is the value to cost discrepancy?
So, how much profit can I potentially make solving this particular problem?
And the number three is what are the competitive Dynamics within the marketplace.
So an example that has two of the three would be like, what if I wanted to sell sell?
18:48
Service, lots of people need it.
The how much it cost me to add an additional customers?
Very, very low.
So very high gross margins, but what are the competitive Dynamics?
Well, there's a lot of really entrenched players.
It's very hard to get into that, right?
And so when I'm looking at an opportunity, I want to see all three.
Now the the difficulty with using those three is that that equation can evolve over time.
19:09
And so if you're starting a business right now, you might not have, you know, self something that everyone in the world can buy, right.
Actually, there's probably not many things that everyone in the world can buy.
He's talking to a diesel Kangen, water.
It's like a it's like alkaline water.
And, you know, I was talking about their Tamara they're like everybody.
19:24
Everybody drinks water is like, yeah, but no one's buying a two thousand dollar water machine.
So that Sam isn't everybody, its people who are fool enough to buy 2,000 or water machines, which is a much smaller part of the 7 billion people on Earth where 80% of them don't have internet.
I don't think your name is big as you think it is, right?
But as you get into business, you learn more.
19:42
And then you realize that you can expand your Market in one way or another.
And I could get into how the different ways.
Expanded Market.
But yeah, give us a little taste.
Yes, the ones I remember from maybe one of the things that you taught me was to think about the scalability of those.
19:57
Yeah, represent and the scalability comes, there's the entrepreneur component which is like, you know, skills traits beliefs which did not if you want.
But then there's the scalability of the of the deliverable which is like how do I create a double deliverable that is more scalable?
If you think about my trajectory, I first that and I would had a job, right?
20:16
And then I Added selling Fitness Services because I was a skill that I learned and then I got other people to do Fitness services for me.
So this is all levels of Leverage like opportunity is just a fancy word for leverage.
And then after that, I sold licensing, which was with media, right?
20:32
So my criminal cross were basically zero, right?
Every new customer was very low for me to didn't cost me much to add them right?
Compared to how much money I can make from them.
And so with the different iterations of fundamentally the same skill set, I knew how to get people in shape.
That was the skill set, right?
I added in learning how to Market Learning how to sell.
20:48
Those were things that added value right now, is when we get into the, the entrepreneur skills traits beliefs like that was from that side.
But that is why I was able to climb the opportunity ladder and gain more leverage on the opportunity that was pursuing and with regards to, how do you increase your total addressable market like.
So, there's four ways to increase it.
21:04
There's five ways to adjust it.
So the first word, the same, don't worry, the fifth one is just the last one, so you can go up Market, which means you're selling to bigger versions of the same thing.
So, let's say I was helping hair, salon owners, I could help people who have chains on her.
Alonzo.
I can help franchisors or license or is of hair salons at Mema, how much smaller demo, but they be much bigger clients to be Enterprise, right?
21:25
I could go down Market which would be selling smaller versions would be like I could I could sell hairstylists right if I want to go down Market from there, people who aspire to be hair stylists.
Right, so it's like a pyramid.
So you all marketing go down, work it.
You can go jacent market, which is what's similar to hairstyles that probably has similar wants and needs.
21:40
So probably like a lash Salon or flowers of nail salon.
Yeah, exactly.
So I would be an adjacent Market or I could go broader sober.
Water is where you take all adjacent markets under one umbrella which would be Beauty, right?
So be like I help.
All Beauty type brick-and-mortar businesses, right?
I would be going broader and so there's the four ways you can increase the total voltage trust won't work out of whatever thing that you're serving.
22:00
The fifth is you can go narrower.
So I say that you can increase it, four ways, the fifth is you gon are we get more more specific about the constraints that you apply to a requisites to become a customer.
The reason that most times with businesses, that I take on in the portfolio, it's actually the first step we do is we actually narrow it most times.
22:17
And it's because they are they don't even know who they serve and they don't know who they serve fast.
And so when you're starting out, one of the best practices you can do is the fancy word is a common factor analysis.
But basically, what is what all the best clients we have have in common.
So if we take 100 clients and we look at the top 20% because there's spread out there probably response for 80 percent of Revenue.
22:35
Anyways we look at 20%, we say what do they all have in common and then what if we only sold that amount of people and we sold now the same hundred but they were all of that 20%.
Well we would 5xr Revenue.
Same operational drag because the same size company but we're selling better customers and get on with entrepreneurs all the time.
22:53
They're like, I think I saturated my market and I'm like, all right.
What's your, what's your, what's your Revenue?
I like 2 million bucks here, like, okay.
Well, the market you're serving is a 60 billion dollar industry and you are making two million dollars a year.
Do you feel like I was like do you feel like you feel like you might be premature or you just don't know how to get more customers?
23:12
Like well I guess I don't have any more questions like that's a problem that solvable.
So let's solve that Right?
And so then we can we can we can break down.
There's many ways to get customers so I can write that down too if yeah but if it's a certain type of business or industry that you gravitate to for that position.
What?
Yeah so we work with Business Services consumer services ideally businesses that re learning course like I love licensing model so I love no overhead yeah hi cash.
23:39
Yeah exactly.
And yep and the problems that those companies typically have and we take them on usual between 3 and 10 million is when we like in top.
And sales as when we start working with them.
The problems that they usually have is that it's to founder, let it stew personality brand driven.
They don't have enough customer lifetime value.
23:55
As in they sell something one time, they can't get people to keep buying, the can't get people to stick.
They have high turn but they typically have high cash flow, but it's very dependent on usually one or maybe two channels of acquisition.
And so, we will kind of lay out our Five-Year Plan to getting them from, basically, a company that has almost no value to getting to like 30 to 50, maybe 100 million dollars in Enterprise Value and a company that has multiple acquisition stream.
24:16
An extended LTV, the LTV allows us to have all these different acquisition channels, but we depends on the, like, the order in which we solve them, depends on the business.
Would you have to pay for the domain acquisition.com?
Was it expensive?
Yes, 400 and not that bad actually.
I looked at marketing.com is 5.6 million.
24:34
Okay.
I thought about the I told Layla, I'd send her a proposal I'd never emailed.
I don't email, I don't check email.
If anyone ever emails when I don't read it.
So, just let me know later today to propose.
I was like so I was thinking So I price anchored with marketing.com and I was like, we could also get acquisition, not calm, which is 400, she's like well that seems much more reasonable exact anchored 5.6 but but marketing.com, I still sometimes think about because I do like that.
24:59
I like that domain but the thing is, is the reason I ended up doing acquisition wasn't even for the money is because the type of people and portfolio companies that I am looking for, use the word acquisition, the people who don't know business, I Don't Know.
But like everyone knows that the word marketing means our thinks they know what the word marketing, right?
25:15
It's a little bit more.
General right, people who are trying to scale their companies, talk about cost of acquisition and so it also had the double entendre of we you know, acquirement already I you know, stakes in the companies in addition to helping with acquisition.
So I kind of like that components.
Ooh.
Yeah for a Grammy and seems like a seal because I think as like five or six years ago Zuckerberg bought FB.com for like 8 million dollars or something like that.
25:39
Just like probably also a great deal in retrospect.
Yeah.
Interesting.
All right I got a couple more things.
I'm telling you, I Could I could sit for hours, I think a lot of people want to know this.
The answer this next question, which is, what is the fastest road to Financial Freedom?
25:55
He talked about everything you're doing on YouTube.
I have nothing to sell.
I'm doing it to help people who you know, are broke.
Yeah.
You've got assuming 10 plus million dollars sitting in the bank today.
Maybe thinks to Layla closer to 15 I'm guessing.
All right, when will the cash And talk about that too.
26:18
Like why why can't I think everything is really fluffy right now.
So I mean I sold three companies last year and house and two cars.
So I sold everything last year.
Okay.
Yeah, so you're you're looking at what's happening predicting there was inflated pricings.
I mean, a lot of people are really afraid of inflation, and I think that's super warranted.
26:36
I don't know.
I think it's just like, that's a purely like this is like, looking at Uncle Warren, right?
He's got 150 billion in cash sitting right now.
He's not worried about it.
Like, He seemed more Cycles in my have.
She's got 25% of his entire company, value sitting in cash, he's waiting.
26:54
And that means it's, I mean to be clear, it's not working for you.
It's not earning.
I mean it's earning a tiny bit of Interest compared to what you could have in stock sir.
Yeah.
Investment properties.
So a little inflation is not going to kill me but like when you look at the NASDAQ during the crashing, whatever 01 or whatever, though your was, it drop by 78%, right?
27:15
So That would be significant it would be significant.
Yeah and so I think just given the timing, I'm willing to wait a little bit and see what's going on.
And I also am very close to a transaction.
So I'm not going to like immediately allocate all the money that sounds like a bad idea.
And so that is why I have for cash that I probably would normally.
27:32
Yeah.
Do you see yourself coming like, do you see see yourself?
They talk about this scarcity mindset, you think that's rooted, maybe in your family story, which is, you know, your, your dad basically had to reinvent himself as the doctor coming.
And over from a different country.
27:48
Thank you, scarcely.
One said, I don't think so.
Wasn't that the reason he was worried about you choosing this path is because know I was scarcely.
I think it was fear.
I don't think they're necessarily the same thing, fear of losing anything, right?
Likes fear of not being able to provide or of not being six.
I mean, I think my dad was afraid of what me, being a failure would reflect on him.
28:04
I don't think anything was scarcely.
I think it just like he was afraid that it would look bad on him.
Hey Mose, an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright, so send me a Request a note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
28:20
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
So then back to the quickest road to Financial Freedom.
I mean, the first answer that can't like the bullet, like the quick answer was knowing thyself, right?
28:39
Which is a lot of people because right now at furnish of school and won't be cool in a few years when I will lose everything.
And so that'll probably probably calibrate a little bit.
And so I think it's just, it's the one thing that you can always protect yourself with that.
And this is something that I have learned from my, you know, Iranian family is, you know, when When when the revolution happened in Iran who talk about Legacy lands buildings houses, bank accounts coverage says those are ours.
29:07
No, that's it.
If your legacy gone that's why I'm like and you were like I'm going to build a legacy and like u.s. might not even be the superpower in 500 years.
Your kids, your kids might be in Bangladesh, who knows?
India might be the the hotspot 500, no nose, right?
29:23
And so, that was a touch of Legacy, but Skills are the only thing that will always appreciate in time and work in compound compound in concert.
So when they work together, if you know how to do math and you can learn how to do accounting, if you learn how to do accounting, you can learn how to do tax work for heart attacks, working for HUD Insurance, works for your insurance works.
29:42
Then you all of a sudden you're a CFO and you can prepare companies for sale.
Like the skill stack on top of each other specialized skills are valuable independent of the currency where the economic climate.
And so if you are good you will always have a place to provide value because people want good stuff.
Prices may vary currencies may vary, but people will want the things you have, if you are good.
30:02
And the only way to get good is to work.
And so, I think that a lot of people spend a lot of their time, in paralysis trying to figure out what the quote ideal opportunity would be when you won't know what the ideal opportunity is because you don't have a Baseline and I believe that research is done through doing and you learn a lot more by doing stuff in action.
30:22
And then you will gain the insights of where the opportunities lie, which is why y combinator had become up again.
What they look for in past Founders, one of their criteria for successful business is past experience in the industry and that can be.
I just wrote a tiny blurb about this in the book that I'm writing.
30:37
That can be tangential.
Like, if your dad owned a mechanic shop or was a mechanic, you probably know a lot more about cars than you thin like you to you.
It seems obvious but like, I don't know anything about cars.
Nothing nor do.
I really have the interest but like, if you wanted to get in the space, you probably have some level of knowledge.
30:53
Some people look at just the whole world.
They're like, I don't know anything.
This is maybe you could like, but I think it's better to have some level because usually we have learned stuff in our lives, whether we like it or not and starting in the in every industry that your parents.
Your cousin's, you worked in there was massive opportunity.
31:10
It just depends on how you structure, right?
So like let's say, my first job was, I was a blender tender at Smoothie King.
First of all, I got blender tending, not a very good opportunity, right?
I'm probably not going to scale that managing their probably not either owning the owning the The the location little bit more leverage.
31:28
Because now, I've leveraged on labor, right?
Owning the franchise much more, right?
And so, like all Industries, if you go high enough up and this is the rule of thumb for anyone.
If you want to see where we're opportunity exists, look at the businesses that have been here the longest because they make tons of money, the only reason they would exist is because they can they can exist during downturns.
31:48
The only way you can exist during downturns, you make tons of prophets all the time so that you can weather.
It JP Morgan's been here for longer than anybody's been alive, right?
The big insurance companies.
Why is insurance or profitable?
Because you pay them for nothing, right?
Like pink hundreds of.
32:04
I mean, depends on what it like.
You pay thousands and thousands thousands here for something that may never happen and they just know how to appropriately.
Value risk.
Assess risk, excuse me and so wonderful business, right?
Insurance.
The point is, is like, I've now learned to see this as like, when I see big businesses, the bigger the business, the more I realize that there's probably a very high gross margin opportunity.
32:24
So you look at the biggest companies on the stock, Market.
Look at what they're doing the base unit that they're selling typically has tremendous like the biggest company in the world right now in terms of profit is like Exxon that's number one, terms of net free cash flow.
That's created the crazy.
Like people are like, Facebook know, it's excellent.
32:40
Why?
Because they drill water out of the ground and they sell it for however, many hundred dollars per right.
It's not water, it's oil, but it works the same way, right?
And so, and that's a massive over generalization, but like you get the idea and so Facebook cells eyeballs, which cost them basically.
Nothing Google sells almost across Basically nothing.
32:57
And so all of these types of businesses, and this is where people get into the ethics, or on capitalism and whatnot.
But, like, you suffer with the market values it at period, and your goal as a business, is to drive your cost down as much as you can, right?
As long as you're still a long-term greedy, which is, if you drive them to low or you don't pay people won't.
33:12
If you introduce new levels of risk, which then long-term you actually lose money.
So that's when you get to the long term for a term like CEO, ship of publicly traded companies and stuff, which we don't need into.
But like if you, if you were to only on the company and you could not ever exit and you made Made your decisions with long-term greed in mind.
33:29
Then you usually make the right calls and I'll say one last thing about the how to how to get Freedom biggest mistake that I see young people or people who are young in the game making is that they want to become millionaires in 90 days.
And when most times you could guarantee that you can become a millionaire in a decade.
33:45
But you have to be willing to not be a millionaire 49 of those 10 years.
And if I had everyone signed a contract that said that when they were 20, they could all be millionaires from their 30 but no one's willing to do that.
And so Happens is for the rest of their lives.
They keep chasing the shiny object over and over again, and keep battling the same boss and losing.
34:03
So you're talking about taking a thousand dollar paycheck and taking 300 of it, and putting it into savings, and living, on less living under your means.
Yeah.
For nine years, and that compounds, and that, you know, I mean, there's the investment side and I'm not despite having a high net-worth, I'm not an Uber invest, I've made my money with businesses.
34:25
I haven't made my money investing.
And so for people who are starting out the know, thyself pieces, am I going to be somebody who has entrepreneurial Tendencies and could potentially own a business?
Business ownership is the best way to create wealth.
It's also, the best way to lose was so dry, hopefully Illustrated the beginning of this.
34:44
And so, it's high risk, its high reward.
And so, yes, it is the way to it is the way to the most wealth.
It may not necessarily be be the way to the fastest wealth.
So like if you're like, I think most most guys, To have our own Tendencies, could could make two hundred thousand a year, 300,000 a year.
35:02
Becoming excellent at sales, like if you just learn that skill and that skill translates to all aspects of Life, most people who are in business not to sell at some level, they know how to sell investors, they had to sell their teams, they know how to sell someone to recruit to bring on the bike, you have to sell.
And so I think for most people, gaining that, I think those initial jobs are undervalued for your ability to learn.
35:23
And so a lot of guys are just looking for the perfect job, when the Good job is the Assembly of maybe three or four jobs that you have to gain skill sets in different areas and I think Warren Buffett said it best.
That's probably good.
Wrap up, which is whenever you're working, you should either be learning or learning.
So, either you're working for the paycheck because it's material to you, or you're working because the incremental increase in knowledge is material to you, but it should check one of those two boxes.
35:47
So, this show is called behind the brand.
What do you think the definition of a brand is and and how do you build a brand?
So I see Brand as reputation and I see reputation as what people say about you, when you're not there.
So that is your brand.
36:03
I think a lot of people take a lot of times you try and build their brand, but I think you build your brand inside out.
So what is the outcome 0?
Z brand.
I mean, I would say it's aligned with the values that we have, you know, it's on a virtual character since your candor I try and be honest with as much as I possibly can and I try and do the right thing as much as I possibly can.
36:22
And competitive greatness like within the rules by, we will play it will play to win and I don't need to know your current net worth.
I'm sure you shared it.
Yeah, and so well.
So do you have your sights on a particular goal?
36:39
Are you trying to get to a billion?
Leonor.
Yeah, so I have two goals on the horizon.
The first goal is to get Leila on the forks 104 self-made richest women so we only have to have 250 million here or there.
So that's that's like the like the immediate goal.
Okay.
36:55
How far away is that?
Is that 150?
I mean like is it a year away, is it?
No I think I think realistically, I think we'll get there like 36 months.
Yeah, I think we'll get there 36.
Once you know the next goal would be, would be, would be billion and that's just because like, if you look at how the highness Actually kind of funny for anyone who's curious the way net worth is broken up, is you have high net-worth very high.
37:17
So high.
Net worth is 125 million and assets, invest wasit's, very high.
Net worth is 5 to 30 million investment assets.
And then 32, a billion, big range is ultra high, net worth and then above billion is bleeding.
Those are the four.
37:33
Those are the four networks categories that exist.
Right?
That, so that for me, it's like, we're all trying it worth now.
And so, you know, getting to the building, I guess is the next thing.
All the while we realized that we're doing it for no real reason other than, For the Love of the Game and because the mission of the company.
37:51
And so, like, if you talk about brand, I told you about our values, but the mission is to document and share the best practices of building world-class companies.
And so that's why we make the books, that's why we make the YouTube, that's why we make the courses.
That's why education will be a core to everything.
We do because what we're doing also that matters most to us, let me ask you a follow-up question, which is, why is that Forbes 400 list important to you for her?
38:15
Or is it her goal?
I think it's more.
It's definitely Michael.
Why is that important to you?
I think it's cool.
I think I like for really no other.
Like I think it's cool.
Yeah.
And it's a vanity metric Jour.
Yeah.
I think it's trophy.
Why not be awesome?
Like that'd be cool.
Yeah, I think that's good.
38:31
That's a good enough reason because it'd be cool.
Okay.
Final parting words of advice.
Dan Sullivan said something that I really like.
You said, wanting something is reason enough.
A lot of people trying to ask you to justify, why, why do you want that?
Why do you want to date that girl?
Why don't you start that business?
38:46
Because I want it like that is the reason I want it.
Yeah, already because you can.
Yeah.
What was the last question?
You said final parting words of advice.
Oh, party words of advice.
You writing this new book.
Maybe let's ramp into it that way.
39:02
So the last book, you know, sort of left off where some of your last videos are give us a preview into what the next chapter is what the next book is about.
So, Textbook tentatively is titled hundred dollar leads because most people had to fix their offers, which is the title of which hundred offers was the first book, which is what do you actually going to present to a customer in order to get them to give you money?
39:23
The second thing that happens after people have that and people start giving the money as they want more.
And so they want more people present to and so they need more leads.
And so the subject of that, the title of the book is leads, but the subject of the book is advertising which by the definition, is to make known so, how to make known.
So you've made a shift recently which is, you know, you used to Basically, by leads or by advertising.
39:44
So, you know, advertising by definition is to spend money to make known right by definition, its to make no, not to spend money.
Just because it's a, it's a, it's an important Point that's fair.
My interpretation is, there's two paths.
There's direct marketing or direct response advertising.
40:01
And then there's branding and I think I've heard you say, if you were a T20 advertising or direct marketing before you are now flip the script and you more into branding, Why did you do that?
And why do you think that's better now?
Because you're more established.
40:16
You have the money in the bank, you've done the business.
I think that having money to make enables for Branding, right?
And so I actually think that branding is a higher return on Advertising over a longer time Horizon, me too.
And so it just takes longer to come to fruition and if you are patient and have money, it's by far, the superior strategy, right?
40:37
But when you don't have money, you need to make money today to pay for your advertising in general.
Whatever.
Are those efforts are to make known then having a direct response.
I think I think people do end up shifting over time from don't like Seth.
Godin is famous for being a hardcore, direct response marketer and then being all about branding.
Now Gary Vee was you know more darker spots built on build the Wine Library on PVC from Google is more about branding and I feel like I've made a similar transition, but I think you have to like yeah it's almost like you have to Discover It Yourself rather than be told it like it doesn't, it has to become real for you and then it has to click.
41:08
And so for me I feel like branding has clicked in terms of Understanding of its value overall, it is more difficult to measure but it is absolutely like when you look at Louis Vuitton and, you know, Bernard arnault who's the who's the owner, right?
He's worth 150 billion or whatever it is.
Now, he's the only one who's not a tech guy, who's all the top that list and it's because he's built a brand, he's able to sell a purse that costs $100 for eight thousand dollars, right?
41:31
Simply because of a brand and that's like so what is his return on on Advertising?
Probably higher than people who are the hardcore drug response, you know, fun Whole, you know, ups and downs above all like, just, you know, by two purses for one-off like that's direct response, whereas it could just be, you know, Brandon could just be a picture of LeBron with a Louis Vuitton handbag or whatever.
41:52
Yeah, I mean so your opinion you're right aligned with with what I've heard from everyone else and I had this conversation with Seth many times.
Yeah and well I said that direct response is sort of like the Tortoise and the Hare like so it's the hairs race is the advertisement of the direct response and you're right.
42:10
Sometimes you need to The funnel because you got to keep the lights on or your you know you bleeding out three thousand dollars a day and he got to get those leads that convert to sales and then if you can do branding it's like the tortoise is race slow and steady but it ends up winning the race and he said if you want to know whether or not you have a brand or not you know, people will pay extra premium for a brand.
42:34
He said, if you go into most hotels and you don't look at the Marquis, look at the carpet around the walls if you don't know where you are.
Are you can't smell it.
You can't see it.
You can't taste it.
Then you don't have a brand, you have a logo, and a brand is, you know, he used the example of Nike and The Story Goes, you know, if Nike built a hotel you could kind of imagine what that might look like or smell like or feel like and you know same goes for our personal brands.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
He said I think you have a level 10 skill set in a level two opportunity and that was one of those simultaneously, incredibly encouraging things and Incredibly heartbreaking things for me.
So it's very like emotional moment for me.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
0:32
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
So, we all have lots of conversations that are pivotal points in our life, and I Define learning as similar circumstance, new Behavior.
0:52
So, if you have the same circumstances in your behavior doesn't change, it means you didn't learn anything.
So, these conversations changed my behavior, which is why they were so pivotal in my life direction that ultimately made me a millionaire, what 27?
And I believe, whatever path were on.
We always pay for lessons with either time or money and so we use the one we value least and so for me I always wanted to pay time and money to As many lessons as I could.
1:17
So I could learn the lessons of my four year old self.
Learn the lessons of my fifth year, old self and apply them in my 20s to drag that future into the present.
These are the things that changed my life.
The first one is about my character, my dad told me when I was 19 and at a terrible reputation and I was asking him, I said, hey, how do I change my reputation?
1:34
How do I get these people to think differently about me?
And I thought I needed some marketing, hacker, some repackaging.
Hack of like how I needed a dress or pure, whatever, in his own words.
He said, why don't you stop acting like an asshole and your reputation will catch?
Up with you and I just counted him at the time, but as it kind of marinated and I, you know, I drove back to college.
1:51
I started thinking about it.
I was like, huh, maybe he's right.
And so what I started doing was acting the way that I thought I wanted my reputation to be and the beginning.
No one cared.
They treated me the way I used to be.
But when the way I was behaving was different than what they were expecting.
The way they saw me started to shift and it took about two years for my reputation to change and that was a long time, but I was really dedicated to doing it for me, rather than doing it for them.
2:15
And then eventually Myra, Titian caught up at one of my first jobs, a mentor of mine who's very, very wealthy said, figure out what you want is 99 times harder than getting it.
And I'm pretty sure happiness is living as many days in a row that are good as you can.
2:31
And a lot of times when I try to think about, like what makes me happy, what brings me joy?
It's really hard to think about that, from a big picture perspective, but when I drilled down to like, what is a perfect day look like for me and then tried to string as many of those in a row as I could, my life started.
2:46
To change because it wasn't this big amorphous idea.
I just know that these are things I like doing everyday and so I optimize for that outcome.
And then that extrapolated over the rest of my life, created a life that I desired.
Another early Mentor, I was going back and forth between quitting my job and starting a gym or starting my entrepreneurial journey.
3:05
And he sat me down and said, you know, man I've been listening to you waffle for months.
Now, he said at some point, you're not going to know anymore, you just have to jump and he said it in a way that made me feel like a pansy.
But when he said that I realized I didn't need more information at already done, all of the research already had as much information as I was going to have.
3:26
I just needed to decide.
So the definition of decision comes from Latin dica Dairy which basically means to cut off or kill off.
And so, the question was, which future was I decided to kill off.
Was it the future that I was in currently that I didn't like anymore or is the future that I had potential to accomplish the dreams that I had?
3:42
And so by not deciding, I was actively killing off the future that had my dreams and then I needed to choose which one I wanted to kill.
And that was one of the things that pushed me over the edge.
The next conversation was about sales and so in the very beginning of our internal journey, I didn't know how to sell anything and rather than going through sales scripts and you know, building Rapport and learning all of this stuff.
4:02
When a mentor just said, do you want to know the secret to sales?
I was like, I leaned in.
I was like, yes, please.
I got my note that out.
You said the secret to sales is making an offer.
So good people feel stupid saying now and that obviously became the subtitle of my under million-dollar offers book and was because it was so pivotal in my life when I realized that I kept thinking that I had to learn how to like, Again, turn manipulate, and try and persuade, and sure some of those skills are useful to have, but the big obvious one is that people didn't want the thing.
4:29
And so a lot of people spend lots of effort and time trying to get better at the skill of persuasion.
When it's so much easier to just find things that people really want Chick-fil-A doesn't need to sell you on chicken sandwiches.
They just have amazing chicken sandwiches, people.
Go buy them, right?
And so, when you make the offer still good, people feel stupid saying, no, they usually don't and that forever changed.
4:46
How I created new products, created new Services was I started with how do I get the most people to say, yes.
And then, Backwards.
One of my next mentors, was a ten billion dollar CEO, he's actually Cielo.
So he was with a company from 100 million in Revenue to 10 billion in Revenue publicly traded.
5:02
And honestly, he came to me before I was really ready for that, kind of advice.
And one of the things he always kept telling me when I was starting out was he's like, you gotta go slow to go fast.
He kept repeating it to me over and over and over again.
The thing is, is like I didn't appreciate what he was trying to tell me at the time.
5:18
And I can really only appreciate it now in retrospect because I feel like I tell this to people, The time is that you only unlock the compounding which later on grow, significantly faster than the erratic activity of small thing here, small thing here, new thing here, new thing here, then just doing the same thing for an extended period of time and so what feels slow in the micro looks fast in the macro.
5:39
When you look at the trajectory over a long period of time but what looks really fast in the micro is usually really slow in the macro because people can never get that compounding start harnessing because they're always starting back over at Ground Zero.
So even though they go from 0 to And over and over again, it feels really fast.
They never get from 1 to 10 that changed.
5:57
How I acted within my business and really conserving resources in terms of how few things are.
We really going to allocate time and effort towards in terms of new initiatives and being very sparing in terms of when we would do that?
Because I would have to know that I was going to incur the cost of change because whenever you change something the one cost is guaranteed is that change will have to get paid for and what isn't guaranteed is that it's going to work and so if you know your have this fixed cost which is How you should see it is that whenever you change something you have to pay a price and are you willing to pay the price?
6:26
If it only gives you a marginal return which often times, many of the small business, I see they try and optimize stuff all day long for these tiny little returns that don't matter because they never are in excess of the cost of change.
The next lesson, I learned was in level of effort.
So one of my early mentors told me about flyers.
6:41
And so I thought I need to go put a lot of Flyers out to get business.
And so, I put out 300 Flyers.
One guy called me back, he told me that I didn't, his car is very upset, no one else called it.
So called the Metro back up and I was like, hey, what the heck?
This didn't work.
And he said, okay well you know what was your test sighs?
6:57
It was like we mean by test sighs.
He's like well you know what was the first test?
I was like, well I mean I just put out 300 total he just laughs, he's like 300.
He's like you're not gonna do anything with 300.
He's like, we test with 5,000, then we do 5,000 a day after that, it's like 5,000 a day.
So yeah.
Like a hundred fifty thousand fires a month.
7:13
When you said that, I had this huge realization that I might have been doing the right thing all along, but I was just doing far too little of it.
And at that point, I decided that whenever someone gave me advice, I wouldn't let the volume of activity that I'd done committing to a plan or committing to a project to be the reason it failed because I wondered to myself, how many things had I done in the past?
7:34
That were the right things but I just hadn't done enough of them or I hadn't done them long enough.
And so whenever I do new initiative now I think okay what is the maximum amount that I can do?
That would be unreasonable that.
I don't have a large enough sample size that this works and then then I can draw my conclusion.
I see so many smaller younger entrepreneurs.
7:50
Who do something for Short too.
Little time not enough volume that they might have been doing the right thing.
They didn't wait long enough or they didn't do enough of it.
And so I never wanted that to be the reason.
I failed the next conversation I had wasn't really even a conversation.
I was at actually a mastermind and I saw a guy get up and he seems so disorganized and so not passionate at all about his business and he said yeah you know we're making three or four hundred thousand dollars a month.
8:16
It's like we've been stuck here for a few years bababababa and Layla and I were actually together at this point and And we both looked at each other and were like, if this guy can do it, we can do it.
And it was one of those moments that like concrete changes were beliefs are broken, right?
8:32
And I think one of the easiest ways to break a belief, is be around people who are making significantly more than you.
Because what you find out is that they are made of the same thing as you same, flash, same bones, same brain, you meet them and you're like, how is this guy doing it, right?
And rather than write off this guy such an idiot, think, despite him being an idiot or despite her being an idiot?
8:51
He still more successful than me.
Imagine if I use my work ethic in my intelligence on the same lessons that this guy obviously has, right?
And when I shifted my perspective from that way, I was able to start using other people's successes to fuel me rather than to make me feel bad.
9:09
It switched from wanting to cast stones at people to being inspired by them and thinking if they can do it.
So can I and really internalizing that?
And that was a big turning point for me.
Within six months of seeing that conversation happen, we're already doing a million a month and at the time we were doing, like 20,000 a month at a different event.
9:25
I went up and I spoke and I told my whole plans of how I wanted to build this national gym chain, be America's next gym, and the guy who ran the Mastermind said, you know what, Alex, I don't think she'd do that at all.
And I was crushed.
Like, I didn't even like, I barely could hear what he was about to say next because all I could hear was like, this is just like, my whole plan.
9:44
I've been working for years towards this I have six locations.
This I'm going to attend this, I'm going to 20 all the stuff and he said, I think you have a level 10 skill set and a level two opportunity and that was one of those simultaneously, incredibly encouraging things and Incredibly heartbreaking things for me.
10:01
So it's very like emotional moment for me.
But he was both encouraging me to say the like you can do so much more that he was pooh-poohing me because I could have been doing more and I think one of the most terrifying lines of the Bible, when I was a practicing, Christian was to whom much is given Given much is expected and that always terrified me because I was thinking like, man I've been given so much and so a lot more was expected of me and this person from the outside, put a bar up that was significantly higher than what I was shooting for and that stretched my Horizon for what I was capable of and I think getting around people who can do that for you is one of the most valuable things you can possibly have in your life.
10:38
And from a opportunity perspective, what he didn't say which I had to later find out for myself was a level 2 Opportunity as he was defining it.
Is an opportunity that has low leverage.
There wasn't a very good compounding vehicle for Capital.
There wasn't a very good compounding vehicle in general, from a business model perspective.
10:55
There was no Limitless scale with media.
There was no Limitless scale with software code and so the only thing that I had to do really in this business model was just hire more people and it was also lots of low skilled labor which made it a very difficult opportunity to succeed in.
And so the fact that I was successful in what most would consider a shitty opportunity.
11:13
He saw as a skill sets that would create a much bigger win later.
And so if you are in a lower level opportunity, I wouldn't say be upset about it.
I would say you're learning with extra resistance against you.
So you're getting stronger now.
And then when you go onto the moon, where gravity is lighter, you just knock it out of the park.
11:31
The next conversation I had was actually an event.
It was a private event.
Whose 10 people everyone was doing like eight figures are more year and I got invited we were doing like three or four million years.
I felt like the, you know, small dick in the locker room and after I went up and I explained our business model and this is right as things started to take off.
This is like the And month and things were just ask.
11:48
Elating like crazy.
The guy came up to me in this guy done, 27 million dollars in a single day, I was like, holy shit.
This is crazy guys.
Made more in a day than I met in my entire life and he said if everything that you're saying is true, he said, fat pitches in life.
12:03
Don't come very often when it gets easy as when you need to go hard.
Because otherwise, there's someone who's ten times bigger than you, who's going to take everything you have and not even think twice about it, they're going to eat your lunch and cast, you aside and take everything you Like I felt like my stomach dropped because all of a sudden what he did was instill fear in me because up to that point like right at that point, I thought I'd made it.
12:25
You know, we were taking him 300, you know, ish a month and if you're like wait, how are you doing 300,000 months taking them through an, I'd like no employees and it's making it all myself and that renewed probably in a bad way.
Whatever you want to say it renewed.
This huge sense of urgency for me that stayed for three years before I was able to like take my head out of the ground and said like is this the life I want?
12:43
And so from like three hundred to four hundred thousand month 24, Million a month that was literally fueled by that one conversation and every day, I would wake up and think everyone's trying to take me out, everyone's trying to copy my stuff, everyone is trying to do that.
And it pushed me and I think that if you do have one of those opportunities that comes up in your life when things start working really?
13:03
Well, that's when a lot of people ease off the gas, that's when they go easy.
But it's like when it gets easy is when you go hard because you don't have that many fat pitches in a lifetime, you might get two or three and you just gotta crack the shit out of it when it comes.
And It's that you're going to sacrifice some short term for some long-term later.
13:21
So at the same event different person, after I give him my host pick, this is a very powerful event, for me, a different guy, came up to me and he said, hey, because I had this point.
I was like, hey, I'm doing three hundred thousand dollars a month and thinking about starting a supplement business and I'm gonna start that, you know, what a month or two and everything was like, oh, you're like doubling every month with this current thing.
13:39
Like, why do you want to start a supplement business?
And I give my reasonings and he was like, flatter me he said, Ed.
What if you just spent three times as much in marketing and didn't start us up on my business and all these guys make more money than me.
So, I was like, well what's the point of asking for advice?
13:56
If I don't take it.
And so I took the advice, I didn't start the supplement business.
I actually delayed it for 18 months, which still probably wasn't the best call but I delayed it.
And in the next three months we tripled the ad spend and went from 400 to 780 from 782 a million from a million to 12 from 12 to 15, 15 to 18, Hate to two million, just the next six months because of that piece of advice.
14:21
And I think the underlying part of that advice is that when something is going well, oftentimes entrepreneurs, think.
Great.
I won.
How can I get another win?
But the real win is just doing ten times more of that thing.
The hardest part is getting product Market fit.
It's getting people to want to buy The Thing.
Once you have that you don't need to innovate that anymore.
14:38
All your innovation has to go through.
How can we do more volume?
The next lesson was from a guy who had a big e-commerce brand.
So use doing like 30 million a year at the time.
Again, I was doing three or four million at this exact moment, and I was like, oh my God, this guy is God and he gave this huge presentation.
It was like 2 hours long and I basically understood on it but it was way, high level like traffic stuff and like intent audiences.
15:00
Like I don't even ship and I just like, I wanted to take something from it and at the very end someone else think God raised their hand was like where did you learn all this stuff?
And he said at this point in my career I can't learn a ton from courses and Mastermind and coaching programs Said, I learn through giving myself a learning budget, he said, so pick a percentage, whatever it is. 10% 20% of your marketing spend and put that towards new ideas and expect to lose it.
15:30
But when you're losing it, you're gaining the lesson, you're gaining the experience and what happens is like, you know, four out of five times more crazy ideas values like, but one out of five.
He's like they crush and become the Leading Edge Innovation, that pushes us to the next level and him saying that at that moment I immediately Took a number and I wrote down what my new learning budget was going to be.
15:49
And it gave me permission to spend money without a return immediately.
And so it happened is if you think big picture, he just extended my time Horizon for a return.
And so rather than saying I have to make my money back immediately within 30 days of me spending this.
I said, if I extend my Horizon over my lifetime, if I spend this money, I will learn and be better and I will learn faster than somebody who doesn't.
16:08
And so that permission forever changed how I approach.
New acquisition channels, new sales processes.
New products, I just gave Myself a budget to say it is acceptable to lose this and then I committed to that.
And that was a huge pivot point for how we were able to scale and try new things because it wasn't uncontrolled testing, it was controlled.
16:28
And I looked forward to spending on my learning budget every month and it just gave me permission to be creative knowing that it would be okay to fail.
And for somebody who doesn't like failing, it was a huge deal for me.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
16:48
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can fly anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
The next one, I got from a pastor between Layla and I he gave us a single piece of marriage advice that we have taken to day.
17:08
We have used countless times in our lives, both in our marriage, or marriage, personally, and professionally in the business.
You said, if you don't agree, don't move forward and it was such a simple piece of advice.
Because in some context, there's like who's the alpha?
Who's that?
Like we have always made our decisions together and if we don't agree, we slow down.
17:28
And so a lot of times we impose this false The Virgin see on ourselves when there's almost nothing that is urgent, like unless you're going to die, which is the only real urgency, because then you don't make any choices after that.
If you do, like, if there is no death, then a lot of times taking an extra second thing, okay?
17:44
Is there something we're missing?
Is there a frame that we're not seeing?
And so if we don't agree, first question, we always ask is what information are you using?
Right.
And so, oftentimes one of us will have data that the other person doesn't which is why if we have the same data because we have the same values and same Mission, we do ultimately come to the same.
18:00
So oftentimes when we don't agree it's because one of us know, something or emphasizing a different piece of information than the other person and then we can get down to the information and talk about that rather than hating the other person for disagreeing and thinking that they're stupid or that you're stupid or anything that has saved me so many mistakes in my life, like it has been one of the most valuable pieces of information and you can make that agreement with a business partner.
18:22
It doesn't have to be a spouse.
You can make it with your spouse and it doesn't have to apply to business, but I think that if you are equally yoked right in your partnership with somebody, Making that the bottom line has just served me so well.
Much later on in my career I went to a big half a billion dollar Mastermind.
18:38
So there was like 10 of us there and the total sales are going.
The room is about half a billion dollars on like this is pretty cool.
So I might business do a little better at this point but I was still among the smaller ones.
I think we were doing 30 or 40 million dollars a year at the time and plenty of guys there.
Right. 100.
You know, 200 etcetera and I you know, I had my goggles on.
18:56
I was like what are these guys have that?
I don't.
Like, that's all I was looking at.
Was like, what do they have on these smarter?
Are they working Harder?
They sacrificing more like, what is it?
Do they better Mark?
What is And the single biggest takeaway that I had from the entire thing was that they had a bigger total addressable Market.
They had a bigger Tam.
19:12
They were going after just a much wider audience and that was when I realized that whatever business you have eventually you need to go why the so you start small.
So the riches are in the niches to a degree, but at a certain point, you do need to open up the aperture.
19:27
So, like, Facebook started with college, right?
That was the, that was the niche and then slowly, they expanded over time because it's easy to do.
One thing really well for one Avatar, which is why I always say one Avatar, one product, one channel.
That's how you start.
But at some point I had been so committed to that that I had to open up my eyes and say, you know what, maybe I can expand my avatar, maybe I can go up Market, maybe I can go broader in some way and seeing all these people that, you know, I thought were equally intelligent and hardworking is me doing significantly better like that was the unlock for me.
19:58
The next one is when I talk to this was one of the first billionaires that I ever met again.
I've been stuck at 30 to 40 million for like, Three years.
So like there was a lot of learning that I was trying to do in this period of to break through that wall and I was telling him all these things that I was doing to try and grow my business and he just laughed and I was like hey man I'm like I'm like putting some real stuff out here like I'm suffering right now.
20:21
Which anybody who's watching this like fuck you or whatever but you know if you do think that way then you don't understand the entrepreneur game because the reason people do it is because they want to grow and when you feel like you're plateauing is still feels terrible independent of what the monetary Alchemist.
And so, he said, the biggest thing that I see and I'm paraphrasing.
20:38
He's like, is that you're talking about you all the time he said, it's not about you.
It's about everybody else and what he meant by.
That wasn't like, me versus customers.
Anything like that.
He was like, all you've been telling me is what you're going to do.
He's like, you need to have a stable of stallions, you need to give people a slice of the pie and let them get rich too, and up to that point, I had hoarded everything.
21:00
I like never did profit shares.
I bet, you know, I did very little like Equity did, you know?
Equity interest for anybody who's a key leader but he told me he's like, you know what got me from a hundred million dollars, top-line to 500 million dollars.
Top Line is like what is like doing less and getting really smart people to help me out and giving them a big slice and it was just so simple and maybe it just means you have to get it from somebody who's way ahead of you.
21:22
And so I don't know where you at.
Maybe the hopefully I can be that for you is that at a certain point 1 million you need to learn the stuff ten million, you still need to learn a lot but you get your first level management like 10 million plus It's about Talent.
It's about people, you have to get other people who can, who can make decisions on your behalf and you feel.
21:40
Not only that they were as good as your decisions, but even better because the skill sets become more niched and more advanced the bigger you go in the beginning, most people can do their books when you're making a million dollars.
A year is not that hard but when you making fifty million dollars a year the books become significant more complex and that concept applies throughout every single part of the organization.
22:00
And so the beginning your jack of all trades master of none but you need to have Mastery in every Department of the business in order for it to scale and you can either see that as I have to learn everything or the faster way which is I can go buy it so you can build it within yourself or you can buy it.
Through other people who've already given ten years already, given 15 years and so a different way to think about that.
22:19
I made on this because I think it's important.
If I can get ten people who've all spent 20 years in their respective departments that I basically have two hundred years of experience which funds are flows to grow the business.
Since will scale to the cumulative brainpower of the organization and if every person the organization is learned everything from you, then it's only one brain and one lifetime that is the limit of the organization.
22:47
If you have 10 people who have lived ten different lives and Achieve Mastery in 10 different areas, then you now have 200 years of experience and Mastery, that is growing, the business and is now the new cap and like that was my big.
That thing is, what got us past the 30 to 40 million.
Like that was a huge breakthrough for me.
23:04
The next one was a podcast that I actually heard from a YouTuber.
That didn't have like, you know, probably a few hundred thousand subscribers.
He sold kind of like some sort of tax thing or whatever and he said, on a podcast nonchalantly that he's getting 3,000 applications a month from this like one or two hundred thousand YouTube channel and it had taken an eight years to get there.
23:26
And in my mind, I heard 3,000 inbound applications from a warm audience.
Filling out a 28 you know, page questionnaire for taxes as As the most insane thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
And the fact that he was getting paid to do, that was insane.
And that was the first conversation that I ever heard.
23:43
That gave me the first step towards creating a personal brand making content like that one thing him translating, all of this content, they was making into the business terms of like, what he was getting from it.
That link for me, was when the light went on, I had a bunch of other things happen after that, that pushed me over the edge, but that was the first time that I said there might be something to this.
24:03
The next conversation I had was around was really the one that pushed me over the edge to the for the one I just talked about was me deciding to maybe even think about this content personal brand path.
This one was the last conversation I had that made me decide to do.
It was a famous friend, you would know him if I said his name and I was at his house and we're sitting at the kitchen table.
24:22
And I said, don't you get tired of all these?
All these people like all these weirdos like messaging you stuff and like sending you threats and like three people a week stopping by your house, like trying to climb your fence.
Like isn't that like Not fun.
He said, if that's the price, I have to pay to make the impact.
I want to have that.
24:38
I'd paid every day of the week and like, for whatever reason, it just like stab me in the heart and it made me feel like if I want to spread a message, if I want to help more people, that there is a cost to it.
Now, what I will say this, having now been a little bit, the other side and having more recognition, what not is that Fame?
24:56
Has pros and cons, there are cons, but I believe that there are more Pros than cons So, that is how I've kind of assess.
It's like, are there things that are inconvenient?
Now, absolutely, you get stopped every time you go out to dinner, like you could disrupt.
It's harder to be like private and public.
If you have a bad day, you can't do it.
25:12
Because someone says hi.
It's the one time they're going to see you.
Like there are things that are cons, but the pros outweigh the cons.
You get amazing teammates, who otherwise would never know you exist, you already believe in your values and you have to indoctrinate that way, they like, they see the mission, the way you do, and they charge 10 times harder towards because they believe in it.
25:28
And you attract Partners who also have the same Mission have the same values and it creates, Only more alignment and real-world value.
In terms of economic value, much money, you make by having people inbound coming towards you and I for the longest time I used to Poopoo making content, I used to talk shit about people may cause I just need to make do cold Outreach and run ads.
25:49
Like don't talk to me.
But now having been on the other side of it I could tell you that it was mistake and it took me a long time to learn.
And that was the last final straw.
Another one was a big influencer and I want it.
This is again on this personal branding Journey.
I'm a big believer that you can either learn lessons.
A time or you can pay for them in money in.
26:04
This is me paying for it and money.
And so, I said, hey your way further ahead of me like, how do I just shortcut this thing?
And so he said, hey start making content every platform.
So I did that.
And then I came back, six months later and I said, hey look, we went from zero to a, you know, 200,000 people in our audience in six months and you know you noted the progress but I was like what's your blueprint?
26:22
What's the what's the model has that your give me the flowchart is that dude we don't have a flow chart he said anybody's trying to tell you that is trying to sell you a system.
You just need to do so much more volume than you currently are.
Our he said, just pull up your Instagram and pull out my Instagram, so, I pulled it up.
What is up here?
Posted five times.
26:37
I had posted once he's like, pull up your LinkedIn, pull up my LinkedIn.
He posted seven times.
I'd posted once platform a platform, you get pulling one up and he was embarrassing me.
With the amount of content he was putting out compared to me.
And so, in the next six months, I put 10 times the content out and we grew ten times faster.
26:56
And so the interesting lesson I learned from this is that there are principles that are ubiquitous the more work you do, the more you get, The more work you do, the better, you get the better, you get, the more you get out of it, right?
And so the boring work applies to everything in business.
Whether it's relationships, whether it's cold calling, whether it's making content, the more you do, the more you get, and it's ironic, I felt silly that I had to learn it from someone that I paid all this money to teach me a lesson that I had already learned in a different aspect of my life, but it also applied here.
27:22
So hopefully you don't have to pay that money.
I'll tell you the more you do, the more you get.
The next one was about investing.
This was a big one because, you know, we had a my wife and I'd already taken 40 Three million dollars in dividends from our business before selling it for 46 million.
And I was actually a pretty big pansy when it came to investing.
27:41
And that's why I have no debt to this day.
I still don't not say I'm against it.
I'm just a pansy about in the very front about maybe someday.
I'll be able to take that on, but up to this point, I don't so everything I own in cash and I still have a ton of cash, just stacked in treasuries, just bonds, just waiting there.
27:57
And this was the Breakthrough.
I had.
One is that if you ever have cash in a bank account, you can just put it in a bond and you'll get a higher percentage and it's safer than a bank.
That was a huge like, such a simple thing like Banks aren't as robust as the US government Banks.
Pay.
28:12
You point, whatever percent, the government pays you for 25?
That's it.
That's all there is to it and they're almost as liquid at because you can sell them in and out whenever you want.
Like, that was a huge.
Aha for me.
So taking all my cash in a bank accounts and putting them into bonds, while I waited with step one step, two, that I learned from this conversation.
28:29
I was investing only in what I knew because up to this point like now I had all this money and people are like I've got this real estate deal.
I've got this crypto thing, I've got a mining, you know, whatever.
There's this all these crazy things.
You know, I've got oil.
Pipe might like when you have lots of money deal flow is not a problem.
People will ask you for money, but what I didn't have was like a set of rules or parameters and you have to make those.
28:50
Otherwise, you get too much decision, fatigue, you waste too much time doing diligence on deals, reading having multiple phone calls, having lawyers come in and then deciding not to do it.
And so, this is a conversation I witnessed and it, Changed my life.
He was telling somebody who had a lot of real estate experience the mind you, I don't have a lot of experience.
He said, if you were to put a circle on this table, what percentage of your brain knows real estate.
29:12
Here's like, I guess 85% is like, okay, what percentage of your brain knows stocks and stuff, he's like, oh 10 or 15 percent.
He's like that is your new capital, allocation parameter 85%.
Your net worth should be in real estate 15% should be in stocks and stuff.
29:29
And it was so simple for me.
Like, Warren Buffett talks about investing what, you know, but for whatever reason, that conversation translated that into real world for me, I know business.
And so what do I invest in now only businesses, which most times people consider private Equity, one of the riskiest types investment, but it's only risk.
29:44
If you don't know what you're doing and this is the plate, like I can write a five or ten million dollar check and be fine.
If I know what it's like, if it's a business because I understand I know what pitfalls are going to come up like I get it with a real estate apartment building.
No idea.
Never never built one.
I got nothing, you know?
30:00
I mean, like, I'm just like, termites or bad.
I hear you know, like, Raina water, bad not on the floor, not a good idea, right?
Like I don't know.
And so sticking with that, just for ever made my life simpler because now, when deals come to him, like that's just not in my will.
And I just immediately saying it's the amount of time and effort and lawyer calls and conversations that that save me has paid so many dividends and now are investing, do significantly better, because it's what I know and I feel comfort with it and I can do move way faster.
30:26
The next one was about the leverage behind a product.
T'.
So Nepal is said you only sell because, you know, how to Market you only Market because, you know, how to build a product and the thing is that an exceptional product is a quadratic relationship with your audience.
Good marketing or good sales is a linear relationship.
30:43
Meaning if I spend a dollar I get X dollars back.
If I make X phone calls, I get y dollars back but with a product, if you make an exceptional product, one person buys the product and they tell to, to tell for 7:56.
And so if you focus on the product on making That's so unbelievable.
31:00
That people cannot help themselves would tell other people about it and you're like, well how do I do that?
You work on it and you keep working on it and you do make new products until the first ones, right?
And if you're like, that might take years, that's why good shit takes time.
And my first real experience with this.
After this was the book that I released hundred offers that book continues to sell more copies every month month, after month with zero advertising dollars, like a lot of books.
31:26
And as soon as I saw that happen, It shifted in me to like I knew the sales stuff, I knew the marketing stuff but now like I would say the chapter of my life that I'm on is all focused around product because I realized that I could work really hard for two years and then not have to work at all or very little for the rest of my life or work, very little bit on a product and then spend the rest of my life trying to Market and sell it.
31:50
And so it's actually less work in the long run to build a better thing than it is to build a shitty thing and then have to spend the rest of your time.
Marketing and selling an excellent product is a form of Leverage because you get more for your time.
You put in X and you get out.
32:07
Why?
For the rest of your life?
That is leverage.
And you want to have leverage in every aspect of your business.
And the product is the strongest one products also unlock compounding because one person does 22 2014 08.
There's a compounding vehicle in it.
If you have marketing or sales, there is no compounding there, you just have to keep putting effort in and you get X return on it back.
32:28
There's no compounding.
Me, and you want to have that in the vehicle, because it means a longer.
You play the game, the bigger it gets the last few.
I learned from Uncle, Warren, which I didn't have a conversation with him.
But the man changed my life in many ways and he taught me the power of brand and brand was always this amorphous thing that I thought was complete BS alike, can't quantify brand, blah, blah, blah.
32:47
But the thing is, you can quantify brand and that is what I learned from Uncle Warren.
He said, the amount that you can charge above the commoditized version of your product, the Delta there is the power of brand.
And what's interesting about that is You have a t-shirt that can sell for $20 normally and can sell for $100 with your brand on it.
33:05
All of that pricing power goes to bottom line, which is why Warren Buffett invest in Brands.
It's one of the strongest ways to retain pricing power, which is a proxy for the profits that you can generate over an extended period of time.
And the new markets you can get into using the brand to wedge yourself into the new category.
33:22
The brand itself becomes a huge compounding vehicle because the audience and the awareness around the brand compounds.
And by the way, I have anonymized these conversations because I don't want the people that I had these conversations with, to feel like I'm name-dropping them or feel like conversation, I had with them in confidence, ever come back to them.
33:41
And so I'm keeping this whitewashed of names because you would recognize probably half the list on your own.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's up everyone and welcome.
Ooh, the gym Secrets podcast, we may take you a brief excerpt from the origin story and talk about something.
That's been railing or gears.
So recently Layla and I have been at it, you know?
0:45
Not not romantically, well, not not romantically, whatever.
Anyways, the point is, we've, you know, we've had a flurry or an influx of applications to work with us, which we're very grateful for and, you know, I mean, That's what it's all about for us.
1:01
But what's what's been interesting for us to?
Observe is just the preponderance, the overwhelming amount of marketing agencies who come in through our funnel.
It's just my numbing and what's really interesting and this is what we're going to try and make try and make the topic of this podcast is guys who have gyms that are struggling who own marketing.
1:29
Agencies who sell to, you guessed.
It other gyms and it's I mean there's so many things that are like layered in this.
We're just going to try and peel this back.
So, first things first, they started a gym and then they learn some bit about marketing.
1:49
And then it probably started working a little bit further.
Jim.
And then it stopped working because then they didn't know how to refresh copy or change their offer, or refresh the Of or have a conversion process that worked and was reliable, or they didn't know how to scale it with a team or variety reasons whatever.
2:06
Right.
But it started the beginning and it worked and then it stopped working.
And so then they thought, okay, I need to make money so then they started selling their services right now.
The crazy thing here, is that what they really need to do is focus on their gym because if they're Jim was making fifty thousand dollars a month.
I guarantee you, they wouldn't have started the agency, they'd be focused more on their gym and then maybe thinking about opening another gym, but that wasn't the case.
2:28
And so then they split Their attention and then made to Shady businesses instead of one explicit.
Oh, oops, okay, well I guess this one's explicit anyways.
So to crappy Jim's.
I'm sorry too crappy business.
Is that one?
2:43
Because they put their attention Russell, when he and I were talking about this, he's like he's like you know what took me from three million a year to 30 million?
He was like focusing, I had eight different businesses and at my Max I had 12 business is going at one point and I could never crack 3 million.
He said he was only until I got rid of all of my Isn't only focused on one that my business exploded and that was a really big lesson for me too.
3:04
Because you know, I mean, luckily, I was just bad enough, a business that I only did one but I definitely had the you learn most entrepreneurs do.
But speaking from experience here, if you have that that that I don't know that temptation to start something else because your current business isn't working, you're just going to have twice as many problems now.
3:25
Instead of just one time as many and you're going to spread yourself too thin and then nothing's ever going to work and you can feel it just Ben Wheels.
I've seen so many people do it, please don't do it and if you're in that situation, just pick one and I guarantee you that you'll make it work if you only had one to focus on now the transition.
So, I can't tell you.
3:46
Because Jim doesn't make money.
And my second question to that is Prep company, make money.
The answer is always no, right.
So so so we're peeling back the layers on the the Dual marketing agency / gym owners who are applying to work with us.
4:02
So the first thing is they shouldn't have two businesses but they do and so okay.
So we're just going to forgive that one or at least, we're going to move past that thing and get to the second layer of why this is ridiculous.
These guys, are these marketing agencies have a gym that they're incredibly personally invested in and are unable to get results for and still female feel morally.
4:29
Okay, about selling their services to other gym, owners who don't know the full picture and like, you got to think about that for a second.
It's like, if, if you knew that like your gym was struggling like isn't that a wrong?
4:45
You know, like is that like just like I don't know.
I would I feel bad about it and so, obviously for us, we don't work with any marketing agencies because like it's really hard to forget something that works.
Works.
And even if we said, hey, you can only use this for this gym, it would just be real hard to take the stuff that we do that lights, everyone's gym on fire.
5:04
And by that, I mean like blows it up and fills it up in 30 days which is what we do.
And then all of a sudden not be able to do that, and start marking it as your own business.
So, Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
5:24
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, We don't do that.
So if you have a marketing agency and you have a gym clothes, your marketing agency and we will help you out, so that's that's that side note.
5:43
But here's the great Epiphany bridge that Leila pointed out and she was like, this is really what it's like, and she said it better than I will.
So I'll just let her explain what the equivalent of what the equivalent is in Fitness for what this isn't Fitness business.
6:00
When you have a gym that isn't working or worked for a little bit and then stopped Being and then turning around and selling your services to other gym, owners who are unsuspecting when you know that eventually it's going to stop working because you don't understand the fundamentals of marketing instead of just understanding a couple of tactics or a couple of things and go.
6:21
So I had this Epiphany when I was driving to go pick up.
Dog food today.
Really exciting but I got it from Whole Foods trying to give him some like organic dog food.
Anyways, so my Epiphany was basically like we all know that One girl that did a bikini competition and everyone's like dude she got fat after like she off after she did that competition.
6:40
And then yet we see her promoting herself as a bikini coach and she consistently gets a new clients and then suddenly we started to notice the trend of that, all of her clients seem to get fat after they work with her and so it brings me to the conclusion of exactly, right?
7:01
So this bikini coach, not Only is coaching other people whom she should not be because she, yes can get some to a competition, but what's the point in doing that?
When we all know they're going to get fat after so she's doing this while she's coaching these girls.
7:18
She's also searching for a coach for herself because she's like I don't understand why I'm fat and I don't know how to not get fat again and like I just keep getting fatter and so she's doing this wall.
She's still I don't understand why my ads aren't working, they used to work before they don't work anymore.
What's going on?
7:33
Right, same concept.
So what she does did before doesn't work anymore.
So her capacity to help them any further than that show is not.
Like, there's nothing more she can do for them, right?
But she's going to pretend like she can anyways, As She searches for somebody else to then help her.
7:53
So then in return, she can maybe help them, but that never works.
So that was the Epiphany that I had.
That's like most of the companies.
So they come to me, well, they come to us.
Us right.
But I'm the first one who talks to them, and they're talking about how they're Jim doesn't work.
They had offers that used to work, but the offers don't work anymore.
8:11
Their ads don't work anymore.
This doesn't work anymore and I'm sitting here, stalking them on Facebook because I do, I saw hard so that I don't have this happen, but sometimes it does and when it does then I'm like, dude you have a marketing company and then it comes around and then you know, they were like, yeah, well it's not really a bit and then the like crap and then it comes down to yeah, you know, I hope.
8:33
In 20, Jim's Market their tombs.
And it's the exact same thing because they're telling me the what they're doing when what they need help with doesn't work anymore yet.
That's what they're selling to these gyms.
And that's exactly what this bikini coach was doing.
8:49
She's selling her plan that took her to get to the show and then she got fat after and so they're selling you.
The ads that took know where they are and they're broken out.
So there's your epiphany So yeah, if you one of those marketing sighs she made sees, don't do that.
And for everyone else, who is watching this, are watching listening to this.
9:11
If you are a gym owner and your approach by Mark, you need to see a.
I don't think she'd ever work with the marketing agency.
I think should learn how to do it, it's not that hard.
I promise, I'll probably get into an another episode, but for now move forward with caution.
Especially if someone has only one gym and their marketing agency, And they only have a few clients that's usually where they're just splitting their attention and then they do neither of them.
9:36
Well, and if that's you, stop doing that.
Anyways, lots of loved everyone, hope you guys have an amazing day night afternoon car drive, wake up whenever you're listening to this and look forward to talk to you guys soon, and if you want to find out more about how we do, what we do, and how we feel gyms in 30 days, in every single Market, that we go into, you can go to gym lunch, secrets.com for each last quiz.
10:00
Is and we will catch you on the other side and you'll get for free case studies that I'll show you a bunch of cool stuff and if you want you can apply.
All right.0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
What's going on everybody?
Happy Thursday and I'm really happy to get on here and talk about this because I just got off the phone with my banjo.
Green means an advancement to this play.
That are literally game changing and so excited or released.
Into Legacy tomorrow.
They're sweet.
0:33
But this came up on the phone call and I thought I was like it's just fresh on my mind.
So I figured I'd make a little video about this.
So money stickle, right?
So how many people do, you know, who just cannot hold onto money right times.
People, might be you, right?
You might be like, man.
I don't know where my money.
Especially with the gym business, right?
Like you're like do you like we're doing all this revenue and somehow the other month?
0:51
Like I don't pay myself right?
Or like there's sometimes I can't eat like and this is what happens most times is that people just cover their butts and like just get to the point where they're not.
Oozing money and then they just stay there and they just stay there and they live out of the business account.
They paid her bills other business account.
They look at it.
Okay.
I got enough to buy grocery got enough about the Holy whatever and no one knows even how much they're making, they just know that they don't pay themselves and they just live as cheaply as possible in order to pay the next red pay payroll, right?
1:17
They stress out a little bit before payroll.
They do a couple of sales, get a couple of things in and then after that, you know, they covered it, they move past and they were good to go, right?
That's what happened.
So, How do you actually end up being the person who money sticks to, right?
1:32
So if you think about this from like an energy of money standpoint money, totally does have energy.
Okay.
Every time you sell someone and they give you money, right?
And then you have the money and then you pay your trainers and their trainers go and buy supplements, right?
1:48
And you're going, you pay the flooring guy to put flooring in at your gym, right?
You do all these things that you're put your putting money out.
Okay?
Now, let's track it.
So you painted your like your trainers and then they blow all their money, most of it, right?
But they pay their rent, and then they go eat out and blah blah blah, right?
2:06
And then you pay the flooring guy and he pays his rent.
For his house or whatever.
And then he blows the rest of his money and then your case you pay your landlord.
And then the rest of the money just kind of disappeared.
You pay employees, you pay toilet paper or whatever, right?
All these different things that you can one exhibit That money that came in, hit you, and then immediately dispersed out and then hit those people.
2:28
And then it just first up, right?
It just continues to disperse and flow from one person to the next.
And then the only person, With money sticks to realtalk is usually that landlord, right?
Your landlord holds on to his money, right?
And so every month, like, money, flows into you and it flows to your trainers that flows to the supplement, comes that they buy their stuff from and it flows the Lululemon.
2:51
So they can buy more expensive clothing, whatever it is, right?
And then the people that they're paying the rent to that rent money goes in and then it sticks.
And that landlord keeps it, right?
And so you think about how money is flowing and outflowing It Up?
Christmas sticks.
Right?
Is that we're more, his guys.
3:07
Who owned properties.
Tend to be a little bit more wealth.
They're paying attention to the money, right?
And so attention is an asset.
We only have so much of it and if you don't give that to money, money will go to the person who pays it the attention.
Like you pay attention you the seed money, right?
3:23
Like you pay, you exchange attention for money in return.
Like, this is legitimately how it works.
If you're super distracted, you've got personal issues.
You've got employees.
She's got all these things.
You have no one.
To left to pay money and somebody doesn't for you, right?
You might have money coming in but you're not paying money.
3:40
The attention that it needs in order to stay with you, right?
And it's always very jealous, it will only go to the person who pays the most attention.
Thank you Jim.
What's up, brother?
So anyways, I just want to make this video, as I was talking to Joe Greene about his money stuff and and like you have to pay attention to money.
3:59
He who pays the most attention to the money, the money will pay that person.
So if you're not budging, you don't know what your margins are if you're not paying yourself.
If you're not on on salary, at least like you're expecting that money just going to pay you and it will never happen.
It will never ever happen.
I promise you.
4:14
If you have the patience of money from any pay attention back to you, got to do the arithmetic in your business.
Got to know how much money you're making per session to know what you're paying your trainers.
Got know what your margins are, right?
1800 cash me out, right?
You always have to know those numbers because we don't, I guarantee you are not getting paid.
4:32
So anyways, money stickle.
That's I'm Jim money math for you if you need to make a couple dollars, pay attention to money money with patients back.
All right.
Lots of guys have an amazing Thursday.
I will catch you guys so soon and my legacy guys.
I'll see you guys tomorrow sick.
4:47
I'm actually really fun.









0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else getting into a head-on collision in.
A DUI and having basically no money to my name to, you know, 12 months later, having 3 million dollars in profits not knowing what to do with it.
Welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:45
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hi, my name is Alex from Rosie and I own acquisition.com and our portfolio companies will do 85 million dollars this year and I have absolutely nothing to sell you.
What I want to talk about today is one of the, the pivotal moment in my life that took me from really just getting into a head-on collision in a DUI and having basically no money to my name.
1:07
To, you know, 12 months later having 3 million dollars in profits not knowing what to do with it.
There was a series of decisions that happened in that period of time that radically transformed my life.
And so I Talk to you about one of the more significant ones today.
And so kind of, like, I just alluded to leading into my DUI head-on collision.
1:26
I had six Jim's to with one partner, I had 43 with another partner and then I had one on my own.
So at all these kind of weird Arrangements that were going on in my life at that time.
I also had a partner that I was doing a 50-50 split for dental agency, work and another and the Same partner.
1:49
We also had an agency together for Chiropractic agency work.
I'm also doing in person Jim launches, so that means that I was flying out in person and doing gym, turnarounds and trying to launch gyms.
And at the time I was so stressed that I was drinking, I mean probably half a bottle every night just to honestly not to get drunk but just to not be stressed.
2:12
It took me a really long time to just even like function, you know what I mean in the morning cause I was so spread thin.
Mentally.
And what I want to kind of talk you through is some of the decisions and how I thought through them, because I don't know where you're at right now.
And it doesn't really matter what the scale is of what the decisions are, because I've made decisions like this, at multiple times, my life.
2:31
I ended up going to an attention coach.
I know this sounds ridiculous, but I went to a coach to help me manage my attention and so, one of the things that I think us as entrepreneurs, we think about all the time is like, you know, we're managing our time, we're trying to be productive and I worked every hour of the day that I was awake and yet I still didn't have that much money at the time.
2:47
Everything was He's tied up and, you know, the gyms and all that kind of stuff and cash flow for employees and all that kind of jazz.
And this, this coach had kept telling me.
He's like, you need to, you know, you need to aggregate your attention.
You need to focus, he's like you're spread all over the place.
I pretty much just like, would not along and listen and I tried to do some of the stuff they told me to do, but I wasn't making, I was making some progress, but it wasn't until I drink so much that I ended up getting into a head-on collision but 60 miles an hour on the highway.
3:18
And I actually walked away from that and it wasn't, I didn't hit anyone.
I was actually getting pulled over and there was a car that was in the in the side the shoulder that was turned off, it was dark and so I was looking over my shoulder and just kind of going from Lane to Lane is I was you know, getting into the shoulder as I was getting pulled over as I was getting pulled over by the cop in the shoulder, there's a black car and I just nailed it.
3:41
And so anyways, they say that because I was drunk, I was really relaxed and that's why I didn't get any injuries who knows But anyways, I stepped out of the car, you know, I'm getting whatever they do, you know, signed, you know, he signed paperwork whatever and the next day after Layla picked me up from jail.
4:00
As my girlfriend, not not my wife at the time, she was like this guy's a real winner.
Anyways, and so she picks me up and the next day I have a conversation with him obviously and he's like, he's like your lack of making.
Decisions is going to kill you.
4:18
And I remember him saying that to me and he was like the reason you're stressed is because you have all these decisions that, you know, you should make and you're not making them.
I wanted to make this because I wanted to talk about probably the second hardest decision I've made in my life.
The hardest decision was quitting my job.
Probably the second hardest decision was was the decisions that I had.
4:35
It was a multitude of decisions that I had to make that.
I knew I was supposed to make it.
I just didn't know how to confront them and it seems like it's a common theme in my life that when I only make decisions when I'm literally confronted with my own mortality.
And so if you notice that as a common theme, Among my stuff.
It's because for some reason I can't get myself to decide to do things unless I literally think I'm going to die.
4:52
And so I saw this and it became the Catalyst for me making a number of changes in my life.
And so what I did over the next, you know, really the next 48 hours was a rapid series of decisions that Consolidated all my attention into one thing and so that's what I want to talk to you about.
5:11
So the first thing I did, I called up the partner that I had the two agencies with and I said, hey, I can't do this, I'm doing Jim agency work where I'm flying out and doing turnarounds, I'm doing Dental agency work, and we're doing chiropractor each to.
I was like, I can't do any of it.
So I'm just I'm out, I just was like, I'm out, you can have everything I'm done, it was like, okay.
5:32
And that was a horrible conversation to have because I felt like I was letting a partner down.
And then I called up the partner that I had In in, in the multitude of Jim's more of the gyms and I said, hey, you know, how can we figure out a way for us to, you know, walk away.
5:50
I want to do this Jim launch stuff and so you know, we ended up working it out and I basically gave away the gyms.
Bad at fire sale, numbers more or less.
I was able to sell two of them successfully in a for a better number, but the rest of them are pretty much just gave away and then the partner that I had that I was going to new gym with.
6:11
I said, you know, hey I'm I don't want to do this anymore.
I need to focus on on Jim watch obviously all those conversations did not go.
You know super well they weren't super well received, but I think I just was only able to have the courage to do it because I had almost Died the night before.
6:29
And so it just gave me this massive perspective where I was like, am I?
I'm so afraid of letting these people down that I that I might die and so I ended up making that all those decisions just in a matter of like a day or two.
Hey guys, real quick.
6:44
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect for you can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
7:13
And having those conversations.
And so I think the the lesson for me that I've taken with me that's been the most valuable thing of this is one you won't die when you make those those calls.
But second a lot of times I feel like when I was a newer entrepreneur and even as I feel it as I accumulate unmade decisions, right?
7:34
I think we accumulate these unmade decisions, are unmei, unconfronted conversations, and what happens is there's like a portion of my brain in my I'm making my thinking power that just gets allocated to, this chunk.
This, this decision, right?
That needs to be made.
That is unmade.
7:49
That I know I should make.
And I probably know what the right call is, but it's just sitting there unmade.
And so it's like, as we start accumulating these things that's like, my, my actual amount of thinking power continues to decrease, until it gets to the point where you're so reactive because you have no brain power and as a small, like a corollary to that, I don't know if you've ever like, if you remember, when you were a kid and you had like homework or something like that and you were like staring at a math problem, you can figure it out.
8:13
And and you know you're staying up late into the night, you're like, whatever.
I'm going to go to sleep and see if I can think about the morning.
And then you wake up the next day, you feel refreshed and you look at the problem and it seems obvious you're like, oh, does here it is.
And then it's done, right?
I feel like that is the, that is an expression of having far, more attention, far more decision-making.
8:34
Part of our former thinking power because you can concentrate on this one thing and all of a sudden, it seems easy.
And I think that business and life are a lot like that.
Least they have been for me where it's like.
If I feel like I like simple decisions are take an inordinate amount of effort, it's because I'm too distracted.
8:51
I have too many things, too many unmade decisions.
Too many unconfronted conversations that I need to have and those can be life conversations with a spouse that can be conversation with parents, that can be conversations with siblings.
They can be conversation with business partners, having conversations with employees.
They can be decisions that must be made.
And I think one of the power, most powerful things that that I've tried to remember is like I'm only one decision away from changing my life, just one decision.
9:12
One decision away from, from changing my life.
I can quit my job.
That is one decision, right?
I can start a business that is one decision.
These are decisions that we have to make it some point in our life and these are like the crossroads there's two kind of major major themes that I have one is that most people don't regret doing things, they regret not doing things and so I know that when I die I don't want to regret not having done things.
9:29
I'd rather do things in the fail so that they do not have the regret and I'll have the experience and having that kind of thought process has been extremely helpful for me to draw back to the point of this this whole thing when I met Made these decisions and Layla was with me because she basically said as well.
9:47
After I got off the phone call with a coach he was like if you don't change things she's like I'm not like this.
This got to change like I'm not going to be around, she kind of indicated that she didn't say it directly, but I think I understood.
I could read between the lines and I valued my relationship with her more than a lot of the other things that we're going on in my life.
10:04
And I could tell that she was a little bit outside of the storm that was Alex from.
I was at the time, the storm of chaos.
And so She was like, you have to make these calls, and so I made these calls physically, like, phone calls and also these decisions.
And what results did next was really the, you know, I had to suffer the pain of the consequence of those decisions which was very hard for me.
10:27
But I felt determined that I had made those decisions.
I felt confident and I felt like I had more attention and more bandwidth at my disposal because I had made the tough calls and I started believing in myself more because I was like man if I can make these calls and I can do this next thing and so that was kind of I would say the explosion That created the beginning momentum of like I can do this after.
10:46
I basically shut down as many different side projects as I could, that's when I went all in on Jim launch and so Jim launch actually was started in 2016 which was probably 2016 into the first half of 2017 was like the worst 18 months of my entire life and that was also when I coincidentally met Layla, my wife.
11:05
So she saw me at the absolute worst and for some reason decided to stay with me because she believed, which is why I shall always have my attorney.
Gratitude, we made this call.
I ended three Partnerships.
I sold sold or let go of fire sold, you know, at the time I guess if you were just trying to number those but I like eleven business, nine businesses or something that was going on.
11:26
And so this is one of those things where people were like man I have I have I have so many businesses you know etcetera and it's like you have to do them in the right sequence.
Like I didn't even I wasn't as barely making any money and I had all these businesses so I could feel good about my status.
When in reality I knew that I wasn't that successful and so It was only one Layla is like this.
11:44
Jim wants thing is working, like, all we have to do is just give it our full attention and it will work at that point.
I felt.
So, I want to say defeated, but I also felt like my slate was clean, right?
I had clean the slate and like, I pushed everything off to the side in the face of my of my mortality that the stress of not, making these decisions was going to kill me.
12:04
And so, that's when I just focused fool in on Jim lunch and and things kind of took off and I think in another video I'll tell you.
You that story of how how things actually started there, because I think it's valuable for a lot of people who are going through it right now.
But I guess I wanted to make this video because the the takeaway that I had from that is that I'm always one decision away from changing my life and I'm often one conversation away from getting my attention back.
12:30
I'm one decision away from getting all my attention back from where I am.
I'm feeling distracted.
So I don't know where you're at right now but the most valuable thing that we have is entrepreneurs is not our time, but our attention, if we have all of the time but we have a million things.
Hang on, we are useless because we have no decision-making power.
We have no thinking power because little pieces of our brain are being allocated these unform done finalized decisions that maybe can cost your life, and I don't know.
12:54
I mean, it did almost for me, which is why I've been so ruthless with my attention since then.
And so, and it had to end by by consequence.
So, disciplined, with my focus.
It's not because I'm naturally that way.
So hopefully, this story will illustrate that to you.
That this was not something that naturally came to me, but was a decision that I had to make to save myself.
13:12
Self.
And so don't know where you're at right now.
My name is Alex from Rosie.
We own acquisition.com our portfolio companies.
Now do about 85 million dollars a year, I have nothing to sell you.
I made this channel because a lot of people are broke and I don't want you to be one of them.

13:32

I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Alex are busy.
Welcome to the BiggerPockets podcast.
Great to have you.
Thank you for having me.
Very honored to be here.
Yeah.
So for anyone who's been living under a rock and hasn't heard about your astronomical success, amazing Insight that you're giving to small business owners.
0:37
Would you mind giving us a background of where you started and where you are right now?
All right, I'll give the world's shortest playback, why Milestones?
So I was a Management Consultant went to Vanderbilt, graduated did defense Contracting for two years.
Really didn't like it got my top secret.
0:53
Frances sounded sexy on paper, it wasn't cool in real life.
Wanted to leave Baltimore went to West Coast.
Started a gym slept on the floor for the first nine months was able to figure it out, by month of teen.
We had our second location, every six months.
After that, open a new one.
Had six locations, had lots of gym owner started asking me.
Hey how'd you grow so fast?
1:09
And so I started helping those guys out.
I ended up doing Jim turnarounds ride fly out to Jim, fill it up, fix it etcetera.
We did 32 or 33 turnarounds over the next two years and then from there, I sold my six gems and then transition from the turnaround flying out.
Guys to Jim's business to a licensing model because it was more scalable and so that was 2017.
1:28
We transition to licensing that business scaled to I think 37 million a year with very good margins.
And then we started a supplement company Prestige Labs which we sold through our distribution based.
We had forty five hundred locations from there.
We started Allen which was a software that worked leads for brick-and-mortar businesses of any kind.
1:46
We exited all three of those businesses, 12 strategic buyer, for the software, and the other two as a package deal too.
Two American Pacific, Rupert's private Equity Firm.
Just that one was 46 million.
The other one I'm not allowed to disclose it, but I can tell you that we did 12 million Top Line that you're before, we sold it for the software company.
2:03
It was an all-stock deal and so it was that was that was last year.
We started acquisition.com 2020, which became are holding company for a portfolio right now.
The portfolio does north of 150 million dollars a year, I'm only going to time stamp, this it is currently July of 2022 because people hear these clips later and they're like you said I like I know we grow that's why the numbers change but you know at this I meant North 150 million dollars a year or portfolio revenue between our companies we specialize in in high cash flow service businesses and things of that nature.
2:32
So it sounds like you started the gym business.
You jumped into it.
You pursued excellence in that area.
You learned sales techniques, the psychology behind, how you get people to do things, then you learn business techniques, how to run a profitable business.
You took the step that most people never take when they hit that point is, you said, how do I scale this and took on bigger and more difficult problems to solve?
2:51
You started solving other people's problems.
Only helping them to do more.
And then once you hit this point of big success you said Okay now what's energy do I have?
I can go sell supplement products because I understand Fitness people trust me and then you solve a new problem you said, okay, now I can have a software company that's going to help manage this and you sort of just spread in this like synergistic way.
3:10
I rather than I'm gonna go start a gym and then I'm going to go start a car wash and then I'm going to go start something like a loan brokerage or something.
Completely unrelated.
Is that more or less a good summary of your approach?
Yeah, I definitely did a whole bunch of things.
Probably wouldn't do again and probably would have done it necessarily in that order, Etc.
3:26
A lot of things were more difficult than they should have been.
But yes, that was 100%.
They were synergistic in nature, I felt like I was leaving money on the table and so I took those opportunities, if I could do it again, I wouldn't have done that way, but they were still obviously very good outcomes, but I feel like I've learned to so since then, yeah, I don't think there's too many people.
3:42
That would be in a position to criticize how it turned out for you.
I think if anyone is, especially, I've got notes, lots of notes.
I'm today's episode Robin, He's going to tear apart, Alex's business strategy, and teach him what he should have done instead.
3:58
All right, well, thank you for sharing that.
I really appreciate it.
You are an incredibly intelligent man and I'm not saying that to butter you up.
I'm just saying, I take a lot of what you say, it's not fluff, it is very, very practical, well-thought-out the type of advice you only get from trying and failing a lot and then figure out.
4:15
Okay, this is what actually works.
It's kind of like listening to a Gracie talk about Jiu-Jitsu.
That's the same feeling that I get when I'm listening to you.
Talk about business.
So, Before we get into Today's Show we actually have a fun game that we're going to play.
It's going to be called Mosey Nation or mozi imitation.
Oh.
4:31
So in today's episode Rob and I are going to try to guess if a fact about you is true or not and then you are going to let us know which one was right?
And we're going to see who wins this is great.
I'm so sorry.
I feel I feel pretty confident.
I do watch some some mozi YouTube video so I think I got this one in the bag.
4:50
Yeah he's been practicing.
He's been researching this so that He could win.
So we'll see we'll see you again Talent or Preparation wins out here.
You guys can figure out which one of us is the talent based on what I've said so far.
All right, fact, number one, Alex, and Layla hormones.
E met on a dating app.
5:06
Rob?
What say, you.
I think I'm gonna go.
No, I think I'll go.
No, they did not meet on a dating app but own bubble, what's okay?
They did be done Bumble.
So I was going to say no.
So both, oh my God.
I think it's okay.
I did confuse you there.
5:21
The reason I didn't answer right away, is I Numbered hearing a interview that you were talking about.
I can't remember what was with.
But I remember you talking about your relationship with her and how you were super busy and there was a time, she came in the room and she was like, do you want to break up?
And you're like, yeah, whatever.
Like, okay.
And then, at some point, you needed help on a business deal.
5:39
She went out there, she absolutely crushed it for you, and it's sort of like, had a paradigm shift, like, oh, maybe this person's little more special to me than what I thought, which, I frankly love that you shared that information because this is something dudes, go through all the time and we never want to talk about.
We want to look like Batman.
We Just show up and you know, everything goes well but that's not how real life works out.
5:56
So I was trying to remember if you had mentioned the dating app or not, it's all right, that one.
Alright.
Alright, I will bring this a, in a gym for sure.
But all right.
I'll get it on this one.
It's all good.
All right.
Question.
Or fact, Alex, emailed himself.
All of his failures for the last five years.
I think I'll go true on that.
6:13
Not from something anecdotally that I know.
But it does seem like something you would do.
I could see and then I could see how you like, use that to fuel your So I'm going to go yes on that one.
I'm going to shoot with.
Yes, but not for any of the reasons Rob said it's because I watched Alex's microexpression.
6:32
When we ask the questions, I'm just going to read him completely allocating it, right?
Yeah, I know 100%.
That was that was how I thought.
That's how I remembered the lessons.
Yep, that'll keep you humble to.
And that's I mean something we could talk about later on the show, purposely pursuing humility when you're having massive success is Absolutely, in my opinion like crucial like it's not something that just happens.
6:56
You have to make an intentional effort to stay in a humble place when it feels like everything that you're doing is just falling in line perfectly.
So I can see that would be very wise.
All right.
Alex starts his mornings with a hot sauna and a nice bath.
You go.
First, I'm gonna go with.
7:12
No, I think he only does the ice bath because a hot sauna would be too comforting and that just seems like something that Alex with that reward himself with Comfort before he earned it.
Throughout the day I'm gonna go yes because I know that you wake up at 4 and that's a lot of time you talk about how you get more done in those hours than people do all week.
7:33
And it's very time consuming to take ice baths and sit in the sauna.
So I'm gonna go.
Yes!
No.
I I wake up a drink cup of coffee and I work.
It's my routine morning to check your not do.
Also a great answer.
I love that, man.
There's certain trends that you pick up on.
When you follow people in this business, taste, that everyone starts saying it because everyone else said it like one other really common ones that I I noticed was Mark, Zuckerberg was credited with saying I wear the same shirt every day because then I don't have to think about what I'm going to wear.
8:00
And I am so incredibly beyond your level that that, that I don't even have mental energy to spare to pick out my shirt and we were like, oh that sounds good, say that like I'm going to start doing that too.
And everyone started wearing the same shirt and I heard him on an interview with Gary Vee.
And he said, yeah, I just said that because really I'm not good at dressing myself and it sounded better than admitting.
8:19
I don't pick out clothes and I was like, how many of us have been This as this business maximum that's super and he's like, yeah, I made the whole thing up.
So there's a lot of things like that, like the ice bath in the morning though the waking up super early which I think is really good, especially if you're in a competitive environment where you're competing with others for business, but like, if you're just someone who writes books, it doesn't really give you an advantage because then you got to go to bed at 8:00 at night.
8:43
It's sort of a similar situation, so I really appreciate you admitting that you're not doing it just because everyone else says they are.
I could broaden go hard on that.
Question, 1.
Well, let's start with that.
That like let's hear your opinion.
If you think that I'm way off here, I think it's a big pile of gobbledygook and I mean the amount of stuff that that is espoused by The Tick-Tock gurus of wealth and finance is insanity.
9:04
You know, you've got the cold plunges, the finger tissues the yellow glasses, the affirmations, the morning, the Gratitude Journal, it's like, by the time you do that already halfway through your day and haven't done anything.
And so, if you break this down to, like a first principles thinking, it's like, okay, in order for me to do more, I must do more anything that is not me doing more is to tracking for my ability to do.
9:23
And so period, you know, like that's it and so time thinking about doing Time, progressed dating doing time recovering, like all those things are just not things that are you doing.
So I think the ability to work itself is trainable and so if people like feel like they need that prep beforehand, then I think that is something that is a crutch that can be eliminated and that ultimate make you more productive.
9:45
Not because you have some hack, but simply because you just put more time, I do love the Simplicity of that in Freely, just kind of breaking it all through.
And it's just like oh it's just this One really simple thing and I remember I watched one of your videos that was like, my hundred million dollar diet or something.
And then, you talked about how you went into a room with a bunch of CEOs.
10:02
One had wheat grass shots and then the other one was, like, meditating in the corner and then you're eating Twizzlers.
And they're like, what are you doing, bro?
And then you basically broke down how all diets are sham and it Shams in the basically comes down to calorie deficits and that ever since then I'm like okay I need to stop and you stop micro counting.
10:20
It's just calorie deficit.
I mean obviously I do want to oversimplify but That it was just like how funny.
It's just like these perceptions really cloud our minds and it's just like, much more simple than what we think.
A lot of the times, I had a mentor who's told me this this this court, it's a two-minute store.
And I think it's very memorable, it's don't be cute, right?
10:38
He was like, you know, he's from Long Island.
He's like, you know, when I used to play backyard football I was like, yeah, sure.
He's like yeah.
So you know, you got everybody wants to be fancy, you know, got that, you know, we're going to flip it to Timmy.
And Timmy is going to reverse this way, and then we're going to fake it, and then we're gonna go along.
And what happens if you drop the ball.
10:54
That's fumble.
It was the odds.
He's like nah we're talking fundamentals football, put the two fat guys in the middle run to the right and he was like don't be cute and he was telling me this because I was talking about this idea that I had for for Jim watch in terms of one of the new initiative that I wanted to take and he was like, don't be cute man.
11:10
He's like just do more what you're doing and I feel like there's a lot of Truth to that in terms of like people overcomplicate things that they already know because the truth is too difficult to stomach, right?
So it's like they want to they don't want to accept that.
They should just Eat less and move more and so they want to come up with a hundred ways to beat you.
11:25
Rather just confronting the fact that you need to eat less and move more.
And like they don't want to confront the fact that they just need to work.
And so, then they're like, I'm going to do all these things to prepare myself to work, right?
And get myself in the right Zen and like, have an attitude of abundance, Aurora and like, read my affirmations, to do my Daily Journal and all the stuff when it's like, did the work, the doing needs doing so it's just who's going to do it?
11:47
You know, I have a theory on that that like our audience is particularly susceptible.
Able to these gurus that say I will teach you how to make a million dollars by taking my hundred thousand dollar course.
And once you take this course you're going to go out there and you're going to flip 40 houses a year by showing you how I do it.
12:04
And even if they gave you the information to flip 40 houses, a year, you're not in shape to jump onto that level of a workout.
It would be like if the rock said, I will show you my work out, that doesn't mean you can go do his work out.
It takes time to build the skills that you would need to accomplish that in.
12:21
It's that like Whenever someone's being taken advantage of their is a part of them that is making them vulnerable to that.
Because like you said, it's they don't want to do the work there.
Either lazy, or they're greedy or there's some component of that that isn't what they don't want to accept it.
The case and I feel like this is why we there's constantly a new diet or a new trend or a new something.
12:40
And if you're the person that sells that to people, they'll buy it, you'll make a bunch of money.
And then it's funny because now you actually have money and so you can show that your system worked, but it you didn't do it by working the system.
You did it by selling other people's.
People on what they could be doing, which is I really like you, because you took the opposite approach.
12:57
You went in there and built these gyms and grinded to learn these things.
And then you said, okay, here's what I've learned after everything I've done and I love that, don't be cute approach, it's just there.
This is the fundamentals is how it works.
Do this better it definitely wasn't a new opportunity or just like so one of the things that we call it database marketing but when we work with a portfolio company especially if they're in the education space one of the first systems that we Implement is is Data Tracking our customer success.
13:22
And so We have activation points that we want to track.
We know that, you know, if someone does x y z by day 30 or whatever, the likely that they stay or asset goes up, you know, threefold, whatever.
And so what happens is, then we can make substantiated claims based on based on what we can observe.
And so the more data we collect, we can say, hey of the people who actually send, you know, a thousand emails to prospective homeowners, people who do that on average, four out of five of them will close a deal in their first 45 days.
13:48
And so, then it gives people prescriptions of activation.
It's like I can't guarantee that Are going to do it but I can give you the data to support.
What actions are going to create the outcome.
And so then you can start reworking marketing message rather than be another guy who's making the same promise.
You just say, hey again, I'm not making the promise, I'm just telling you what's happened and then you can make your own decision based on that and that's how I prefer.
14:07
It is also gives you unlimited amounts of kind of marketing angles and hooks, because once you have data, you can talk with the top twenty percent, the bottom, forty percent, the median, the average you can talk about people who do XYZ at contingencies to, you know, the claims that you make, and it gives you an unlimited way, but it all starts with actually focusing on the customer and making sure that they're getting.
14:23
They're supposed to, you know, be got a right.
Yeah.
So I like this, a lot that don't be cute and I am a frequent Watcher of your YouTube channel and it's a very raw Channel where you sit, you talk about life, lessons that you've gone through.
And I really like that.
14:38
I really appreciate you.
Basically, you leave it all out there for people to kind of take and apply to their life.
So one of the things I hear you talk about really often, you know, is scaling in that seems to be somewhat of your specialty.
I know that there's different tiers of kind of scaling companies, right?
14:55
There's the first million and million to 3 million and then 3 million to 30 million.
So it's kind of hoping we could dive into that a little bit because I think a lot of people in the Bigger Pockets audience they're trying to get to that first million dollars, right?
And we want to really dive into some of those Concepts and what's needed to really hit that million dollar Mark in the company.
15:16
So do you think you could just sort of walk us through those different tiers?
Starting with that first?
How do we get to that?
Golden egg of a million?
As for a business coach, even break it down to six figures to because I was asked on a different podcast about six figures and it actually it's even simpler.
So you know, to get started, you have to sell something to someone, that's it.
15:35
Like literally that's all one Avatar.
One product, one channel.
That's it.
So you have one way of getting customers.
You saw one thing to one specific type of person that is all you need to do to get to six figures, to get to Seven figures.
You need to learn how to do those three things comma.
Reliably comma consistently, right?
15:51
So it's, you know, how to sell One product, one avatar on one channel in a consistent manner.
So you start having predictive metrics on how you can acquire customers.
So, it's either I spend this amount of money on advertising.
And this is how many, you know, calls to give up.
And then from that many calls, I get that money, you know, sales, Etc, its outbound.
It's like I said, this many emails are make this many calls or this many texts and then spin a you, nope, reply back.
16:10
This one is scheduled as many show.
This many clothes Etc.
If you're running organic, it's I know that I need to have this many posts that I have to make across these different channels with call to actions that drive towards this page, for every thousand visitors on this page.
I get why Opt-ins.
What you don't mean.
So each of these vehicles are have to hit my email list, you know, once a week.
16:28
And if I hit it once a week with a call to action again.
So all these are the different ways you can get customers.
You could also do a Affiliates can do referrals.
There's many ways to do it but the point is that you pick one Avatar, one channel and one product and then as soon as you can start, predicting how many inputs it takes to get an output then you get to a million, right?
16:45
And at that point you're you know, 123 million issue.
Year 1. 2 3, you have to build out your core team so that's usually like the first five higher.
Hers first 5 to 10 ish that are, it depends on the ticket of the thing that's being sold.
You know, if you're selling 25,000 or things versus five hundred dollar things, the team size is going to be different, but it's the core team at about 3 million.
17:05
And that's, uh, that's the reason we take companies on at three is usually there, cuz because there's a core team and at three million there's product Market fit.
So, they've demonstrated that people want this thing and they have enough support that we can take them from 3 to 10 3 to 10.
And this is interesting because as a mistake, a lot of people make it three and I can stop whenever you want me to cut the line.
17:23
It's of the problems that come up, but the problems that come up at 3ish, are there people start getting cute.
Right?
And they start saying and here's what's difficult is that you get reinforced on the fact that the more you Market, the more you sell, the more money you make, right?
And it's true and you can scale from there by doing more sales, more marketing.
17:40
And that is what the vast majority of the industry will do because they got reinforced doing it early.
The problem is that they switch the objectives, the objective of the first phase of business which for me is like zero to three is just to demonstrate It Market fit and an acquisition channel.
That is profitable.
That is the objective.
17:57
Now, at this point, we transition objectives to increasing lifetime value per customer.
So this is improving the customer experience putting Data Tracking in place if there's an Ascension opportunity that makes sense.
We need to build out that product or service line so that and this is the big point so that when we do choose to add another Channel or expand on our current Channel, we can do some more profitably, right.
18:15
Where if you just sell a single product, that might not have as much l TV as you would, you know, you would want as you scale or put more in, Your margins begin to compress so you might go up to 10 million but your margins have compressed over time and then you get in this place where you have to keep selling to maintain your overhead, but you're not really taking enough home and you can't have enough cash, free cash flow to grow the business.
18:36
And so sometimes it's like, you have to take the step back, fix the product, fix the customer experience, fix the service, fix the data, fix the infrastructure, that everything's built on, probably hire and fire.
Some people that you promoted a little bit too early to didn't have the experience because they're actually not actually running things that well and then once we fix that stuff then honestly going from 3 to 10 usually.
18:53
Almost happens on its own.
Once we're at 10 then we go for more aggressively on the acquisition side which is you know, the easiest moniker that I use is more better new.
So we do more, what we're currently doing until we Max that out and then we do better of what we're currently doing.
Is there any cro opportunity?
19:08
So conversion rate optimization, can we switch this headline out?
Can we change this lead magnet?
Can we can we Implement some of the best practices that we know to get, you know, more people to show up?
If it's a service business?
If it's a, if it's a product B and I only focus on service businesses, so, lots of meat.
Lots of our stuff is over the phone.
Can we change the The video sales letters in the follow-up email, things like that, all the improvements that can happen and then different is okay, or new is, can we add a new channel to this?
19:31
So we have six that we can choose from to get new customers.
We've got, we've got, we can hit up our own lists.
We can do cold cold a pound.
We can do content, we can do paid ads, we can do affiliate so we can do referrals.
And so there's the only six ways to get your customers.
We look at those six and say of the skills that we currently have, which of these would make the most sense to add to it.
19:48
And you can even go adding a new thing within a current.
So if you're running paid ads, it's like In from Facebook to YouTube or going from Facebook to tick tock.
And so there's you know, as each one of those six squares has channels or media channels that you can or platforms that you can tap into that, give you new audiences.
20:04
So that was a little bit of a crash course there, but that's what allows you to scale from 10 to 30 and Beyond at 30-ish.
The founders typically will start feeling constrained because they are the juju behind the entire business, and please cut me off.
I'm starting to bore you guys, but at 30 ish is when it stops being about the founder, not that it was about the founder to begin.
20:23
But like you can will your way to 30, but at some point, like right around there.
There's like, just you get spread too thin.
And so in this was a mistake, I stayed, okay, I'll stop the the point.
The point is, is that I need more, you need more stallions, right?
And so you have to find more people who can drive things like you do.
20:40
And so, this is where employee compensation in recruiting become Paramount to getting to the next level because we need to bring people in who have already won the Olympic gold.
You've already run this race multiple times at companies just like yours, but bigger and better.
And then have them come and run the play book for you, so that you're not driving it, but someone else's since that's where like compensation in recruiting.
20:59
Becomes really important.
So you can incentivize people who who deserve to have that level of compensation.
And that's you get to, you know, it's a nine figures plus.
Okay.
All right.
Well, I think we're probably just end the podcast there, right?
We got a lot to cover on this.
21:14
So let's talk about the the first million because that seems to be where a lot of people aren't all of this.
So you talked about in your first million You're kind of identifying a few things is going to be your avatar, which is going to be your customer profile.
Who is your customer profile?
But then you also mentioned your one channel.
21:31
Can you explain that?
Do you mean the one channel that your marketing or the one channel that you're?
Yeah, they explained that do you mean like YouTube, like social Channel?
Give us a little bit more on that.
Yeah, so there's, there's three variables, right?
So you got platform, you've got, you've got media and then you've got the content, right of whatever your marketing.
21:48
So you just have to pick one of those three things together.
So I told you about Ways to get new customers just now, right?
So there's six ways to get your customers.
You pick one, you double click on that and it's like, okay within their by do cold out, but am I going to be cold?
Call my going to decode text called the MS cold emails, all of those would be one platform, right?
22:04
So one method and then you've got the platform that you're doing it on and then you pick the type of media that you want to send do.
I want to send a voice memo?
Do I want to send a text?
I want to send a handwritten card, do I want it?
You don't even like, depends on the platform because some platforms.
You can send multiple types of media, some of them can only set one and so you pick one channel which is all those things together which is just a fancy word for a pathway for a Injured become a customer, right?
22:24
So we pick a pathway for strange.
If you have a customer and we focus on that one thing, You guys, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
22:44
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
And do you feel that for breaking your first million?
23:03
The entrepreneur, that's in this journey.
Is that kind of like the loneliest phase of the company?
Because I feel like for me, you know, I was alone for a lot of it in terms of Just In The Weeds of my own businesses and I really didn't start hiring until breaking.
23:20
The threshold of that, in my businesses, is that a pretty common sentiment you think?
Or is it?
You know, like do people have like well-established And that's how they get to a million.
No, I mean it a million it's usually a few hires a few contractors, you know, it depends again on the number of units sold to get to a million you know because you got to make 83k months ago, maybe 20 K week, right?
23:42
So 20K week if you're selling 20K things, it's like you're selling for clients a month.
Like, that's pretty easy to manage.
If you're selling, you know, a hundred dollar things, you got to sell 200 clients a week.
So, it's a little bit harder.
Again, if it's a physical product business, then it's going to be mostly like support.
And if you're the media, buyer / marketer, then you know, Do you can probably manage an e-commerce but again it just depends on the type of business.
24:03
But I would say, from a zoom out perspective, I think all all seasons of Entrepreneurship have elements of loneliness, and I think that it changes I think in the beginning, it's a lot harder because you're really competitive.
You're really competitive against other people rather than being competitive and it's yourself.
And so like, in the beginning, like this guy ripped off me.
24:19
This guy's loved about you have all this like finger-pointing and I was just on a podcast with Ed my letting.
We had a really good conversation about it, but like the 20-year Club, you know?
I mean like I'm only in the decade club, right?
But like, you know five years in 80% of people are gone, right so it's like okay.
It's a little bit friendlier at ten years, you know, at least for me like I have no I just know how big the big the world is and so if there's a I remember when I was starting out with Jim Lunch, I've thought about doing a weight loss business because we're going to weight loss and that was actually what ended up we decided to do the weight loss business and that's when I pivoted and I told the guys the gyms that were we're going to do the turnarounds the next month that we weren't going to do it and the guys were like, well, can you just show me how to do it?
24:59
And I was like fine.
I'll show you how to do it and I sold them just kind of like a licensing of all mi mi mi mi ads and all my pages and everything had already built out and tested and then that ended up being yeah that became Jim wanted became way bigger than the the little weight loss thing that we had.
But when I started doing we lost just for a few weeks a buddy of mine who was in weight loss came up to me.
25:16
He said, you know, if you do weight loss we can't be friends.
He was doing like 150 Grand a month.
I was like dude.
It's a 60 billion dollar industry.
Like we can't both do weight loss.
He's like dude.
I was doing weight loss first.
I was like, bro.
I had six gyms.
Away lessons but you are a 17 you don't.
25:31
I mean that's crazy.
That's crazy that he invented the concept of weight loss like you know that guy that's so cool.
It's all right, and so I say that because like it sounds ridiculous and that guy ended up becoming very very successful to and he like later on was like do and I was just, I don't know.
25:47
Sorry, you know because you're so afraid.
It's just fear.
You're just so afraid that that something's going to go wrong that you just want to like, hold on and clench and just, and just pointed everybody else when it.
Just like it just isn't about you you know.
I mean it's just like if you can serve your customers you'll have business.
26:03
It doesn't matter what the competition is doing and the market so big, you know what I mean?
So anyways, I think that's why it's lonely but like, it's lonely at my point to just in a different way.
It's lonely because there's just not that many people that I can talk to who are, you know, dealing with the same things, right?
So, do you feel because that that makes sense for me?
26:21
Like, I've been in a lot of moments like that, where it's rare to connect to something that's going through the exact kind of very new Nuanced thing that you're going through like have you found people in your journey that you've have connected in that way and like how does one even find that?
26:37
Because I think that is really tough for a lot of people to find someone that really grasp.
What they're saying on a personal level.
So to talk on one of the points that we were talking about, didn't the game show earlier?
I'm a huge, huge, huge, huge, proponent of alternative education.
I love, I love the education businesses.
26:55
I Love Guru businesses.
I mean II love them.
Comma, as long as they're being done well and promising the correct thing and really focused on the product and the customer, I love that and fundamentally like during businesses are just education businesses and they are sprouting all over the place because the demand is unmet by the formal education system and the demand is for skills that make money and people are not getting them but the demand is not going away.
27:19
If anything has grown because people are seeing on social media, all these other people making money, they're like this is possible and so in one good way I think Instagram and all that stuff.
Has made more people believe that they can do it.
The downside is obviously whenever you have upside you've got an equal opposite up reaction of people who are scamming people and things like that.
27:35
And I think that the difference between a scam and somebody who is trying to deliver is intention.
I think there are many well hearted or well-intentioned Educators who are really trying to do a good job but they are poor teachers just like they're people who love the teacher or teachers and were terrible at teaching math and you probably had them but they really wanted to happen, they just weren't that good at it.
27:51
And so I have a little bit more of a heart for both sides of the equation here, but I do think that education is the way.
How did I find people?
I asked and I was willing to have people say, no, and real real.
Very few people said no to me my whole journey, and I think it was, because the way that I asked was, I didn't ask I went and said, hey, this is all the stuff I'm good at and then I would just prepare stuff.
28:12
And I do work ahead of time to help them with their business.
And I would just get on a call and be like, here's all the value, I could possibly deliver to you.
And then if it was anybody worth anything, because winners give back, they were like do this was I was not expecting this.
Do, what can I do for you?
28:28
And be like, okay, I really have this question.
Do you know how to do this thing?
And they're like, no, but I know a guy and I'll put you guys together.
And so I'd like, my first Mastermind, I was a part of.
I got voted member of the year with like 100 internet marketers and I was an internet marketer.
Could I know anything about in our marketing, which is ridiculous.
28:45
I joined because I wanted to learn and so I just only thing I knew then was sales.
And so all of those I rewrote so many scripts for guys in that Community because there's only thing I was good at and so they're like, wow, this is awesome.
Then they would help me out and I was like, how do I make the landing page to an opt-in thing?
And they would sit there and he would show me how to do it and that's how I learned.
29:04
Like I did not, I learned like this, like you had me on the phone right here.
This is how I learned and I paid dearly for that because I didn't buy that many courses actually bought way more one-on-one and I bought a lot of my 101 by doing work for other people for free.
Yeah, I can definitely relate with the, the opt-in form and connecting into the landing page one.
29:24
I, when I first launched my my very first program That was the hardest week of my life because I did all the tech and all the marketing, all the content, and all the editing, and all the copywriting, and it hurt my brain, you know, but at the end of it, I was like, okay.
And so I'm a really big, proponent of learning.
29:40
All this stuff in, mastering it before.
I can delegate it out to somebody else because I just want to know that they are good at what they're doing, but I feel like that's not necessarily super sustainable as the organization grows.
And I think you kind of mentioned this earlier when you said To start scaling up, you have to start hiring.
29:59
These stallions are people that are better than you at certain functions.
I struggle with that, not because I think I'm smarter than everybody, but I'm just always like no one knows it the way.
I know it.
Is that a limiting belief that that is difficult to shake your entire Journey?
30:14
Are you pretty good at Breaking Free from that that limiting belief?
Yeah, 100% limiting belief.
I mean it's prideful to think that no one can do something better than you.
So a lot of times what happens is people hire people.
Who have never done this thing and then are like, oh my God, I'm better than this person's ago.
30:30
Obviously they've never done it before.
Hire someone who's significantly better than you.
Who's done that thing for very long time, who's not also running every other department of the business and you'll be amazed at how much somebody can do in the beginning though.
Just to be clear, it is normal for people to have to learn all the basics, right?
30:46
Like entrepreneurship in the beginning is very much, you know, master of all trades.
You know what is the jack of all trades?
Master of none.
Like, that's very much the beginning.
You have to just be good enough at everything, you don't have to be great, you have to be good enough.
To get it done and get the first dollar across the bridge from there.
You start to begin to get more leverage and so the entire conversation is scaling and Entrepreneurship about two things control and leverage.
31:05
And so the control component is that you have, it's a consistent relinquishing of control.
As you move up the leverage ladder, right?
Because you can't see every email that goes out.
You can't approve every post, you can't review every sales.
Call, you can't, you know, make every video that's going to be in your in your course, from what your sack, right?
31:23
Like you can't make every one of those things and the person who's making it in the beginning.
Inning might not be as good as you, but the question is, are they good enough?
And that's why organizations improve over time because like you have to scale with good enough until you can replace it with better because you have more leverage because you have more cash flow.
You can attract better people, you can fix the culture, etc, etc.
31:40
And so, the whole concept of moving up in entrepreneurship is trading your time for increasing amounts of money.
And so, we're defining leverage as getting more for what you put in, right?
Inputs and outputs at a systems discrepancy between the two is the leverage.
If that's the leverage in the system, we try and use more leverage in the first.
31:57
Version of that is labor, right?
And so that's the lowest form of Leverage that we can use.
And so we hire people to do things for us so that we can have time back to do more valuable things in your experience.
Alex, do you feel that the skill of hiring?
32:12
Well is a really big hurdle that people have to overcome this one of the bigger problems or is it not as big as I'm thinking in my mind?
It just D problem.
Yeah, it is.
The biggest problem.
So, think about this from a purely theoretical Standpoint, if you understood what was required in a business, like what has to happen for a business to succeed and then all you did was put the people in place to have that happen.
32:36
Then you would not need to work.
And so the reason that things are not happening is because the people are not doing the things.
And so for our ability as entrepreneurs to select.
So first, attract recruit hire manage and Ascend /, keep the higher up, you go in the business, the more leverage you have on how much money in your time, you make it all becomes about recruiting and You might like this from a from a real estate perspective but you know, you can buy, you can build that's kind of an MMA thing, right?
33:03
So like if we have a new division that we want to get into, we can either build the thing from scratch, we can buy it, but if you zero down at a micro level, you can either build Talent or you can buy it and so it's much faster to buy talent.
And so I think one of the things that people overestimate, this is a quote for my wife, but she says everyone, everyone thinks they're a good judge of character until they get judged by the people they hire and so it's a little little mic drop for you, but it's true.
33:27
Right?
Yeah, it's true.
And so, if we're judging, if we're being judged based on the people, we hire, I would say that in my experience, the objective facts have worked better.
And so, track record and case study analysis on before they start.
33:44
So it's like, if I want to hire a video editor for example, to cut content, then I want to look at their track record show me the stuff that you've already done.
And that you've been doing this for a long time.
For people, just like me trying to get to where I want to go.
Those are all nuances.
And what I just said, The second piece is, hey, here's some Roz.
34:00
This is what I want.
Go make stuff and then I can have 10 guys compete.
And the thing is, is that there's so much psychological bias of like, I like this guy.
He looks the way I look bla bla bla that we don't let the work do the talking.
And so, the more objective we can be about it.
So, in that way, I really do believe me like, colorblind and all that kind of stuff when it comes to recruiting talent because like, Talent comes in all forms.
34:20
And so, all I really care about is the productivity, the output of the person.
And so I think for me, that's been the easiest thing.
This is much more laila's Department.
But in terms of like how we scale businesses and acquisition.com, we consider recruiting to be our core and number one competency because at 3 million with the business, Laxus talent.
34:37
And so what we do because it's usually one founder that's breathing life into this thing.
With lots of little helpers, it's a genius of the Thousand hands.
And of course if you remove the genius that's there's nothing right.
That's most businesses and most businesses aren't worth anything because they're not businesses.
They're very their leverage jobs and so what we do is we look at the needs of the business and then we recruit people who've done the thing already.
34:57
And can demonstrate that they can solve the specific problem that we're facing in the nice thing, is that if you are hiring somebody, you should have a problem, they should be solving.
And so the problem sitting in front of you and you're like, hey head of marketing, fix my marketing on the job interview and two things happen either.
They don't know how to do it or they do know how to do it and they teach you stuff.
35:14
And so during the interview process, if you're not learning from the person that you're supposed to hire to take the job from you then they're going to work as a subset of your knowledge because you know more than them which means you need to train them.
And so you're not buying tell your building again.
You might be paying by Buying it price for building it work which is not the trade we want to make Soto's.
35:31
I could talk about that longer but that's fundamentally.
That's how you scale.
You're making me very uncomfortable because I'm realizing as you're talking here that I tend to lean towards the, I want to coach this person up.
They have a great attitude.
They want to learn, they're like whatever you want.
I'll go do it.
35:46
And then I actually not only am I paying you, but I'm losing money because I'm taking time away from revenue-generating activities to train you to do the thing that I'm also paying you to do and it never, and I'm just stuck in like sort of Is treadmill that I can't get out of right now.








0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out 100, million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with this.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star review.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Basically.
I started With the question, what can I do for ever?
0:31
And then work backwards from there, because I knew if I could do something forever, then it would get very big.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
0:47
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
One in every 250 businesses, achieves a 10 million dollar more run rate, that's point four percent and I started for businesses that cracked 10 million in a row.
And if you're on your entrepreneurial journey, I want to share the Frameworks and lessons.
1:05
I learned from the many mistakes that led to those four in a row so that you can use the same framework.
So that hopefully, the next business you have or the current business you're on, can achieve that level and Beyond.
And for context, you don't know who I am.
My name is Alex Mosey, I would acquisition.com, its portfolio companies that right now.
It is over, $200 a year.
And I make these That you can hopefully get big enough past, 3 million, 10 million Etc, and then we can invest your business to help it grow further.
1:27
So, the first big company I built was called Jim watch.
It was a licensing business for gym owners as in.
I had a model and I would license that model to them.
They would use this things, they make more money on average.
The average it would make an extra hundred thousand dollars a year in profit on top of what they were currently making.
1:42
Using the model that we had and we were able to charge a percentage of that additional profit as our fee.
And that's how we made money that business.
At its peak was worth about 150 million dollars and then covid hurt that business and I ended up selling it for forty six point two million to American Pacific group, which is a private Equity Firm out of San Francisco.
2:00
I had many businesses before Jim launch, and the reason that Jim wanted my opinion was able to scale from what I had pretty much kept at before, which is about a couple million dollars a year, all the way to 30 million dollars a year in, you know, 20 months was because I had more leverage in the model and if your Nutrish four types of Leverage that you can employ in a business and this is the From the of all ramakant said it's his thing, but it's great.
2:24
The first level is labor, so you can get other people to do work for you, right?
Like you were doing something someone else does it.
Now, you don't have to do it.
That's leverage you get more, you get more done for your time.
The second level of Leverage is capital, so that's you asking for other people's money.
2:40
Other people spent their time to make the money and then you use that money to make money as well.
And you get a percentage of that gain, but you didn't have to incur the cost of time to get the money.
That's the second level.
This is how War.
In Buffett Charlie Munger lock icon.
Those guys made their fortunes labor was how the pyramids of Egypt were built and how the royalty of generations was built before that on the backs of other workers.
3:02
The third level is and really third and fourth are same there.
Just equal is code and media code being software is if you write something once a bazillion people can use it, that's leverage you put one input, you get infinite output media to the same degree.
I'm recording this video right now.
3:17
I report it once in a million people can see it.
Those are Things that are newer of this economy, which is why even more wealth is being aggregated in the companies that can use, one, two, or all four.
And I will say, one more thing is that it's not, do you use it?
But it's the extent to which you use it.
So you can raise Capital, it doesn't make you Warren Buffett.
3:35
If you can raise 10 billion dollars, you have more leverage than somebody who might have just a YouTube channel, if mr.
Beast only has his YouTube channel.
He might have more leverage than somebody just has a nap.
All right, so it's not just, which ones do you have?
But to what?
Extent, and so Jim watch was able to Grow significantly faster.
3:51
Because as I look back on my career at every level of Leverage, I've added a zero to my monthly income.
And so when I was an employee I was making four figures a month.
When I became self-employed, I started making five figures a month.
When I started using other people help me out labor.
4:08
My first real level of Leverage is when I got to six figures a month, when I use labor and included media which was licensing.
I got to seven figures a month and so all it is I was able to get more out of the Inputs that I was putting in the system because the work that I did was always constant, I was working 16 hours a day every day.
4:25
That's just what I did.
That was constant but how much I got out of that work expended and that is how my income changed.
The first 10 customers are from Jim launch came because I got somebody to pay a VA in the Philippines to scrape crossfit's database for gym owners and then send me the list of e-mails.
4:45
I then uploaded them to Facebook made it look like audience off of those marketed to get a webinar.
Our which no one watched.
And then I had 80 leads from people who had opted in, I'd even know called Outreach like existed at that point could have just called the leads the thing about that.
And so I had to a tea leaves that came from that who went through the opt-in page and none of them bought or scheduled to call.
5:06
And so I looked up every one of the emails manually and I like friend of them on Facebook.
I messaged them and then I got a few of them on the phone and I got them to pay me. 500 bucks to go out to fly to their gym and actually do the turn around.
So I started the licensing version of the model which is the one that really gave me the scale because I started doing like a few hundred thousand dollars a month when I was doing the turnarounds in person, I then called back all the guys that I've done the turn around and said, hey you want to do this new thing at that point, I switched the offer from me flying out and I had gotten a little bit better at marketing that point that people did start booking calls, but then then I was selling the licensing package rather than like the done-for-you service ride fly out.
5:45
And when I started Jim want when we transition from selling done-for-you service, which is Really heavy to the much operationally lighter media version, where I was licensing, content and promotions, and AD copy and all that stuff.
I was able to sell something that had virtually 100 percent margins.
6:01
So the first month, I think it did like 120,000 in sales in the next month, I did like 300 ish.
And then for high fours and then 780 and all I was doing was just selling more units and then we hit a million, the next month.
And this is where the skill sets that I learned from the turnaround business because I date sales, guys, then and we were doing 10,000 a day or more in sales in three to five hundred dollar increments.
6:25
And so I was used to managing a team of eight guys who are selling 10, 20 30, 40 units a day, you know, because they don't sell 30 days a month.
So they're selling 24 days if you get the idea.
I was used to super high volume sales very transactional.
And so, I had the skill set already scale a sales team really quickly and that's why I was able to scale.
6:45
So so fast, whereas other people get stuck there.
They like they've been the only salesperson they've never trained to Salesforce.
They never hired a sales person verbal sales team.
They don't have about commission structures, they do how to build ramp up, like I already had all that stuff and so, because the turnaround business I had built, all these internal trainings to teach the gyms like, what to do.
7:02
After we left, I didn't have to do a ton to translate that into things that I would give to them.
And all I really did was take two trainings that were internal the sales and the marketing, and make them things that I sold the rest of it.
All the delivery, all the meal plans on the Fulfillment.
I was already giving that so I literally had to take two internal trainings.
7:20
Some external.
And then I just turn the faucet on and already had a sales team so I could just scale it.
Jim wants is our product continues to change every month.
We've run the same Cadence.
We run a beta test, we take 10 gyms that are from representative markets that are representative in skill set.
So we take some people that are the bottom, third, some that are the middle third.
7:37
And some of that are high performers.
This is actually a mistake I made early on.
I used to only take High performers but then they always one and then I didn't have a representative idea of if this was actually a good thing or that they were just winning.
And so we started taking representative samples.
From representative markets and we would run one specific play.
7:53
And so, if you think about any business, as a pipeline, we would look at whatever problems, the gym owners that we were with, we're currently suffering from.
So, could be their suffering from Turn and they could be suffering from margin issues, they could be suffering from, they're not getting enough leads.
They could be or there's you know the clothes rates aren't as high as we want them to be whatever.
The problem was we would then create a hypothesis around what we thought might work.
8:12
And so usually the way we do that is we would survey the community and say who has the best conversion rates if that's what we wanted to fix and then we invite 20 of them onto a call.
We would take all the notes to figure out what things they were all doing.
And here's the important point, we didn't say great, we're going to do all these things.
8:27
We try to see the few things that they were all doing because people might have 20 things that they're doing, but all of them were doing these two or these three.
And so, we cut everything else, out would remove it just to the core units.
And then, we take the group of Representative Jim owners that are a smorgasbord who weren't doing necessarily well at those things.
8:45
And then we'd say, we'd make the training and we deliver it the same way we would to everyone because if you give more service when you're doing the training, You screw the results because then it is it because the way you package the the license of material that was good or because of the service.
And so we had to deliver it the same way we would deliver to everyone else to see what the result was after.
9:01
We have the result, it was either positive or negative or it was neutral.
So if it was negative, we would still share the results because then the entrepreneurial brains of everybody who's there's always just curious, like, how did the test go?
So that was still valuable to the community.
They didn't have to run that field test if it was neutral.
I would say.
Hey, this is neutral.
9:16
I don't think it's worth incurring the cost of change based on what everybody else has are doing.
And If it was above, then we'd say, hey guys, this is big deal.
This is like worth the cost of change, you're going to have a demonstrated long-term benefit to the business and for context my best Jim did about six hundred thousand dollars a year.
9:32
Our average gym who's a gym Lord made six hundred thousand year, so we're my gym success.
Ended is where my test begin to improve the model and I would say that was probably a decent operator.
And so if I had had all the things that I now know, or what I learned from everybody else in the community, my gyms would have all been syndrome.
9:50
Oops, I just didn't know testing was something that was a consistent value at month over month because a lot of times, people who have any kind of digital business or licensing, Business Media business, you learning business.
Things like that information to Klein's and value precipitously over time.
So, like the day before, you get the information, it's incredibly valuable the day after you learn it.
10:09
It's almost no value.
And so, in order to retain people, one thing we had to do with separate information from consumable services and say, okay?
Well, what were charging on a recurring basis to the things that you consume, you Zoom ads because you need new ads every month you consume accountability is actually a thing that people consume.
10:25
They need it this month.
Next month, Community is something that you consume this month next month.
So what are the things that they consume on a monthly basis for the things that once they've learned they don't need it anymore.
And your tests is another version of things that every month you want improvements.
And so you can consume those improvements.
That even though the information there declined, after we did it, they knew another one was coming.
10:43
I mean, in gym, we had many, many terrible things that happened during de menthe.
I mean, one, we had covid-19 General.
A third of all of our clients went out of business, very hard when you're not allowed to be in business, even if you're a great gym owner, for if your state won't allow you to do your business and you still have to pay rent and that's it.
11:01
Like you there's not a lot, you can do there.
Another thing that we do that was really bad.
Was we over hired for our support for our supplement business.
When we launched that, I had hired an inexperienced director of customer service.
She was a Frontline rep that we just promoted all the way through.
She was a great culture fit, you know, High work ethic, but no experience.
11:18
And so she mapped the level of support we I did for a high-level B2B business, to the same number of people for a very high volume transactional, business.
And so, she are 35 Reps for customer service on the cell phone business and we only needed five.
11:35
So, we had to lay off 30 people and guess whose glass to work out her hers or mine.
Mine.
And then that became a thorn in our side for the next 2-3 years because our last or got smashed.
And this is all front level employees who are new.
So they had no problem just smashing someone's front door, like they had no loyalty and I get it, you know, it was a it was a mess up on our side and then of course, when you, you know, achieve a certain size, there are predatory employees who will come in, who's so way of making money is trying to make a lawsuit and get you to settle for less than the cost of proving that you are innocent.
12:09
And so depending on the state, you're in, if you hire remotely, if you're higher than 50 states, there are very employee-friendly states where but you know that the legal fees are going to be 10 to 20 thousand dollars and it costs less to Just pay someone 10 to 20 thousand dollars and set.
Also, by the way, if you ever hear a company settled out of court, they might have been right then it just becomes a cost analysis, which sucks because I'm principal a lot of I had to like my CFO who's more experienced than me at the time was like, Alex, do want to be right?
12:34
You will be rich and I was like, The biggest reason Jim wants a successful, and it's funny because I see these Twitter threads, where people break down, why did you launch a successful?
Having never actually been engine, won't or been a customer or being me in my opinion.
And who knows no one will ever know why it was successful but I believe, looking back, I have a couple of things that made it successful.
12:54
One, is that?
It was timing.
We identified Arbitrage on Facebook ads before anyone else did and we created a turnkey system around how to monetize it.
And so I mean I was running.
The ads on Facebook in 2013.
Like, that's hard for people can't like, that was a long time ago and that was, when you could put a girl in the bikini and say, click here now, like it was the Wild West.
13:15
The second thing is that because of that Arbitrage, the average gym was taking home an additional thirty thousand dollars in cash in their first 30 days.
That was the average like it's very difficult for anybody who has any kind of e-learning thing or licensing or even franchise to understand like how insane that is.
13:32
Like, if you take a business where the average business owner is making 36 hours an hour, Orders in profit and then you add thirty thousand dollars in the first month of working with them.
You don't need to worry about marketing.
And so, technically, my return on marketing was 101 for the first 18 months of the business, but it's because I probably could have just not marketed at all.
13:52
And I would have had the amount of people that came in.
So, like, who knows if the ads are doing anything but everybody from the outside was like, this guy's ads are everywhere, like he's killing it.
And thing is, I was killing it but not necessarily for that reason.
And later on covid taught me an important lesson, which was that Timing matters.
14:07
And as much as I will never give power in terms of like, it's not going to change my behavior.
If we have, you know, like right now we're in a recession, but I will be more realistic about goals and expectations.
So, I attributed all the successor lie to myself, and and then later, I looked back and covid taught me.
14:27
The lesson that I was like, I'm pushing twice as hard now, but we're pushing against industry that 30% of people are permanently going out of business.
And maintaining is what I told my team is.
The New win, if we maintain we win.
And so, that was an important lesson.
But I think the big, the big picture is that the product has to be exceptional.
14:46
If your customers are in love with your product, which takes more time, because we were like, oh you through this thing together is like it took six years for me to put all those pieces together and then finally be able to monetize that deliverable and everyone just underestimates how much time it takes to go from good to great.
15:03
And like that little inch between good and great is Hers.
But the return you get on it from the word of mouth that compounds is hard to Fathom when you get it, right?
So telling the team to maintain wasn't as hard as you might think, because everybody else who is in my industry was just dying like everyone else was dying.
15:21
And so, I was like, all we have to do is stay alive and then we'll get all their business like the next year, and that's what happened.
So, many people who are copycats Mickey Mouse gimmick bullshit, people who just used old versions of our stuff to try and sell a tad.
It like all the stuff you would imagine.
All those guys went out of business.
This because they didn't have the depth, like they hadn't put in the work, they didn't understand why the stuff was structured that way they would make changes to it.
15:42
That we had already made in the made it worse.
Like, we already tested that stuff.
And so I had confidence that we would be able to weather the storm one because we had big cash reserves that other people didn't have, secondly.
Because other people stop marketing and we mark it at harder and cpms dropped for our Market because no one could afford getting to them.
15:58
And because it's a service-based business, we actually are, we're already very tight.
We were in a very lean ship, Jim largely prided ourselves on that.
So we had to let some people go, but it wasn't a huge percentage of the workforce.
It was just like, okay, well if our clients go from, you know, seven hundred to Five Hundred than we need, you know, fifteen percent fewer, you know support reps or whatever but when is what ends up having those you prune the tree.
16:19
And so a lot of times when you kind of get rid of the lower performing people, the actual tree get stronger and sets itself up to grow more the next season.
So I will say that the biggest shift I've had as a longer term entrepreneur because I'm hit my decade of Entrepreneurship is that things are more seasonal than I used to.
16:36
I think they were one of the other big secrets of Jim launch was that we had a very different approach to acquiring customers and so the traditional model of most businesses in general is lost leader.
You know, you get someone in for some sort of free thing, you lose money on the acquisition, you make it up in LTV, that's kind of the model I came with a different model and I've since done that every single business I have.
16:57
So this is one of the important Frameworks that I want to pass to you.
And it's something called client, finest acquisition.
So quiet.
Finest, acquisition basically means you get the customers.
You get your clients to finance the acquisition.
The next customer.
So all you have to do is have enough money to get the first sale.
And if you make more in the first sale than the cost to acquire that customer and the cost to fulfill that customer, plus the cost to fulfill the next customer and the cost to acquire the next customer.
17:19
You eliminate Capital as a constraint in the business.
And so I would give you a simple math thing, but there's no point that's fundamentally what it is.
If you can put a dollar in and get to customers back then that next customer, buys you two more and two more, two more and then that point acquisition no longer becomes the bottleneck.
17:34
And so with the brick-and-mortar businesses I Taught them that model.
So a traditional gym would make 600 to 1200 dollars in lcv with my model.
They would make that upon the first transaction.
And so they would get that cash flow up front and then they would collect the LCD on the back of that would continue to stack and they'd be competing against people who are bidding for the same eyeballs that were only trying to sell a 21 day detox for 21 bucks.
17:54
And so, all my gyms were able to just Crush everyone else because we can outspend them.
And so, I've taken that kind of aggressive acquisition perspective, to every one of the businesses that I've had.
So, the way we think about that is like, is there a way?
We can increase the first transaction, which is counter-intuitive because most people don't increase the first transaction because they're afraid of not selling, but if you have the skill of sales, it's in my opinion that when someone is the most excited, the most in pain is at the first moment.
18:17
So the day you walk in the gym, is the day that you are the most in pain.
And so trying to sell someone later when they've already had some results or the novelty has worn off to me, always felt backwards.
And so I want to get someone in make a very strong argument why they should commit.
And then also get the bigger commitment up front, which actually long-term makes it more likely that they're going to be successful, especially Ashley.
18:36
If it's something where they have to do a lot of work, which in the Fitness business, there is a lot of work but customers to do.
So Prestige Labs was my second big company which actually really a sister company to Jim watch.
So when I said 250 Enterprise Value, that was both of them together but Prestige Labs contributed about half or a little bit more than half of the revenue but less than half of the profit.
18:54
So is this is a less profitable business that had more Revenue because it was e-commerce direct to Consumer.
The difference between there is that we basically just monetized our base of gym owners through another stream.
And so, the reason I wanted to start the business was I To have more recurring revenue and so rather than seeing an end consumer, who buys a supplement as the person who's recurring, I saw the gym owner as the recurring Revenue customer.
19:15
So I knew that every month they're going to sell 10 to 20 new members and if I could get them to sell 10 of them supplements, a 200 dollar average price point, then I add another two thousand, dollars a month per Jim per month, even if the people change their going to be responsible to thousand dollars a month, and one of my big things with compounding is that you either have to sell something that people never stop buying or used to get people who never stop selling.
19:36
Saying like there's are the only two things and so when you bring in an affiliate base and you get them to consistently sell for you, even if the end consumers change all the time, you can count on the fact that if you get 10 Affiliates this month and 10, if it's next month, then all 20 of them are now going to sell two thousand dollars a month Etc.
And so we built the entire business off of an affiliate base that we acquired through Jim launch and so like the first month of being fully operational than 1.7 million and the next month did 1.5 million, you know, I mean and so mind you the first month of January which I planned and so I was going to be a little bit higher but that was kind of the idea that Civilized around there and so that business, you know, cost of goods is low but the affiliate payouts are significant and sourcing is an issue.
20:14
There's just completely different problems that present itself in a physical product business.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
20:33
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
So I would recruit a gym owner and I would say hey we're teaching on this marketing and sales stuff over here.
20:53
I can show you how to get your marketing for free.
So normally I was teaching how they could sell services for higher tickets and having more upfront cash at the liquid acquisition costs.
Like, but if you just saw every person supplements, it will cover the cost to acquire a customer, just from the physical products.
In the beautiful thing with selling physical products is that there's no added fulfillment.
21:11
So in a Services business, you know, one of the problems is the more you sell, the more you have to deliver, right?
And so it's kind of this double-edged I'd wear the moment you swipe the credit card you're like oh shit now have to deliver on this, right?
And so with physical products, they didn't have to do anything.
They literally just swipe the credit card and then we meant centrally we would ship it directly the consumer and because I built it.
21:30
So this is the unique value prop.
I had is that it was built for gym owners by a gym owner.
And so, all the things that I hated about dealing with supplement businesses before that right there, had to front them cash for inventory.
They only had a couple of Brands, think I could pick from the margins were lower.
I have to compete with the vitamin shop down the street after I sold someone like, Son.
21:48
Then they go to BSN and say five bucks, or they go to Amazon who basically got every sale after that, I was like this sucks.
So I wanted to create a brand that only gym owner sold.
So no one else could sell it.
We priced it on our home site higher than they would price it.
So if someone wanted to price-match they'd be like oh shit, this is just and we priced at 30 percent higher on the main site.
22:08
So there were significant savings on top of that.
We gave them a very good selling system because I learned you know, a lot about selling supplements because it was a big percentage of my profit within my brick and Our facilities.
And so, once we basically connected, the dots were the last piece that I added to make it even more friendly to gym owners.
22:24
I made it a recurring subscription.
So now they got to have to recurring subscriptions per customer.
And so if someone's coming in and they're bought in on having some sort of transformation because the gyms that we worked with were more like weight loss training specific, they weren't like big facility.
Lisa Jim, now we do both but at the time it was just those ones.
22:40
If people are brought in on a transformation they're going to want to pay both for the services and for the products.
And they will also take the recommendation from the Person who sold them the services.
So, rather than send them down the street to Vitamin Shoppe, which is what 90% of gemsto, like, I'll tell you the moment that it became real.
For me.
I didn't want to sell supplements for a very long time because I was like, supplements, you just need to eat eat right and work out and then this woman wouldn't leave my office.
23:04
He's like my friend says, I need supplements, you have to tell me.
I was like, fine, so I wrote her list of the go, get the stuff go away.
She came back the next day with the things and she was like, I just want to make sure I got the right stuff and I saw the receipt at $700 in the receipt.
And the thing that I had Slaughter was 400 bucks X.
And I was like this motherfucker across the street just made $700 and I had to our muscle this bitch for an hour to get her to say, yes to sign up for my fitness program.
23:25
And I was like, fuck that.
And so I was like, I'm gonna sell supplements.
And so that's when I started selling products my own and that, that was kind of how I got into this element you.
So I picked the first 10 customers farmer distribution based already.
So there's obviously going to be gyms or customers that are that are better than other ones.
23:40
And I wanted to work with again, a representative sample of, you know, some bad ones, some middle ones, some good ones.
And present them a training on how to sell supplements and then the way to do it.
And so I rolled out 10 locations, I think in the next month I rolled out like 20 or 30 next month, the rolled out another 20 or 30 and then we did the big launch to everyone kind of the 90 days leading up to the big launch and we were able to get a lot of The Kinks out just like small things in terms of how the shopping carts worked, how is attributed?
24:06
Like we added in a thing.
So trainers can get commissions.
Like there's lots of little things that we do that.
We're Jim specific that no other supplement company could do which is given us a nice mote in that space.
So cost me four million bucks to start Prestige Labs, about a million of that went to the tech.
So we created our an entire point of sale for supplements that was specifically made for Jim.
24:25
So every Jim would get a retail kit so they have a full wall of products.
They would have a kiosk, which is like kind of like a stand with a, like an iPad type thing on it that would already be pre-loaded to their gym specific page.
So they would get, you know, a the sale would be attributed to them and then they could run that transaction.
24:43
And also track it down to the The trainer level, and then automate payouts, across hundreds of people, and this is my new like Shopify, didn't really exist that.
So, like, we had to build this whole thing and to build, like a Shopify from like the ground up and it cost us about a million bucks.
And then it also had to like manage inventory, like, you know, how to do all these things and then the other three ish million went into just product, the biggest difficulties with it.
25:05
I mean, Tech was always a problem with the business because we started writing Shopify was there and it wasn't good enough yet like Shopify was around, but it just wasn't good enough to do a lot of our use cases, which made it unique for Our specific business.
So that was always tough.
There's always bugs and things like that, that way to fix second supply chain.
25:20
So, like, if you run out of one ingredient on one product, like you can't sell the product that's tough.
There are also legal firms, that will buy all your products and try and test find something that's off or underrepresented or whatever.
That's just like a pain.
You know, we've had multiple people claim like name infringement, things like that like they had half of their name is in our name.
25:41
We don't even know this company exists and so they just there's predatory law firms that That was soon.
As you have a patent, they'll just try and find people to Sue and I'll just like basically rev-share on the amount of money.
They can get terrible way to live life but people do it, that's always an issue and then I would say the two biggest problems with the business overall is that the end consumer is just not sticky and that's just because people don't stick with Fitness stuff in general for a long time.
26:02
And I think that's one of the things that like, I just kind of hate just in general.
Like, I hate products for people, I hate having to resell people, like, I don't like that consuming my stuff.
Like, I've every business, I started consistently gets more and more compounding.
There's more competition.
Happens every business.
The other issue was my problem, which is that I always focus on how much money they were going to make.
26:22
And I tried to do that for like, five years and I was able to brute force my way to keeping that company at, you know, whenever 20-ish million a year, but it was actually talking to any Force Ella from first form.
He was talking to me about this and he said, he has big transition when you switch from talking about sales, and the hand-to-hand combat and how to present things and all that stuff, too.
26:42
Just like he said, he switched from head to heart and he's And you talked about like, when you were first getting into fitness, you bought supplements, this marked, a new identity should for you.
Like you should want to do that for the customers and the people who follow you, and I did not have that language.
And so I've already told those guys and they're trying to implement that now in the language because everything I had was what I cared about which was like, how do I make more profit in my business?
27:03
How do I look what it cost of acquisition?
But many people who aren't fit us on surprisingly, get into fitness because actually want to help people.
Not that I didn't want help people.
I just also wanted to make a profit and that was a priority for me.
But I should have talked more about that than And anything else.
The biggest lesson I have for you guys, mostly nation is around Prestige Labs is that I probably shouldn't have done it.
27:23
That's the real row.
It is a business, it is a good business, but I think that if I had allocated more time to just making Jim launch better gym, which would have been bigger, and because Jim won't stop growing the year I launched with these labs.
And I don't think it had to stop growing.
27:38
I think I was split and I also at that time didn't understand how to recruit Talent the same way.
And so, I just became CEO two companies rather than CEO of one.
And so, that was, that was the big mistake.
Now, maybe I could have done procedure Labs, like today, but at the time, I didn't have the skill set and I didn't have the ability to recruit the way we do know.
27:57
So third business, I started the hit figures was use Allen.com still around today, doing great news.
Alan was one of the first companies to use machine learning in chat interactions.
And so, I first started it to solve the problem for gym owners because one of the biggest constraints that people don't work.
28:13
There leads, amazing.
I know.
But the average gym was getting nine percent of leads in the door.
When they had to work to manually, we were able to get just under 20% of leads in the door without them doing anything and the average front desk person costs, 2000 plus a month, and we could do it for a fraction of that.
28:30
And so, one of the things I did, which I thought was pretty genius.
Was, I'd ran a pricing survey to our customers and I said, hey, if you could get this outcome, what would you pay per month for a software that would do that?
And The Sweet Spot was like three hundred to four hundred dollars a month.
Is what they'd be.
Let's go.
28:45
I like the sweet spot in terms of demand and pricing power.
So then I had sent a second survey that had the exact same use case exact same outcomes.
And I said, if you had to pay her person who walked in the door, what would you be willing to pay?
If you reverse the math, it was four times the price.
And so that was a huge breakthrough in pricing.
29:03
Is that how I positioned it rather than making a recurring subscription.
But paper usage became quarter the model.
And so because they are small business owners, they don't like recurring fees, and this was something that we learned about our Avatar.
They prefer to have something based on usage, even if it was Pensive because it's lower risk.
At least perceived risk.
29:18
And so that was a big pricing thing that we figured out sold, the first, can customers of Allen by going to our distribution base and saying, hey, do you want to try to stay and so, we sold customers in a rolled out the exact same way I rolled out Prestige Labs.
But what was interesting is that we very quickly realized that we couldn't expand outside of our distribution base and so then I had really good results for that specific Avatar but like it's still such a very narrow niche.
29:43
In terms of who we could use in the price per It was significantly lower than what I could charge for other thing.
So, like, Revenue was low ish relatively, then the Breakthrough was that I realized that we needed to get agencies on board, rather than getting small businesses on board because they'd be like, great, I can work my leads, how do I get leads?
29:59
And they're like, ah shit.
They don't how to get leads.
And so we went to the people that we knew we're getting them leads, which is agencies.
So then we started selling agencies, which had another degree of Leverage, because if you saw an agency, they could have 50 small business owners or any of them.
And so we had to reconfigure the software so that it was actually made for agency owners.
30:15
It was made agnostic to Industry, so it could select the industry and we learn how to White Label.
It that was a huge advancement as soon as we did that.
That was kind of the unlock and then I did two webinars with people who had big agency audiences.
So now you go up another level so I could make one pitch, get 100 agencies.
30:33
Each agency might have 10 small businesses and in one pitch, get 1000 customers.
That was when this thing really took off, I did two pitches.
And within six months we were doing 1.7.
Also ironically IE per month through the software company, I develop software for Prestige Labs.
30:49
I use the exact same development shop to make the software for Alan.
I regret that I should have just brought it in house and had a CTO.
You need someone who has skin in the game otherwise.
So this is for all entrepreneurs.
I don't think development shops.
Honestly, I think they're they're about as close to a complete scam.
31:07
As you can come, too.
Like, I just because if you really going to build a software company to build a software company, Like, that's it.
Like you need to build software company.
It's like having a marketing agency and having a white labeled marketing agency, doing all your delivery.
It doesn't make any sense like that is the business.
31:22
You need to know how to do the business.
And I made that mistake twice the first one less.
So because it was just like a core helping component with receives loud, but it was the core thing that we were delivering here and so that was a mistake.
But it cost me about two ish million, I want to say and then it's still stayed at like a few hundred thousand dollars every month and development costs.
31:43
And so, I figured if I were able to aggregate all of the data from every single type of small business, all scheduling brick-and-mortar in person appointments, I'd be able to predictively show, what days of the week, what times of day, what kind of follow-up sequences got the most amount of people shop.
31:59
And since we were compensated on percentage of people that showed up, we were highly incentivized to solve that problem.
And I learned a ton about how to get the most throughput for leads from that business.
And I've used that in every one of the portfolio companies we have and you can usually Ali, add twenty Thirty forty percent to the throughput on ads, simply by adjusting how you your scheduling process.
32:19
The agencies will come on.
They would pay, I think there's like 20 grand to license the whole thing and like white label it because it would create a ton of value for them and they were able to switch their business models from a recurring Revenue model to a paper show model as well.
And so they were able to charge significantly closer the transaction.
32:35
So the closer you can charge the transaction, then the higher percentage of the transaction you can charge.
The sales process, is simply say how much do you make per customer?
The most you.
Get someone in the door and they would give you that price and then you could just charge a percentage of that rather than saying you know pay me two thousand dollars a month and I'll run your Facebook ads and whether the person makes 50 Grand or five dollars you still get two thousand dollars this way.
32:54
You got a line with the winds and what happens is the few customers that are really Big Spenders and to becoming kind of almost like Partners which aligns even further it aligns the economic model from the top down, Alan was a company that worked with agency owners.
We first started working with small business owners, as Jim's realize that they Didn't get leads for themselves, even though we solve that problem.
33:14
And then we had to realize we had to go to marketing agencies that were Legion based because they would solve that problem.
Then we white labeled it to that they could use it as their own company and then switch their model from recurring Revenue model to a paper show model, that allowed them to make more money, and it was also an easier sale.
So they could charge some 15-thousand dollars one-time for a setup fee.
33:32
And then only on if somebody showed up after that, which is a much easier sale for a small business owner to swallow rather than a thousand dollars a month until you die.
And so a lot of people like that because then if they turn ads off or they turned On it was variable.
How is the business that I probably learned the most lessons from?
33:47
I ended up selling that business as well. 75% of it to strategic buyer.
Who's still running it and doing a good job with it.
And hopefully they'll have a big exit in a few years and that was an all-stock deal.
So under NDA and can't tell you but I can tell you, we did 12 million in the trailing 12 months before the sale.
So you can do your own math.
That being said, lesson one, is that you need to have an in-house CTO of.
34:05
You're going to get into software and ideally somebody who I think should have equity in the business, because they should be bested, like this should be like, this is a long as you do.
A partner who's going to be running this with you if you're not a tech guy.
Number two is that you want to run pricing surveys early because we unlocked four times the pricing Power by simply repackaging, how we charged.
34:22
So exploring different ways to charge based on usage, based recurring, fees based on different, you know, kpis, this is especially true of software because there's so many different ways you can charge compared to maybe traditional service.
The third thing is having a line incentives with your customers.
Often just makes you more money and so that business had a tremendous amount of scale, because we had so much, Moment, with every single stakeholder, the small business owner, want people to show up the agency owner wanted people to shop and we got paid based on shop.
34:48
So, everybody was align top down to make things happen.
The fourth thing that we learned this is more tactical.
Is that throughput on appointments?
When you're scheduling for sales calls, or in person appointments the amount of days per week that you are open the hours that you are open and the increments of time matter a lot like Fifty to two hundred percent.
35:12
Lat and one of the biggest issues we ran into is that people would be like Mark and his work for me and they had one time slot for an hour per week that they were willing to take new customers on.
That's just stupid.
And so there's no other way to say it.
People complain about being poor and I'm like, well, you do poor things, so stop doing that.
35:28
But the people who made the most money for the most part of the ones who gave the most availability, get the most flexibility.
Their customers were open the most days and they unsurprisingly got more people schedule and show up.
And so that was a huge breakthrough and then trying to set expectations there with customers that they should do that.
In order to maximize the return.
35:43
Not all of them.
Did it.
In fact, many of them didn't because there's a reason small business owner stays small, they make small business owner decisions, so acquisition not calm.
This is the fourth business that we're now, you know, obviously crossing a figures with I wanted to have a compounding vehicle that I could do for the rest of my life.
35:59
I wanted to be able to be involved in different Industries so that I wouldn't get bored.
Basically, I started with the question.
What could I do for ever?
And then work backwards from there?
Because I knew if I could do something forever, then it would get very big and so that was really I was solving for and so then I just had requirements for that business model.
36:14
So it's like there has to have a lot of Leverage.
I need to have a capital compounding vehicle.
One of the things that I didn't have in the other businesses or at least I didn't realize that in the other businesses, is that I didn't have a way to reinvest Capital to further spur growth, which I do have in this business.
I started acquisition.com by hiring the top down, so every other business I've had, I hired from the bottom up, this one I went from top down and I will always do that from here on out.
36:36
You can really only do that if you're well capitalized, meaning you have money to spend on people before they can pay for them.
Themselves.
That's why Venture people raise money because you can get more Talent before the business can really afford the talent.
I can afford the town, which ultimately makes you grow faster because you have better people sooner, and you also don't have to go back because I think of the day every business incurs debt.
36:57
So it's just what kind of debt.
So are you, in Current financial debt, are you encouraging management debt, are you encouraging cultural debt?
Are you encouraging technical debt?
Like, there's always different types of debt, you're incurring in.
The question is, which one do you want to pick?
And have to pay down later.
And so, for us, I be Bank was willing to pay down financial debt to not have to pay any of the other debt down in the future because ultimately on a longer time Horizon, we'd move faster.
37:20
So the first 10 Investments that we found all came from content.
So it's just people that we, I mean, some people I knew from, you know, beforehand and I would say that the relationship had shifted more and more to it like basically an advisory role.
Anyways, and I was like, hey, I think we probably just formalize this and so that was probably the first few.
37:35
And then from there, the rest of it has been people who read the book who watch videos, you listen to podcasts, who come in, who already are aligned with our Values, they have a business that has some level of compounding in it.
There, you know, doing five million or more, will always look.
Anything is three or more, but most of the businesses are over five.
The average business right now is doing 17 million in the portfolio.
37:53
So, that's kind of the range there.
So Acquisitions, not comments the first business, that was really like built on a personal brand and inbound with content.
So that's been like the biggest change compared to the other businesses.
There's pros and cons to it.
Like we can attract more Talent than we otherwise could we get?
We get better people, I mean their Partners so you're dealing with a more sophisticated person in General.
38:12
So that's a little bit different.
It's a slower business overall.
Like if you are used to doing a transactional business where you're doing, you know, multiple sales a day type thing, going into a business model where you have one every month is dairy different and there's a lot of conversations that happen that don't amount to anything.
38:27
That's kind of that's a very different thing that you have to get used to.
There's more conversations, it takes longer there's legal involved in these, you know deals.
So there's just more of that which is different than all of the other business models we have The thing that excites me most about acquisition not calm is the, well, it's things that I learned.
38:46
Like I love learning every day and then I get to learn something from one company, and help another company use that learning.
And so, I learn more now than I ever have because I'm exposed to more businesses at a higher level.
And so, I believe that the purpose of life is to learn that is my purpose of life.
39:02
And so, if that is my purpose, then enabling myself to learn in as many ways as humanly possible maximizes that.
So, like, I write books because I want to learn about the Amount of writing about we co-own all these businesses because I want to learn how solar sails work.
I want to learn how mortgage sales work, I think that's interesting.
39:19
You know like those are all just very interesting things and so I end up getting a really diverse background of experience like knowing a lot about.
A lot of things allows you to cross-pollinate ideas.
That worked well in one industry and then apply them to another one and then get out sighs returns.
And the last big lesson I have remark was not calm, was as we saw how quickly and how easily acquisition not come grew.
39:40
The Part of that was because we hired from the top down.
And so there was so much that we could automatically delegate to people who are better than us at their respective, things, not as good as but better than us who are teaching us about these things, teaching us about personal brand, teaching us about making content teaching us about how to set up, you know, HR and recruiting teams, that was a huge breakthrough for why this did well.
40:02
And the other thing is that we have made recruiting Talent, probably the single core competency of the business in terms of how we get better returns.
So Mostly company that we're bringing on like I said, they're, you know, most of them doing 5 million, 10 million, whatever or higher than that if the biggest companies, you know, was basically over 100, so big difference there but the entrepreneur needs more talent and we have the ability to recruit Talent better than most people, because one we have so much inbound that comes into we as a private Equity Firm have more Prestige than most of the companies that are in our portfolio because we are bigger and we are more sophisticated.
40:38
And so we can recruit and people To a private Equity, Firm who is portfolio companies, more than they respond to Joe's dry cleaning, right?
And so we can get better Talent than they can get on their own.
And then once we put the person in their role, we have somebody at hold Co who will help train them on our way of doing business, so they get it right the first time.
40:57
So you get the right person in the right seat, doing the right Playbook on the first shot.
And so, what you do, is you massively pay down the ignorant step that it's what causes most companies to slow down.
And so, it happens is they just have a really nice trajectory and keep going because they're just not fucking up.
Up.
So when your hair from the top down, it's every Department of the business.
41:13
So, you director of sales, director of marketing, director of people, director of IT, director of, you know, portfolio operations, you know, for us, we have our CFO like, these are all different roles that correspond to different components, the business director of Business Development.
These are all like, you just think about the pipeline of the business, like, you have to get somebody who gets the inquiries.
41:28
You got to get somebody who closes steals, you have to get somebody who you know, papers the stuff with law and finance and then you have to have people who can translate those skills into the portfolio company.
So a portfolio company when they are.
Integers are getting stuck or their directors still getting stuck.
They talk to our director of sales, who implants The Playbook into their, into their business.
41:47
They're getting stuck on marketing or marketing.
Goes in to help them out.
If they're getting stuck on HR our recruiting team recruits for their leadership so we can help them with the job descriptions.
We already have how to post it.
We know what the follow-up sequences are and we can do for higher level will actually take the well, if it's the highest, if it's sea level and up, will do the whole thing and end because we want to have a big say in the talent that's going to grow.
42:08
This company, we want to make sure they're aligned with our Asian for other companies going to grow.
Because a lot of times, if you don't know what you're looking for, which is with the most entrepreneurs, are at this level, they've never done it before they pick wrong.
And sometimes it takes 6 to 12 months, to reverse that error and a 6 to 12 months of growth to keep basically having to push off until they find the right person.
42:25
So we get the right person, right?
See the company goes on its own.








0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I want to talk to you about how I made my first.
Nine dollars in profit.
Mind you the reason I'm so big on profit rather than revenue is that at that point I had already made, you know, I was already making a couple million dollars a year between all the different things that I was doing.
But I was taking home, basically, nothing because I was so smart, then I wasn't paying attention to profit, I was just looking at Revenue, trying to beat myself up and feel status rather than thinking about what I was actually taking home, and I told you in a different video, how I got in a head-on collision in a DUI at 60 miles an hour on the highway and walked away from it.
0:59
And now, Kind of the the Catalyst that ended up changing my life in a lot of ways, mostly because I decided to confront decisions that I'd been putting off and make hard calls that I didn't want to make to force myself to focus on one thing.
And so what I want to do in this video is talk to you about the result of that decision and what kind of happened and transpired in the next six to 12 months, which is anything anything, But A Cinderella Story, I made the calls.
1:23
I went all in on Jim launch ice.
I basically fire sold my other businesses and just as a quick tangent on that.
Like a lot of times, I think, the great thing that we have is sitting right in front of us, after we, let go of the things that are holding us down.
I'm a big believer in the theory of constraint which is, you know, a system will grow to up to.
1:41
It's basically as bottleneck, right?
And then until you relieved that like, systems will grow as long as they're not constrained.
And so most of us are constrained in many ways and we just do not recognize them, which is why we have things called limiting beliefs, it is a constraint, right?
And for me in a very real way.
I constraints in terms of all the different things that I was allocating my attention to, I had, you know, I think literally like, Or ten business businesses.
2:01
I'll use quotes here that I was trying to run at the same time and I was spread so thin that I could barely allocate anything.
And I was working every hour of the day and I was taking half a bottle of Johnnie Walker at night, so I just go to sleep.
And so, anyways, I got in a head-on collision II.
Decided to make the next, the next move, which was going all-in on Jim launch.
2:17
And this is the beginning of yet another hard road ahead.
And so at this time, for those of you don't know, I started flying around and doing done for you.
Jim launches.
And so what that was was basically Layla and I would go Go and do a gym turn around.
I didn't like to use that word because I didn't think gym owners liked it.
2:33
I was originally going to call Jim rescue, but no one wants to be rescued.
So I call it Jim launch and everyone was okay with that name.
We would fly out to Brick and Mortar facilities.
We'd sit at the front desk.
I would spend my own money on on everything.
So, their offer was pretty simple.
I said I would feel your gym in 30 days for free.
That was the offer.
2:50
I was like, I'll spend my own money on the ads.
I'll spend my own money on the hotel's, the food, the everything, and the deal is, I just get to keep The Upfront cash that I collect and that everything afterwards.
That's Value.
You get to keep it was a pretty compelling offer, right?
They didn't have to do anything, right?
They would just say yes.
And then I would show up.
I think I'd ask for $500, a reserve the day just to make sure that they wouldn't like not be there but I made it a refundable deposit.
3:12
But anyways, I would fly out and we would spend all the money in marketing and we would sell an average when Layla, and I would go with.
So on average, about 200 people in 21 days.
So we average about 10 sales a day, and then we would take, you know, then we'd fly to the next one.
This is kind of what we had been doing in 2016 and I was doing this while also having 16 gyms and two agencies and and and all these other things that we're going on and I was spread wildly too thin.
3:37
And that's when I got in the DUI and then decided to end everything except for Jim launch, we ended up basically, I had to shut, I had this, I sold five of the six Jim's.
I shut down the two agencies and then I had one.
Jim that was left over.
And I put the money from the sale of those other businesses, which is not a lot.
3:54
And to kind of the last facility, the, the partner that I had at that facility ended up feeling like I had been taking distributions somehow from the business, which I had it, and then he took what he believed was rifle compensation for him.
Not being involved in that gym.
4:11
Anyways, basically took the rest of the money out of the account.
And so I basically was left with nothing.
So, I was truly at this, this but, you know, Rock Bottom moment of just gotten a DUI, I just got rid of all my gyms.
I put all the money from those gyms into this last facility that money got taken.
4:28
And I then decided to close that one Jim down and then when I did that I couldn't sell anymore at that facility to generate cash flows.
I wanted to close it down.
I didn't want to be involved in that gym anymore and so I basically stomached rent and pay roll out of there with no new cash flow coming in.
4:47
And I watched my bank account basically go from some money to no money and so at the end of that, we shut the gym down, I got tons of refunds and things like that.
That ended up happening.
Earning afterwards, because people are weird when you, when you shut up business down.
5:02
So, heads up and so we just kept, but the coach that I had at the time was just, like, just write the checks do right by everyone and you'll be able to, you know, escape this thing, unscathed emotionally and more or less.
I did.
I was able like that was some of the best advice I ever got.
Like, I just didn't try and pursue anything with the partner.
5:19
I just wrote the checks for all the the customers who even if, even if we had fulfilled the services which I just wrote the checks and I actually didn't Lela Rose.
Checks because I was I was so like destroyed by this entire decision, you know, process.
But anyways I was completely you know, clean slate.
5:35
At that point I think all in all I had 23,000 dollars left over at that point and so after after selling six passes, at all the stuff, I'd like nothing left.
And this was hard for me because I just spent four years building, you know, six facilities and all that stuff.
And I almost had nothing to show for it and that was one of the biggest lessons that I've had is that like you have all the skills and experiences and character traits they developed to show for it like, The entrepreneurial journey is one that improves you not anything else.
6:01
And so that's why I'm such a big believer in that stuff because like I had these things, these assets that I did not value and was crazy.
Is that in the next, you know, 30 days or so we did a hundred something thousand in sales and so I was like, oh wow, we can do this.
And so anywho actually, I think when it up happening is, I had almost no money and then we did a launch.
6:22
And then I, after all the costs and everything, I think I had 20 something thousand in money for me.
Next month later, when I said we were just focusing purely on this business.
She told all of her friends from high school to quit their jobs, right?
So she had six friends from high school that all were doing, MLM, shake mix stuff and she said, hey, you know, you should quit that and start selling this stuff.
6:44
We can make a hundred bucks a pop.
Instead of, you know, making $5 on shake mix, and they were all like, awesomest do it in between month between.
I think it's like November ish going into January, which is when we wanted to slate the six gyms that were going to launch at the same time, which of course, makes sense, right?
Why go from one 22 when you go from one to six because it's a brilliant idea of Alex's, right?
7:02
And so we had one month in between where I was going to go launch a gym with Leila.
We were going to do like a hundred grand Ash, and then I was going to be able to I was kind of going to be the restart money, right?
So here's what happens next.
I get a text from a guy.
He's like, hey my brother lives in the same city as where you're starting your new gym and I was like are not started doing a launch.
7:21
I was like okay he's like a he's a Salesman, he really needs a job.
He's got, he's got a baby and he's got another one on the way and it might Good fit.
And so, anyways, I knew I needed to take a month to kind of put all the resources together to start doing the launches at six at a time and training that those sales guys, everything.
7:37
So I was like, okay, that might work because I don't have to spend all day selling and so, anyways, I trained him and he crushed it and the next 30 days he did, I think 120,000 in sales in December, which is like a hard month to do it and be it was a great first, you know, launch for somebody who's new, which also kind of prove the model to me because I had done it.
7:55
Layla done it.
We never had someone else who wasn't like Super tied to me doing it.
Obviously Layla was more invested than just, you know, just an employee right at the time and so it was awesome.
So I was like super excited.
I was like sick.
This hundred grand is going to be the launch money for the next thing, this will be great.
And so at this point Layla says this guy's a winner, I'm gonna take him home to meet my family, which is hilarious, because I was not a winner at that time.
8:20
And so, anyways, I'm at her at her family's house Christmas Eve and we had been selling for three weeks at this point.
So we had you know 70 80 thousand in sales at this point and what was weird was I was running all the money through just my gym processor because I still, you know, maintain the processing like my POS and and so anyways, I always got deposits on Tuesdays and I was like, huh?
8:42
This is weird.
We haven't gotten a positive since like I didn't get a positive last Tuesday and I was like okay that's odd and I called them and I like hey, you know, I gave it like three or four days because I was like, you know, maybe it's delayed or something and it had been a holiday because In the holiday season, whatever.
And so the deposit supposed to hit it doesn't I wait some days.
8:59
Keep checking, doesn't hit, I call them.
They say, hey, you're in an annual review standard nothing to worry about.
And I was like, that's weird.
I've been with you guys for five years.
I've never had an annual review, interesting?
And then waited a couple days called again, was I came in, like we're really going to need these funds.
Like, I need you to deposit these and they're like, yeah, it's we're just working through some final things, blah blah blah.
9:21
All right.
And so Christmas Eve, I call them and we're supposed to launch six.
Jim starting on the 26th.
So, two days later.
I called the guys up and I was like, I'm not getting off the phone until you send me the money.
Like I'm not like I need, there's 100 Grand that's sitting there.
Like, I need that money.
9:36
The guy was like, sorry, you know, we're seeing some regular activity in your account in this is because we had written all these refund checks for for clients when I was closing down the gym that the last gym that I had.
So there's been some regular activity.
This isn't the way that you know, you're not you seems like you have Your business.
9:54
Now that's not what this is intended for.
This is supposed to be for a single brick and mortar location.
So we're going to hold on to all the funds for six months and I lost I lost it.
And for those who don't know me when I lose it, I don't actually get like explosive.
I just get incredibly cold and very mean.
10:09
And so I probably said some of the meanest thing like I didn't cause I was just like I destroyed the person's character that I was talking to on the phone, like that person questions like why they were alive.
And so anyways, I got off the phone and Layla and I parents are supposed to go to the These because it's Christmas Eve and her dad was like, you know, he seems a little stressed.
10:31
She's like is he always this way?
And and of course I was a little bit stressed at that time and so here's what was crazy is that, as we're going to the movie theaters I'm just like completely numb.
I just was like, I feel dead on the inside and so we go to the theaters, the movies playing in front of me, I'm not even watching the movie Layla, hold my hand and she's like, what's going on?
10:50
I was like, I'll tell you later.
She takes my pulse.
My resting pulse is like 120 in a dark movie theater at age 27.
I was stressed out of my mind and so we left the movies and I told her, I was like, the money's not coming and she was like, what do you mean?
11:06
I was like, they're keeping it.
She's like, can they do that?
It's like, apparently.
Like this is the first time.
I've even known this.
That a processor can hold money.
And so, anyways, I got home, I still owed the salesman from the last month, who'd done that huge launch.
Like this, this all these sales had happened.
Somebody had sold them, right, but I didn't collect the money from it.
11:23
It.
And so I owed a 22,000 or commission check and I had 23,000 dollars left and it was on money that I never received.
And so in congruence with the the lesson that I learned from, you know, the clean exit of all these other things which is like just do right by everyone.
And then you won't have any emotional scars that you carry with you.
11:41
And so, I wrote the check, actually, I wired it for twenty two thousand and ninety thousand dollars left.
And that's when we got home and I told Layla, you know, everything that I had done.
I was like, I have a I was always left and we were supposed to launch.
It told her six friends to quit their jobs, and we're going to start launching Jim's.
12:00
Two days later on the 26th.
And I was like, I have a thousand dollars and I have a credit card that has a hundred thousand dollar limit.
I was like, I will do this.
I was like, but this could go horribly wrong so you don't have to stay with me if you don't want to and that was like, this was the moment for me that I did.
12:17
I knew I was going to marry Layla and she said I would sleep with you under bridge if it came to that she's like we'll get the right and that Is what I just like I wanted to like, you know, I would, I would have been teary but I was so emotionally numb at this point that I just wanted to just like, keep moving forward and keep keep keep getting through it.
12:34
And so anyways, 48 hours later, I make all the ads, I set up all the campaigns, all the funnels, all the everything's.
And I remember turning the campaign's on for all the six locations that we're going to do is like, often often, often often on.
And I remember, I was sweating.
12:50
I was literally sweating when this was happening because I just felt Judge Dredd.
I was like, this could literally just ruin me I like right now.
I have no money but I've never, I'm not in debt and I'm going to be going in debt at 80 rate of thirty three hundred dollars per day of money that I do not have.
And so, anyways, I turned it on and the six guys were at the locations.
13:09
I was and it was $300 a day because I was paying for a hotel, are fair food car ad spend and commissions every single day for six guys.
And I had remember, I had a thousand dollars, right?
And so is all coming out of a credit card.
In the next 30 days and we ended up getting canceled by the processor, right?
13:28
I told you, this is the beginning, the story.
So I started all this and I had no way to process money.
So these guys are getting leads, they're making calls, they're closing deals and I can't process the money.
All right.
And so, so we're sitting there, right?
And, and, and these contracts are just coming in, right?
13:46
And we had him scan them.
So we this mobile app and we have this Central Dropbox, which, of course, is not PCI Compliant.
I had no idea what PCI compliance was Yes.
And so we had this one lady that we used to work.
If I did that, I was paying part.
Time to process this mind you.
I didn't understand what like, how much work this was because we were doing like 50 sales, a day, right between these locations at like 500 bucks, a pop.
14:09
And I was paying someone for part-time.
Four hours, a day of contract work, which was just insane.
It was like, it was probably two peoples worth of work.
And I was paying somebody part time.
It ended up that ended up blowing up because she couldn't do that and her full-time job.
So, and, and we You have a way to process the money anyways, right?
14:26
And so, anyways we're I'm calling everybody I know to try and figure.
I was like hey can you process this?
And then you can keep 10% and just send me the rest of the money and people were like, I don't know, man.
Like I don't know if I want to do that and so no one would process the money for me.
And so I called, you know, every person I knew and then I finally got in touch with a guy named Alex Roy, at the time who specialized in like high risk processing, which is basically the category I was in at that time and he said I can get you set up and I was like okay cool he said but Even the record that you have right now because you just refunded all those all those people at the last location.
14:57
He's like they're going to want a reserve which means they keep a certain percentage no matter what and they're going to put a limit on how much you can you can you can charge.
I was like okay cool.
He said we'll give you a 50 thousand dollar limit and I was like, dude, I need like four times that, and he was like, sorry, man.
That's what I can get you.
And so the last week of January, all right, so we're doing you know, we're doing five six, you know, thousand a day in sales may be more than that.
15:22
And I had no way of processing it, right?
And then the last week I get this processor for fifty thousand dollars and I run I run 50,000 dollars in a day, right?
And he's like, okay here's the good news.
Is that it's per month so it was the end of.
He's like, so this we can do 50 in the next week you can do 50 and then I'll see if I can get more lined up.
15:39
More processors at 50k to allow you to start processing for them and I was like, okay fine.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more Or graphs drawn out stuff.
15:54
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, So next week we do 50 on the same processor and then we set up another one, and another one and another one and I was able to like catch this this falling plane as it's going and we ended up somehow I think we ended up processing. 100 Grand actually.
16:19
That first one, I think you got two people.
He got somebody like the last day of the month and I process, another hundred.
So another 50 to get 100 for the first month and the next month I had three processors.
So I was able to process 150 and things actually started working out, right?
So I So we did a hundred thousand which basically just covered my credit card bill, which is doing 3,300 a day, right?
16:39
So I just boom.
I'm back to zero again, but at least I like had a way of getting out of this thing, right?
So the next month I think we did 150 or 180, I have the chart in my book.
Hundred-dollar offers, I can't remember.
It was, but it was somewhere in there.
And so a process that February and we actually had a profit that months, I was like holy cow.
16:57
Like we I think we made like 30 or 40 Grand and I was like, oh my God.
I think we might we might get out of this right?
But wait, there's Or there's more to the story, it gets worse and so I think we're I think I'm in the home stretch, right?
And so then March rolls around, all right, so at this point people that we had sold in January, we were selling 6 week weight loss programs at local gyms all of a sudden, I see this massive hit on the bank account for 100 grand and I was like, whoa, what's going on?
17:26
What happened?
And it turned out that two of the facilities that we had launched in January.
And this is now, at the end of February, beginning of March, they told a number of their clients.
17:42
Hey, if you refund, you can just sign up through me and I'll do it for less.
And so, we had already paid for the airfare.
The flights hotels commission's ad spend for all these sales.
So you know, the margin on this was lowish, right?
I was probably running 20% more.
17:58
Engines and that hundred thousand completely wiped out.
All of the savings that I had over the net the last month or two, right?
And and it was actually more than I could even handle and so we had to sell more to cover the refunds and so this is where things got even more fun and I say that sarcastically.
18:18
So this is what happened.
Next February, we do more money, March, I know that we have to sell even more.
So I hired two more sales guy, we do eight launches that month and that's to cover the refunds.
Starting to come in, from January.
All right, you can probably see where this is going, the refund start getting worse.
18:34
There's more and more, and more.
It turns out after everything, 35% of all of our of all of our sales that we were making, we're getting refunded, which is an astronomical number that is hard to even comprehend, and it was because we had no control over the Fulfillment, right?
So we were selling and then other people were filling on contracts that we had sold.
18:51
And so, and there was a lot of, you know, hey just refund sign up through me.
Don't worry because we'd be gone right?
We were already we'd already left the location and these people were getting fulfilled on contracts and so we didn't have the relationship with the customer.
The business owner to.
And so it was a really dumb model from that perspective.
19:06
I learned right.
One of the lessons, I learned there was control the, like, you want to control everything end-to-end if you want a life lesson, and so, anyways, the next month were we have to sell more.
And so I think we did 280,000 next month and I was like, okay cool, but all of the access cache that came from that from like the prophet went into funding, these refunds from the month before.
19:27
And then It's just kept going up.
And so, I knew that in April, I was going to have to sell even more to cover the refunds from February March.
And I felt like I was in a death trap.
I was like, I don't know how to get out of this.
Like every month, I have to sell more to cover the refunds from the month before.
But then the cash from these things, I'm going to cover the next month and sell even more and honestly I had no idea what I was going to do.
19:47
And so all of a sudden Layla at this point because she still has one foot out the door a little bit because she was like I don't know about this guy.
And so this whole time she'd been living on like three thousand dollars a month that she was Getting from her like online coaching business associate transition to her personal training clients to online and she was doing like three grand a month from that.
20:04
And I was like, hey, why don't we take the middle man out of this, we know how to Market and sell weight loss.
Let's just sell it online, which, by the way, is a massive transition from doing brick and mortar.
But anyways, I was like, you know, I was in absolute desperation and so I wrote one of the best sales Pages my entire life.
Out of just sheer need, took me two days to write the sales, the sales letter, maybe three, and I didn't even like, get up from the computer.
20:24
I was just writing the sales letter and so, I started running traffic to it and we started doing a thousand bucks a day of just online.
So there was no Mark.
There was no, it was all margin.
Right - had spent and I was like, holy cow this could work, right?
And so we had eight sales guys and so I was like, okay, we can tell these guys, they don't have to sell Jim's anymore.
20:41
They can sell from home, they can see their wives and we can do eight thousand a day because if we're doing a thousand just just with her selling, we could do a 70 more guys and do 8,000, right?
And so I told the guys, the next month, the gyms that were lined up to launch the next month.
Hey, we're not going to we're not be doing this anymore.
Sorry, we're going to be going another Direction and they were Like hey man, like we need this and I was like sorry, man.
21:03
Like I'd it's just it's just I'm not doing that model anymore and they're like, what can you show us what you're doing?
Because like my friend told me that you signed up, like, 200 people at his gym and like three weeks and I was like nah man.
Sorry.
And there's like, do please?
Like and I was like, I'm not flying out there and I'm sorry I'm not doing it.
21:21
And so anyways, push comes to shove.
I was like fine, I'll show you how to do it.
I was like, but I'm not flying out there to save your ass.
You can't sell.
He's like, no, no.
That's fine.
It was like well how much to show me how to do it?
And at the time I picked what was the highest number?
I could possibly imagine in my head which was six thousand dollars and I said that because I didn't want them to say yes and because I didn't want to do it.
21:43
I just wanted to move on because I was.
So hopefully at this point, you see how dark NEOS card?
I was by the all of these experiences leading up to this and the guy said, okay.
And I looked at the phone and was like, you got to be kidding I was like holy crap and so it was six thousand dollars and then I had seven more guys that I was supposed to call, you know, to tell them that I was going to do their launch the next month.
22:05
And so the next conversation I had, I was like well shoot if I'm going to do it, I guess, I guess I have to make it now that I sold one of them, this whole program.
Next guy, same conversation with the same way and I was like well how much I was like eight grand.
He was like, okay and I was like holy cow and then every single one after that said yes and ended up doing 60 thousand dollars in sales in a day.
22:26
And I looked at Leyland, I was like we might be able to get out of this and at that time as much as people talk about the Romantic like vision and strategy and and impact and saving lives and all the stuff like it wasn't any of that.
I was just trying to be able to not be in debt and pay the pay the bills that were mounting every single month off.
22:47
And so I knew that I needed to make like 150,000 in profit in the next like 30 days or so in order for this to work, right?
And this was the only way I could do And so what I did was I called, you know, those guys, they all bought and then I called up every gym that we had launched at that point which was like 32 I think.
23:04
And I called every one of those guys was like, Hey you know how he filled your gym up?
Want me to show you how I did that and they were like yeah that would be great.
That's exactly what we did.
And so I ended up doing like 300,000 in sales.
The next month selling a digital product which was actually more like a Consulting type thing and here's what's crazy.
23:23
The next 30 days.
The average gym that You used the Consulting program?
Jim launch, did thirty thousand dollars in collected cash.
Not contract not contract, not anything like that, but thirty thousand dollars in sales in the next 30 days.
23:41
And, and then that is when everything took off like a rocket because every single one of those guys told every person that they knew that was in the gym space like dude, I just did this thing and it killed that was what gave birth to Jim launch as it became the consulting company.
23:56
Licensing company, where we license out, all the materials, all the ads, all the copy, all the scripts, how to set up the lobbies.
In the thing is that when people ask me about the story and this is, you know, now we're six months into 2017.
At this point, I've gone through like the hardest 18 months of my entire life.
24:12
That is, when we would just went from.
I think we did 100 Grand that first, you know, month or last last few weeks than we did, 300 than 480.
Then 780 than a million then 12, then. 15 18, 20 22.
24:29
Like we just kept, we just grew like like a rocket.
And a lot of people think it was because of the marketing that I was running at that point.
But it wasn't, there was a lot of it was just the word of mouth and the actual product worked, you know what I mean?
And I use that as an example because like right now, I launched the book under million-dollar offers, it's 99 Cents with one post on my Instagram, which is not that big of a following.
24:52
And right now it tells about a thousand copies a day with no funnels, no ads.
No.
Whatever.
And it's because the product was good, you know?
I mean, people talk at the products good.
And with this product, I was able to charge an egregious amount of money, but it was because we charge because we were making people so much money.
25:10
Like, if I gave you a system that make thirty thousand dollars on average in the first 30 days, how much is that system Worth right?
Most guys charge, you know, for franchises?
They'll charge 500,000 first system that doesn't like that, right?
And I was just charging 16 Grand because I was like holy cow like they're going To make double their money in the first 30 days if they just do this, right?
25:28
And I was so I knew every aspect, every piece of this process because I done it, not only for my six gyms, but for the 30-plus that we had launched.
And so like I knew the differences between different markets, I knew how to train sales, guys, to get them to do it, I knew how to position the offer, I knew how to do the layout of the sales room in the lobby.
25:45
So you can maximize the amount of people that you could sell.
I knew how to do the nutrition consultations the next day.
So you could cover all the ad spend, just with product sales, right?
Like I knew all these things because I did it and so I told This story to illustrate one thing.
One is that what you were going through now?
26:00
It doesn't mean like your work works on you more than you work on it.
I was developing skills character traits and beliefs through this entire three, four five, six year period of just just eating shit that I did not know was for me.
And so we think that the first business, the second business, the fifth business you start is going to be the business, that's going to be it for you.
26:20
But like, the journey is long, you know what I mean?
And you accumulate these skills in these beliefs and He's traits over time and those become the things.
Those are your actual assets, right?
The businesses are just manifestations of those assets in reality.
And so, as as these things took off right, my, you know, my life, radically transformed and the piece that I get a lot of questions about.
26:45
It's like, how can I do what you did in my space or in my Niche, or my whatever?
And the thing is, people want to skip the first five years of the story, right?
The first five.
Ears was that I didn't sell a course on how to make ten thousand dollars a month from a gym.
When I had my first gym, I didn't do that when I had a second I didn't do that.
27:03
When I add a third, I didn't do that.
One on a fourth.
I didn't do that.
When out of fifth, I didn't know that when I to sixth, right?
Because I didn't feel like I was good enough and it was only an even then I started doing the launches as the next thing because I wanted to make sure that everyone always got way more value than they paid me, which was Zero, they paid me.
27:21
Nothing.
That I would fill their gym, a pretty good deal, right?
No risk for them.
So, I did that for almost two years, doing the doing the gym launch.
It's right where we fly out and you already know how that went, which is difficult and hard for me, but I learned so much.
I learned how to run a virtual sales team.
I learned how to do all these things.
27:37
So that when I did have the next opportunity that lined up for me, we went from zero to 30 million in the next year in Revenue, because I had accumulated all of these skills in these character traits that I would note, not otherwise have had and so a lot of people want to just jump to that part but they don't have the skills.
27:52
They don't have the character traits.
They don't have the beliefs.
That align with what they want to achieve.
And so I'm a big believer that the foundation that you set is going to dictate the height of the peak of the pyramid that you want to build within your life and the business that you want to grow.
And so most people have a very small Foundation, they took a course and then they want to start selling how to, you know, run Facebook ads, right?
28:13
Or whatever.
And so the reality is that they're just not good enough.
And that's why the thing that they have just doesn't work that well, which is why it doesn't make money.
Which is why they don't make money right?
Because the Money.
That you'll be me that you'll make will be, will be will be predicted by the value that you provide to the marketplace.
28:30
It's always what it is.
I know this is a longer story, but I think that hopefully it illustrates one that the path is not straight to.
It is fraught with difficulty and mind, you me telling you the very, the quote end of the story is that like, oh yeah, then you know, everything took off like a rocket.
All of these types of problems.
28:46
There was different problems that we had to solve then, which is like how do you double every month and somehow keep up with high quality service.
And, and support, and train Talent.
While also, bringing new people in and keep a culture and all of these things.
But at the end of the day, the product brought us so much forgiveness from our customers because they were just all making so much money.
29:07
Using the systems that we had laid out that we were able to build the infrastructure as the plane was flying, you know, during the journey.
And so anyways that was that was the transition of me going from broken.
Looking at bankruptcy lawyers to we did three million in Profit just in the last Like four or five months of that year and then the next year we did 17 million in profit and that was because I switched from a service to to Media which is no cost of reproduction.
29:37
So there's significantly higher gross margins on it, which is a better opportunity vehicle.
And what's interesting about this and I'll just I'll hit this because I probably make a video on this one concept alone, but I think it's worth highlighting is that when I had my Jim's right?
That I had relatively the same skill set, right?
29:53
I knew how to help people lose weight.
Wait, I know how to people, you know, I need a market, I know how to sell, I had these locations, all of that from there.
I transition to a done-for-you sales model, right?
And I made more money right now.
I had some issues and it's funny because I could look at that model now, and fix it in 2 seconds, because it's obvious what I would need to do to change the model, but I didn't do that.
30:13
But I made more money in terms of Revenue and, you know, in terms of net margins, I was making more but there was holes in the actual way.
The model is designed, which is why I had to do with all these other things.
And then finally, we switch the licensing code in media, right?
And that is where the, you know, the highest gross margins exist.
30:30
And so I the same skills, right?
But as my belief changed a, my character traits changed and developed.
I was able to switch into better and better opportunity because for the same set of skills, And that is what that was, what ended up, creating the fortune that Layla, and I were able to eat a mass in this period of time and it was because of that transition through different Vehicles, repackaging, the same skills.
30:53
And so the first step in this is getting the skills to to repackage.
And I think most people just want to skip that part which is the rocky cutscene, that every single person that I know successful, does that no one wants to talk about every every single great big business owner that I know have these years of thankless work, where they develop these skills, these traits In these beliefs that end up setting them free.
31:15
And everyone wants to just take the one course and thinks they're going to become a millionaire in 6 months and it's just not the case.
And so many people are.
Far ahead of me in there are internal Journey.
You know, then I was in my first two years, three years, five years.
And so, I told the story to hopefully give anyone who's like two years in and isn't making money.
31:31
It's like well, multiply that by 3 and then that's about where I was where I started making real money.
So anyways, lots of love Mosey Nation.
Love you all.

My goal in life was to be wise my life.
When I was really young, I was like, I want to be wise and wisdom is seeing what other people cannot say.
It's understanding the circumstances in having with the sermon to see what is true and what is not.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:17
I hope you enjoy and subscribe but I mean, certainly Alex.
There has to be some people in your umbrella in your company that you do train up, and those are kind of the people that they're like, the foundation of your company ride or is it completely objective, like, you can just buy all Talent when you're starting, a company depends on the nature of the work and what you're able to pay.
0:40
So, For example like Frontline work in general, you're going to get lower skilled labor and so it becomes a competitive advantage to have a very good Training Program because then you're getting the work done for less than the market, right?
So if someone comes equipped with the skill, you have to pay the premium of them having already acquired the skill.
0:55
If we have a really robust training system, like if you're a door-to-door business, door-to-door sales, business like solar Pest Control, whatever.
Then a really big business will Pride itself on the fact that it can take somebody off the street, put them, run them through their Gauntlet of training.
And then on the other side, they've got a 400,000, all your producer and so, It depends on the nature of the thing that you're selling and what your competitive advantages are.
1:16
Yeah, I think I've been so slow to hire simply because I feel like, I want to have a few people that I build up and train, simply because I want them to speak Robin.
No, Robin Wright, Rob Wright.
And think, the way that I think so that when we start hiring externally, they can then train all those people, because they've been trained by me, but it's hard, it's harder than you think.
1:37
I mean, I just hired a CEO for my my Haitian brand.
And that was a really Pride busting moment for me to really, finally, sit down and say, okay, it's not that I was failing, but I was failing myself from a personal standpoint of being able to be sane, and not stressed and like fulfilling family needs and everything like that.
1:56
And I really feel the moment that they accepted the offer.
I was like, oh, I can finally stop saying no to everything because anytime I have a new idea or something new that I want to do with my program, I would immediately say oh yeah, but the logistics on that are Headache.
I would never do it, but it's a really cool thing.
2:13
And I was in the meeting with my co yesterday and there's like three ideas that came up, and I stopped him from riffing on it because I was like, know the logistics on that are a nightmare and then I was like, wait a minute, I don't have to worry about the logistics.
It's literally your job to do that and he's like, that's right man, you tell me what you want me to do and I will make it happen.
2:31
And I was like, wow this is a now.
I understand why people hire people.
So I think a lot of this came down to like one of the reasons I chose him as he came from my organization.
Ation.
He was paid me for a consultation.
I didn't charge him 120,000 though.
I think I charged it like 150 bucks like a year ago, then he joined my program.
2:50
Then he joined my Mastermind, then he joined my sales team and then he quit because he was too busy, working his full-time job and I said, no, wait, don't quit, I need.
I'd like you to much come back and I was able to bring them on and integrate them, but one of the reasons I think I saw him early on was actually something that you said and it's your philosophy on Superstars.
3:09
I'd like to talk about that for a second.
When you see a superstar, you know, it can you tell us expand on this a little bit?
It's not common.
And I think you get better at recognizing it over time, you know.
I think the amount of people who heard me talk about superstars, they're like, oh yeah.
So it says regarding our to meet a superstar superstar be like, I don't know.
3:24
That's a superstar because every, you know, right?
I had a mentor who sold his business for, you know, multiple bees.
He said, you know, Alex you have to remember that the best talent has yet to come.
He's like the best higher you've ever made is in the future and so it's always Like this constant raising bar but Superstars when you find them you have to hold on to them.
3:46
And you have to find a way to.
Now mind you.
The big common here is that as long as they do not break the culture and you're not making exceptions for them from a cultural basis because that's one of the biggest issues is that you've got this super high individual contributor who actually tracks and is a cancer for the overall, you know company.
And so that's the hardest fire to make but the one you have to make but superstars who fit within the culture, I mean you want to give them as much opportunity as you can and support them in their growth so that they can But even then with, like, like the salesman to clo, move out of me, like, huh?
4:15
That's interesting.
It's a very different character trait and very different skill set.
So Mike, huh, interesting.
I wouldn't have been my first guest.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I think the salesman thing that was definitely part of his.
I think he just wanted to be a part of the organization and so he was willing to do sales for me just to be like, hey, I just want you to know I'm in.
4:37
And I had seen him like, you know, that throughout the whole journey.
He was kind of not now the ground level of like the rabbit Channel but pretty close to the beginning of everything.
And so I was like, all right, well this guy has been around since the beginning, he's had faith in me.
So I'm going to have a little bit of faith in him.
4:52
And honestly, I mean, just in the one week that we started, I'm already like really I needed someone that was complimentary to me, right?
Because the phrase for me that I always think about is if we're both the same one of us is unnecessary.
And so, for me, if I can't, I can't work with someone who's a Visionary and like has big strategy.
5:11
Big Ideas because that's what I have.
I don't need that.
I need someone to actually go and run with it so I want to kind of talk about a little bit here.
Can you give me your opinion on when you're talking about scaling?
What is the more difficult stage?
Is it that first reaching the million dollars?
5:26
Is it the reaching 23 or the 30 or even the any numbers past that?
It's so difficult.
It's so difficult to say which one's the hardest I would say the heart feels different.
So you know, the first the the first stage you know 02. 60 to 70 the heart is that you don't know what you're doing.
5:43
And if I'm allowed to cuss, if I'm not then bleep.
Me bleep.
Whoa!
Bleep you out.
It's all good.
Yeah, you have no idea what you're doing.
The biggest threat.
You have.
Your business is ignorance.
This is not knowing what the hell you doing?
That's the threat, right?
And that is hard because it just fit.
You feel like you're just flying through space and you have no idea.
6:00
You're disoriented once you cross like getting from a million to 3, million is very difficult because you have to learn an entirely new skill set, which is like you have to hire your first.
Right?
And that's that's very difficult for a lot of people.
You know, 3210 is difficult because you have to unlearn the thing that made you successful up to this point which is you're focusing on front end rather than on product and back-end.
6:22
And so that becomes it's very difficult it's like it's like spiritually difficult at that point.
You know what I mean?
Once you're at 9:57 you're already out of the like I have to work.
I have to cry my face off in terms of like ours in because at some point the amount of work that has to get done surpasses, your ability to work which means you have to work through other people.
6:39
You know, at 10 million the LT, is you have to give up even more control.
And so at each of these levels, you're giving up different types of control, you know, in the beginning, you're giving up control of fulfillment.
The next love, you're giving up control of sales, then you're giving up control of, you know, finances, things like that.
Then you're giving up control of marketing, then you're giving up control of managing all those things then you're giving up control of leading, you know, the company and so on so forth.
7:01
So, like, there's always this relinquishing of control, which is, I would say, spiritually, very difficult and it's easy to say very hard to do.
And that's what we look for in the portfolio companies that we think about taking, We look at the CEOs.
We're like do I think this person has the humility to give up control when it is required?
Yeah, David I think you're pretty good at this.
7:18
I think you're really good at finding people that you can, as you say, develop them and help, you know, run the different companies that you're that you've created.
What's been the toughest I guess phase for you when it came when it came to scaling I'm like I'm having a whole psychological session with myself as I'm listening to Alex talking.
7:37
Bring out into hives over there.
Yeah like It keeps on coming back that like every issue I'm having in business is a reflection or a symptom of an issue I have with myself.
So like as I'm thinking about white, what he's saying makes perfect sense why don't I do that?
There's this big arrow that comes pointing out some character flaw that I have or a fear that I would have or a like maybe I don't want to commit to being there every single day 8:00 and if I'm going to hire this person pay them three hundred thousand dollars, I have to be just as committed as I want them to be.
8:06
So maybe Alex at some point we could talk more about like what your advice would be.
It robbed.
I'm sorry.
What was your question there?
This is how deep I am in such a lot, I know.
But I can already see the the YouTube title is Alex hormones exposes David nice nice clickbait title.
8:22
Um, I want to know from your standpoint.
What's been the most difficult stage for you to scale in any of your company's?
Was it getting to the 0 to 1 million Mark?
Or was it any stage after that?
I think by Alex is definition here the 3230 is where I keep getting stuck so I am very good at what you said, a This is just a leverage job, you have one person a bunch of support pieces, right?
8:44
And I get to where I Max, I cannot get any higher than this.
I am doing as much as I possibly can, and then I picked the person and I hand over a lot of my responsibilities, and then I go off and I crush it in another thing.
And when I come back, I'm like, ah, like what happened.
And then, I have to take that person out and put a new person in, and I just get stuck in that like, leap off cycle.
9:04
And then, I fall right back down and it's definitely a problem with hiring, like, I'm sure someone who's good at.
This would look at her right away and say, Doing it wrong but I've been probably three years on that treadmill.
Yeah, you know, it's an interesting concept to think about Leo and I discussed this all publicly, but it's like called The Hidden funnel or the missing funnel, but if you think about has to happen to acquire customer, right?
9:24
So you have to do some sort of lead generation, there's some sort of leave nurture, there's some sort of sales, there's some sort of delivery and then there's some sort of retention and then some sort of attention, right?
So those are kind of like the steps that you take through for a customer.
Well, the same funnel exist on the other side of the business, which is as the business grows, you need to have a funnel to acquire Talent.
9:40
Don't require employees and so you have instead of lead generation you have application generation instead of being nurturing of application Archer.
So it's like how quickly are we getting these people book for interviews like the best best talent finds a job in eight days, eight days from the start the day.
They start searching if your entire job hunting process.
9:55
Takes longer than eight days.
You've already lost all the good people, right?
And then from there, the sale, is the interview, right?
And with good talent, it should be a sale right?
Because they should be able to be picky.
Like if the person that you're trying to hire doesn't have any other opportunities, do you really want to hire them?
Yeah, you know, and then from there, you have the delivery which within the context of an employee's going to be the onboarding process of like, how am I going to acclimate you to this business, where our cultural values?
10:21
How do you get paid?
How do we do with time off with our compensation philosophy?
What is your career path?
What is your Ascension, blah, blah, blah, blah, try all these things that have to get covered and it takes time, right?
Like we on board a new like senior executive.
It's going to be a month of one to two hours a day with the executive.
And then finally, we have a retention and Ascension, right?
10:37
So it's like, okay now that we have this person their onboarding to productive, it's like, how do we retain chain them to continue to get them motivated and that is there the opportunity for Ascension to same way.
We have that with a customer and so you really have this mirror funnel that exists in the middle of the business that's external versus internal.
But the promotion process is saying, and most people build this front-end and they don't have a concurrent funnel that funnels into the business, to build the infrastructure, the business to support the leads and customers that are coming in and ultimately, that's how you were able to scale it by having.
11:02
If you remember what I said earlier, there's one Avatar, one product, one channel.
We can have the same process on the back end, which is like, we have a specific Avatar that were searching for You have a specific job that we have, and then we have a channel that we're looking to get them on a consistent basis.
Getting the consistency down is really what gets you from one-off hires to having a consistent hiring process?
11:22
Just like your lead generation process, right?
Like you guess that's an order to get to that point.
You get comfortable with the process.
I always have to be lead generating and then you need to sort of take that same pattern and apply it to.
Well, I'm lead generating for talent at this point.
Yes.
Yep.
So that's where we're I've been stuck.
And that's just the the challenge I like until I can figure out what it is in me.
11:40
Eeyore find the right person that can do that for me, right?
Like, there's probably a person that is good at hiring people that if I had someone like that, man.
I think I would, I would 10x pretty quickly.
That's and just to any last advice there.
Oh yeah.
No, I was just gonna say, like and that's why for us within within our firm.
Like the only thing that we keep in houses recruiting Because at least for me, I think about the highest leverage ways because like, if I were to do anything us as a hold code, do anything for the portfolio companies actually doing this rather than advice in addition to recruiting Is that, that company becomes less sellable in the future because that hold code have to go with it, right?
12:14
It has to sit within the Enterprise for the value to be created right in the Enterprise Value itself.
And so the most efficient way of us doing that is for us to hire, and find that Talent, which is what we can do with our reputation, our reach etcetera, that's our competitive advantage and we can bring the All-Star into the business.
And then now, the values being created on a consistent basis, the problems been solved for good and then that value sits inside of the Enterprise, which then makes everybody more money later.
12:37
I want to take a slightly different approach to what we're talking about and get your Ian on something, I'm writing a book for Bigger Pockets right now and I think it's going to be called pillars, but the basic concept is instead of trying to find out how to buy a bunch of real estate without acquiring any skills or without having any money, why don't you just solve the problem of why you're broke, right?
12:56
Get your spending under control, get a budget, right?
Here's some tools to do that, get good at making money because that's actually something that is possible to do, especially in America.
So there's defense offense, and then you invest the difference and that would be the part on investing in this one.
I'm I'm trying, thank you.
13:12
I'm trying to come up with advice for people who are not making enough money in their job.
Because as what I notice is, as we talked to people, like you the constant problem is, how do I get Talent.
How do I get someone to do a good job?
How do I?
It's not like we're holding people down saying, I don't want to pay you more money.
13:31
Work desperately looking for these leads of people that can help our business.
And then you've got a whole population of people that are saying I want to make more money.
There is a huge disconnect Skanect that's happening here.
So do you have any advice either for me that I can put in the book or for the people who are listening?
Who are not happy with how well they're doing for what they can do to actually bring more value to their employer and make more money?
13:51
Yeah, so I think everyone needs a turn off their 19 year old Finance expert.
Your and stop trying to you know invest in the S&P 500 and invest in the S&P 500, right?
They should be putting every dollar they have into themselves rather than an index because I can promise you if they put a thousand dollars into themselves, they're going to make more than a hundred dollars a year off that increase in skills.
14:09
And so, The biggest issue that most people have is they don't have the ability to discern what they're missing link is or what their next step is what's the thing about the theory of constraints which is that a system will grow until it's constraint.
And so what happens is, most people add potential to assist them but they don't actually increase the throughput of the system.
14:24
So, for example, if I had a bridge, right?
And it has a weak Link in the bridge or let's say a change, probably simpler.
So if you have a chain and you have to pull two things, the amount of force that you can put on the chain is just predicated based on the weakest link.
And so what happens is that people reinforce a strong link and not the weak Link in the chain and so they a potential to the chain but they don't actually add any more strength that can be pulled.
14:44
And so if you think about the amount of money, you're trying to make as amount of money that you're literally trying to pull towards you, that weak link is going to be the skill deficiencies that you have.
And so most people solve problems that aren't really there, and they spent a lot of their time reinforcing skills that they enjoy, but that's not their deficiency.
And so that's why I like, the entrepreneurship thing is, you have to be a jack of all trades, master of none.
15:01
You have to be good enough to get the thing across across the Finish Line to pull it, you know, pull the money towards you.
You don't have to have the strongest link, you just need all the links to be strong enough.
And so, I think most people Good at assessing, their own deficiencies.
And so, if the follow-up question is, how do you assess deficiencies?
How do you know what's missing?
15:19
The question is, what are the revenue generating activities within a business?
How can I get myself closer to those Revenue, generating activities?
And so, you can look at product is revenue generating activity.
You can look at sales and revenue generating activity, you can look at marketing is revered generating activity.
And so, if you think about those kind of the Three core pillars of what businessing is, and then you have back of house, right?
15:35
You've got Finance, you've got it, you've got the other pieces, but the people who Ascend, even in the back office, Know how to generate revenue and bottom line for their division.
So for example my CFO Suzanne triplet she you know she led a 15 billion dollar acquisition five billion, 1 billion.
15:52
The last company shoes.
I was seven and fifty million.
She's been dollar 1 to 100 million two times.
So like she's been there and the first thing she did on our like our first interviews I know you won't have to pay from it was like and she's paid very well and she's like, you know today for me she's like I'll say I'll save more than what you're ever going to pay me.
16:10
First six months, I'll save you that.
I was like, oh, cool.
And so smart people know how to do that, like, like a an intelligent, you know, video editor is going to come and say, dude, I can 10x the amount of views that you're getting on this thing because he's going to time self to marketing.
A good product person's going to say, I can, if I can decrease our churn which is going to increase your LTV, I'm going to be able to get more people to ascend because they have a higher NPS score and they're more likely to want to keep buying from us like so they have to just figure out a way to tie whatever the thing if they're really passionate something by all means.
16:38
Going on, if you're a righty, then you're thinking how Can I decrease page load times?
How can I get conversion rates up?
You start getting into the cro side?
How can I organize the data in such a way that the co can make better decisions?
And we have real-time reporting?
It gets all the sales, guys, so we can optimize our photos towards the best converting guys, right?
Like all of all aspects of the business can make more money, but people don't think about it through that lens.
16:56
So the first thing is, how do I tie what I do everyday to making more money in the business.
You connect that dot and then you improve that connection.
Let me ask if I understand your, your chain link analogy there because I thought that was really good.
And I also love what you said is like, Solve a problem for somebody bring value to them and you're paying your own salary, you can name your own price, if you're making your saving the company that money.
17:16
I did a TED talk about building skills and in it.
I described how when I was, you wouldn't think it from looking at me now, but I used to be incredibly skinny, like, I was very insecure.
I was a beanpole, six foot one, and like 150 pounds.
It was terrible.
And so it was just a challenge for me to get to the gym at all.
17:33
I just was working out next two Meatheads and I hate it, how how it felt, and I was trying to work out my arms gym launch, man.
Exactly, exactly.
We didn't have that back then Alex.
I was trying to work out my arms.
As I was the biggest area of insecurities that I would have.
I would wear like extra-long T-shirts because I don't want people to see how skinny my arms or so I'm doing these curls and I realize I can't even get a bicep workout because my wrist would get tired before that muscle would like the muscles in my wrists were not strong enough to do it and then I finally got my wrist strong and I had that same problem.
18:03
My forearms they would burn too much and I couldn't get to the bicep.
So I had this like process where I had to strengthen individual.
In that chain before I got to the actual freaking bicep.
So I could work it out.
Am I?
Is that close to what you're describing that people have with their own personal skills?
18:19
That they're, maybe they want to get to this part in bringing value.
But they've got these weak links, they have to strengthen before they get there, like it's Perfect Analogy, the one that you had, it's a perfect analogy and as a total side note because Rob you're in the in the education space like one of the big things that people there's a big misconception which is that one product or one course or one coaching thing or one master.
18:40
Mine is going to be their Messiah, it's going to be the one thing that sets them off in the thing is that the testimonials that anybody receives is not purely because of the of the program that they have and that's hard for a lot of Educators to take on, because they want to take responsibility for everyone success.
But the thing is, if you take responsibility for Success, you have to also take responsible for anyone's failures.
18:56
And so I think that a realistic approach is probably better, like you didn't teach the person.
How to read, you didn't teach the person arithmetic, you didn't teach them multiplication and so education, sits atop foundations.
And so a lot of times and this is, this is for everyone.
Who's listening to this, who is who's going through educational programs.
G and they haven't made one.
Yet the point is to make progress and the hardest part in the beginning of Entrepreneurship is ignorance and you have to pay down the time tax of ignorant as fast as you can.
19:20
And so you pay down that time tax of ignorance through education.
And the thing is, is that if you are fortifying different aspects of the chain, if there is a link that is literally missing, let's say there's 30 pieces of the chain that have to get built for us to pull a certain amount of money towards us.
All right, just for the to keep the analogy parallel.
19:36
If there's 30 links, the first course you take might give you 20 of them.
Right?
But you didn't make money and so that person then said, they shake their fist at the guy and say screw that guy.
He took my money but you're 20 links out at third, right?
And then you take another thing because you had least accurately identify what was wrong and you get another eight links.
19:53
Now you get to links and then you go to this next final guy.
And he gives you the last two links that you need.
And then you're like this, guy's the Messiah disguise, the stuff I did to other programs.
I didn't get any -.
All right thing is that you were measuring your measuring based on outputs, not on impasse and you're measuring based on how much money were make rather than how much work you were doing on.
20:11
And so, I think if people can make that shift based on them being the investment that they are making, then they will always see the return and then it, obviously, focuses more on the process and the outcome.
And if you can do that, cuz I can tell you for me personally, because I get asked a lot, and hopefully comes off the right way.
Like how did you move so quickly because we're 32 years old cross, 100 dollars in net worth last year, and we get asked this question all the time and it was because we always took 100 percent as much of the excess cash that we had and just plowed it into education.
20:38
My goal in life was to be wise, why?
Like when I was really I was like, I want to be wise and wisdom is seeing what other people cannot say.
It's understanding the circumstance in having to discernment to see what is true and what is not.
And so, if we look at why you're not doing well in business, it's being able to properly discern and identify what those problems are, and you only get that through repetition, you get that through experience.
20:55
You get there through mentors, and people who have more context than you, who can breathe into your life.
And so, anyways, I'm very passionate about that and so I just think that a lot of people do the education industry to service, because they go to college.
And four years later with a Spanish degree, they can barely speak Spanish and They take one course, and they're like, I'm not a millionaire and if it's if it's hard, then that's what makes it worth doing.
21:16
Like, if it were easy, it wouldn't be worth doing.
You wouldn't even want it.
If it were easy.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
21:32
I'm doing that to build hype 400 leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
21:51
Because last time I sold out for like Eight straight weeks really fast.
So, that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
I feel like the education space gets pooh-poohed on a little too much, especially for all the legitimate people out there teaching stuff.
And it's like, the way I say it is, I've learned it the hard way so you can learn it the easy way.
22:10
But the bad news is that you still have to put in a lot of hard work for it to work out.
It's not it's not hard but it is hard work.
A lot of the time in real estate, you know.
It is hard to if you're really getting started, but I like that.
You said ignore the 19-year old Finance Bros because I do feel like that is that I think I actually got interviewed for a podcast or for a YouTube video about a month ago and it was a buddy of mine and he was asking a bunch of millionaires.
22:36
Hey if you're talking to someone just getting started, how would you recommend investing a thousand dollars and every single one was like, SMP 500.
I was thinking, like Solana or like Bitcoin.
Really was like, yeah.
And I was like, you're not gonna make any money really.
22:52
That's like life-changing with a thousand dollars.
In a stock investment, invest in education by a thousand dollar course or 25.
Hundred dollar course and learn a skill that allows you to make more money.
Maybe it's video editing, maybe it's, I don't know.
Amazon, real estate whatever it is, I don't really care about learn Empower yourself, give yourself knowledge and use that to make more money because at the end of the day, starting out the thousand dollars.
23:14
I mean while some people have done it and become billionaires from and I'm sure it's not something.
I mean you know you get a you gotta get real lucky with the thousand dollars on them like a Bitcoin call or something like that, to make a ton of money.
So I always say, go learn in that is what's going to make The money not necessarily like a like a tiny little investment in in my opinion 100% of anyone's money especially sub-30 should be invested in only one thing which is increasing their earning capacity.
23:42
That's it is increasing your earning capacity, so much so that you cannot spend the money that is coming in and then and only then when you literally can't find places to spend the money on education, which is why I get so excited to spend 130 grand for the calls with Grant or anything.
I've done that a number of times 25.
23:58
In order to call, I've had plenty of those types of calls and they've always returned.
And the constant is that you have to be willing to work.
And if you have the belief which I do, which is that I always want to be the best student.
So if I go into somebody's program I will say if someone else can then so can I and then I will do whatever they did and do a little bit more and so we're a lot more and that way I can always because if it worked for one other person than it means it can work for me.
24:19
And so like I've always had that as a deep-seated belief at least it served me well and maybe maybe it'll serve the audience.
I know I went on a tangent with that but now that's like really light.
Not because it's like what I what I care a lot about.
I'll give you a quick example cuz I think it'll drive this home.
So A friend of mine has a daughter 17 years old.
24:35
She got a job at a bowling alley and she was making minimum wage.
Things like 750, whatever.
And he's like, why don't you just get us?
Phlebotomy certification, it's a weekend and you immediately make $25 an hour, right?
And so people think about that and like, guys, it's $500 and two days.
24:51
It's a weekend to get a phlebotomy certification and forever.
She will have three and a half extra earning capacity for the rest of her life.
And so if you take That same thousand dollars and put it in the SMP.
Maybe it goes up, 10% maybe goes up 25% because it's a crazy year, right?
Well cool.
You have 250 dollars extra, you can have two hundred fifty dollars extra per week, just by investing in that one thing where you get a 50 x return or 100 extra turn, right?
25:16
And then you take that excess to your point, David Wright.
And you say Okay, phlebotomy is this skill?
Is there another school I can stack on top?
This?
Maybe it's project Management's or management Tools in general and I can manage 50-foot, botanists, it's leveling up the skill.
The opportunity vehicle that were pursuing so I could be a blender tender.
25:32
You know what I mean?
At a smoothie shop, right?
Or I could be a manager a little bit better, probably still not a good vehicle or I could own a smoothie shop where I could own the franchise of all the smoothie shops.
Like, it's all just degrees of Leverage and acquiring the skill set are required.
And just, as long as you know what the path looks like, then you can ask the question, what do I lack that that person has?
25:48
And I think that's usually the one of the more valuable questions rather than envy and and point in casting Stones about why someone's ahead of you and why they were cheap and you're actually a really virtuous person and they must be doing something negative to be ahead of you.
Maybe they're just better than you and if you can at least admit that and have the humility to do so, then you can create the deficit that you can then solve.
26:07
I love it, man.
I think what you're saying right now has the ability to change lives more than almost anything else.
That could be said and it hits right at the core of like you are actually in charge of your own success.
If you take the responsibility for building skills, you still hear people talk about how important it is to have skills.
26:24
Like you get that Napoleon Dynamite complex, right?
Girls like guys that have skills.
Don't have any skill, but that's what, that's what we'll put you in the position of empowerment.
It's not the next get-rich-quick scheme.
It's not some clever marketer.
Telling you could have a Ferrari, like me.
If you do this type of a thing, like, what you're trying to do when you're taking these courses or educating yourself really is building skills.
26:46
And I think, like, you take any one, you put them in a Jamba Juice and their, the blender tender and they take the right approach and then they learn how to become a shift manager.
And then from there, they learn how to manage the other people and then they get put in charge of hiring and then they're looking at company books and well, we can increase Revenue.
If we sell up cinnamon bun with every smoothie or whatever, you're actually building skills that then they say, let me put you in charge of the whole Jamba Juice.
27:06
Let me put you in charge of my other five Jamba Juice is now you learn how to franchise and you could buy a job.
I mean, that's literally kind of what you did and this is the key to making it, is it like, and for everyone's always, I don't know where to start, start with the money watch where the money goes.
27:22
How does the money come in the door?
Like you just have to watch the path of the money like from click to close cradle to grave?
So how does personal find out about whatever business you're working it?
Like ask those questions, like, that is fundamentally with the understanding of businesses is understanding.
How do I monetize raw tension?
27:37
How do I get Rod attention?
How do I attract it towards me?
How do I convert that attention in exchange goods for goods and services for dollars, right?
How do I get that good and service person to come back and spend more money, right?
Like, if you know what, that path of the money looks like, and that's where you can ask.
I remember when I actually was a smoothie blender tender because I, that's why he's got because I was born, I remember.
27:58
And if you're like, man, I haven't thought about that.
It's okay, neither did I, you know, I mean, like I worked for two years at a smoothie store and every day I would, I would look at the total sales, I'd added up, and I never actually thought about.
I never once multiplied it out to see what the monthly Revenue was.
It was just numbers to me.
28:13
Like, I didn't, I didn't care it, just didn't matter.
I just came in and clocked out, but, like, I'm telling you now, sitting where I'm at.
If I can, if I can save you that time follow the money, if you can follow the money and get yourself closer, the money, you will become more valuable.
And if you don't know how to get closer to the money, ask most business owners.
If there are small business owners will know, a little bit more than you and in that you can learn about.
28:32
Yeah, do you think the owner of Smoothie King?
Told the owner of Jamba Juice hey man you can't do smoothies or else.
We can't be friends they probably aren't friends but probably when they were starting out but now it's you know both of those companies are you know multiple decades old.
28:50
Yeah.
Who knows?
But yeah.
I mean that's it's funny though because like I said it's like 20 or I can't wait to get like the 30 or 40 or Club because I mean, you think about a guy whose but you know you're 65 plus years old to you see that guy like shaking his fist at the like no, of course not.
I like he's old, right?
29:06
It's like in so if you're gonna be that way, eventually, why not be that way.
Now, I agree.
I'm competitive in my own respect, but I think I've had friends that have started similar things in me and they've come to me and they're like, hey, I just wanted to I wanted to bring it up like is it okay if I like if I do this I don't I'm like dude I didn't invent Airbnb or short-term rental, I didn't invent investing in this city, I didn't invent this concept.
29:28
You can do If you want because I got nothing to gain from being competitive with like friends in the space, right?
We can only help each other grow.
There's a lot of people write on and you also get into like psychographics, which is kind of interesting if you're a mass-market thing like you know, anyone can do Airbnb, short-term rentals, right?
So somebody might be attracted to you, some of them be attracted me, some would be in my track of David.
29:47
Some people won't be attracted to lay LED.
So like not only.
Do you have demographic differences in terms of like who's the Avatar that we're marketing to but like psychographic we have different values.
We stand for different things and so people just naturally going to just say, like I want this flavor of it.
Maybe, you know, the actual mechanics might be the same.
It's just I want this flavor because I just prefer this community a for these values.
30:03
This is more my vibe which is fine you know really appreciate you sharing your experience, your Alex.
This is like legit really gold information that I think can change lives for their lives for those that have ears to hear.
Please listen to this one again, let it sink into your heart, ask yourself, those tough questions because this will get you more money than you would need and investing in real estate becomes a lot easier.
30:23
When you have a lot of capital to go do it, all right?
We're going to move on to the last segment of the show.
This is the Famous famous far in this segment of the show.
We ask every guest the same for questions.
We will take turns firing them off at you question.
Number one Alex, what is your favorite real estate related book?
30:41
Crushing it with Real Estate apartments.
Wow I'm impressed.
You had a book to say there.
I was thinking you might be like I don't do real estate I do business so you're gonna say the Burr book since you've read it before.
Yeah, I've read.
I've read probably five real estate books and that one is really good is really well, written.
The guy didn't sell anything.
30:57
I'd like I like he had a really cool.
Ryan Murray, right?
I can't remember the author name, but I think it's pretty black with a red.
Yeah, it's black with red thing.
That's him.
Yeah, he partnered with my former co-host of this Brandon turner.
Oh no way.
Brian is now the partner with him and his company.
ODC.
They buy mobile home parks, super cool.
31:14
Yeah and it was a good book.
Okay, question number two, what is your favorite Business book?
For what stage in business for someone just struggling with scaling.
How about that struggle with scaling?
I think ready?
Fire aim by What's his pen name?
31:30
Like Masterson.
It's Mark.
Ford is the co-founder of Agora which is a direct response giant.
They do, I think a billion a year.
So he's he has a book that goes all the way up.
You said it was a ready.
Fire aim ready?
Fire aim?
Okay.
Yeah.
He talks about the transitions in business between each of those levels to okay, great.
31:48
I always write down these books whenever people say it with the aspirations to read them one day so got it on the list I'll give you a give you a Flipside one, any of the books by Patrick When Sione, he talks about operations and fundamentally like that's my most if you're talking scaling, right?
32:04
It's people and so that those books are fables so they're really light reads.
You can read in one sitting and they really teach really important lessons.
The book called The motive changed, my life and is what got me to break through the that.
Plus you know, I was in a big reading mode because I've just felt stuck at in the mid 30s but I couldn't get through and that was among the books that most deeply most profoundly shifted, how I acted as entrepreneur awesome man.
32:26
Question number three.
When you're Out there building hundred million dollar.
Jim Empires.
What are some of your hobbies?
I don't have money.
I work out, I work, I eat, that's most of the most of what I do.
Actually, this is very topical because I am somewhat known and on the internet as the Chipotle guy and then I recently saw that you posted, you ate at Chipotle 500 times the year.
32:51
One time, which is that actually does put me to shame and embarrass me that I haven't done that before.
Yeah, Thief.
Yeah, I did, because I was a single guy, and so, it was way more efficient for me money.
Like the amount of time, it takes to grocery shop prep, cooking, Etc.
33:07
It was way easier for me to just get 20 twice a day.
And the end of the day Chipotle was easy because it didn't track from work.
So the only thing I really had to do is to lunch polite and I didn't eat breakfast.
So I would just go nothing.
Oh nothing goal and that was all I hate.
I didn't even have anything in my fridge besides egg whites Coke, Zero Red Bull, and Johnnie Walker Black Label.
33:24
It makes sense though because when you're making a certain amount of money, it might be a 20 thousand dollar loan.
That you just say, if you had to go to the grocery store and you had to shop and you had to come cook your food, so that makes a lot of sense.
Alright, last question from me and your opinion, what sets apart successful entrepreneurs from those who give up fail or never get started.
33:41
The ability to deal with short-term discomfort for long-term achievement that comes through everything.
It's like, if you literally boil success down in any field, it's just the ability to endure short-term discomfort for long-term achievement.
Whether you want to lose weight, whether you would have a good marriage but even have a, you know, be a good leader whether you want to have.
33:58
Six pack, whether you want to make money, it's like you have to be willing to endure short-term sacrifice for a long-term achievement, okay?
That is very good because me and David are currently both working on our six-pack.
So, really took that to heart.
I'm sorry, what?
The 4-pack first, you know, got some, got to get away to go there, okay?
34:17
And then last one for you, Alex.
Oh, Where Can people find out more about you or what you're doing, all?
All on the internet, I've a podcast called the game so you just search The Game on any That you listen to podcast Spotify, Apple, All That, Jazz Stitcher, all the weird ones were on all of them.
34:34
Now, that's the best thing.
If you like videos, we have a pretty good YouTube channel.
We're on all the social medias.
So search my name, Alex from Rosine.
You should find me.
Go do it.
Everybody go subscribe to his YouTube channel.
Yeah, I don't know.
I haven't I've said this, I watch your channel.
It's been really cool to see you blow up, man.
34:49
You're like the YouTube poster child for all entrepreneurs out there.
So very much, appreciate all the content that you put out there.
David, what about you, man?
Where can people find you?
Online at David Greene, 24 on YouTube.
A David Green real estate and on Bigger Pockets everywhere.
So you can message me on there you have any questions for me.
35:06
Rob, how about you you can find me on the YouTubes at Rob built on Instagram at Rob built and then if you want to see me do crazy, little cute dances on tick-tocking, find me at Rob built.
Oh man, asking Alex last guy, I lied, I have one more question for you.
How long do you anticipate?
We have to endure before we stop having to look at the little like Tick-Tock pointing at bubbles thing.
35:26
I'm, I'm losing my mind.
Every time I These now yeah, it's really interesting because like I, you know, we've grown a decent amount.
I think we started September of last year so we're almost coming in on a year.
I think we've learned 400,000 or something like that as of today, in that period of time from zero and I didn't do any dances ever.
35:43
And so I think people people look at, you know, because it was musically before the so it made sense that there was a little bit more dancing, kind of in the in like the embedded in the culture of it but fundamentally it's not a dancing app.
It's a short form video app and so I think it's just about whether you can deliver value in an Pertaining way in 60 seconds or less.
36:00
And so, the dancing is just like a non.
Like, when I see business people are like lawyers, doing dances of like five things, you need before you do a deal.
It's like due diligence and like I just, you know, I feel like, you know, you don't need to dance and point just talk of like about the five things and how you do it and keep it under 60 seconds and you've got a tick tock, you know what I mean?
36:17
And so I think it's people misunderstanding the platform and this is by no means me being some social media expert.
But just at least my understanding up as it currently stands as it currently is.
It's just like, it's just short for a video and then you just know that Is a slightly different demo there and trying to cater it a little bit more.
Like my general things about marriage and food and fitness tend to do better than my business stuff.
36:35
But it's also probably the audience in general is a little bit younger probably, but it'll a job, you know, in five years they'll all be starting their businesses and hopefully you know they'll be able to get some value from it.
Did you hear that people?
You don't have to dance and point at bubbles, that have a little piece of please.
Share this video.
Make it go viral, get collectively.
36:52
We can end this.
Horrible Trend.
That is makes me want to poke my own eye out every single time I see these things.
Things.
And I think it might be a realtor thing.
I follow a lot of realtors in there, a lot of real.
That's what that's what I'm supposed to do.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna start making exclusively that content and then tagging both of you in it.
37:11
All right?
Alex.
Thank you very much, man.
We really appreciate you were gonna let you get out of here.
Rob.
I know you love what I do this.
Any last words before we go?
No man.
No, no final words.
Other than thanks for coming on and I watch all your tick-tocks.
There you go.
Appreciate you guys.
Thank you so much for having me and to the audience.
37:27
I hope.
You were able to get, you know, some return on your attention.
I know that's all of our homes.
So thank you so much.
You were able to get, you know, some return on your attention.
I know that's all of our homes.
So thank you so much.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn-out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, if you want to get access to people who know more than you use your base skill to give everything you can to them before you ask for anything.
The right people will ask you if they can do anything back.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:35
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and Buffett had documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
So in the most valuable things that you can do to move your career, forward is to network is to find people who are ahead of you, who can give you the steps and say, hey, watch out for that puddle.
0:53
Hey watch out for that brick, it's going to fall and they can help you avoid because the number one cost that you have to pay down in.
Your success, is ignorance, is that you do not know what you do not know.
And so, if you think about this, hypothetically, if you're not making a million dollars a year, whatever you make per year, you can subtract from a million dollars.
1:13
Year.
And that amount is what it costs, you every year not knowing how to make a million dollars.
That is the tax, the universe taxes on you, for your ignorance, it's the debt, you have to pay and so everyone who is poor pays a debt to the world for not knowing how to make more money.
1:30
And one of the fastest way to pay down that debt is to find someone who's ahead of you, because they have already paid it down, and they can identify where you're at, in the few missing links in the chain.
Because what happens is when you're building skill sets, if you think about like a bridge, Right.
Give this bridge that's built of bricks.
1:46
And what happens is you need every single one of the bricks for the dollars, start coming across and you might have 20 of 28 bricks and then you spend all your time reinforcing bricks but there's still a gap and so you keep buying courses and watching YouTube videos about copywriting or building landing pages.
2:03
But the thing that you don't know how to do is run ads or the thing that you don't know how to do is sell or the thing that you don't know how to do is build a product or find something people like so if you can identify the gaps, which is hard to do because you don't The perspective from which to make a judgment because you've never been there then having someone from the outside, you can point to the few cracks you have can so quickly drag your future into your present.
2:23
You can move that much faster because you're always going to pay for the lessons either time or money and you always pay with the thing that you value, least and so if you don't value your time, you will pay a lot of it to learn the lessons.
So one of the top five questions I get is, how do I get connected to people who are far ahead of me?
2:41
All right?
And I'm going to tell you, How I have network with people, significantly wealthier than me.
And this is probably the first time I've broken this down into this much detail, but I want you to win and if you don't know who I am, my name is Akshay Mosey on amazon.com.
Its portfolio is over $200, a year and I make this cause I want to be rich as hell and then have a good company.
3:00
So I can invest in your company when get richer together.
So, once you crash 3 or 5 million a year, give me a call the way that you connect with people ahead of you is that you have to provide them value.
So one of the stupidest things you can do is ask someone how can I provide you.
You it means that you did no forethought and you're asking them to do the work on your behalf.
3:19
So wait a second.
Some 19 year old kid text me and says text me whatever dmsr comments, whatever and says Alex I'll do anything.
I'll pick up your coffee.
I'll do your you know laundry or whatever like like I'll willing to work for free.
Well honestly, it would cost me more to have the nuisance of somebody always asking me questions every day and thinking that me Consulting them every hour of the day is a fair Exchange.
3:43
Change for them.
Getting me coffee.
I'd rather just pay someone who doesn't talk to me, think about it and if you can't think like that, you're never going to get to that level.
So you have to be able to empathize with somebody who's not in your current circumstance and think we'll what does that person want?
The thing that I want in?
3:59
The people who might be ahead of you one is time.
They want convenience and they want Value First.
The same way, they probably tried to provide you Value First in order to build Goodwill.
And so you reverse what they are doing to you back to So one of the first big people who are way ahead of me in business that I was able to come in contact with you, either have to buy your wit and pain, egregious amount of money where it actually makes sense for them.
4:24
But if you're poor, that's tough to do.
Because their way wealthier than you probably don't want to sell their time.
So I mean I've offered some people like they're speaking feet times to just to hop on the phone with me and sometimes it's like 250,000 dollars for like 1 hour, the highest we've ever offered, I was 350 Grand, the person said no, but just to show you You, I'm willing to do to have somebody who sees the world more clearly than I do speak into my life, because the people who make more money than you have a more accurate view of reality, if you are struggling to make money, it's because you do not see what they see.
4:58
So you're going through life with really blurry glasses.
The reason somebody can be a billionaire, lose it all and make it all back again is because they see something that you don't.
So the way that you network with these people, as you have two options, one, you build a platform.
5:14
That is valuable enough to them, that they're willing to come on your platform.
So, for example, if you've ever seen Ray dalio, the guy's worth, whatever 20 or 30 billion dollars now.
Well, you know, founder of Bridgewater, huge, private Equity or hedge fund.
Big thing.
Anyways, lots of money, he's hopping on podcast with people who aren't worth thousands of his net worth because they have something that he doesn't, they have distribution, they have attention, they have media, they have a platform and so you can build a platform of any kind of genre.
5:42
And if you have enough If people you have enough eyeballs, you will be able to gain access to people far above you, by inviting them to exchange with them something that you have that they do not, which is just tribution of a message.
And so that is one way that you can get, someone way out of your league, come into your world.
5:58
So think about Joe Rogan for accepting is like the biggest extreme example of that Joe Rogan, get president's, you can get prime minister's, you can get the richest people in the world to drop at the bottom of the hat to come to be on his podcast.
Because he's distribution, doesn't have money.
Doesn't pay them in money.
Pays them attention, which is a different currency heimo, sedition quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
6:23
Alright, so send me a connection request.
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
The second vehicle, which me coming up, I didn't have that one.
6:42
So this is the one I did is that I developed base level skill.
And I Bartered with everyone, but the way I Bartered was that I would do the work first 100% is that they were paid client, and then I would give it to them.
6:59
And then they would get really uncomfortable and they would be like, oh my God, I can't believe you did this.
So I would offer to hop on a call and have done a ton of work.
I'm not saying, like 10 minutes of pre-work, I'm saying a day of pre-work before I hop on and not only identify problems but already create the solutions that I think would help them.
7:20
And then when I would walk them, through all the things I'm seeing you will see their eyes like glazed over in a good way, where they're like, holy shit.
Like this is so much.
Like, I can't believe you did this, like, dude, I feel bad.
Like, you know, what can I do to help you out?
And that is what will happen when you don't just give with the intention of exchanging, but give with the intention of blowing their minds.
7:44
And what happens is you start to stack, something that are more valuable than money, iou's, you start to stack Goodwill and you have this little collection and you keep going and you keep giving and Layla used to joke about this.
But like, every Community, I would go and I would And I'll talk to everyone about hop on the phone with them.
8:02
And I wouldn't just say hey let's exchange from value, live to connect some time, 101, jit, you want to be Advanced will be thrilled when shit you go in and you give so much more than that person.
In the best thing is when you don't prepare them for it, you didn't give any insight.
8:17
And one of my favorite ways to do that is make it look like.
It was nothing like don't talk about how long it was, how long it took?
Or and if you do make it like, oh we didn't spend much time.
We probably spent a day or two.
But you discount it because you're not trying to play that game, you're trying to show value.
8:35
And when I got into my first little Mastermind group, that's what I did in, Leila said, you should choose to joke about it.
She's like, oh, he's on another favor call.
So you do favors for everybody.
I was like, I don't know what, I'll need something back and I would like to have a bunch of good will.
So if I can call it, it's there for most of those, I never called them, and I probably still haven't called them.
8:54
And I still have good will, with those people.
But when I did need it later on, when I was like dude, I don't know anything about paid ads, what did I do?
Rather than pay a consultant?
I cashed in one of the things that I had pre Bartered for because if you think about the amount of work that you're doing, wouldn't you want that level of work back realistically?
9:17
You'll never get it back.
You're not going to get the same level of work because people most people don't play that way.
Now, Advanced people do and they will recognize that game and then they will immediately like you Promise you because they understand how other players play.
And so they will try and give even more because they don't want to be out of exchange with somebody.
9:34
They don't want to owe anyone.
Anything.
And so the givers will over-delivering, you'll get it back in spades to create great relationships that allow a few your lifetime, but for everyone else, they will give you back half a third 20% of what you gave them.
But if the skill, they have, is the link you need.
9:53
It'll be worth far more than the fact that the only give you 20% of the effort and Even then you still always have the upper hand because you did give them things and value out of time.
And so you can see this whatever way you want you can call manipulation you can call it reciprocity but I'm just telling you that this is effective.
10:10
If you want to contact people who are above your pay grade, is that you do the work first.
You Leverage The small-scale.
You have to give as much of that skill.
You can to somebody else for free and then when they owe you something, you stack another skill, you said, hey can you show me how you do that?
10:26
Hey, can you show me how you do this?
Yes, I'm traveling with this thing.
Can you show me how you connect those dots?
Then what happens is that you trade, your skill for another skill.
Now, you have two skills.
And so then the next time you get on the phone, you can trade to skills to somebody.
And then you get a third skill, you trade three skills, you get a fourth skill.
10:42
The way I Learned was by going it networking with people, but not just meeting and getting business cards.
Like that's bullshit doesn't work doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
No one cares, but you do real work, it would be better for you to give five people that are valuable a Nificant amount of your time to get something back with the hopes that you can learn a skill from them then to give 100 people 10 minutes.
11:06
So, go deep with the few that is worth doing and if you're early on, you just got to go deep with everybody because you don't have the perspective from which to judge and you might get deep with somebody, who's like I recognize what you're doing and I can appreciate it.
This is what I think she tried to next time.
Do this a little bit different and those are what you make these huge leaps in your professional career.
11:24
So if you want to get access to people who know more than you use your base skill to give everything you can to them before you ask for anything.
The right people will ask you.
If they could do anything back and you can either tell them then or you cannot and you can hold it.
Like, I don't need anything.
I just wanted to provide some value.
11:40
I hope we can just you know, stay connected wherever.
And then later you can make that ask and then ask as you decline in time will be less that you'll be able to ask for.
But at the right moment will be worth everything.
So once you have an IOU, the number one rule of an IOU is you cannot pretend they owe you something.
11:57
You know that they know that it's not acknowledged, you don't need to, you can be like, hey man, you owe me one, you just lost.
It's done because now you did it for the wrong reason or at least you publicly acknowledge that you did it for a reason.
Second rule of this is that it's always a question.
12:12
It's like hey man you got a second and you don't need to reference the thing that you did you can you can say like hey man I hope that YouTube's not like let's say I help somebody with you to like, hey man, I hope that YouTube stuff working out well for you, by the way, do you know anything about this question mark?
12:30
And they're going to say, yes.
And you like awesome, like do you have time later day and then you can just, you know, schedule it from there whatever.
And that is how I probably.
We would redeem most of the I/O use that I have, which is hope that thing that I gave you is working out great.
12:46
Anything you need their question mark and if you really want to be a best about it, you can follow up with the person on the favour.
You did provide more value on the next time you talk to them.
And then in that call making ask, you got to ask.
And the thing is, is if that person is not willing to give you anything back then, cool.
13:04
You probably stop getting to them.
And the thing is that.
There's a thing.
Is I want to say it's the go-giver.
I don't know what book.
It was pretty.
They basically there's Game Theory with givers matches and takers.
Yeah, give and take.
There you go.
And so givers move faster in life, because they get opportunities that matches and takers don't.
13:22
And that also means that the majority of people are matches in takers, which means that if you are a giver, it means you will be taking advantage of more times than you will get anything back, but you still make more From the few times that you do invest in another giver.
And so that's why, when givers recognize givers they stay home, he's for life, and then they go out of their way to always try and out give one another and then both people go up.
13:46
That's the kind of community you want.
And that's why it takes time to build a network of people that are actually valuable.
But in the meantime, you can still do Tit for Tat with the matters, right?
They'll give you something back it'll probably be less than what you gave them.
That's okay.
Because the thing is that every time you get something Add it to your stack.
14:05
And so means you give even more to the next out, which means they're more indebted to you and then they give you something back in the use at it.
So, it's like, you're a treasure collector of skills and then you can start wheeling and dealing with anyone because you're a skeleton key of value.
Whatever lock you need, I've got you, which means you can provide even more targeted value to people, which means they can give you even something more, targeted back.
14:26
So, in the very beginning, I knew how to run a gym, I knew how to do training and fitness stuff.
And so like the skills that I use most commonly, You were helping people with workout stuff helping people with nutrition stuff, but rather than be like, yeah, I can help you out that.
Well, hop on a phone call.
I would like make them an entire meal plan grocery list food, preparation instructions, I would give them everything I did as though, they were a full client and then I'd hop on the call.
14:48
Yeah, put the stuff together and then they'd be like, holy shit, same thing with the training.
I'm like hey and if you want I'll walk you through this entire workout.
I'll show you how to do it and then they come out and I do that they're like dude how can I like we're good man.
I just want to help you out.
Like and I did like, you have Also want to help people out because then today you're going to die is like a matter anyways.
15:07
But that was one of the skill sets ahead and then from a business perspective like no one really cared about running a gym for all the people who are not in the gym industry.
So if I wanted to connect with people outside the do ministry, well what was the one skill?
I had that transfer, I knew how to run local ads.
So I taught some people that because I was one of the things I could barter with and for most people under how to sell and that was something that was probably my most commercially viable skill which was arguably the most valuable skill I had at the time.
15:31
And so like think about it how much do you pay a personal trainer?
For a training session, how much do you pay somebody to help you fix your sales process?
A lot more for the guy to help you fix your sales process.
So that was usually, that was my most valuable skill that I had developed.
And so, that was the one I traded with most often.
And so, I could walk into a company already.
15:47
Already went through your entire funnel.
Already saw your follow-up sequences, like I hopped on the phone with one of your guys.
I recorded here.
Did, you know, they were saying that they're like, oh my God.
You're like, yeah.
Don't worry about.
So anyways, I think this would be a better framework for how you could walk through it.
If you want, I'm happy to hop on the phone with your team and walk them through it.
16:03
Do a couple calls.
That just kind of like, make sure they're getting it when you do that.
Do you think the person whose business you did that for?
It will not try and offer to help you in some way.
Of course they will.
And if you're like dude, I don't know how to run YouTube ads.
I only know how to run Facebook ads, they're like dude, whatever you need.
16:19
I've got you will hop on.
I'll like I'll fly out or record the ads with you.
I'll make sure you get it right.
That's how you provide value people like.
That's how you get connected to people.
Who are out of you, is that you actually have value.
Which means that step one, get a skill and then you keep trading that skill to have.
More skills and so that you can trade it more valuable skill to somebody who needs it.
16:37
And it's the opportunity.
If Joe Rogan for whatever reason wanted to reach out to me because he was like, I really want to know how you target low.
Mid-market companies for minority, investments in, how you run your portfolio.
I would jump because at that point, I have a perfectly match skill for the thing that he needs.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
You have to prioritize being rich which means spending less because you were not valuing the opinion of other people over your own which because you respect your own approval more than that of other people, you have to be willing to die to the opinion of others rather than dying to depend on yourself.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:38
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I'm going to talk to you about the 28 ways to stay poor and the reason I'm framing it that way is because Charlie Munger my personal hero had a seminal talk that he gave multiple times on how to live a miserable life.
0:55
And the reason he gives it that way, is that he believes in a process called inversion thinking, which is where you solve problems in reverse, For example, if you want to have a good marriage rather than asking the question, how do I look in marriage?
You ask the question, how would a destroy my marriage and then you list out all the ways to destroy your marriage?
1:11
And then you do the exact opposite of that.
And what's interesting is that our brains are much better at finding problems than they are finding Solutions.
And so, what we do is we harness this innate ability that, we have to find the problems and then after finding every possible problem, we can imagine every threat imaginable which evolutionary were designed to look for then flip that in Reverse to find our Solutions, all right?
1:32
And this is a Process of thinking that I've applied to business.
I've applied it to marriage applied, a lot of different aspects of my life and I would encourage you to do it as well.
I'll talk about the 28 ways to stay poor, all right, if you don't know who I am, I am jacquimo Zio an acquisition.com to portfolio of companies that is over $100 a year and I've nothing to sell you.
1:47
I make these videos because I have a lot of fun doing it and I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed.
Making them for you.
Alright, so the first and best way to stay poor is to start tomorrow.
So whatever it is that you want to do whether it's losing weight, saving money, starting that business, whatever it is, is to start tomorrow.
2:02
All right, so that's the best thing you can do to stay porch to start tomorrow.
Okay.
The next one is to read lots of books and then do nothing.
All right?
Because it's one of the, you know, lots of people talk about reading books and I see people all the time that I've seen for years in the exact same position posting every.
Oh, yeah, I'm reading 52 books this year.
2:18
That's why we commitment instead of reading 52 books maybe just read one book and actually do something about it.
Crazy.
I know number three, take advice from poor people on how to be rich.
Alright, so think about that for a second.
A lot of us around ourselves or at least I did when I was starting out surround ourselves with people who are very poor and we listen to their advice on how to be rich and they have no idea what they are doing and we also listen to their judgment on why our idea is stupid, even though they are poor.
2:49
So what would they know, right?
So number three, take advice, from poor people on how to be rich.
Number four, this is a big one, pick a spouse who will make you feel guilty for working.
Alright, so you have your dreams, you've these things you want to pursue.
But this person is saying, you shouldn't do that.
3:04
You need to be doing X Y & Z, blah, blah blah, and then you feel like you need to compromise your dreams for that person.
The problem is that you put your power of your destiny, in their hands and you're asking for permission instead of support, right?
Because the end of the day, if you don't accomplish your dreams and you did it because of them, who do you think you're going to resent, right?
3:22
So you owe to yourself and you owe it to your marriage to a pick people who are going to support you in your dreams even if they don't necessarily agree, right?
But more easily not put your power in somebody.
Else number five fail once quit forever.
All right, so as soon as you do actually start to decide doing something you feel immediately, say up, I guess, this isn't for me, I guess.
3:43
Success is in for megas businesses in, for Mega sales, isn't for me, I guess whatever.
The thing is isn't for me because you felt once, but it's because we have a weave, an incorrect view of failure, right?
Because failure is a necessary part and the things that you learn from failure.
And so, it's either you win or you learn, right?
But that is the fifth thing you want to do, if you want to stay poor forever.
4:01
Number six is think.
The world is fair.
So a lot of us, especially me earlier on, like, I would complain.
I'll be like, that's not fair.
This is fair.
It shouldn't be this way.
Blah blah, blah blah.
And the thing is is that all that complaining that I did did nothing at all whatsoever, did nothing.
And so the thing is, there's no activity that comes from blaming your circumstances which just so happens to be the seventh one of, how does a porous blame your circumstances and complain alright, complaining about things that you cannot control.
4:31
And the thing is, It's like these sound so obvious, but think about these in Reverse again.
So if the contrary of thinking the world is fair, is assumed the world is unfair and then act accordingly.
Instead of blaming your circumstances.
You think your circumstances for who you are and what they gave you right?
4:49
You are who you are because of the shouldn't you have gone through, right?
There's there's a saying your message, your message and I think it's a very, it's a, very beautiful.
Seg because how sad would it be to wish to have a life of ease and comfort?
Because strong Dr. Is built through hard times.
And so, if we want to have strong character, we basically must have a hard life for periods of time or four seasons and so we can't lament the thing that creates the outcome.
5:13
You can't Lament The Heat and the beating of the hammer to strengthen the steel, right?
They go hand-in-hand and so we just have to accept them for what they are.
And as for complaining, I think you can just accept and move on, right?
So number nine, I covered through their number nine, expect the government to save you.
5:31
All right, that's a great way to stay poor.
Or expect the government to save you or given set expect other people to save you.
The reality is no one's going to save you except for you.
And a lot of times many people have spent their entire lives waiting around for someone to save them and still stay poor.
Number 10 value, the opinion of others, over your own.
5:49
It's an excellent way to stay poor.
All right?
You think everyone else's opinions matter more than yours and I'll give you a secret.
That it took me, you know, making a lot of money to then realize which is you are successful.
The moment you say you are Crazy, right?
Like you are successful, the moment that you decide you are successful.
6:07
There are people who are billionaires, who don't feel like they're successful.
And there are people who have almost no money, and absolutely think that they're an amazing success.
And the thing is that they are both, right?
It's our choice, right?
And I can promise you that if you try and give yourself a number, you will just move the goalposts.
I promise you that, from the depth of my soul, you will move the number and make something else the new goal.
6:26
And once that once I am rich then whatever, right?
But it's a win, then fallacy.
It doesn't.
It's not true.
So you can accept and you can become successful today.
Because, if you look at yourself compared to people in a much worse off scenario, they would love to have your life and so you just need to decide for yourself.
6:43
If you are successful in the thing is to success is a process rather than an outcome.
And so you can be successful in that you are living your values of pursuit that can mean success.
If you choose to Define that way.
So number 11, way to stay poor, avoid discomfort.
7:00
All right.
A lot of us, you know, we have new things.
To take risks.
You have to learn things and it's uncomfortable as you will suck, right?
Of course, you will suck.
It's normal to suck.
But people avoid discomfort because they don't want to go through that, and it's so silly.
The discomfort that they're feeling is the Judgment.
They impose upon themselves about not being good at something they've never done before.
7:17
How insane is that Barry?
That's why humans are also kind of insane when you think about the things that we do in the things that we think, right?
And so, great way to stay, poor is to avoid discomfort of all kinds, right?
You also guarantee the number one discomfort, which is that you don't accomplish What you want in your life, 12, how to say poor tolerate mediocrity from yourself and others.
7:38
Alright?
So as you start to grow if you're growing you know a small business or even in the workplace, if you tolerate mediocrity from others, you will beget more mediocrity and people over time.
We'll just degrade and get worse and worse over time.
Rather than the reverse of that of thinking, like, I will only tolerate excellence and anything below that is intolerable.
7:58
If you think about the best leaders in the best CEOs, the most successful people vault I'm they have this innate trait, right, for lack of leadership, there ball-busters, right?
They hold a standard that and here's the catch that they themselves stay above, which means you must raise your own standards so that you can model what it looks like for other people around you to hold themselves right at the best.
8:19
Like, most people need to be let most people need a model and they can see that, right?
And you're leading, by example.
And so best thing to do is tape or tolerate mediocrity from yourself and others 13.
How to speak or make promises break promises.
8:36
So you make promises to yourself, made promises to other people and you destroy your reputation with other people and that's a terrible thing and it takes a long time to fix that but the one that's the hardest one to fix is the reputation.
You have with yourself, right?
You make promises to yourself.
You break promises to yourself because the thing is you were the only one who's holding you accountable and I think a different version of happiness.
8:54
In my opinion is respect for oneself and I think your own respect is the hardest to earn because you know how hard you could have pushed.
Pushed, you know, if you could have gone for an extra mile, you could have showed up to the gym more times.
You could have eaten better, you could have made more cold calls.
You could have done what reach out.
You could have made more content, you could have actually left a nice note for somebody on your team.
9:13
When you, when you were too tired to do.
So you could have over delivered on the product, you could have made a better version of that video and you decided to put it up anyways, even though you knew it wasn't as good as it could have been.
And so, you make promises to yourself and then you break promises yourself.
And you lose respect in the process.
It's an excellent way to stay poor.
9:29
Number 14.
Wait for perfect conditions.
All right, this is a great one.
Great way to stay poor is, it's one of my favorites.
You got to wait for everything to be perfectly aligned for you to be successful.
And here's the secret, there are never going to be perfect conditions.
And here's what's even crazier.
9:47
If you need perfect conditions to be successful, the moment, the conditions change, you will stop being successful.
So you might as well start.
When the conditions are at their absolute worst because it means that they will only get better from there.
And if you can prove success when things get bad, when they get, Bad again, which is guaranteed?
10:03
You will still remain successful because you have learned how to do it in this time.
In this circumstance, make sense.
Great reason to not wait for perfect conditions. 15 prioritize looking Rich over being rich.
This is a classic one of poor folks in general.
10:19
Right?
I get the, the loving amount of troll comments.
I get it from the fact that I'm in my mama's basement and wearing a wife beater and wearing a nose strip.
Right must mean that I am poor, of course, right?
Because you can fuse Looking rich with being rich, right?
Just silly, you just Google my name and just put private Equity at Jim launched, an American Pacific group and you can see what we sold to our businesses for.
10:40
All right, so the point is, the point is you have to prioritize being rich, which means spending less for a long period of time because you were not valuing the opinion of other people over your own which because you respect your own approval more than that of other people, you have to be willing to die to the opinion of others, rather than dying to the opinion of yourself.
10:59
I mean, that it's real.
Oh shit, stop trying to look rich.
Be willing to look poor.
All right, I know this contrary to like dress the part and all that stuff but like the thing is is like you got to be real to you.
We're going to be really knowing that's a promise.
All right.
11:15
Number 16 avoid working on what matters most our this is a great way to stay.
Poor.
Is that you work all day long?
You're busy, you're full of activity, you're doing stuff and nothing important moves forward because the nature of speed Not about activity, the people who are the riches the world are doing the most stuff right there, doing the right stuff right there, making sure better stated making sure the right stuff gets done in general whether or not it's them or someone else.
11:42
All right?
And so it's looking at the many things that you can work could do and picking the very few that are the ones that move the needle, the most and typically, they're the ones that you do not want to do.
When you are procrastinating on, you can probably eliminate all the stuff that give you.
The mental masturbation of getting stuff done without actually moving the ball forward.
12:00
Towards your goals.
So it's a great way to stay poor.
It's just keep doing stuff that does not matter 17.
Say you're going to do something and then don't do it.
This is just like making breaking promises to others and self but this one is actually just like that.
So, take that 18, this is a really good one.
12:19
Great way to stay.
Poor is do what everyone else is doing, right?
Because if you're doing what everyone else is doing, most people are not in the 1%.
If you want to be in the 1% you can't do what not 99% of people are doing.
Is hard for people which is why you can't value their opinions.
Because again, talking to poor people about how to get rich, is a great way to stay poor, right?
12:38
They have no idea.
And so you can't look for their approval on what you are doing or model, what everyone else is doing because everyone else is poor.
Why model them real quick guys?
You guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
12:54
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money feed their Please make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
13:15
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
Right.
Think about number 19, do your best, Not What It Takes because the route is a lot of times your best May suck and what is required is, what is required and that may be Beyond you which means you must become better.
13:34
So that your best is beyond what is required because the number of people who say, well, I tried my best.
Universe doesn't give a shit.
The marketplace doesn't give a shit.
Your boss doesn't give a shit.
What they care about is what is required until you have to do is figure out what is required and then if you are incapable of doing it be better.
13:54
And do it for long enough, that would be unreasonable for you, not to be good and then your best will surpass, what is required and you will become better in the process.
But if you don't do that, it's an excellent way to stay porous.
Just keep doing your best and giving yourself a pat on the back and say, I tried 20 talk, more do less post about your goals post about your affirmations spend all day doing routines and stuff of getting prepared to work and actually do very little.
14:21
All right, it's a great way.
This is one of the favorite ones, especially in the internet Community.
People love talking about how much they're working rather than actually getting shit done.
So I would advise you to rather than spend all this time preparing to work and creating superstitions and routines around the things that you think you should do in order to maybe put Eventually get something done, start with the doing because sometimes doing just needs done 21.
14:46
Start something new today.
Start something new tomorrow.
Repeat, great way to stay.
Poor do stuff, try something.
Try something else.
Try something else, try something else.
Always leave half built Bridges, right?
You never complete anything.
You start.
Just keep starting new things because it's exciting and it's new.
15:04
And you have what is called uninformed optimism?
Because as soon as you jump, The new thing, you realize that it will take work and the things that were awesome about it, also have downsides, which is the work that is required to be good.
And as soon as you realize that his work, you go through the change cycle, you go uninformed optimism to informed pessimism and then you go through the valley of Despair.
15:25
And this is where everyone then jumps to the next opportunity.
All right?
And they just to this forever and they just never achieve what they want.
So to accident way to stay busy and poor, all right, just keep trying new stuff and never see anything.
I'm through okay number 22, believe what other people think about you or than what you think about you.
15:45
All right, it's a great way to stay poor.
I think it's just it's easily stated there.
So I'm not going to belabor the point, but that's what you need to do to stay poor.
Just keep believing when everyone else thinks about you, and I'll let you think about you, all right, excellent way to do it number 23, way to stay poor, make a mistake, then wait, repeat the mistake, do it again and again and again and you've probably seen people who Stuck in their life, like this, like the keep dating the same person, they keep making the same business mistake.
16:12
They keeps getting the same bad Partnerships, whatever, right?
Or they keep trying to do something that stopped working and they keep doing it over and over again, because they think that for some reason that's going to work somehow or they just don't have the wherewithal to realize they keep making the same mistake.
And so, if you keep doing the same stuff, you're going to keep getting the same outcomes, right?
16:29
Like we kind of know this, but the thing is that people still do it, it's like well, whatever you're doing right now is gotten you to being poor, so don't do that.
Ooh, that right?
And when I say poor poor can be whatever you want it to be, you could be a billionaire before, it might be, whatever, whatever that amount is, is not as much as you want it to be right?
16:47
Which of course gets into the deep things of like, maybe you should decide not to want it to begin with and then whatever we won't get into that.
Number 24, be replaceable.
All right, this is a great way to stay poor because if I heard this from Navarro of a kind of like a lot, which is, if you can get a degree to do the job, you're never gonna be on Wealthy doing because everyone can do it, right?
17:06
And so you have to be able to learn things that other people can't do.
Right?
And that they're in makes you Irreplaceable or less replaceable, right?
The very least.
Last replaceable you want to be replaceable by a Marketplace of people lined up behind.
You ready to take your job and do it for Less.
All right, because they're also poor and they are willing to do it for last.
17:23
Just terrible way to do business.
It's also an excellent way to stay poor though.
Do what everyone else is doing?
Do it For Less unless you have an operational strategy which is, you know, like Walmart and whatever.
And that's probably not you right now.
So number 25, way to stay poor.
Find something that works.
17:38
Dear God, find something that works and then stop doing it.
Think about it.
How many of you have needed to make money last minute you had to pay payroll?
Yet to pay taxes.
You had some Bill unexpected, you know, surgery iPhone, whatever, right?
Some Bill comes up and you need to pay for it and you find a way to make money.
17:57
Because if you're watching this video, still alive, right?
So you found a way to find a way to pay for it.
What did you do there?
When you needed to make money?
You're so messed up.
You were willing to make money and you had the ability to make money when it was for someone else.
Else not for yourself, think about that, you have the ability, you knew what to do and you just chose not to do it.
18:15
You stop doing it.
As soon as you pay someone else's bills because you were willing to pay other people's bills in that your own interesting which leads me to one of the most retweets had recently which is most people know what to do to achieve their goals.
Most people do know what to do people like I don't know how to lose weight like a you do stop.
You can should move.
18:32
You know, you know that you want to make money.
Start making calls, start reaching out to people.
Start promoting the thing that you were trying to sell.
I mean, not complicated.
I got this thing.
You want to try it.
No, cool.
Talk somebody else got this thing.
You want to try it?
No, cool call somebody else, but it's not, it's not a complex.
18:48
Is not complicated, but people just don't do it.
It's because they're not willing to do it, right?
And so actually thing to do, find something that works a lot of you do know something that works and then stop doing number 26.
We're rounding off.
We got two more.
Higher dumb, people.
19:04
Excellent way to stay poor and have a bad business.
All right.
Really, really highly recommend.
It's also really good for if you have a job to, if you have the ability to hire people, hire dumb people.
It's just it's just a great way to make your life miserable.
There's very few ways that are better than this one.
Like if you just want to be surrounded by people just hire, people didn't just hire people.
19:21
Don't when you, you know, I mean and you'll feel good, but you'll be poor and so don't do that.
Number 27 is a huge one that I see all the Time.
First thing Port it's a really good strategy.
Might be one of the top ones on this list assume you are.
19:38
Always right?
How many people here right?
You're watching this know someone who always just think they're right and they're not successful.
They get advice from somebody who might be successful or unsuccessful, then they're like no that's not going to work for X y&z right because they assume they're always right, they know.
19:54
They assume they know everything.
Well, if you know everything, then why aren't you doing what you want?
Hmm.
And I will tell you this from the people that I've met who have Too far ahead of me, they have a voracious desire2learn, and a voracious interest in learning from anyone.
And every single possible Source they can.
20:11
And those people have the humility to say that everyone knows something that they don't know.
And so in that way, they can learn of them which is I think an Emerson quote, if you cannot learn.
Then what's the point, right?
It's the same thing.
As, as the saying he who chooses not to read is no further ahead than the men who cannot read write.
20:30
And so, it's like, The man who chooses not to learn from others, is no dissimilar from the person who is disabled from learning from others, right?
So you give yourself 0 advantages, like, there's no way that you can learn from other people if you think you're always right.
20:48
And I know this sounds fucking obvious, but a lot of you guys do this.
Why like, you'd rather be right than be rich and it's silly, but it's an excellent way to stay poor.
So that's why it's number 27.
And then, the last one in this is the simplest of the economics around it.
21:03
I'm just going to drive this baby home is.
Make money period, spend more than you make.
And the Beautiful part about this is that it doesn't matter how much you make.
If you spend more than it, you can be Port, which is why this is such a great one.
It's a great way to stay porous.
It's matter how much you increase your income, just spend more than you made, right?
21:20
Go into debt.
Get adjust your lifestyle to your new income at all times, or rather above your income.
So that you can always stay poor.
No matter how much money you make.
It's an awesome way to stay poor.
So I highly recommend doing that and honestly, the more you can do it, the more you can outspend your income, the poor, you will be.
21:38
And so again, highly recommend it and it sounds silly.
But, you know, a few people like right now, I think it's like the bottom 50% of America, like, doesn't have any savings.
And what's crazy is that like you can, you can control like these Controllable like you can always downgrade your lifestyle but the thing is you care more about the opinions of others and you let your own right?
21:56
You care more about looking worse than being rich, right?
All these things and that's why all of these things go together.
And so to wrap this up, the reason that inversion thinking is so powerful is that we can use our brains to find threats more easily than we can find Solutions.
And so, if we think about your business career, when you think about your marriage, you think about your body or you think about whatever it is, your money goals, think about the ways to destroy it, I just gave you Twenty, Eight different ways that you can be poor, right?
22:21
Right?
When you reverse them and you make those the rules for living that you have.
Then what happens is you succeed by accident?
Because you avoid the pitfalls because the thing is, if you don't make many mistakes, you succeed without trying because all you're doing is just focusing on, just not making these stupid mistakes that most people do, right?
22:39
If we were to reverse these and this is what I'm going to hit this with hard, enjoy, we're hitting it right now.
Start today, read books, do the stuff that's in the books take advice from rich people and how to be rich pick a spouse who makes you feel.
Awesome about working.
Phil wants to try again.
22:55
Think the world is unfair and act accordingly.
Never blame your circumstances.
Think your circumstances for making you who you are?
Instead of complaining, do something expect, no one to save you, except for yourself, value your opinion, over those of other people seek out discomfort tolerate, nothing but Excellence, make promises, keep promises wait for the worst conditions.
23:19
We for imperfect conditions and act.
Anyways, on what you want, right?
Avoid working on the stuff, that doesn't matter work on the things that matter.
Most ignore the rest say, you're going to do something and then do it, do what?
No one else is doing.
Do your best and make it above what it takes to be successful.
23:40
Talk less do more start something new today and keep at it until you are good.
Do it so long that it would be unreasonable for you to be bad.
Believe what other people think about you more than what you think about yourself?
Be Irreplaceable.
23:56
Find something that works and don't stop doing it.
Keep doing it until you're bored out of your mind because you're so good at doing that thing that worked.
All right, hire smart.
People assume that you are always wrong and be willing to learn and make money and spend less than you make.
24:14
And that is the 28th rules of poverty flipped on its head and you can make your own conclusions about where that will take you.
I love you.
Mo Z Nation.
Keeping awesome.
I'll see you guys next video.








0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
You have to prioritize being rich which means spending less because you were not valuing the opinion of other people over your own which because you respect your own approval more than that of other people, you have to be willing to die to the opinion of others rather than dying to depend on yourself.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:38
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I'm going to talk to you about the 28 ways to stay poor and the reason I'm framing it that way is because Charlie Munger my personal hero had a seminal talk that he gave multiple times on how to live a miserable life.
0:55
And the reason he gives it that way, is that he believes in a process called inversion thinking, which is where you solve problems in reverse, For example, if you want to have a good marriage rather than asking the question, how do I look in marriage?
You ask the question, how would a destroy my marriage and then you list out all the ways to destroy your marriage?
1:11
And then you do the exact opposite of that.
And what's interesting is that our brains are much better at finding problems than they are finding Solutions.
And so, what we do is we harness this innate ability that, we have to find the problems and then after finding every possible problem, we can imagine every threat imaginable which evolutionary were designed to look for then flip that in Reverse to find our Solutions, all right?
1:32
And this is a Process of thinking that I've applied to business.
I've applied it to marriage applied, a lot of different aspects of my life and I would encourage you to do it as well.
I'll talk about the 28 ways to stay poor, all right, if you don't know who I am, I am jacquimo Zio an acquisition.com to portfolio of companies that is over $100 a year and I've nothing to sell you.
1:47
I make these videos because I have a lot of fun doing it and I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed.
Making them for you.
Alright, so the first and best way to stay poor is to start tomorrow.
So whatever it is that you want to do whether it's losing weight, saving money, starting that business, whatever it is, is to start tomorrow.
2:02
All right, so that's the best thing you can do to stay porch to start tomorrow.
Okay.
The next one is to read lots of books and then do nothing.
All right?
Because it's one of the, you know, lots of people talk about reading books and I see people all the time that I've seen for years in the exact same position posting every.
Oh, yeah, I'm reading 52 books this year.
2:18
That's why we commitment instead of reading 52 books maybe just read one book and actually do something about it.
Crazy.
I know number three, take advice from poor people on how to be rich.
Alright, so think about that for a second.
A lot of us around ourselves or at least I did when I was starting out surround ourselves with people who are very poor and we listen to their advice on how to be rich and they have no idea what they are doing and we also listen to their judgment on why our idea is stupid, even though they are poor.
2:49
So what would they know, right?
So number three, take advice, from poor people on how to be rich.
Number four, this is a big one, pick a spouse who will make you feel guilty for working.
Alright, so you have your dreams, you've these things you want to pursue.
But this person is saying, you shouldn't do that.
3:04
You need to be doing X Y & Z, blah, blah blah, and then you feel like you need to compromise your dreams for that person.
The problem is that you put your power of your destiny, in their hands and you're asking for permission instead of support, right?
Because the end of the day, if you don't accomplish your dreams and you did it because of them, who do you think you're going to resent, right?
3:22
So you owe to yourself and you owe it to your marriage to a pick people who are going to support you in your dreams even if they don't necessarily agree, right?
But more easily not put your power in somebody.
Else number five fail once quit forever.
All right, so as soon as you do actually start to decide doing something you feel immediately, say up, I guess, this isn't for me, I guess.
3:43
Success is in for megas businesses in, for Mega sales, isn't for me, I guess whatever.
The thing is isn't for me because you felt once, but it's because we have a weave, an incorrect view of failure, right?
Because failure is a necessary part and the things that you learn from failure.
And so, it's either you win or you learn, right?
But that is the fifth thing you want to do, if you want to stay poor forever.
4:01
Number six is think.
The world is fair.
So a lot of us, especially me earlier on, like, I would complain.
I'll be like, that's not fair.
This is fair.
It shouldn't be this way.
Blah blah, blah blah.
And the thing is is that all that complaining that I did did nothing at all whatsoever, did nothing.
And so the thing is, there's no activity that comes from blaming your circumstances which just so happens to be the seventh one of, how does a porous blame your circumstances and complain alright, complaining about things that you cannot control.
4:31
And the thing is, It's like these sound so obvious, but think about these in Reverse again.
So if the contrary of thinking the world is fair, is assumed the world is unfair and then act accordingly.
Instead of blaming your circumstances.
You think your circumstances for who you are and what they gave you right?
4:49
You are who you are because of the shouldn't you have gone through, right?
There's there's a saying your message, your message and I think it's a very, it's a, very beautiful.
Seg because how sad would it be to wish to have a life of ease and comfort?
Because strong Dr. Is built through hard times.
And so, if we want to have strong character, we basically must have a hard life for periods of time or four seasons and so we can't lament the thing that creates the outcome.
5:13
You can't Lament The Heat and the beating of the hammer to strengthen the steel, right?
They go hand-in-hand and so we just have to accept them for what they are.
And as for complaining, I think you can just accept and move on, right?
So number nine, I covered through their number nine, expect the government to save you.
5:31
All right, that's a great way to stay poor.
Or expect the government to save you or given set expect other people to save you.
The reality is no one's going to save you except for you.
And a lot of times many people have spent their entire lives waiting around for someone to save them and still stay poor.
Number 10 value, the opinion of others, over your own.
5:49
It's an excellent way to stay poor.
All right?
You think everyone else's opinions matter more than yours and I'll give you a secret.
That it took me, you know, making a lot of money to then realize which is you are successful.
The moment you say you are Crazy, right?
Like you are successful, the moment that you decide you are successful.
6:07
There are people who are billionaires, who don't feel like they're successful.
And there are people who have almost no money, and absolutely think that they're an amazing success.
And the thing is that they are both, right?
It's our choice, right?
And I can promise you that if you try and give yourself a number, you will just move the goalposts.
I promise you that, from the depth of my soul, you will move the number and make something else the new goal.
6:26
And once that once I am rich then whatever, right?
But it's a win, then fallacy.
It doesn't.
It's not true.
So you can accept and you can become successful today.
Because, if you look at yourself compared to people in a much worse off scenario, they would love to have your life and so you just need to decide for yourself.
6:43
If you are successful in the thing is to success is a process rather than an outcome.
And so you can be successful in that you are living your values of pursuit that can mean success.
If you choose to Define that way.
So number 11, way to stay poor, avoid discomfort.
7:00
All right.
A lot of us, you know, we have new things.
To take risks.
You have to learn things and it's uncomfortable as you will suck, right?
Of course, you will suck.
It's normal to suck.
But people avoid discomfort because they don't want to go through that, and it's so silly.
The discomfort that they're feeling is the Judgment.
They impose upon themselves about not being good at something they've never done before.
7:17
How insane is that Barry?
That's why humans are also kind of insane when you think about the things that we do in the things that we think, right?
And so, great way to stay, poor is to avoid discomfort of all kinds, right?
You also guarantee the number one discomfort, which is that you don't accomplish What you want in your life, 12, how to say poor tolerate mediocrity from yourself and others.
7:38
Alright?
So as you start to grow if you're growing you know a small business or even in the workplace, if you tolerate mediocrity from others, you will beget more mediocrity and people over time.
We'll just degrade and get worse and worse over time.
Rather than the reverse of that of thinking, like, I will only tolerate excellence and anything below that is intolerable.
7:58
If you think about the best leaders in the best CEOs, the most successful people vault I'm they have this innate trait, right, for lack of leadership, there ball-busters, right?
They hold a standard that and here's the catch that they themselves stay above, which means you must raise your own standards so that you can model what it looks like for other people around you to hold themselves right at the best.
8:19
Like, most people need to be let most people need a model and they can see that, right?
And you're leading, by example.
And so best thing to do is tape or tolerate mediocrity from yourself and others 13.
How to speak or make promises break promises.
8:36
So you make promises to yourself, made promises to other people and you destroy your reputation with other people and that's a terrible thing and it takes a long time to fix that but the one that's the hardest one to fix is the reputation.
You have with yourself, right?
You make promises to yourself.
You break promises to yourself because the thing is you were the only one who's holding you accountable and I think a different version of happiness.
8:54
In my opinion is respect for oneself and I think your own respect is the hardest to earn because you know how hard you could have pushed.
Pushed, you know, if you could have gone for an extra mile, you could have showed up to the gym more times.
You could have eaten better, you could have made more cold calls.
You could have done what reach out.
You could have made more content, you could have actually left a nice note for somebody on your team.
9:13
When you, when you were too tired to do.
So you could have over delivered on the product, you could have made a better version of that video and you decided to put it up anyways, even though you knew it wasn't as good as it could have been.
And so, you make promises to yourself and then you break promises yourself.
And you lose respect in the process.
It's an excellent way to stay poor.
9:29
Number 14.
Wait for perfect conditions.
All right, this is a great one.
Great way to stay poor is, it's one of my favorites.
You got to wait for everything to be perfectly aligned for you to be successful.
And here's the secret, there are never going to be perfect conditions.
And here's what's even crazier.
9:47
If you need perfect conditions to be successful, the moment, the conditions change, you will stop being successful.
So you might as well start.
When the conditions are at their absolute worst because it means that they will only get better from there.
And if you can prove success when things get bad, when they get, Bad again, which is guaranteed?
10:03
You will still remain successful because you have learned how to do it in this time.
In this circumstance, make sense.
Great reason to not wait for perfect conditions. 15 prioritize looking Rich over being rich.
This is a classic one of poor folks in general.
10:19
Right?
I get the, the loving amount of troll comments.
I get it from the fact that I'm in my mama's basement and wearing a wife beater and wearing a nose strip.
Right must mean that I am poor, of course, right?
Because you can fuse Looking rich with being rich, right?
Just silly, you just Google my name and just put private Equity at Jim launched, an American Pacific group and you can see what we sold to our businesses for.
10:40
All right, so the point is, the point is you have to prioritize being rich, which means spending less for a long period of time because you were not valuing the opinion of other people over your own which because you respect your own approval more than that of other people, you have to be willing to die to the opinion of others, rather than dying to the opinion of yourself.
10:59
I mean, that it's real.
Oh shit, stop trying to look rich.
Be willing to look poor.
All right, I know this contrary to like dress the part and all that stuff but like the thing is is like you got to be real to you.
We're going to be really knowing that's a promise.
All right.
11:15
Number 16 avoid working on what matters most our this is a great way to stay.
Poor.
Is that you work all day long?
You're busy, you're full of activity, you're doing stuff and nothing important moves forward because the nature of speed Not about activity, the people who are the riches the world are doing the most stuff right there, doing the right stuff right there, making sure better stated making sure the right stuff gets done in general whether or not it's them or someone else.
11:42
All right?
And so it's looking at the many things that you can work could do and picking the very few that are the ones that move the needle, the most and typically, they're the ones that you do not want to do.
When you are procrastinating on, you can probably eliminate all the stuff that give you.
The mental masturbation of getting stuff done without actually moving the ball forward.
12:00
Towards your goals.
So it's a great way to stay poor.
It's just keep doing stuff that does not matter 17.
Say you're going to do something and then don't do it.
This is just like making breaking promises to others and self but this one is actually just like that.
So, take that 18, this is a really good one.
12:19
Great way to stay.
Poor is do what everyone else is doing, right?
Because if you're doing what everyone else is doing, most people are not in the 1%.
If you want to be in the 1% you can't do what not 99% of people are doing.
Is hard for people which is why you can't value their opinions.
Because again, talking to poor people about how to get rich, is a great way to stay poor, right?
12:38
They have no idea.
And so you can't look for their approval on what you are doing or model, what everyone else is doing because everyone else is poor.
Why model them real quick guys?
You guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
12:54
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money feed their Please make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
13:15
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
Right.
Think about number 19, do your best, Not What It Takes because the route is a lot of times your best May suck and what is required is, what is required and that may be Beyond you which means you must become better.
13:34
So that your best is beyond what is required because the number of people who say, well, I tried my best.
Universe doesn't give a shit.
The marketplace doesn't give a shit.
Your boss doesn't give a shit.
What they care about is what is required until you have to do is figure out what is required and then if you are incapable of doing it be better.
13:54
And do it for long enough, that would be unreasonable for you, not to be good and then your best will surpass, what is required and you will become better in the process.
But if you don't do that, it's an excellent way to stay porous.
Just keep doing your best and giving yourself a pat on the back and say, I tried 20 talk, more do less post about your goals post about your affirmations spend all day doing routines and stuff of getting prepared to work and actually do very little.
14:21
All right, it's a great way.
This is one of the favorite ones, especially in the internet Community.
People love talking about how much they're working rather than actually getting shit done.
So I would advise you to rather than spend all this time preparing to work and creating superstitions and routines around the things that you think you should do in order to maybe put Eventually get something done, start with the doing because sometimes doing just needs done 21.
14:46
Start something new today.
Start something new tomorrow.
Repeat, great way to stay.
Poor do stuff, try something.
Try something else.
Try something else, try something else.
Always leave half built Bridges, right?
You never complete anything.
You start.
Just keep starting new things because it's exciting and it's new.
15:04
And you have what is called uninformed optimism?
Because as soon as you jump, The new thing, you realize that it will take work and the things that were awesome about it, also have downsides, which is the work that is required to be good.
And as soon as you realize that his work, you go through the change cycle, you go uninformed optimism to informed pessimism and then you go through the valley of Despair.
15:25
And this is where everyone then jumps to the next opportunity.
All right?
And they just to this forever and they just never achieve what they want.
So to accident way to stay busy and poor, all right, just keep trying new stuff and never see anything.
I'm through okay number 22, believe what other people think about you or than what you think about you.
15:45
All right, it's a great way to stay poor.
I think it's just it's easily stated there.
So I'm not going to belabor the point, but that's what you need to do to stay poor.
Just keep believing when everyone else thinks about you, and I'll let you think about you, all right, excellent way to do it number 23, way to stay poor, make a mistake, then wait, repeat the mistake, do it again and again and again and you've probably seen people who Stuck in their life, like this, like the keep dating the same person, they keep making the same business mistake.
16:12
They keeps getting the same bad Partnerships, whatever, right?
Or they keep trying to do something that stopped working and they keep doing it over and over again, because they think that for some reason that's going to work somehow or they just don't have the wherewithal to realize they keep making the same mistake.
And so, if you keep doing the same stuff, you're going to keep getting the same outcomes, right?
16:29
Like we kind of know this, but the thing is that people still do it, it's like well, whatever you're doing right now is gotten you to being poor, so don't do that.
Ooh, that right?
And when I say poor poor can be whatever you want it to be, you could be a billionaire before, it might be, whatever, whatever that amount is, is not as much as you want it to be right?
16:47
Which of course gets into the deep things of like, maybe you should decide not to want it to begin with and then whatever we won't get into that.
Number 24, be replaceable.
All right, this is a great way to stay poor because if I heard this from Navarro of a kind of like a lot, which is, if you can get a degree to do the job, you're never gonna be on Wealthy doing because everyone can do it, right?
17:06
And so you have to be able to learn things that other people can't do.
Right?
And that they're in makes you Irreplaceable or less replaceable, right?
The very least.
Last replaceable you want to be replaceable by a Marketplace of people lined up behind.
You ready to take your job and do it for Less.
All right, because they're also poor and they are willing to do it for last.
17:23
Just terrible way to do business.
It's also an excellent way to stay poor though.
Do what everyone else is doing?
Do it For Less unless you have an operational strategy which is, you know, like Walmart and whatever.
And that's probably not you right now.
So number 25, way to stay poor.
Find something that works.
17:38
Dear God, find something that works and then stop doing it.
Think about it.
How many of you have needed to make money last minute you had to pay payroll?
Yet to pay taxes.
You had some Bill unexpected, you know, surgery iPhone, whatever, right?
Some Bill comes up and you need to pay for it and you find a way to make money.
17:57
Because if you're watching this video, still alive, right?
So you found a way to find a way to pay for it.
What did you do there?
When you needed to make money?
You're so messed up.
You were willing to make money and you had the ability to make money when it was for someone else.
Else not for yourself, think about that, you have the ability, you knew what to do and you just chose not to do it.
18:15
You stop doing it.
As soon as you pay someone else's bills because you were willing to pay other people's bills in that your own interesting which leads me to one of the most retweets had recently which is most people know what to do to achieve their goals.
Most people do know what to do people like I don't know how to lose weight like a you do stop.
You can should move.
18:32
You know, you know that you want to make money.
Start making calls, start reaching out to people.
Start promoting the thing that you were trying to sell.
I mean, not complicated.
I got this thing.
You want to try it.
No, cool.
Talk somebody else got this thing.
You want to try it?
No, cool call somebody else, but it's not, it's not a complex.
18:48
Is not complicated, but people just don't do it.
It's because they're not willing to do it, right?
And so actually thing to do, find something that works a lot of you do know something that works and then stop doing number 26.
We're rounding off.
We got two more.
Higher dumb, people.
19:04
Excellent way to stay poor and have a bad business.
All right.
Really, really highly recommend.
It's also really good for if you have a job to, if you have the ability to hire people, hire dumb people.
It's just it's just a great way to make your life miserable.
There's very few ways that are better than this one.
Like if you just want to be surrounded by people just hire, people didn't just hire people.
19:21
Don't when you, you know, I mean and you'll feel good, but you'll be poor and so don't do that.
Number 27 is a huge one that I see all the Time.
First thing Port it's a really good strategy.
Might be one of the top ones on this list assume you are.
19:38
Always right?
How many people here right?
You're watching this know someone who always just think they're right and they're not successful.
They get advice from somebody who might be successful or unsuccessful, then they're like no that's not going to work for X y&z right because they assume they're always right, they know.
19:54
They assume they know everything.
Well, if you know everything, then why aren't you doing what you want?
Hmm.
And I will tell you this from the people that I've met who have Too far ahead of me, they have a voracious desire2learn, and a voracious interest in learning from anyone.
And every single possible Source they can.
20:11
And those people have the humility to say that everyone knows something that they don't know.
And so in that way, they can learn of them which is I think an Emerson quote, if you cannot learn.
Then what's the point, right?
It's the same thing.
As, as the saying he who chooses not to read is no further ahead than the men who cannot read write.
20:30
And so, it's like, The man who chooses not to learn from others, is no dissimilar from the person who is disabled from learning from others, right?
So you give yourself 0 advantages, like, there's no way that you can learn from other people if you think you're always right.
20:48
And I know this sounds fucking obvious, but a lot of you guys do this.
Why like, you'd rather be right than be rich and it's silly, but it's an excellent way to stay poor.
So that's why it's number 27.
And then, the last one in this is the simplest of the economics around it.
21:03
I'm just going to drive this baby home is.
Make money period, spend more than you make.
And the Beautiful part about this is that it doesn't matter how much you make.
If you spend more than it, you can be Port, which is why this is such a great one.
It's a great way to stay porous.
It's matter how much you increase your income, just spend more than you made, right?
21:20
Go into debt.
Get adjust your lifestyle to your new income at all times, or rather above your income.
So that you can always stay poor.
No matter how much money you make.
It's an awesome way to stay poor.
So I highly recommend doing that and honestly, the more you can do it, the more you can outspend your income, the poor, you will be.
21:38
And so again, highly recommend it and it sounds silly.
But, you know, a few people like right now, I think it's like the bottom 50% of America, like, doesn't have any savings.
And what's crazy is that like you can, you can control like these Controllable like you can always downgrade your lifestyle but the thing is you care more about the opinions of others and you let your own right?
21:56
You care more about looking worse than being rich, right?
All these things and that's why all of these things go together.
And so to wrap this up, the reason that inversion thinking is so powerful is that we can use our brains to find threats more easily than we can find Solutions.
And so, if we think about your business career, when you think about your marriage, you think about your body or you think about whatever it is, your money goals, think about the ways to destroy it, I just gave you Twenty, Eight different ways that you can be poor, right?
22:21
Right?
When you reverse them and you make those the rules for living that you have.
Then what happens is you succeed by accident?
Because you avoid the pitfalls because the thing is, if you don't make many mistakes, you succeed without trying because all you're doing is just focusing on, just not making these stupid mistakes that most people do, right?
22:39
If we were to reverse these and this is what I'm going to hit this with hard, enjoy, we're hitting it right now.
Start today, read books, do the stuff that's in the books take advice from rich people and how to be rich pick a spouse who makes you feel.
Awesome about working.
Phil wants to try again.
22:55
Think the world is unfair and act accordingly.
Never blame your circumstances.
Think your circumstances for making you who you are?
Instead of complaining, do something expect, no one to save you, except for yourself, value your opinion, over those of other people seek out discomfort tolerate, nothing but Excellence, make promises, keep promises wait for the worst conditions.
23:19
We for imperfect conditions and act.
Anyways, on what you want, right?
Avoid working on the stuff, that doesn't matter work on the things that matter.
Most ignore the rest say, you're going to do something and then do it, do what?
No one else is doing.
Do your best and make it above what it takes to be successful.
23:40
Talk less do more start something new today and keep at it until you are good.
Do it so long that it would be unreasonable for you to be bad.
Believe what other people think about you more than what you think about yourself?
Be Irreplaceable.
23:56
Find something that works and don't stop doing it.
Keep doing it until you're bored out of your mind because you're so good at doing that thing that worked.
All right, hire smart.
People assume that you are always wrong and be willing to learn and make money and spend less than you make.
24:14
And that is the 28th rules of poverty flipped on its head and you can make your own conclusions about where that will take you.
I love you.
Mo Z Nation.
Keeping awesome.
I'll see you guys next video.








0:00
The difficulty with information is it's really valuable the day before you get.
It is not as valuable the day after you got it.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
0:15
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
And here he is mr.
Alex, her Mosey himself.
Alex, what is going on?
Welcome to the fighting entrepreneur.
This has been a long time coming.
I'm sorry I've had to reschedule you twice cuz but I have a good excuse.
We had a baby and so you know you and I had a podcast, our first one scheduled the exact time.
0:35
It was like within a half an hour of the time.
I baby was born so I remember mess.
Judging your assistant like a day before.
I was like I don't think I could have to be at work tomorrow.
So man, thanks for finally making it here.
I got so many questions to ask you congrats.
First of all, on all your huge success companies selling book and now social media sensation, I don't know where to start, so much to ask you, dude.
0:59
So, tell me something.
What we'll start with this, I'm going to start with a question.
It's just like, what's the evil plan here?
What's the, what's the master plan?
Start with the end in mind?
And then I've got a bunch of questions.
Going to specifically get into a but social media, I mean you're doing a this is hard work, putting this kind of content.
So tell me the big Vision that you're going towards.
1:17
I mean the big Vision at this point is to document and share the best practices of building a world-class companies.
And so I mean that's the mission of the business and so that is what we're ultimately trying to to have happen.
And so we wanted to build a business that builds businesses because after having the three exits that we had last year, it was more around.
1:34
Like, okay now that we've kind of done that understand the process etcetera.
It's much more about buying and building now, because the whole liquidity event as much as it's like an interesting Milestone from an entrepreneurial perspective.
You then get this big glob of money and you're like what am I gonna do this big glob of money?
1:50
Like well I guess I'm going to go buy more assets with it.
You're like what kind of a system whereby?
Well I mean I do know business.
So maybe I'll start by face and then you end up just like treating equity for one thing for treating a basic, basically back into equity and other things.
And so for me the transaction was like okay well this is where we feel like we have a competitive Advantage like I'm not Real Estate Mogul.
2:09
I mean I haven't been doing that.
That's not a world where I feel like I haven't had an edge but you know, in the business services World, education, World Etc, just traditional business.
I feel like we're pretty pretty strong there and we can have a value.
Add an addition to Capital and time.
And so we wanted to build a hold code.
2:25
That would be able to scale companies quickly if they fit within our kind of by box.
And so that's ultimately, we did and the social media side is, can we provide value to 99% of people without really selling anything?
And then for companies that find Value in, Who are, you know, three million, 10 million are a company right now.
2:42
Just 17 million Top Line at the time of this making, which is date stamp this, August, 16, 20 22.
And so that's kind of the range we're looking for.
Most of those guys are looking for, you know, getting 250 or getting to 100 million and then having some sort of exit got it.
2:58
So do you have a particular like you're building acquisition.com?
I've heard you throw around a billion dollar portfolio.
Is there a numerical goal that you're going for like what's your next?
Next kind of man told that you're shooting for the first one would be to get Leila on the Forbes list for women which is you have to have a net worth of over 250 million.
3:18
So that's probably, you know, in the near future side after that would be a billion dollars in Gross portfolio revenue.
And then after, that would probably be, you know, maybe I make it on the guys list which is, I would say substantially higher than the girls listen, that's no insult to women.
3:33
That's just those are just the stats.
All right, so the next, the next goal you're going for his Over 50 million.
Are you guys public about your current net worth know?
What is that?
So 100 ice.
All right.
I figured I was going to say because I've seen a couple podcast episodes that are the hundred million dollar man and then of course, her saw one for Lila as well.
3:52
So one thing is how many companies are inside of acquisition.com right now Bruno. 1111 companies.
Do you guys have like a particular rhythm?
Is it like one every quarter or like what do you?
What's is there?
A goal there?
There isn't a goal.
4:08
So that's been something we're pretty deliberate about because we didn't want to try and force Acquisitions.
We don't want to want to do a deal.
So we didn't want to even have incentives around that we actually recently just started saying that we weren't even going to put any kind of, we didn't want to report on it because we didn't want to draw attention to it.
4:23
So it's much more about gross portfolio, Revenue which is what we drive and so you know you can grow a perfectly Revenue through Acquisitions in terms of getting new companies in or by growing the existing companies and I will say, you know, transparently it's a lot easier and a lot faster.
Just grow the crop existing companies that just like onboarding.
4:41
Get another one.
And so it's much more about like picking right, which I'm sure you can imagine.
Like, you know, you only need one Facebook and so it's definitely not a quantity game from that perspective is definitely like a pic right and wait game got it.
And you said, your highest one right now is 17 million a year that you acquired know our average or average company?
5:01
Big difference in average, careful in our largest company did 11 million last month.
Amazing.
And when what were they doing like was that a recent acquisition?
Like you have a story a cool store?
That's a that's an older one that way they doing when you acquired them 20 per month, no, they were doing.
5:20
They did 20 the year before.
That's awesome.
That's amazing.
All right, I got I got so many questions.
I'm going to try to bounce around here a little bit.
All right, because I'm like, we're already inside acquisition that cam.
I don't even want to really go that far into it.
So your goal is really to grow the portfolio Revenue which I like that as a goal.
5:39
That's cool goal because like you just said you could do it by either just growing your existing companies which would be a great incentive for you because that's why, you know, you invested in them and that's why they had you invest in them, one of the things You said, I want to talk to you about this because there is, and I heard you say this on some podcasts and at this was one of those moments where I stayed in my car.
5:58
So I parked at my office and like stayed in the car.
Kept listening, like rebound it and listened again and I was like still in the parking lot for 10 minutes which I've never done before.
Here's why.
Okay, I'm going to come out in the open and say this, I have tried to build technology.
Now multiple times, I think I heard you say at a different day on a podcast that you burned about 3 million dollars.
6:20
Well, if you feel I don't because I think my calculation comes up to, about 15, I have given it a long go for a long time.
And this was a year where I just said, no, but I suck at it, like I don't, I can hire a VPS high-powered vp's and it doesn't seem to work.
6:37
The only other thing I can think of is, if I were to get at some point, a very passionate.
Now, this is all stuff I realized on my own and I was thinking on my own was like, if you got a really passionate co-founder Who I Really trusted and loved and that was the technical hand, and all I had to do is marketing and sales, like maybe I have a shot at building a tech company but the obsession with building a tech company is because everyone's just so valuations and Sass and you know, are, are are and mrr.
7:01
That's just lost so much money in the, the episode.
I was listening to.
You just said, I don't care about any of that.
I'm building like simple traditional information businesses and they're still going to be worth a lot.
Can you talk a little bit about that?
And because you've done a lot of thinking about that, and it provided me some good hope so talk about that.
7:19
Yeah, for sure.
And I would add the caveat, Out that we're like open to learning businesses because they can be structured as what I would consider traditional service businesses.
So the portfolio that we have is an exclusively learning, its we have brick-and-mortar chains, we have you know, different different things, you know, just traditional Professional Services businesses, things like that, but big picture it's like information is a service is the way that I kind of see it.
7:43
It's like that's really what you know, coaching information businesses are which is we're helping somebody achieve an outcome and we assistance the process and we just happen to have some sort of learning portal It assists in that to a degree which gives leverage and adds to margin and so like I just see them as just service businesses like by and large, that's what they are.
8:00
You know, with the exception of just like truly just so like horses and whatnot, but you know, of course, selling business is going to have less Enterprise Value because it's transactional nature.
There's nothing recurring and so from a value perspective somebody who's buying it wants to look at the predictability of the future revenue and How likely it is to a happen and be grow and be bigger.
8:19
And so it's like, if we can answer those two questions that it's very likely that this We'll continue to happen and second that it's going to be bigger in the future than it is today, then it's going to be a company that's valuable most information companies.
As they currently exist, are very founder driven face tripping and they sell in a transactional model.
8:34
So it's like it that person disappears the likelihood is low.
And in terms of whether it's bigger in the future, not it's like they already missed the first one.
So it's like not even worth getting into, but if you have a large, you know, addressable Market that you can go after and you have some sort of recurring nature that can be attached to information, then it becomes a A service business and service.
8:53
Businesses can be sold for 10 15 times you know, ibadah without an issue.
So it's really just making sure that the business itself can be transferred from one owner to the other, that the likelihood that it grows in the likelihood that it continues to thrive as hi.
I mean, that's fundamentally how I see it.
9:08
So we build those companies and then reverse it, you know, like that's what they that's what a future buyer would want.
And we just reverse that in the Press which just also happens to be what any owner would probably want as a company, that doesn't rely on them that is has high likelihood of existing.
Errol and should ideally be bigger than it is today 100%.
9:26
Okay, so your goal is to get a company that you feel comfortable has a 10 to 15 x if it exit in its potential future.
Is that, are you going to start at some point exiting or right now for the foreseeable future?
Are you guys all about?
Just growing that portfolio revenue or let's say tomorrow.
9:42
Someone comes along is willing to offer a good deal to buy out.
One of your companies is that on the docket for you right now?
Yeah, no we're actually Indulgence right now with an offer for one of our portfolio companies who took on two years ago and so the founder.
It's only when he started these.
Like this is my exit number.
He's like I don't want to be fancy about it.
9:58
Someone offers me that after fees taxes everything that's in my bank account, I'll take the deal.
So I was like, okay.
So we ended up getting a approached by private equity and they made an offer.
And he said, that sounds good to me.
And so we're in the diligence process as we speak.
So the thing is, we're minority, were minority stake holders.
10:16
So if the founder wants to That we will assist in that process.
What percentage do you try to go?
Usually take, we're typically in the 20 to 30% range.
And are you buying that that percentage or is it more like your services in exchange for Equity pens on the deal?
10:33
Depends, we've written checks with not written checks, it depends on the deal, okay?
But by and large the types of companies that we're taking on our high cash flow businesses that have low capital expenditure.
So if a business needed Capital to expand like let's say they wanted to, you know, have more corporate Ian's in their expanding brick-and-mortar than there would be an argument for where the capital will go.
10:51
That would be, you know, needed to fuel business growth right.
But the vast majority of businesses that we take on are not in that circumstance so we don't work with e-commerce, particularly for that reason because they tend to be just be big Capital sucks.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
11:11
It has almost a perfect for you can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I can push the bargain with you so that's my give.
11:29
Go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
So, 10 to 15, x of, if it does, let's say you do get.
So it seems to me like a typical information marketing business, right?
So I want to selling courses, you have a back-end coaching program or whatever.
11:46
That's not, you know, going to be right out the box a acquisition.com Target.
But let's say someone comes to you.
That's what it does look like.
And you say, hey, not for me right now, but they're very insistent.
They say, tell me what you want me to do.
So that in one year, you are interested.
12:03
What?
Advice, do you give them so that, that becomes an investable company.
So oftentimes, we will work with companies that are in that goal.
I say often, it's not like people, you know, we've 11 so we have taken on a handful of companies.
I've been in that situation because the transition from founder face forward to Enterprise company is one that takes, you know, two years Ash to really fully like kind of wash the fingerprints off.
12:27
You know the spirit of the founders always going to be there but you know whether they are in the ads whether they're in the Fulfillment, those are the two primary places that they have to be removed.
So the easiest way to remove Us from the ads and then the second place that they have to get removed as from, you know, if it's an information business, it's going to be the content itself and then like subsection of like, the delivery would be like if there's calls, or there's events or there's workshops or there's webinars things like that, we have to remove them from their.
12:52
And so jumping ahead.
Because I know we talked a little before I had when we were able to sell gym, launch and Prestige Labs a bundle for these options in e-commerce, branch of the business, we were not at our own events so we did not speak at our own events.
We didn't show up, we Have coaching calls that we were attending.
13:10
There was no trainings that we were educating people on the only direct reports that we had was just the CEO and CEO of the company, and that was it.
So, we didn't have the weekly meetings.
We weren't on the monthlies, we attended the quarterly's and we had our weekly one-on-one just with the CEO and CIO.
13:25
So that was the level of that, which we had to be able to pull ourselves away from the, from the company to make it a sellable asset.
And that you had already set up.
Before you got approached by the buyer, that was already there.
Are you got approached by the buyer after all that was done.
So this one was a different process because we actually went out.
13:42
We went to Market whereas the one that I was talking about earlier, like we got approach.
So it's just, you know, it's fortuitous, but no, we went to Market and so it was actually a two year process for us.
We went out to Market, kind of preliminary really talk to different Bankers, Etc.
And were like, what do we need to do to sell this?
And they basically just give us the checklist of all the things that were wrong and so is like, it's to founder face forward.
14:00
So there's too much Chi Minh risk.
It's, you know, depending on one or two primary acquisition channels would like to see more diversity of acquisition, We'd like to see lower churn in your, you know, in the licensing etcetera, etcetera.
So they kind of gave the laundry list of things they want.
And, you know, the last one was like, if you can prove this out and maybe an adjacent space, that shows that there's a growth potential in the business, then it becomes, you know, increasingly more attractive as, uh, those boxes get checked.
14:24
And so, it took us about two years to basically execute on that, which was like hiring out, you know, the entire leadership team which got Layla and I out of the day-to-day and out of the ads, we built a 26% hold called team to which at the time.
I'm the sale over half of our sales came from cold calls and cold emails.
14:41
Rather than just paid ads which was a nice honestly direct-response person coming from that background.
Having this knowledge that no matter what was going to happen, we were going to have sales is really, really nice.
And then in terms of the recurring, we, you know, we did a lot of different things in terms of the customer experience, the onboarding process re mixing the product Suite, so that we could better match avatars to products allowed us to, you know, cut the churn and half over that period of time.
15:07
And then Proved out an Enterprise product Suite, which was three times more expensive than our current product.
And we basically sold a representative sample into that showing that, that, that product Suite would have legs for the next owner to be able to build out.
So, that was, that was kind of the process of what we had to go through with Jim launch to make it a sellable exit, where we could just get a check and walk away without an urn out without seller financing without a consult back period.
15:32
The day we signed that was the day we walked on.
All right, so I want to definitely come back.
To Jim Lunch because I want to understand that business model.
I've had a few, you know, obviously watched a little bit and had some aha moments.
But before I go there, so let's say someone comes to you today.
There they have a, I'm going to pick a random nature and for a minute assume you assume you, you like the niche.
15:53
You're interested in the name.
Yeah.
You like the person, you know, personal development there in personal development, they have a webinar, it sells a thousand dollar course and they got something else behind it coaching and they're like, Alex, I'm not going to leave you alone until you figure out how How to make my company investable for acquisition.
16:09
Tell me what, give me that checklist, what do you want me to do?
How do you turn someone that's doing a one-time transactional webinar, you know business, what what, where's your brain go?
Where do you see that person?
Then turning it into more of gym, launch type of business that could be exited.
So, one Sig fig strategy, things in them, kind of like more tactical.
16:30
So strategically the reason I like niches like, you know, Physical Therapy, hairstylists, Realtors gym, owners whatever, is that.
Once you basically figure out the model, you can copy and paste a tremendously personalized solution to many people, which then gives you a very valuable thing that doesn't cost much and most of those businesses have recurring needs and so we can basically look at what the needs of the business are and say, how many of these can we fill?
16:57
And then envelope, the customer in all the additional Services, they will need on a consumable basis.
And so the difficulty with information is it's really valuable the day before you get.
It is not as valuable the day after you got it.
But there are other things that are consumable, accountability is consumable, community is consumable.
17:15
These are things that you would value today and you value it tomorrow, right?
And so we try and peel apart, what are the parts of the solution that we're offering?
That are consumable.
Just one time.
And so once we peel those out, we can make those elements, a recurring basis on the back end.
17:31
That starts to build up.
Mr. Are in the business, you make it, you know, reliable.
And honestly, just solving that problem is, the primary emphasis in the beginning is, what is the recurring product Market fit that people will continue to stay in pay for within this, you know, opportunity vehicle in the personal development space?
17:47
It would have to be probably something that was much lower cost because they're not business owners so it would likely be things that would be you know, tools.
That will assist them so it might be.
Well they started an LLC.
They're going to need Tax Services.
They're going to need you know for clickfunnels right?
Like they're in the in the biz op very early entrepreneur stage.
18:04
So what do they need?
They need a website.
That's a recurring thing.
They're going to need to have.
So it's like peeling apart.
All the little need, two halves in personal but they're not going to have a lot of Revenue, so it's going to be probably lots of little doodads at widgets.
That would create that recurring base.
Got it.
So, so, it sounds like though and this is what I've heard before and this will be a perfect transition into in.
18:25
Jim launch, but to me, it sounds almost like your favorite, right?
Is almost a copy paste of Jim launch.
It's almost like, how can we do Jim launch?
But for like, I don't know.
I like pizza as I was like, think about pizza to this like pizza restaurants, right?
Or like, like you said, like hair salons or spas or any, it sounds like pick a local business, that is a business owner, they're successful, they have cash flow, they have money, and show them how to build.
18:54
That business and come up with the licensable model for them to use and they will pay five figures a year to license this.
And that's the model that not only gets your interest, but that was the same model that got the interest of your buyers.
I mean, and it doesn't have to be brick and mortar, it's more that I love businesses that sell a particular way of making money.
19:16
So rather than say like make money online like that stuff, you know what I mean?
It's just it's too very there's too many different Avenues, someone can go down.
If it's like, hey here's how you start a ranking rent website business, then it's a very specific opportunity.
19:32
So we can create specific solutions to them that we predict their note.
We know they're going to need and so we can just a provide more value B.
We know where the path is going and so that we can basically, I don't know if they siphon but plug into whatever future revenue streams.
We help them build and then a big function of that is like, how good is our customer success?
19:50
Like, are we able to very consistently get these people result in which case, we build, Our back end.
And so that way, we become much more aligned because the Enterprise Value is going to be based on the likely that we can take somebody from whatever vehicle there in into our vehicle and make them successful.
Because then the more successes we had, the more mrr we built, okay?
20:08
Great.
So Jim launch was was that the big breakthrough?
Was it?
You went from selling.
I know your story about you.
You were going to Jim's one at a time doing all their work and then from there, you had a day where you took some calls and you're like, wait, what the hell I can sell this for 6,000. 7,000 8,000 9,000 And just sit in one place.
20:26
So from there, you went and landed up on a licensing model and and to talk me through that a little bit and like, in the end when Jim launcher, sold, what were the key product offerings?
And where did most of that Revenue come from?
Like, what was the product offering where you're like?
Oh, that was, that was the big break away for us.
20:44
Yeah, there's, it's always two products.
I tend to like, simple products we.
So, so we had a front and a back end.
Jim launch was a product that basically sold a turnkey acquisition system.
So it was, you know, use these ads, use these Pages, insert your name here, use these emails, insert your name here, use these meal plans grocery list for Preparation instructions, eating out, guides and put your, put your logo on it.
21:07
And press go, you know, I mean and people will start walking in your door.
Here's the things you say to them.
Here's 20,000 recordings of other people selling the exact same thing.
This is how you price it.
This is how you down so something that I hope so.
Somebody that's how you tie in supplements all these elements.
It's just a turnkey kind of acquisition system, the back in programs like okay well then what would you sell them to work?
21:24
Basis.
So if you think about that business, one of the things people need, they need new ads because that's fatigue.
So rather than, you know, so you can, you can give those ads once, you know, that they're tested in work, you can add the accountability portion.
You can have all the system scale the team.
So it's going to add to the trainer's, ask the sales guys, as our front desk role and the recruiting process in order to get those people in place.
21:44
All of the CRM that they used was actually just a white labeled CRM that we partnered with.
I was a gym, specific one.
And so for each of those things they just kind of became revenue streams that were able To tie into on the back end and sell a much longer-term, kind of deal and so it's just front and back end.
22:00
We just tried to ascend the people that you know, we're successful at limiting front end because then we knew they'd be successful in implementing back up and that was it very simple wall.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
The most expensive thing that's costing you the most money in your business right now is ignorance right now not knowing how to make a billion dollars a year cost.
You a billion dollars a year, which is why the biggest debt you have to pay down as fast as possible.
Is what you're paying to the universe.
While you're paying other people, you're paying yourself to not know how welcome to the game, where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:40
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy at acquisition.com.
Our private Equity Firm, we talk to 600, entrepreneurs, doing over a million dollars a year, every single month, and 300 them are over three million dollars a year.
1:00
And a hundred of em over 10 million dollars a year.
And so we talked to a lot of entrepreneurs every day and over time we've developed kind of a rubric or framework for how we analyze the skill of an entrepreneur.
And so what I'm going to do today is break down how you can think through yourself as an entrepreneur.
1:17
And the four elements that we look at to say, how good of an entrepreneur this person is and how much were willing to bet on the fact that they're going to be successful.
And if you're the person who's going to be successful for yourself, then it's about how do I increase the likelihood that I'm I'm Successful by looking through these four Frameworks.
So every entrepreneur isn't successful because they don't know how to do.
1:36
One of four things.
They either don't know that.
Something is possible all together.
Number two, they don't know how to do something 3.
They don't know how to get other people to do something and for, they don't know how to get themselves to do something.
And so, we'll break down each one of these when I had my chain of brick and mortar gyms, and I was transitioning to flying across the country and helping other people do Jim.
2:00
Out.
So I had six teams of my own and then I started doing that as a service.
I would actually fly out, get some is Jim to full capacity and go to the next gym and I did that for almost two years.
We did 30 plus turnarounds of Jim's, right?
Do it, fill the gym up in less than 30 days.
Collect all the cash and move on.
And it was only when I talk to a mentor of mine that he said, Alex, you're too good at this stuff.
2:21
You need to be showing other people how to do it and he introduced me to the concept of Licensing.
I didn't know that that was possible.
So for me, my deficiency was number one.
It was an ignorance or on what is possible in the universe and so that's the same degree if you have.
Like it's the biggest threat, most entrepreneurs have is they don't even know what they can do.
2:39
And that's because and this is the biggest handicap for poor people or people who are born in lower socioeconomic status or their parents didn't make a lot of money.
So that's you listen up the way that you do that is by getting around people who make more money and watching and consuming the content of people who are wealthier than you and wealthier than your parents and wealthier than parents have ever been.
2:59
And ideally, What these you want to become or beyond that because they will tell you the things that are possible.
That you didn't know, were like, you probably didn't know that insurance isn't a taxable thing, huh?
You didn't know that was possible, you didn't know that the guy who sells your mortgage makes five to twenty thousand dollars on the mortgage itself.
3:17
Really just for selling an interest rate, you bet they do you didn't know that on average 35 percent of the average American Income goes towards interest expenses to Banks.
So people to know why do banks do in the world because they have a REV share on everyone.
A paycheck of 35 percent.
Because when they get you to take a loan out for a car or house or a boat or whatever, most of what you're paying is not principle, but interest and interest, just a fancy word for fee.
3:42
And you know what?
What it costs them to actually give you the money, one, click of a button and all of that is margin.
So even though it looks like 1% or 2%, 3%, the actual gross margin on it is very high.
And so, as I'm saying, these things, you might be like, wow, I didn't know that was possible and that is the That that all entrepreneurs have to pay down especially if you were born poor.
4:04
The second thing is they don't know how to do something.
All right?
So these are the Tactical skills that people don't understand.
So they don't know how to build a website.
They don't know how to integrate a payment processor into their site.
They don't know how to set up an entity, they don't know how to send an email to a list.
4:22
They don't know how to do many different things.
They don't know how to build a product.
They don't know how to Source things from China.
They don't know how to set up things for Drop Shipping.
They don't know how to click buttons to run a Facebook ad.
They don't know how to do something.
The good news is that stuff is actually the easiest thing to solve and I'll tell you the most technical thing that I learned and how I learned it.
4:42
So, when I was transitioning to my turn around business, I realized, I need to learn more about ads.
I done a workshop for two days and learned the basics of running Facebook ads in the local market.
But I knew I needed to level up my skill that have been a few years earlier and I haven't learned anything since and so I talked to a couple friends and say, hey do you nobody's really good at Facebook ads mind you this is six years ago or seven So like that and they said, well, I've got these agencies that did a pretty good job, maybe you can talk to them.
5:04
So talk the agency owners.
They're like, I don't do.
You know, fee-for-service, like I'm only an agency and that's it.
You can become a client or not.
So why don't really want you to run my ads?
I want you to teach me how to run it and they were like, I don't do that.
I said, well, it's America, everything's for sale.
So just name a number.
And finally, one guy said, I'll do it for 750 an hour was like, $750 an hour and he's like, yeah, I was like, all right just you know, just making sure.
5:27
And so I said, sure sign me up.
I said every Week, I'll meet you for an hour and you can show me how to do that.
Now, if you're doing the math, here is three thousand dollars a month, so, like pretty penny, but guess what?
Within eight weeks, I knew everything that he was going to do on my ADD account and so the, the terms that I had were, you can't control the mouse.
5:46
I control the mouse, you tell me where to click and why you're clicking it that way.
And then very quickly, I learned how he was doing what he was doing in about four weeks.
And the next four weeks, I was like, okay, so this is what I'm doing.
This is why I'm doing, is that make sense?
You said, yes.
The invention was like, I don't Anymore.
And so all in all cost me about six thousand dollars to learn how to run Facebook ads just by paying someone for one-on-one tutoring.
6:06
And I have done this over and over and over again to acquire skills, my life.
Now, mind you, again, you two didn't really exist that much then or like not nearly to the extent that is.
Now we can learn just about anything by looking online for free, but if you still need help, just offering to pay people way above Market in order to have them stand over your shoulder and show you how to do something, is one of the easiest, and fastest way is that I've learned any skill on my life.
6:28
So if you don't know how to do, Nothing phrase.
What you don't know how to do as a deficit of?
I don't know how to insert problem and then that's what you Google and that's what you can try and find a business owner who knows how to do that thing and sells it pay them two times or three times.
They would normally make to show you and transfer the skill.
6:46
The third type.
And I've done these in reversed order of difficulty, the third type of difficulties, they don't know how to get other people to do stuff.
All right?
So they don't know how to get other people to give them money.
They don't know how to get other people to work for them.
They don't know how to get other people to continue to work hard on their behalf.
Right?
And so, we have different words for that, there's recruiting their sales, there's leadership, there's management.
7:05
All of these words are fundamentally about one thing which is getting other people to do something.
And so, if you think about that as a meta skill, if you know how to get people to do stuff.
You could actually only learn that one skill and get everything else in your life done for you.
7:22
Because if you could get somebody else to figure out how to do the website and someone else to figure out how to do the LLC and someone figure out how to do your finances, someone else to figure out how to Mark and figure out someone else to figure out how to do the product and get, people are experts at all.
That's up because you had the meta skill of being able to lead and cast a vision to get people to want to work.
7:38
Then you would have the highest leverage of the ones that we just talked about.
And so when we're looking at an entrepreneur, we think to ourselves with This person be able to attract high level Talent.
Will this person be able to manage an Enterprise that continues to grow with higher and higher level skills that people?
7:55
And many times you can see the cap of the entrepreneur by their character traits, right?
And this character trait is a, you know, an amorphous work, but it's really just personal and interpersonal skills.
All right, and I'll get to the personal skills in a second, but interpersonal skills, which is how to get other people to do.
Stuff often times become the limiter.
And so usually, we have to find operators to complement the entrepreneur to help continue to scale the business.
8:16
Yes.
Now they not be able to get that type of talent which is why we have a private Equity Firm.
So we can attract talent that otherwise wouldn't be available to the types of businesses that we work with.
So many entrepreneurs who've done a hundred million dollar exit, don't want to come work at something that's doing 10 million dollars a year.
8:31
But if we cast The Vision that we've done, many exits like this, then they'll be far more likely to do it now, that's where we transfer.
Our skill of getting people to do things to the entrepreneur or on their behalf.
Look, guys.
You guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
8:48
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, but taking 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, it means the absolute world to me.
9:09
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
The final deficiency is getting themselves to do something and this is both the hardest and the ongoing one that goes for the rest of your life.
Because in the beginning, you can't give yourself to do anything and then you get yourself to do something.
9:25
But over time, the things that you have to get yourself to do is over and over again, gets harder and harder to resist your impulse.
And so, if you've ever heard of character traits, like, honesty, or loyalty or patience or Focus, those are just fancy words for a bucket of activities or behaviors that exhibit or manifest themselves in a certain Circumstance or condition.
9:45
And so if you have a loyal person you know that they are loyal.
If when presented the opportunity to betray you they don't do it.
And so if you want to practice loyalty or develop the trait of loyalty which is just a scale, like everything else, which can be learned, then you go into environments or you wait for the environment that presents itself with the opportunity, to prove that you have the skill and then you exhibit it.
10:11
You show it.
And what happens is if you do that over and over and over again, eventually you develop a reputation as the type of person who does this type of thing.
And so when you're looking at yourself as the entrepreneur and you have these four categories, the hardest one to determine that you're lacking is that you don't believe something is possible because the hardest thing to know is what you don't know, that's an unknown unknown right?
10:35
The rest of these.
For the most part are known unknowns and so these are the ones that are mostly under our control.
The unknowns are to a degree under our control.
Because we can go seek out.
Other people who are further ahead of us to have them break our beliefs, about what's possible.
But the rest of these are under your control, in that, you go find the skill tactically.
10:52
You go figure out how to persuade the people tactically or you figure out how to get to persuade yourself tactically, to do things the way you want them to be done.
And that's how you can develop, humility, develop, Focus, develop, loyalty, develop honesty, all of those things are skills.
11:09
And as soon as you make them that way, they become things that you can learn and develop.
Otherwise it's like I wasn't born that way.
This is just how I am and that's how if I hear a Founder talking like that I know that they will be significantly less coachable, they will not be able to develop that skill set which I know automatically will cap their business.
11:26
And so if you can look at yourself as the person or the asset that runs the bigger asset which is your business, you can figure out, do I have a problem of not knowing what to do, or how to do it?
Do I not know how to get other people to do the stuff or do I continue to exhibit erratic behavior and my Focused.
11:43
Am I undisciplined?
And then you define the circumstance where you exhibit the thing?
You don't like on Saturday mornings when I should be working.
I don't.
So then you say okay if I worked on Saturday mornings then I would tell myself that I had exhibited discipline that day.
12:00
If you string enough of those days in a row, you are a disciplined person and so it's really about stacking up that proof for yourself that you have the trait from what you've done, rather than claiming some amorphous thing because that breaks this amorphous idea.
Gets down into what can I do today to develop it and that is what everyone else will notice.
12:16
And that's how you can attract better Talent, who can do better things who can accomplish things that are impossible?
And the craziest thing is that the most expensive thing that's costing you the most money in your business right now is ignorance it's ignorance around for things but before I tell you what they are the reason that it's costing you so much money as I right now.
12:33
Not knowing how to make a billion dollars a year cost.
You a billion dollars a year, which is why the biggest debt you have to pay down as fast as possible is what you're paying to the universe where you're paying other people.
People you're paying yourself to not know how which is why knowledge is the number one asset that you have in your business.
12:50
Because what happens is, your business can disappear and a billionaire can make it again because they have the knowledge, they know how to do all of the things.
If the government comes and takes all of your assets, which happened to my family in the revolution of Iran.
The only thing they're able to take with them, was their knowledge.
They were to come to the United States and rebuild again.
13:06
And within two generations.
We have the same waffles we did, when we were in Iran through knowledge, if you don't pass knowledge to the Generation.
Then they will eventually statistically squander all of the wealth because what wasn't passed was the knowledge to keep the asset rather than the acid itself.
13:23
So there are two ways to figure out what's possible the hard way.
And the easy way the easy way is to find people who are way ahead of you talk to as many of them as you possibly can.
And cross collaborate, the things that they are saying meaning you listen to this guy who is this guy?
Look at the things they have in common and say this is the thing that the most people think is true and so that has the highest likelihood The hood of being true.
13:44
If you talk to 20 people, you may get 20 pieces of advice, but there may be threads that all of them share and there will be fewer of those.
But those few threads in the things that you can count on, that's the easy way to figure out what's possible.
The hard way to figure out what's possible is using Aristotelian thinking, which is called first principles thinking, which is basically you break it down to most foundational unit of physics and think, why isn't this possible?
14:07
And if it is possible, then it is believable that being said, many people have a hard time with first principles thinking and so on.
My opinion for most people, go to other people who are further ahead than you want to be and further ahead than all the people you are.
And if you don't have access to them, get the indirect taxes, consume their concept, read their stuff like that is the education that will break your beliefs about what you can do.
14:27
In this universe, the beliefs tell you what direction to take your action in.
Once you have a belief and now Orient your direction into a higher leverage opportunity, a belief will change your action because it will Orient it rather than changing what you necessarily do.
14:43
So if you have the correct belief, then you'll be headed in the highest leverage opportunity, boat or Direction in your career and then the other three Frameworks will apply to that with more outcome.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Everyone Good morning, happy Friday.
As my team says happy Saturday Junior.
If you're wondering where my mustache is, I am letting it recharge before the event, that's coming up for our gym or something.
0:43
So I'll just hit them, I'm gonna I'm gonna find it, but luckily, it's a middle eastern.
We find a real fast, so be back in a few days, but I wanted to just tell you three stories that won't make you any money.
May dramatically improve your quality of life and It was a lesson that I learned when I was 19 years old, and it's served me really well up to this point.
1:06
And so, I'll give you the basic background.
I was 19, I had been dating about pretty seriously for two years and had split up with her, and my best friend had been hanging out with us all the time.
And as you might imagine, they ended up getting together afterwards and I remember finding out because somebody had seen them and they, you know, That guy was like, dude, this is so messed up, I just had to tell you and I remember, I didn't sleep for, like, three days to the hell.
1:36
So heartbroken, and so betrayed by my best friend and so no longer is, you know, the best friend.
And I remember, I literally couldn't sleep for three days because I had so much like white-hot, rage.
I was so angry.
And and I learned so much, I'm so thankful that it happened because the first thing that flares up, if you ever have anything that comes at you, Is your ego, right?
2:01
And that's raged Pride, right?
And then what happened after that in order to like for me to like come down from this huge like rage rage mountain, right?
Was I was Googling like how to forgive people, like Sky couldn't sleep.
I was like, all right.
And I came on this coat, which is in the Post, Its home to understand, is to forgive and as Pascal, who was a Critic because, you know, amazing, that petition will not be able to attract.
2:24
Pascal's triangle abuse.
Also, Christian Theologian, and for some reason that was the one that stuck out to me.
Me and I didn't know what to do.
So I actually wrote a love story from the perspective of my exbest, friend, and his now relationship with my ex girlfriend and I tried to see how he would write the story of his own love for her from afar and how, you know, you know, whatever that Dynamic would have looked like for him in.
2:54
Having this this this love that you couldn't act on and then finally being able to do that and appreciate her and whatever.
If you delete Words, you know, necessary whatever.
And I tried to write that story and, you know, and I really dug into like, how he was raised in his relationship, with his dad and his mom.
3:11
The things that led into making him.
He was in the values that never he now had as a result of that.
And after I finish the story, like, I mean, it was truly like a story that I wrote out, I used to be a little bit more.
I used to, I used to be, I was the editor of the newspaper and the literary magazine.
3:28
When I was in high school, And so I used to be a little more literate than I am now.
But anyway, so I wrote this story in like finally after finishing, I was able to sleep because I felt like I understood and so I tell you that story because I had a couple of things to 11 really easy thing that you can apply to more than one bigger thing.
3:49
So, the biggest thing is that I had a franchise or I think make some scathing video about us and, you know, And it's always in the thing is the more like more times.
You go up rage Mountain, the the faster you recognize it and the fast-food come back down and then kind of appreciate it.
4:09
And so I looked at and so this is just like something that's helped me a lot in life.
My life is, I was like what?
What would cause that person what upbringing what relationships, what deficiencies and insecurities?
4:26
What holes were trying to fill?
Would create the necessity to act in this way, right?
And then what happens is you start to really uncover the fact that somebody might be, just not cold, you know what I mean?
I have like significant deficits in their life and the love that they might have received from even their wife, their, their significant others, their parents, whatever.
4:48
The people who form them, that created these holes and sometimes Ultra successful people have massive holes that the trying to fill, right?
And so trying to think about that.
And then what happens is, I get like this overwhelming amount of empathy, and sadness for that person, and then my anger disappears.
5:04
And it's something that's really served me well, throughout my life and here's a visual, like the people, you know, big, big, big examples, right?
But but the other day, I was at the gym and I was just, you know, doing leg presses and I put bands on my leg presses.
5:22
So that it's hard at the top and easier.
The bottom, I know this is really just a lie, but so it gets harder as you get.
Also, it's an accommodating strength of.
So you get, you just basically your legs, you're bigger and stronger faster, and it's better.
And this is personal trainer comes up to me.
5:37
And I'm like headphones on like just like panting between my sets.
And this personal trainer comes up to me, he's probably 65 68 years old and he's wearing his suit coat hooks of here.
He's probably a buck Thirty soaking wet and he's wearing the the finger toe shoes.
5:56
You guys don't talk about.
He's one of the guys who like wants to talk about like angles of rotation and like 13 degrees and like or provinces change protocol the ball, right?
But it doesn't even look like he like, looks like it.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
6:16
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career, I questioned partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
6:39
And he was like hey man, you know, you can fool around your band so much as you want, but if you really want to work the bottom of the movement, you know tip just take them off and then really just you know do a weight.
You can do that and he had this client with.
It was some problem, 55 year old woman who's out of shape behind me.
6:58
And there was this moment in knew that was about to just like absolutely put him in his place for just not knowing anything about what he's talking about and so I'd alike Deep breath.
And I was like, thanks for that advice, man.
Like have a great day and I put my headphones back on and I started like, you know, it's like in these emotions.
7:18
Start coming, right?
You start thinking like, okay, okay.
And then I realized that like for him in that little world I don't know what's led to him for being, you know, being 65 years old and working at Gold's as a personal trainer.
But that's that's his reality, you know what I mean?
And so I thought to myself like this might have been a moment where he was able to feel really significant and he was able to You know, gained a lot from this direction of the thing is, is if I go over there and I and I just totally just, you know, destroy him personally in front of his client.
7:49
I don't make me feel good, maybe.
But then I'm the type of person who does that.
And then I also have to think like okay well then how's this going to affect him, right?
Like he needs this woman to like feed himself, right?
I mean he's there at 6:00 in the morning at Gold's training a you know if it's fair lady you know, whatever and Oh, he like he needs that in or like, I don't need that.
8:11
And so it was like, who needs this more who need the interaction more.
And so I thought about it I was like he needed that interaction and so I'm glad that it was me that he was able to say that to rather than someone who might watch out.
And then like, otherwise embarrass him in front of his client.
8:28
And so that was that was kind of a conclusion there.
And so I just I share that with you because maybe somebody clicks you at the gym and then I had like this beautiful speech that I've already like, pre-recorded in my head of exactly what I was telling, which, you know, I did.
8:44
I recorded my head during the next three sets and I got great sets in, but um, but anyways, so I don't know if this if this applies to anyone.
But I think if you ever like see Ingrid super, like raged up, I try and think, like, how can I understand this person?
9:00
Because I don't think most people have an intention that's evil.
I don't think that, I think that they're doing what they believe in their own narrative to be best whether or not that's absolute truth or not, is Irrelevant for the free or our emotions and, and maybe sometimes if you slow down for a second and think like, huh, I wonder what created that action will created that person.
9:23
You know, feeling a lot better about it and you don't feel this need to lash back out and then it kind of turns into this weird gratitude of like I'm glad I got to be me instead of someone who might have heard that guy.
You don't need me anymore.
I'm glad I got to be me instead of, you know, and I mean, just I'm going to go really fast a little bit even further at this.
9:43
So there's another part of you that's like, how come I'm doing this?
Why do I deserve this?
Why does someone lash out at me?
Why did someone make it?
You know, a skating thing about sir?
Whatever, right?
And then I'm like, what ignorance you don't?
I mean, what's?
So centeredness is think that like, we don't, you know, like come on like Jesus, right?
10:02
So whether you're a Believer or not, most people can agree that he was a really good guy, right?
So, like, arguably one of the best guys who ever lived, right?
If you're, if you're not, you know, believer, Is he was like beaten in the streets, baton, and then crucified.
And so it's like if we feel like we're not going to encounter people who are going to take strong positions against us, then we're probably not doing anything great, right?
10:27
And so I think what we need to look at is also like, what type of person is standing against you and think like, is that the right type of person here?
And I mean, if I have all these people who were like really Godly and like, you know, I mean at least in my own perception of like how I see things like people who have like right Morals are standing against me then I'm going to take, huh?
10:45
I'm gonna have to take a look at.
I need to check myself, but on the flip side, if I had a whole bunch of people who have like horrible reputations about being like, you know, liars and cheats and and just like totally like mistreating the customers and things like that who stand against me, like I'm cool with that.
11:02
So anyways, I hope this spoke to somebody and maybe somebody had some stuff that was going on but I have an amazing Friday, guys.
Maybe you don't elbow jab somebody in the in the Throat for cutting you off in traffic and take a couple breaths and seek to understand and then you can forgive.
11:19
So there's also guys and I'll talk to you soon, alright?

The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast, but the longer GE you delay.
0:30
The ask the bigger, the ask can be Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe in this video.
0:46
We'll break down the difference between branding and direct response marketing and why not deeply understanding.
The differences costing you millions and millions of dollars.
And ultimately the amount of money that you probably want to make.
And if you don't know who I am, my name is Alex, mozi, I own acquisition.com.
It's a portfolio of companies that is about 85 million dollars a year in revenue and I have nothing to sell you.
1:05
All right?
I'm making It is because I was once broke and I've learned a lot of lessons on the way and I don't want the pain that I experienced to be in vain, right?
That's why I make these.
So that being said, branding versus direct response.
I think this is one of the more interesting topics that I have dove into over the last year or so and it's come from a variety of different conversations.
1:27
I've had with top marketers.
In this morning, I had a conversation with Dean gracioso you who is a phenomenal world-class marketer.
And we talked for like An hour this morning, just about this concept of the difference between branding and direct response and I thought I would share some of the lessons of discussion points that we had with you so that you can hopefully benefit.
1:45
And so, the first point is that you may have heard this in my book and really offers, but the longer you delay, the ask the bigger, the ask can be.
So for example, if you're, if you can use this in any situation whether you're you know courting a lady or guy or whatever, you know if in the first five You're like, hey, let's go in together.
2:07
It's like, well, you might have some audience that be willing to do that, but the vast majority of people would not be willing to do that.
But you, if you date for, you know, six months, then that might be something that would be almost, everybody would be willing to do that after six months depending on whatever really believes.
That's not my point here, but you can get the idea that a higher and higher percentage.
2:22
People would be willing to take you up on that offer if they spend more time with you.
And so the longer the delay, the bigger the ask, and the visual that I like to ascribe to this is the longer, the runway, the bigger, the plane that can take off.
And so, the bigger the payload, You can get based on the mount you delay to the same degree.
2:39
If you've seen Gary Vee he's he's a he's an influencer and and he owns a marketing agency out of New York and he spent I want to see 10 years or 12 years building his personal brand.
And then he finally had his asked, which was Hey by my 10 ft.
2:54
And then within this band of, you know, six months ended up making like a hundred million dollars from that nft launch right now.
I would make the argument that the nft launched itself was actually direct response marketing play.
Whereas everything prior to that was really about Britt building the brand, right?
3:10
And so different examples of this that I think would be important to drive the point home.
And why I think that the many many, many marketers start and Drug response and then end up in branding is because of what about to share with you.
So please listen closely to this.
3:25
If you were trying to make more money, If you look at most big consumer Brands, you look at, you know, Colgate or Crest or, you know, shampoo Brands, right?
That have been here for very long time.
They're not offering two-for-one deals.
They're not like, hey, go by this toothpaste for 50% off, right?
3:42
That's not actually what they're doing.
They're just talking about the products.
And if you look at some of these bigger celebrities that exist, you look at Dwayne Johnson The Rock built his huge brand and then said, hey I'm offering, I'm starting this Aquila, got you guys should check it out.
Conor Sure, Conor McGregor built up, you know, his personal brand that's today.
4:00
Check out proper 12.
Kylie Jenner was like, Hey, built a brand, and then she did her lip kits.
And so what's interesting, is that brand people are now, realizing is an amazing Arbitrage opportunity for maximizing value.
And I think part of the reason behind this is that Goodwill compounds faster than revenue does.
4:20
And so hear me out, think through this with me, if you've seen, somebody who's consistently been selling and this maybe you what happens is you Provide value in some way and then you extract the value that you've the equity in the relationship, through monetizing it through and ask, or some sort of Right Hook as they say, just getting them to try and buy something, right?
4:40
And the thing is that whenever you make an ask, you decrease, your Goodwill, right?
And so you kind of have to start over at zero again and then you build up Goodwill and then you and you ask and then it goes back to zero again, right?
So you're constantly depositing and extracting capital in the relationship and the hope is that it costs you less, did it?
4:58
Posit, then you make on the extraction, right?
Like that's fundamentally, what like traditional direct response marketing is at its most basic form, right?
And the reason it is direct response is that we are actively requesting a direct reply or immediate action as a result of seeing our advertisement, right?
5:18
Of any kind to contrast that with branding, what we're doing with branding is that we are reinforcing the values in the stories that people Tell about our products and services.
All right, so we're reinforcing Stories versus asking for actions and you might be like, well I you know, branding doesn't make sense and I want to tell you this because when I started out my career, I thought that every single company that did branding was retarded, I was like you guys are idiots.
5:47
If you guys understood how to rock response work, you guys would make more money.
I'm such a genius blah blah blah and I was wrong as I often am and the more I study the These massive companies, I was like, okay, so all of these companies all do this type of marketing.
6:04
Whereas, little old me is doing this quick.
Do you know, jab, right hook, whatever, Marv just of, just give us, give us, give us.
Give asking always just, you know, deposit enough value in order to extract the value later, in the thing is, is people get it.
People have seen it, they know the game and yes, it does work to a limited degree, right?
6:24
But I would, it's very, very rare to find A massive, massive drug response company.
I'm not saying they don't exist, but I would say the preponderance of enormous companies are not direct response based companies and so why is that?
And I would posit in this is my theory and this is what I talked to Dean this morning about at length is the difference between direct response and branding is not the I Roi on the advertisement itself but on the time Horizon with which we measure it.
6:56
Alright and so in direct response to You're always calculating your return on ad spend immediately.
Rather than thinking, can I build up this brand and then look at the return, you're getting on that brand over all over an extended period of time.
7:12
And so I'll give you a classic example to illustrate the difference.
If I were selling T-shirts, a direct response, marketer might have a cool funny meme thing.
Aggressively Market, it have upsells, of two of two of the same shirts, five of the same Spirits, getting on continuity for each mean fruit every month, blah, blah, blah.
7:31
All right.
It would be a typical direct response.
Marketing play Nazi can't make money doing it.
You can't.
And that's, this is the big exception I'm having here, right?
Is that, like, you can become a millionaire doing small games.
All right, so I'm not saying you can't do it.
You absolutely can.
It's just that?
7:47
What type of game would you prefer to play?
And I can say that as I've aged, or weathered in the game, I continue to shift more and more Burning.
But I do think there's a balance needs to be struck, but from a, from a branding perspective in that same example, it would be spending a year, talking about what your values are the, the stories that you want people to tell about you and your company.
8:10
And then you can simply put your brand on a T-shirt and people will pay $100 for it.
Right?
And so then, what is the return on the advertising did for that year?
Well, if you can sell t-shirts for $100, Rather trying to are rather than trying to Arbitrage, you know, Meme, t-shirts and discounts, and bundling, and doing all sorts of more complex things.
8:32
And just simply saying, if you believe what we believe vote, with your dollars, about the things that you care about, right aligned with us, and that's fundamentally.
What branding is and the wooden branding works very well, is when what you are saying, about your brand clarifies, what people already saying.
8:49
And so a lot of times people have a general gist of what your brand is.
Hopefully, It's what you want, often times, it's not.
And this is, especially true in the direct response marketing community at large, because people say terrible things about the people who are doing their drug response and so their brand is the reputation in the things that other people say about you.
9:10
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
9:30
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
But in an example that Elon Musk gave an interview, I can't remember where you give it.
He talks about how the consumer is the one that creates your brand.
9:47
You said, if you look at, I think he gave the example of Toyota and forth, but the point is not necessarily the brands, but more.
So, the message, which is, he said, listen, you know, for talked about being reliable and being high quality, Etc, he said in Toyota their marketing.
Never said that.
10:02
And yet Toyota is the company that's known for being reliable and high quality and things like that.
Are to the fourths, right?
He said, so as much you can say whatever you want in the in the marketing messaging, but it has to be true.
And so to my interpretation of, that is what you want to do is give people the words to describe your brand that are true and just give them the words to say, rather than trying to redefine the thoughts they have.
10:28
And I think that that is really, what comes to effective branding and doing that deliberately as an added point to that.
This is something that I got from Grant Cardone, which is been one of the one of the really deep and profound lessons.
I think I got from what are two conversations we've had about Marketing in general, but one first off, the many people who don't like Grant.
10:47
You have to appreciate how effective he is, at promoting himself, and his brand like you have to respect that.
All right.
You can you can not like the man, but you can app.
You must respect, what his level of effort and the outcome and the output of his effort, right?
11:04
I personally have had nothing but positive interactions the grant.
But my point is, is that you have to respect that.
Now, that being said, one of the things that he said that I have really taken with me, is the one or two words that someone will associate with your brand.
11:19
He said, when they think of me, I want them to think this, right?
And that is not, you know, this massive declarative, you know, value statement or mission statement, because people don't care, right?
Nor do they remember, The anything and so if you can get the masses to just remember, oh yeah, he's the real estate guy.
11:40
He's the business Builder guy, right?
Which would be more aligned with what we do.
We build businesses and we, you know, we buy interest in information coaching eLearning type businesses that are in a niche and like that's what I want people to associate.
Now they're not going to remember all this stuff that I just said, but if I could just if they can just see like he's a digital business Builder.
11:59
Like you are like this is digital business investor right either of those.
Things would be things that I would say, okay, that's it.
A positive Association.
That's the type of Association that I want people to make with my brand, right?
And the thing is that, if I can wait a longer time, which is why most people cannot do this.
And why I'm not saying necessarily have to start branding day one.
12:17
But if you can be cognizant of what the message that you were relying in your content and in the advertising that you do, and I'm using advertising by the actual definition, which is to make known right?
When you, when you make your products and services known in the many ways that you do it, if you can reinforce the simple message and Every single thing people will begin as long as it's aligned with what's true to say the same things back to you and that will reinforce the cycle of who you are in the marketplace and what you stand for.
12:46
And so if branding is a higher Roi activity overall, I believe it is and I think that there's the many massive companies that exist out there would be great, Testaments in evidence to that point is that they don't engage in direct response, marketing, for the most part or even at all to the vast.
13:04
Just like the vast majority of the time.
They are talking much more about who they are and what they stand for, right?
Why they do what they do, right.
And then people then buy their products and service in accordance with their values and they vote with their dollars.
But the things that they care about being the identity that they wish to associate with, right?
13:22
And so I think that the reason Seth Godin started with direct response and then became and now talks exclusively about branding.
The reason, Simonson deck started direct response and then talks way more about branding.
The reason that I started in direct response and talk much About bringing stuff.
Now, at least that's my belief and where I think it's because that's where you make more money, just over a longer time Horizon.
13:43
And I think the reason that many direct response marketers burnout is because they don't like the brand that they are building for themselves, which is why most people leave the space over a long enough time Horizon.
And so that's why you don't see many I'm not saying there aren't any, but the vast majority of direct response, marketers tend to be younger and one of the difficult things about this and I was having a conversation with a friend about this.
14:04
Is that That because it is such a young space.
There are no, there are not many people who have old lessons and so the the predominant education that exists in the spaces, people who are new, the fact that someone can consider themselves a quote OG in the internet marketing space.
14:21
After three years is laughable, right?
It's laughable to Larry's, but it's true in that space.
It's very difficult to be an OG because most people burn out because their brand Equity drops so much right.
And so, if The only way that we can build very big things is doing them the same thing over a long period of time.
14:39
Then it would create the don't say obvious.
But a natural conclusion.
That branding is the direction that more people end up going in once they have the ability to do so.
And so if you can delay, the ask and you can have the resources and you can have the patience to build something bigger, your Goodwill will compound faster than your Revenue will in a direct response, marketing environment, and so this is the concept around give Give rather than ask give give give comma, give give give comma, give give give get.
15:12
And what's interesting is that I think most people and the prospects that are consuming your your content and things like that.
They are waiting for the other shoe to drop there, waiting for you to make the ask and so they have their guard up, but if you give give give and then, right?
15:30
When they're expecting, you to ask give again, and then again and give even more Their guard begins to drop and then they start think, man, this guy or this, gal is awesome.
I really like this person and then something interesting happens.
They start telling people about you because they don't believe that they're sacrificing, their own brand Equity, by sharing your message.
15:51
And so that is where the compounding effects of word-of-mouth start to take off.
And so when I say that Goodwill compounds faster than Revenue, it's because in the traditional example, it would be give, give give asking this isn't me pooh-poohing, Gary or anything?
Like that.
I mean, I think that very much at least establishing that Cadence is useful for most people who are doing it to respond, direct response, at least, get something before you ask, right?
16:12
But if rather than asking, right where you have to start over at zero because you build brick, you build equity, build value in the relationship, and then you asking you back down to zero, and then you build it and you go back down to zero.
And then you basically always cap by the amount of value that you have in the relationship, that's the cap, right?
16:29
But the alternative if you were to look at this, visually would be give, give give give give give Give give give and then it keeps going.
The chart keeps going off.
And then at a certain point, a certain percentage of that audience because they have they are reciprocal in nature type people.
They will take steps towards you without you even asking simply because they believe so strongly in what you have.
16:50
And those are the types of clients, right?
That you want to be able to take on it, just takes patience to get there.
But when you have those types of clients, they get better results, they paper, bigger premiums and that also gives you implied scarcity within your products and services and you were always under selling your And which will essentially eliminate your bottleneck that you have in growing, because you will always have more demand than you can possibly handle.
17:13
And that is the benefit of building the brand, over the long term, rather than simply the, the one-two punches in order to extract Capital today.
And so if you can delay, the amount of time that you have between, when you provide value, and when you ask and ideally you never, do you simply allow the Goodwill to continue to compound, allow the word of mouth to continue to grow to the point where you start receiving money.
17:34
Really far, far further in the future than you are now and what you are accustomed to doing.
But in that future State you can then look at the minimal amount that you're spending right in order to distribute your message to advertise, right?
To make known and then you will see that you have significantly higher Returns on your advertising efforts, it just took longer to get there and so understanding the differences in branding in direct response and having a longer-term perspective and looking at the O G's in the space or lack thereof.
18:01
And the people who have transitioned from direct response to pretending, I Think that there is a lot of lessons that we can take from it and this is just one of them that I wanted to share with you and if you're new to the channel, welcome to Mosey Nation.
I said this earlier but our portfolio is about 85 million dollars a year.
It's actually higher than that.
I just try to stay consistent but I think is probably over 100 now.
18:18
But I make these videos because I struggled a lot coming up and I and I just I hope that you know, the pain that I went through is not for nothing.
And so I that's why I make these videos and yeah.
So we I just, I just hope you like it.
So anyways, keeping awesome.
I'll see you guys next bit.
18:34
Bye.








0:00
I see business is Three core skills, it's like you got to learn how to build, you got to learn how to sell and you gotta learn how to lead.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What was the front end?
0:17
Was it like a course or was it straight into the licensing model?
I think the back end was like the full Suite, right?
Pay us x amount per year and have access to everything.
Yeah, the gym launched the original product for the first five years was 16,000 for 16 weeks.
So 16 K 16 weeks.
0:33
So bucks a week and tumors would make significantly more than That in new contract, sales cash upfront, cash collected etcetera.
It definitely was not a course.
And I think that's where we parted from that.
Probably five years ago.
I saw, you know, I saw the course business world, there's something wrong with it but it was especially cuz we're Niche.
0:49
You know what I mean?
So you've got 50,000 Jim's it micro gems.
I'm not gonna.
You know, if I wanted to sell 2,000 gym owners at 1,000 bucks, a pop, I think two million dollars like that's just not super interesting.
But if I sold 2000 gym, owners at you know a hundred thousand dollars pop, it's like it's 200 million, it's much more interesting.
1:05
So it's like, how can we We do that.
But no for us it was implementing an entirely new business model because with the implementation of like the acquisition system, other holes the business become clear.
It's like oh you're pricing on your term, you know, businesses often hey these are the new membership options, you should be selling.
This is how you should leg or floor.
1:21
This is how you should be helping her coaches, say up your sales guy like there's all these other problems that came up as soon as we saw the first problem.
So the first one is really just kind of an accelerator to get them.
People in the door, get them passion, their pocket and the second one is to buy them time back in transition from a job.
So NASA got it and the So that was a front of your front.
1:37
End was 16,000 for 16 weeks.
What was the backend behind that then 4242 was that the licensing where they get like access to like basically the done-for-you licensing.
One was just a truncated duration.
Yeah.
Okay, got it because they could use the ads, they could use the pages, they could use everything.
1:54
We've already built, just press go and just put they're known for their name on but they could use it only for that 16 weeks.
Was that the yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
So it's a pretty seamless transition into the 40 because it's just more of what they Already paid a lot of for and got value my favorite up.
2:09
So more of what you already got, ya more what you already got which you probably liked and enjoyed and got results from.
So now you want to keep using, it makes sense.
I'm glad I asked that question, very simple business.
Well and I'll tell you I've run.
All right here, I'll say it.
I mean, learn about his damn complicated as a can get.
2:26
I've made other businesses.
Actually is my superpower is I complicate things like I go in and I'm like, oh let's you know, let's see.
How do I do this?
And lately, I'm just Like and I swear I think it's because we had a baby so I like limited energy so I'm just like you know like like let's not do that.
2:44
Let's not do that.
Let's definitely not do that.
Let's just do this and like let's just do this and do a lot of it.
And you've talked about this in your podcast before where you're like a lot of entrepreneurs especially in the information space will get to a certain size and they're just like I think it's over and start launching everything else and it's like to do.
3:01
You barely got started like there's such a huge Market.
I have a friend really good friend of mine.
He owns a pizza restaurant.
So I was like, jiving with him a few weeks ago, telling him ways and strategies to use the internet.
Well, I don't see anyone doing this.
I'm like, this is how you can get business using the internet so like not hard and he's just looking at me like completely like, right?
3:20
And I just happened to go Google this and I was shocked.
There's 42,000 pizza restaurants in the country and I was like, holy crap, I think it's 40.
So it's 42,000 non franchise non corporate owned.
So it's Yeah, it's like it's 42,000 like independent Pizza.
3:40
Which first of all, by the way, that was a really easy data point to get.
And I was like, wow, that's cool.
Google had it right at the top and I was actually thinking of you.
I'm like this Market needs to be Alex from Rosie, like this.
Like, these guys don't know what they're doing about, how to get business.
But all right, I have a question.
3:55
I don't know if you're publicly on the record about this, what's the next book you're writing?
Whatever leads?
Nice, love it.
So, your book, you know, I that's how I came to know if you and I I feel like a lot of people are kind of getting to know if you have an odd places, I kind of, you know, seeing stuff about Jim launch and all of that.
4:13
But your book, you know, the book came out.
So this is funny I'll give the backstory was like everyone starts talking about.
Mike, who the hell is this guy talking about offers like what is this hundred million dollar offer?
So what is this ridiculous?
So I was like, I got to look at this like I've been in this space for 20 years, I don't know.
This guy's so open the book.
4:28
I started reading it and I'm like, That's the one question by the way that I had beside teach copywriting I teach everything.
The one question I have always struggled to answer for students is how do you make a good offer?
And like I could just never really answer.
It's a tough question and so now it is it's just like go by Alex's book like that books.
4:47
Got the full frame where I also say good luck because it's freaking hard.
You'll spend more time trying to check off the boxes in that book than ever but that's by Design.
So a hundred million dollar leads so you're going to share see.
Systems to generate leads paid organic all anything else that you've got your shared about that.
5:06
Yeah.
So there's four ways that a person can let another person know about a thing and then there's two strategies in addition to that.
So there's six in total but the other to leverage the first four.
That's awesome.
Alright awesome.
Like do you have a rough idea when it's coming up?
I'm guessing, q1.
I finished the final.
5:23
I like the first draft this last weekend, and so I'll have to go through second drafts and edits, all that kind of stuff, and Usually I'm a guessing they'll probably take 12 weeks and then from there I'll take 12 weeks to get it published and all that kind of stuff.
So probably six months ish from now, q1.
5:39
Awesome.
All right, so let me ask you this question, you kind of alluded to it earlier.
Will you ever operate another business?
Or is it just investor from here on for you?
It depends how you see the hold cooperation.
So you know I mean because it's if you think about Warren Buffett and Charlie, I think they definitely were active in, you know, Berkshire Hathaway.
5:58
They have 19 employees.
Etc.
Now is Does it require do any of the portfolio companies?
Require them to grow?
No, absolutely not.
But they're actively involved in trying to, you know, fix things.
Obviously, these are much older now and they take, but it's not looking at what they're doing now.
It's looking at what they, what they did to get here, right?
I think they were working a lot.
6:15
And so, you know, it's the same degree.
That's, that's very much.
How, my time is spent is it's almost all helping the portfolio companies, but not actually selling something that makes them so that and that was actually going to ask you.
It sounds to me very Berkshire Hathaway and I was going to be like, do you have any employees at acquisition?
6:30
Come I have seen the office you work out of.
So I did see that Tick-Tock video Camp.
Can't fit many employees into that office.
So, do you have any official employees of acquisition.com?
Yeah, we have a full.
Okay.
Very cool too.
Okay, awesome.
And so, what are they doing?
6:45
Other than, obviously, their support staff to help support you.
I know worked with your assistant, who's awesome, but do you have people that are out there looking for deals?
Analyzing the deals?
What is the support staff will play?
Yeah, I mean there's definitely the deal, the deal analysis side.
That's a decent amount of bandwidth but if we were to divide the company up, 75 percent of it is supporting the portfolio companies.
7:08
And so that's basically everything we can to help each of the Departments of each of the companies grow.
So we've got people who are experts in marketing.
People are experts in sales expert and all you know, all these different components that we can help them.
Grow is excellent.
Okay, so you have people that work full-time for acquisition of calm whose job is to coach whatever their expertise is into the portfolio.
7:30
Companies, whether it be sales or marketing or any of that.
Yeah, I wouldn't use the word coach but yes to support that better.
So why not use the word coach?
I'm curious.
Why would that get you laughing?
What's wrong with that word mostly?
Because I think it has a different connotation, you know what I mean?
7:46
I would say this is much more.
You know, advice counsel that it is like coaching, you know, they're not on accountability calls and stuff like that.
They're more.
Like, this is how you need to lay out this department.
This is the cop structure of these.
Are the way that we're going to recruit these people, like, we need to switch the software up, things like that rather than like, hey did you do this?
Things you did last week, you know I mean it's a little kind of consultant / like almost like a board member much.
8:06
Yes, it's much more akin to that.
Okay.
Got it.
Got it got it was, it's a good, it's a good difference in, I'm glad you brought that up.
All right, so let's pivot to social media.
It's a lot of work, man.
Why not just do some paid stuff?
What's going on?
Like and let me let me share why I'm saying this.
8:21
So I'm loving it.
I'm not going to complain and my my social media is blowing up but we were just talking about this before our interview started.
Where my head AV guy was like man we're just like it is so crazy how fast we burn through the stuff.
We shoot.
Because we'll one week will be like, yeah, we're two months ahead and it's like hey man, I'm about to run out of content like three days.
8:43
So like can we film or?
And I like we just filmed and so it is exhausting but I'm seeing, you know, your stuff and you're very prolific, you made a video recently, we talked about like kind of how much you spend just on it.
So I'm curious you came from pay.
You did a ton of paid and then all of a sudden one day you're like I To do organic like a lot of organic talk me through that mindset.
9:04
Well, the first one was so weak.
I said, start this.
Now that there's six weeks can get customers, right?
So you can we do paid ads, you new content marketing, you can do cold a pound or you can do warm up out where you can do referrals, you can do Affiliates, right?
So there's our going, like the six strategies you can do to get get people, right?
9:19
I had built a company using five of the six.
So I've used each of those five in different companies that we've owned, and then sold the one that I hadn't done as I've never built an organic base brand, so, Sounded fine to try and do something that I hadn't done before and that was honestly, the primary thing.
9:35
The secondary reason was that, I knew that for what I wanted to build, I would want it to be inbound like deal deals are not sales, you know, I mean, it's a partnership for very long term commitment.
You have to come in with trust, especially because we're in a minority stakeholder situation.
9:52
Like we have to be able to lead with influence rather than with legal, you know, arm-twisting which is how I prefer not to live my life and He's so kind of solving backwards from the problem of like how do we get lots of people who already trust me to want to work with me for the long term?
It's like well then they should have consumed a lot of my stuff so I can either do a pate thing but that's still more salesy and we're buying not selling.
10:12
So we're in a reverse situation.
So I had to kind of reverse the funnel and make it off with inbound and so that's why I did it off organic.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
10:33
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Right around the time that I saw, you really go deep into, it was right around the time that I was thinking about it.
I have not done cold outbound but of all the ones that you mentioned, the only two, I have not done our cold outbound.
10:55
I've got a little warm outbound, probably do better with that, but I had not done organic at all.
And mostly the reason I had done not done organic was it is a time commitment.
But mostly also I'm a bit of a private person.
So the idea of me talking about my relationship with my wife or whatever it just, Just didn't really settle with me.
11:13
And so this is a funny story, you'll appreciate this.
So we use some of the same resources in the sense of Consultants that work with us.
So the first time he came down, flew down to film with me he's talking and he was telling me a lot about kind of stuff that you and him have done together.
11:29
It gives talking I'm like all right when you went to film with Alex, first time, how many videos did he do?
And he's like, yeah, 100.
I'm like we're going to do 101 and he's like I don't want, it was like we're going to 101.
He's like, we don't really need to be taught.
Sounds like Tim it except really 201.
But I was arguing with him because he would tell me to do certain topic, right?
11:47
And I was like, how to talk about that, right?
And boom.
He'd be like, let me show you, right?
Of course it would show me your channel and so I studied your channel.
I like the mix.
I think it's very, very meticulously done.
You can see the balance of like cake sticking to the point of like you know, that attracts that but then come out sometimes kind of veering off and getting personal.
12:09
What's interesting is I I'd watch your content for more the professional side, but I just told you earlier, I'm like, I've seen your flannel shirt at that your flannel video.
I thought that was freaking hilarious.
I've seen your office video so actually, it does help for people that are following you till I kind of see that other side.
12:26
Like your Chipotle thing.
Dude, makes me laugh, like every time I go to Chipotle every single time I eat Chipotle.
I'm like, I think about Alex from Rosie.
So you somehow branded yourself along Chipotle now, but that stuff really helps.
And so when I got started with it I wanted Outreach.
12:41
I was like, I'm really tired here is what I was tired of.
I was tired of every time.
Someone sees my face.
It's commercial.
It's an ad.
It's me holdin.
Something me saying come.
Yeah.
And I was like, I would love them have different place in my life.
Not love to be able to every time someone sees my face, I want them to be.
12:57
Oh, what is he up to say today?
Like and so organic was the best way to do that for anyone who's listening or watching.
Organic will take some time.
But man, when she starts to take off, it's a go freaking freight train that, you know.
Like, right now we're getting on YouTube alone.
Leave. 15 million views a month.
13:13
I don't even know how to process that.
It's like, it's growing so fast.
So what's your favorite social media channel?
Let's say gunned ahead.
You got to lose them.
All you get to keep one, which is the one that you think is Zoomer to Consumer to postal not to post for your business.
I like YouTube YouTube.
13:30
What about the Cuban?
I would have, said, YouTube / podcast.
I just like the long-form stuff, you know?
I mean, the long-form stuff you can go so much deeper in the topics.
I feel like you can provide a lot more value in a in a real way.
Nothing you can't do in the shorts but it's you get, you get the difference, it's a, you can really take apart a topic and get some to understand something rather than just like a quick quick hitting belief shift.
13:50
Hey Ryan, did you hear that?
Ryan, did you hear that?
Long form is still better than short for women.
I argue about this all the time you can, okay?
Also, think about shortest, top of funnel versus middle or bottom of photo, you know, it's a different way of thinking about it.
So maybe I mean, it's again, these are preference, we do them all.
14:07
And then in terms of using its Twitter by far, I'm a huge Twitter guy left hook.
I don't do Twitter at all.
I don't even.
I don't even on a log into my Twitter.
I don't know why people like Twitter.
What's so great about Twitter, talk to me.
Like I'm not, I'm just not in the Twitter land at all, so not to offend anyone and other platforms, but I think the quality of the average Twitter user is higher.
14:26
So like they have higher average income like higher IQ.
I don't like the discussions that are happening on.
Twitter are much more interesting to me than, like, you're not going to see like tons of cut viral cat videos on Twitter, you know, I mean, maybe there are.
But they're just not getting served about about but like there's just less of that the other Quitters kind of like it select.
14:45
Yeah, it's kind of like a it's like a, it's like a more Maverick LinkedIn.
You know what I mean?
People are not necessarily more polished there, but the difference is that people are being judged on the quality of their ideas.
So it's not just some groans posting but pictures, it's you all you got is and and because of the character limited forces concision.
15:04
And so I think a lot of people tend to draw a lot of people don't know why they're saying what they're saying, they just like make noise.
And so I think there's a higher signal-to-noise Ratio on Twitter overall and so I think I get more value from consuming Twitter and then I thought also think that Twitter is made me a better writer, is it forces me to consolidate my thoughts into single like various shorter sound bites?
15:23
Speaking of Twitter, so on Twitter, if I want good people to follow can I go to your profile and see who you're following?
Is that a good measure to see?
Like some like because we have similar interests, you know?
Like business people, you know, I'm pretty sure I would enjoy following the same time people that you follow.
15:38
So I'll just hack whatever you're doing.
That's like what.
Art one-third one-third.
It's like comedians, philosophy and business.
Those are like the three that I follow.
Nice.
Alright.
I can see that.
So, speaking of Twitter, what do you think?
You think, you think he's gonna Elon Musk is going to get Twitter?
15:55
You think is going to fall apart?
I hope so.
I hope so.
I think it'd be really good for the platform and I really like the platform.
Do you think there's a lot of fake users and robot issues?
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
I mean I don't know how you deal with it on Instagram but like author.
16:10
I mean I get it.
You know, 50 plus comments per post that are just robots on my Instagram.
So I can't imagine that, you know, I guess I'm getting a lot even on YouTube.
Now a lot of comments that are, that are pushing people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, I'll tell you what, most of my posts on social media.
16:27
I get to learn.
Just how much people hate me?
Well, I don't know me.
Hate me and yesterday.
So this is a funny story.
You'll appreciate this.
And my I got my first 1 million view video on tick-tock.
After being on it for like, almost almost three months, just frustrating me.
16:47
And of course, it's got my wife in it, right?
It's a video about me and my wife and I don't remember filming it's my wife has one simple rule with me she's like if you're gonna talk about me or use me because she's not, she's in my business but she helps manager Investments but she won't like Leila will be on camera and show new.
17:05
My wife is like I'm not don't take a picture of me, don't do anything.
So she's like if you're going to use a picture of me or whatever has to be approved by me first, Wanna see the picture?
Oh my God, I don't know man.
In the middle of this filming session.
How?
I end up filming this video.
I don't remember filming it.
I'm listening to it again.
I'm like say that the video hits.
17:22
I see it on my own Tick-Tock and I'm like, oh shit, because I see a picture of her right in the front.
And I'm like, this is not approved and I'm like, okay whatever she want.
No, she's not on social media, she has no accounts and any social media, but her friends, usually tell her, except like a check, like an hour later in the videos cross like 100,000 views and I'm like, oh shit, this is the one of all And it goes viral.
17:43
So yesterday, she finally makes me, she's we hit a million, she's like, read the comments.
I'm like, never read the comments.
She's like, well, what's the point of posting?
I'm like don't read the comments.
So she finally forces me to read them, you won't believe this, Alex.
I thought I was being Punk'd because they're all positive.
18:01
I could entice, I scanned a hundred comments and I couldn't find a single negative one.
And I was like, wow, I think people are getting nicer.
Yeah.
Hey then then look at the next video and Then I'm like, never mind.
We're back tomorrow.
Look at me.
Everything is good in the land of tick-tock.
All right, so now we've been through a lot.
18:18
So, first of all, thank you for being so open and and just sharing everything for me.
It's, you know, like I told you with where I am right now.
I'm trying to get them trying to nail that simplification side of it.
And so it's really interesting to hear how you think about what a business should do to be simple.
18:34
But highly valuable and kind of learning from the gym launch.
Someone recently I saw on Facebook post and this is a tip for everyone there.
Like Talking about Alex's hundred million offers book and if you're smart go read is Jim launch book.
I don't even know you had a book called that so I was like, alright, I'll go read that.
They said, lots of great wisdom there.
18:50
Hey, if you could go back 10 years and give yourself one piece of advice one.
What would it be to help accelerate your growth faster?
It's tough because I wouldn't want to mess up.
What's happened?
I'm very happy with how things have turned out.
So I really wouldn't want to mess with anything.
I've thought about that a lot because you know, I'm sure you play out these hypothetical scenarios just like, you know, if My eight-year-old self comes back in time and tells me something.
19:14
It's like if he comes back in time and says nothing that I'm like, oh I must turn out.
Well, I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.
I'm asking a different way.
I'll ask you a different way to be easier.
Twenty-year-old, walks up to you right now.
Says Alex, give me the number one advice.
What was once?
One advice you would give me that, you know, it's bar a bar above all.
But advice about being a successful entrepreneur.
19:31
Learn how to sew how to sell, got it.
Yeah, I agree.
It's so, it's so pervasive.
So, I mean, I see business has three core skills, it's like you got to learn how to build.
Gotta learn how to sell and you gotta learn how to lead it starts with selling because no one knows about your stuff until you until you sell them the thing, right?
19:48
And then as soon as you sell you realize that you don't know anything about Building Product or Building Services.
So then you gotta you keep selling it as people are not going to, like what I'm about to say.
But like you're out is that when you start you're going to suck, right?
And that's normal because why would you be good?
You've never done it before.
And so you have to accept the fact that you have to just try with 110% to fulfill as much as you can from the promises you're making on the sale side.
20:07
And so try not to Promise Too Much.
The easiest thing to do is start working for free.
You just to get those initial successes in learn from the failures of the, the people that you the customers you get, even if they haven't pay you, even if they didn't pay you there.
So customers, learn to get to the point where they're like, hey if you said, hey, I'd I'm not going to help you anymore.
20:24
They would say, well, I want you to help me move.
Say okay, well then pay me and then if they say yes, then you know you've got something that's actually providing value, then it's kind of like the shortcut of selling and building products or services.
And then the level above that, that turns it into a business rather than just a high-paying job is learning how to lead others.
20:41
And so I see those three core skills of business.
Yeah, no.
Love it.
Absolutely love it.
It's been super interesting.
A last question, I'll close up with is your obviously watching the markets, you're seeing what not markets like in like Market markets?
I just mean economy or just different Industries.
20:59
What is one?
Two or even three sectors, that you're really hoping that perfect application comes through for acquisition.com.
What's an area that you're really, like, man, I really want to get into, or acquire, a be a part of a Any that's in this area and you should see the amount of cool interesting companies.
21:16
We see every day from an exposure standpoint.
I definitely would love to have more web three stuff, everything that I have seen come across.
Our table is not people who know business.
It's just people are just really know are very interested in web free stuff, but think that the normal fundamentals of physics, don't apply.
So I'd love to see a marriage of like the fundamentals of business with the new technology that exists, so that would be one of them.
21:38
It's kind of like the internet way.
Back in the day.
People thought like fundamentals of business.
Sigma Pi with the internet stuff.
It's like it still applies just as you know, different benefits.
Since one number two I love unique alternative, education stuff.
I mean it's our core thing but that's I love, I love this types of businesses, low capital expenditure High cash flow and I would say a third one that would be like a shadow when people probably wouldn't expect is Payment Processing loan.
22:05
A lot of like Finance related stuff, I've become a lot more interested in that side of the world like the businesses of Finance rather than like Finance per se.
So I would say those are fighting limit to three categories, probably like Finance, some sort of alternative education and then web three stuff.
There's probably three that like would be really interesting to me.
22:22
Love it.
Awesome.
All right, man.
We'll listen, I want to respect your time.
I'd love to have you back in the future at some point, hope to run into you in an event reach some point.
And if I can be of any help to you, please always, you know how to reach me and keep inspiring us.
Thank you so much and congratulations on your success.
I appreciate it.
22:38
Thank you for having me and of the audience got value from the time we had








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur persuasion.
Told number five is Authority.
The reason it's so powerful is not because and what an authority says is actually more persuasive in terms of the actual words they say but because people put up fewer filters and accept more things is truth.
0:40
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
You can get anything you want in life, if you can get other people to get it for you, which makes persuasion among the highest leverage skills in the world.
1:01
Think about, if you just got one person to then just get everybody else to do things for you.
That it means that's the only thing you'd have to learn in order to get whatever you want in life.
And the good news is tons of research has been done on how to become more persuasive and I have to give my nod to Robert K, eldini The Goat Who made most research accessible to the masses in his book influence.
1:21
What I want to do is show you the most effective ways I applied his methods in my own That now do over 200 million dollars a year in combined revenue and hopefully they work even better for you so that you can you grow your business 3 million dollars, plus a year.
So we can invest in and grow together tool number one is reciprocity.
Give that which you want to receive when you show kindness and generosity towards others, they're more likely to return the favor and like you as a result.
1:44
So for example if you pay for your friends lunch that person now feels obligated to return the favor, they're like hey I'll get the next one right now.
Fundamentally they don't have to do that and we already assumed that it works that way because we've just been doing it for so long.
We've been Human being, right?
But that, like, fundamentally, if you pay for it, there would be no obligation for them to pay you back.
2:00
We just almost expect it because it's that deep in our cultural DNA.
Now kld need gives a really beautiful example of how to leverage this in business and he shows an example for a waiter.
So if a waiter puts a mint on the bill, they get 3% more tips, right?
2:15
People get something and they're more likely to tip them a little bit more.
Now, here's the second version of that, the waiter gives the person two minutes, all of a sudden the tips and By 14% significantly more, if you could get a 14% page up, just by putting a second mint on every single thing.
2:31
Why wouldn't you?
I mean, it's worth paying five dollars a month for a big bag of mints just to make sure you get paid.
But the thing is, is that in business, there are tons of these five dollar mint bags that are laying around that you can immediately Implement in your own business.
And the third way they did, the waiter example, was that the person put them in town, turn around and put another mint on the table and that created a 23% increase in tips and it's the same reason that that outside of a retail store.
2:57
As soon as you come in, they offer you a cold water.
It's not because they're nice people.
It's because they know that you'll feel indebted to them and be more likely to a stay longer.
Be listen to them and see ultimately by.
So, imagine how much it costs, a store owner to give everybody who walks in the door, a water.
I don't know, five dollars a day and if they get one person to buy extra a week off of that, which they probably get a lot more, is that worth the investment?
3:17
It's probably the highest return on investment thing in his entire business.
So here's how it works.
Psychologically reciprocity activates the brain's reward system All right.
And so it releases dopamine which is a response to pleasurable experiences are, stuffy alike, including reciprocity.
Alright and so this helps build social bonds and creates positive feelings towards people.
3:34
You can reciprocate with right now.
The main point is the reciprocity increases the feelings of trust and cooperation in Social settings.
So, if you sell stuff for, you want to persuade people, that's where you want to have the trust and cooperation, right?
Cooperation.
Just another way of saying the person does what you want them to do?
3:50
So, here's how you can implement this in your life that being a weirdo.
So, years ago, I actually Ali had this done to me and I saw the effect and it was wild.
All right, so there's this guy that I thought was a complete weirdo.
Now whenever I saw him he was trying to ask me like a hundred questions so he was local to where I was using like some entrepreneur networks and you just like, trying Corner mean I was like, dude, just get away from me.
4:08
You know what I mean?
Like you just is like 100 questions.
He's willing me like so I started avoiding him entirely, right?
It's ours.
And So eventually I had to confront, if you like stop talking to me like go away, leave me alone and be quiet.
And so what happened is, he was so ashamed of the whole experience, whatever he started saying.
4:25
The gifts every single month.
So I'm talking about 500,000, our gifts, every month, like Cutco knives and and like clothing, which is kind of weird, but it was expensive Lululemon stuff.
Anyways, every single month you would send me the stuff.
And for nine months, say something birthday cakes that were custom-made and ice cream like was wild and I still never responded.
4:42
But after a while I just started feeling bad because you just kept sending them and saying like so sorry, I hope everything's awesome, blah blah blah blah.
I was like, you know what, maybe I just saw him the wrong way and I was just like got him off on the wrong foot.
And so even though Oh, I knew what he was doing.
It's still worked and I ended up going out to meet him again, turns out still a weirdo, but the thing is, is that it actually worked, even though I knew everything he was doing and said that's to show you how powerful this stuff is.
5:08
And to give you another one, me personally, on the giving side, I try to get in contact with Arnold Schwarzenegger when I was running gym, which I thought it would make a lot of sense and I wanted him to endorse my book.
That was like, my whole goal.
All right.
And turns out, nothing worked.
It also turns out Arnold doesn't really care about endorsing some kids buck.
5:25
In order to guy's attention with Leyland, I did, was he donated a million dollars to his charity and then we ended up sitting down with Arnold multiple times, right?
And because he used to be one of the famous people, the world, I knew I had to really step it up because he gets custom-made gifts all the time every single day.
And so I knew I had to do something that was gonna get his attention.
5:42
And the thing is, I don't want to give him money because he doesn't need it, but I had to give a cause that he cared about money.
And so that was ultimately, the thing that did it for me and out of reciprocity, you wanted to, like, meet me at cetera.
And so I'm telling you this stuff works at all levels.
Now mind you The gift you have to do is proportionate to the person, you're trying to give to write, but in the beginning, you can just start by giving people free gum when you're in class.
6:02
Which is the first time I learned it when I was in Middle School, is that it turn around.
Open my thing, and out hand.
Everybody else.
Got it turned out, people weren't as mean to me when I gave them gum earlier that day.
And so, it's tiny little thing that cost me almost nothing that made my life, a middle school, a little bit easier.
To number two is consistency, we judge people based on their actions.
6:18
All right, consistency can be used in Persuasion by asking, someone to publicly commit to an idea or action.
A public key can be just in front of you, but it can also Be widely to the world.
All right so if you encourage someone to take small steps towards the commitment that they already made and reminding them of the commitment and asking them to remain consistent with it.
6:33
Then people are more likely to continue down that path.
And if you set the original frame and the original commitment, then you can get them to be consistent with that thing in increasing larger steps.
This is called the cold like foot in the door concept, all right?
So it's the whole idea of like the salesman gets his foot in the door like give an inch get a mile it's all around that and the old saying exist because it's true like you are more likely it's slowly.
6:55
The boiling the Frog, it's the same concept, right?
Something that somebody would never say yes to originally, would definitely be more likely to say yes to earlier.
And so they did a research study where they had people post.
Little signs that said, drive safely was a note card like this and they had it put them in the window for their neighborhood and then they asked them two or three weeks later hey because you're somebody who's so committed to this safety commitment.
7:16
Consistency, reminding them of the thing they said would you be willing to put a big sign in your art?
And people said sure and they put a big sign in the yard.
Now they asked a different set of people would you just be Need to put a big sign in your yard that says the stuff and way more.
People said no.
And so just because they made the first ask and then the second asked in alignment and commitment and consistency, they able to get way more yeses.
7:35
So, for example, a charity organization, may ask someone to pledge a certain amount of money publicly, right?
And then they encourage them to take small steps towards fulfilling that pledge like setting up automatic monthly donations.
And then finally, maybe the remind them of the commitment, ask them to do even more, right?
Because because you're the type of person.
7:52
Do you also want to sponsor this kid in China?
Whatever?
So here's how it works behind the scenes.
All right.
No one wants to be known as inconsistence.
It's a bad character trait among humans, like people don't like to be called flaky.
Lot of people called volatile or erratic.
It's sign of like craziness so people don't like that.
So they want to appear stable consistent throughout their life, it's one of the problems that politicians have because as soon as they say something, they have to stick with it forever even if they change their minds, all right?
8:14
But people have a natural tendency to be consistent with their past behaviors and decisions, especially when they've made a commitment publicly, alright?
That's why switching Brands and so hard for some people.
And the only way for commitments to work is that Has to be voluntary.
You can't force someone to make a commit, otherwise the persuasion doesn't work, they have to voluntarily, do it, which is why I usually have to do with questions, get them to admit it get them to label themselves as a certain way or certain type of person and then ask them to make an action in accordance to the thing they just voluntarily stated.
8:43
So here's how I used it in my life, hopefully, without being too much of a weirdo.
So in sales scripting, you ask lots of questions during the discovery phase.
All right, so that the early part of the sales conversation.
Why are you here?
What do you want?
What is so important to you etcetera and you?
Do that for two reasons, one because you want to hear about the person's problem, to make sure that you can actually solve it.
8:59
But secondly, because you like, commitment and consistency guidelines.
So, as soon as the person labels themselves a certain way, you then reaffirm it.
So you say, hey, just to be clear are you the type of person do x, y and Z's?
And you want to make it a positive label.
So you're the type of person who sticks with their commitments.
You're the type of person who takes action, you're the type of person, who cares about their family.
9:17
You're just a person who values reinvesting in their business.
You say these statements, because you're laying the commitment consistency, that you're going to ask them to stick with, Later on in the conversation.
And the key point is that once they agree to the label voluntarily you then later can make the request in a course that because if they don't decide to do the thing, they have to either make an argument for why they are still the type of person and yet still don't do the thing or they have to admit that they're not that type of person both of which are much harder to do.
9:44
Once you voluntarily stated you are.
So for example, if I said, hey you're the type of person so like let me get this straight.
Are you the type of person who like takes action is in his is willing to invest in themselves if someone Says, yes, then later on, if I say, hey, great.
I think you should invest yourself since you're the type of person who's really willing to take action and really likes to invest in themselves and I think this would be perfect for you.
10:04
Boom.
And then I can make the ass because I just reminded them twice of the commitment they made earlier.
And I'm asking to be consistent with those later during the clothes.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
10:20
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
10:37
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under million All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight, Weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
Tool number 3 is social proof.
10:54
People tend to confirm the actions and opinions of others in a given social group.
And in the reason they do that is because it's safer.
If 100 people Walk This Way, well, they must have some idea and secret is they don't, but people are still wired that way, right?
And so people look to other people for cues about how to behave or what to believe and this is how we learn to be human, right?
11:11
When we were little kids, we just look at other people and say, I'll do what they do because that's what humans do.
And then you start becoming human.
For example, if you, if you see something on Amazon, it has five thousand, five star reviews your way.
More likely to buy it, like, Amazon does this stuff because it knows, it gets people to take action.
It's a persuasive tool.
11:28
And so if you've ever heard a laugh track on a show or it's like hahaha in the background people, then laugh more than if there is no laugh track, which is wild, but we are so conditioned to behave in accordance with how everyone else does that.
That laugh track persuades US and in other words, guess this to do something they want us to do which is laughs better than anything else.
11:49
And so, here's how I used it on my own.
Says, one, I printed out every single five star review, guy got online.
So if you ever get a five star review on trustpilot or your product gets to review or if you have a brick and mortar location, this is where it kills is that you look at all your Yelp reviews and you screenshot every single one of them.
12:06
So I screenshot it all of them and I framed, every one of them so that floor-to-ceiling, my Lobby was five star reviews and then the other have was before and after pictures.
So I'd have every single person and this is how you can weave this into your business, is that in the beginning, right?
When you take somebody on as a customer, Etc.
12:21
Try and capture some sort of visual of their current state and then later when you have the opportunity, you can ask for the after and so that you can put those together and can display those at the beginning of your sales cycle, so that people are more likely to believe you.
When you say I can help you because imagine a world where someone says like, hey Alex, I don't think you can help me lose weight and I was just like, look around the room be like really.
12:45
And then I'd say how much proof would you need to believe and at what point is your requirement for proof, more unreasonable than the amount of proof I have.
And that crushes, their belief of whether or not they could do it, or at least that I was good enough to do it.
If you struggle to get testimonials, there's two reasons.
One, is that you suck seconds.
13:01
You don't ask.
Alright.
And so, one of the things that I do is I also would like to give an incentive to people to leave a testimonial.
And so you can do that with higher levels of service for a temporary period, which by the way, can just give you give them a trial of something that's more expensive later.
Great idea.
Or if you're like in the digital space you can give them access to exclusive media that like they might not otherwise have trainings programs stuff, etcetera.
13:21
And you can just unlock it, only for people who do the thing.
Now if someone doesn't want to freely, give you a testimonial, do not push it the way that I got over that, I say, totally, unlike I immediately back off and like, totally understand, I didn't know, we were, like we had not done, like, I would go totally other direction.
13:37
Like, I didn't know we had done such a bad job that you wouldn't want to talk about it publicly.
And they're like, whoa, whoa, no, no.
I like, I'm not saying that it's like either way, it's totally fine.
What would I need to do in order for you to feel confident about being able to portray as public is now they have to Answer the question and if they'll give you, whatever ensure they will, if you can go do it, then do it and then come back because often times it's like a tiny little thing and it also gives you early indications of someone's not happy, which is also just great to have in business.
14:04
Anyways, and so either, you get more information or you get more testimonials either way, you win tool number for liking or what people like to call Rapport.
All right, so people like people who like them right or who prefer they perceive as friends and the more, you like someone the more likely they are to say, yes, to you, right?
14:20
And so the like, In principle states that people are more likely to be persuaded by those that they like and want to be like in the second part is important.
Alright, physical attractiveness, similarity, and compliments of the three factors to get people to like, you more right, duh?
Right?
But people still don't do it.
And even if people know that other people are being paid, and they even did a research study to test this, they told people that they paid strangers to compliment them.
14:42
And so they then got complimented by a stranger who they knew were getting paid to compliment them.
And guess what?
They still like them more than strangers.
They did.
And so even if you know what someone's doing, it still works and they also found out that there's actually no cap to how much flattery someone will take provided it's genuine and so you can literally compliment someone endlessly over and over again.
15:06
As long as it's genuine and they will continue to take it and like you more, it's wild, but it works.
And here's how I've tried to use this in Persuasion.
So I always use the ACA framework, which is acknowledge what they say complement, what they did about that, what they said.
And then ask another question, you can get basically anybody to like you in a sales conversation or in a social situation where all you just acknowledge what they just said, because it shows that you're listening and paying attention to them.
15:28
Because the thing that people, like more than anything that they pay people, hundreds of dollars an hour to is just a listen to them.
Talk, what do you think therapists are?
They just sit there and they just listen to you talk because your mom, your mom, your boyfriend or whatever.
Don't want to listen to you anymore.
All right.
So you pay people to talk, that's how much people value it, they pay more.
15:44
They pay hundreds of dollars an hour just to get someone to listen to them.
So a you listen acknowledge what they That see you compliment them on what they just said and how it ties to them being a great person, in some way, some positive attribute.
You want to be a Super Saiyan, you link it to something, you want them to be consistent with later and then you ask them the next question to move them down the conversation and so the way that I actually was able to keep my spirits High because if you are ever front facing in a role, whether it's customer service or its sales or anything.
16:12
If you deal with customers all day, then you get tired.
And so what I did was that I actually bought a mini trampoline and I put it next to my desk and so I would meet with people and And I was doing 20 plus consult a day in person, and I would be bouncing on this trampoline and they would look at me, like a psychopath.
16:27
But I would have this.
I be grinning ear to ear and I challenge you, you cannot be in a bad mood and on a trampoline.
I've tried it.
You can't do it.
So you can be tight, you can't be tired because you just start jumping again.
And you're like, what am I doing?
I'm such an idiot.
And so, you laughs, you don't take yourself too seriously.
And then what ends up happening is, people would close more because, like, this guy's such a goof, and when I didn't have the trampoline before that, I actually used to do a cartwheel every single time before I shook someone's hand, when they walk in my gym.
16:49
So imagine you walk in the gym.
Some guy The car will is like, hey, welcome United Fitness, nice to meet you.
My name's Alex, you would crack up be like, who is this guy?
But you know what you did?
After that, you give me money.
All right?
And so because you like to me automatically, even if someone was a sourpuss, I could still turn the mood around because what they ultimately wanted to buy was the feeling that I was giving them during the conversation.
17:08
If you want to be more advanced about this, you can actually ask prospects to fill out a small questionnaire before they get on the phone with.
You just you have more information about them so you can make the call more reliable and now you can actually use that information to build the similarity.
Find things that you have in common show, how your similar etcetera and then ultimately compliment on those things, much faster earlier on best hundred bucks you can spend on your mood is hundred dollar dribbly.
17:30
I promise it really works.
Persuasion told number five is Authority.
The reason it's so powerful is not because what an authority says is actually more persuasive in terms of the actual words they say but because people put up fewer filters and accept more things is truth.
17:46
And so if a doctor says XYZ to you, you just take it as gospel.
And the reason we do that is because Actually takes me less mental effort because if you were constantly determining, whether something is true or not, all day.
As soon as you find a trusted Source, what do you do?
You just listen to it, right?
Which is why mentors are so bad because it actually decreases our speed to decision-making and getting action done, which is why we seek out mentors to begin with which is maybe why you watch stuff on YouTube, right?
18:07
Is like you want to learn stuff from a trusted source.
And so if Warren Buffett gives you investment advice, you can move on it fast because you just trust that he's that he's right, even if his advice is the same as a high school teacher, which means it has more persuasive ability, independent of the message, which is why the messenger and the message are inextricably Linked In terms of their persuasive power.
18:25
So what do you have to do to this?
Your establish credibility as an authority figure and expertise you show, diplomas credentials, Awards, industry recognition, Etc and your track record which is if you followed my Channel at all.
I talk about is building your life resume and having to track record to stand on rather than puffing your chest and having lots of Charisma.
18:43
Instead just saying, you can believe me.
Because what I've done, not what I'm telling you, I'm going to do.
And let me show you how powerful The Authority frame is think about a man who can tell the president of the United States to drop his trousers, and stick his finger up his ass.
18:59
Well, Proctologist can do that whenever they want because they're a doctor, and in that frame in the doctor's office, they are the authority while, right?
The same degree.
If you go into a gym setting, you reason personal trainers want to hang out at the gym, all day isn't because they're finished junkies, but because in the gym, it's the only place they have authority and status.
19:17
Everywhere else, they're just a poor trainer but in that gym, they can get a executive of a Fortune 500 company to drop on the floor and give them burpees, it's wild but it's true.
So the way that I establish Authority is because of your track record, right?
You show that you were good at this thing because of the things that you have already done, right?
19:34
And you can show that through the experience you have and through how you your expertise in terms of how you can explain a concept, all right?
But on top of that, if you add third-party accreditation then I printed out certifications for myself and every one of my trainers.
And so I I was able because people coming to be like, well, are your trainer certified?
19:50
I would say like one which ones do you want?
It would never have any idea and to I'd say well just to put your concern at ease, all of my trainers are double or triple certified.
Now mind you certifications are not a credit of the United States.
Meaning I could have ten certifications that I certified them myself, no nose, right?
20:07
And so I'm saying this to say, I did pay for my trainers to get certified through actual ones, but I also internally certified them so that every one of my trainers was either double or triple certified and that made.
Seems significantly more prestigious, so they had more Authority.
And so people would be far more likely to listen to me and I could transfer that authority to my trainer so that they could run the business on my behalf persuasive tool.
20:29
Number six, scarcity, and urgency urgency is a function of time.
So promotion ends, tomorrow.
Scarcity is a function of units.
I only have 100 of them left.
Alright?
So that's how you can talk about it.
Intelligently people value.
What is scarce the reason gold is inherently valuable versus a rock is that there's just less of it the Even two beers has become this diamond conglomerate even though.
20:50
Rubies and sapphires are actually rarer than diamonds.
Is they actually control the amount of Supply in the marketplace.
They own all the diamonds.
They keep them involves just so that they can keep the scarcity high enough on the diamonds to fetch a premium price, all right?
And so the way that you implement this in Persuasion is that you use limits right.
21:07
Limited time limited Supply, one time offers to create the perception of scarcity and ideally actual scarcity.
All right, the other way to doing is talking loss language.
So instead of like don't you want to To get its.
You don't want to miss out on, right different.
Way of framing the same concept.
And they've actually tested this in copy talking about missing out, what people are not going to have people have more loss aversion, they have desire to gain, so they'd rather save or not lose $100, then gained a hundred dollars, even though economically it's the same so you can use that in your favor when you're trying to persuade someone So, here's an example, you might have heard of in the luxury good space.
21:40
So, if you've seen Chanel or Gucci or Prada or whatever, right?
They actually don't tell the story is how much of any item they'll send.
So they'll have a new spring line and they'll send one or two or three purses and they won't tell the store, how many they're going to send and so in a real way the salespeople have the same concept of urgency.
21:58
They probably figured it out at corporate that even if they said hey say that we don't have that many purses.
The sales people actually got more in the back and so they just actually Control the whole thing centrally they only send them into.
Like, I don't know what I'm going to get the next one in or if I'm going to get another one in at all and so people are more likely to buy but then they took it even further and during covid if you saw it, there were lines out the door because there's like one person and one person.
22:19
Now, you know what stores?
Kept that while everyone else.
Let It Go the fancy stores.
Why?
Because they want to hold a scarce resource, they want to show that there's tons of demand.
That's a little bit of social proof of people like you have to be special its exclusive in order to get in, and if people wait for it it is scarce and therefore more valuable.
22:36
Now, more common example is like a merge drop.
So, if I say, I have a new hat available in my store, that's one thing, but if I say that I signed a hundred of them and that's all there are, and I'll never make this specific color.
Again, I've made them one of a kind, and if you have even the slightest desire to have one of those hats, you're now more likely to get it.
22:55
If, you know, there are limited because you want to do it now before you miss out forever.
Now, the key to doing this is not being fake.
It's the number one thing I can say, if you have scarcity and the thing is Is that people want to have scarcity, but they don't want.
They want to sell as many hands as possible.
I get that.
23:11
I don't know how to say this to you differently.
Besides trust me, if you actually put true scarcity on something, you will sell more.
When I had my massive sales team and we were doing turn around.
So, we had eight cells, guys, that were launching locations, whenever we would do half of our sales in the last 25% of the period.
23:30
Sometimes, even more than that, sometimes, like 60 or 70 percent of the sales.
So when I had my gym once business, where I would turn around, This is before I did licensing.
An Inked.
Guys are flower to location.
We spent 21 days, three weeks on location.
Here's the crazy part.
Two-thirds of the sales happen.
The last one, third of the time period and the lead flow is the same.
23:49
But here's the thing, the sales guys knew that their time was going to be over and they needed to leave and get the check they wanted and the people that were coming in the urgency of like you have to sign up now.
Then the beginning was like it's three weeks away but when it was two days away, everyone signed up back to back to back because it was limited.
24:06
Added in time.
Now some of the locations also to limit in terms of their actual capacity so we can only sell 80 people.
And so we knew the number and the thing is it would be slow in the beginning and then it speed up near the end because the scarce of the resource got the faster it sold.
So if you can handle 20 people a week in your business or you have X amount of product right now, you probably have some sort of cap and units to be sold or ability to provide service, tell people your limits and you'll increase their desire.
24:33
The reason Amazon still says 23 left in stock is because They know that more people will buy it if they see that there's limits.
So if I said, hey, I can send you a thousand, customers smart, you probably couldn't take them.
So, just be explicit about how many you have left and you'll actually sell more.

You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, the biggest mistakes that are made stem from these three evil.
He's Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
0:33
It's Alex Mosey, CEO of aled prestige Labs, Jim launch.
We don't 120 million dollars in sales last four years and I have nothing to sell you.
And so today, what I want to talk about is the three entrepreneurial evil he's or of Entrepreneurship.
0:49
All right?
So these are the three kind of ease that I that I see over and over again.
In from the entrepreneurs that we work with directly in our portfolio companies, but also in the a that I talked to in general, the biggest mistakes that are made stem from these three evil.
He's and so, what I'm going to do is I'm going to, I'm going to walk through all three of them.
1:05
I'll tell you an easy way to try and at least, attenuate the mistakes that you can make from them.
And then at the end, I'll show you the one that I think is actually the most evil of them all.
Alright, so the first e0 is expectations, all right, and the reason that this one is so easy.
1:23
Evil is that most of the time us entrepreneurs.
We think that everything has to happen immediately, right?
I had an entrepreneur not that long ago reach out to me and say hey how can you know if we work together how can you guarantee that I'm going to get to a million dollars a month within the next six months and they were currently I think doing a hundred thousand dollars a month and that kind of expectation and mindset is literally, what will destroy you in business?
1:51
Because what happens is, Is you set these arbitrary because all goals are arbitrary for the most part.
Write these numbers that in your mind, make you feel good or make you feel accomplished and you set these things up there with not a huge path of getting there and you put an arbitrary timeline on it.
2:08
And then you try and force yourself into it.
And so it ends up happening is you take shortcuts, you make, Hasty high risk decisions, and most of the time, you end up destroying the business and taking 10 steps backwards.
And so expectations that we set for ourselves and our teams, we want to be intolerant of anything other than Excellence, but focused for more on the process than the outcome.
2:33
So if you could shift the expectations from outcome-based, expectations to process-based, expectations, and then meet that with the intolerance of Excellence, right?
Or tolerating only at clinks, excuse me, then you can help mitigate expectation evils right where you basically destroy your business as a result of thinking, That you have to be at a million dollars a month, or a hundred thousand dollars a month or ten thousand dollars a month or whatever that number is for you.
2:59
By X time, write what I see again, and again, and again of the people who make way more money than I do, is they have reasonable expectations, that would be unreasonable to achieve based on process.
Right?
I have a mentor.
I know who always repeats the same thing.
3:15
He says, good process drives, good results and I just that's that's been something.
I've been trying to ingrain in my mind.
Good process drives, good results.
It's all right, so that's evil number one.
The second evil Is emotions.
All right, the second thing that will kill your business.
3:32
All right, if you look at the biggest, CEOs, in the world, you look at the Bezos as you look at, you know, you look at you look at Monger, you look at Buffett you look at all these guys, right?
And what you may notice is that they are very devoid of emotion and it's not that they're like, emotionless people.
It's more so that they try and stay as even-handed as possible with the decisions.
3:52
And this is just something that I've observed.
And so here's a Telltale sign that you can tell for yourself.
If your if your Suffering from this because sometimes it's hard, especially for guys for us to be like, I'm emotional right now, right?
But like, we're human, we have emotions.
And so if you're, if you're looking and you flip flop, a lot on decisions, as in your presented, the same data and one day, you feel this way and another way you feel another day, feel this way and literally how you process this Vision flip-flops all the time, it's because you're being subject to emotions.
4:19
Now, if you look at the trajectory of a business in the and the hundreds and thousands of decisions that we have to make as an entrepreneur, you could see how quickly these thousands of decisions can Been this way or this way, on this path, based on your emotions.
And it can be the right where the wrong way.
And so I'll give you here's, here's to two pieces of this.
4:38
It's, it's very difficult to eliminate emotions, right?
But if you can detect, when you aren't emotional, then you can decrease the speed of your decision making, which is usually contrary to what most people do.
When they are emotional, they speed up their decision-making process when they're in emotions, all right.
4:54
It's so if you feel urgency.
So for me, these are these are things that That are like red flags.
If I feel like I have to make a decision by today or whatever most times it's completely fictitious and made up in my mind.
And so what I try and do is extend the time arises between the, the feeling I have.
5:12
And when I actually decide to take action, I can't tell you the amount of huge mistakes that I was able to avoid simply by sleeping it off, right?
Giving my not myself, 24 hours to think on it, right?
And a lot of times the entire world looks different when you wake up in the morning and so that should frighten.
5:27
Because it frightens me how can the world looks so different only, you know, after nine hours of sleep, right?
It's because our emotional states different.
And so, this is a tactic that I do like a lot for managing emotions.
So the best decisions that we make for ourselves in my opinion or that I have made for myself, have come from a state of contentment.
5:51
And so there are probably been moment that's why.
When you go on vacation, you feel like you've a lot of clarity it's because you were in the correct.
Allstate to make the right decisions because you're not operating from place of scarcity, right?
You're not operating from a place of have to, you're not operating from a place of deficiency where I am not good enough, right?
6:07
When you're operating from a place of contentment, and I'm not saying we're always content.
That's not my point, right?
The point is that you could probably recognize those times where you sit back and you're feeling great, you know, you have a lot of gratitude for an experience or or things that give you perspective.
6:24
And so it's in those time periods where you should make Big decisions for your life and then know that you made them in the proper emotional state.
This is something that I'm actively focused a lot on for me, because in our business is now we have four of them.
6:43
They're being in the correct, making the right call is basically my only job now it's really just proper decision making Amos an Asian quick break.
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
6:59
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And so, when I sense myself in a well-rested Content, you know, full of gratitude mood, that is when I want to look at my most complex issues my most complex multi variable, you know, decisions and say, this is what I think the best course of action is and then sticking with that, even when the the trials and tribulations that are never going to happen as a result of the decision later, down the road.
7:36
And so, that's my, that's, my hack is, I can't get around emotion.
I Try and extend time Horizons whenever I feel the urgency and then if if I'm going to make emotions from an emotional state, I try and go from a place of contentment and gratitude.
7:52
And if I do not feel that state, I don't usually make the decision.
So think about that.
So if you have like moments, when you're playing with your kids and you look back and like man, life's awesome, that's when you make the decisions that you need to make about your life.
All right?
Because from there you'll be operating with a much longer time Horizon.
8:08
And that's I think my way I think this this is doing it that way.
We'll trick yourself into extending your time Horizon which ultimately will lead to better decision-making and the third e.e. of 30 evils evilly Hoops writing down evil is or are scuse me.
8:26
Me our expenses.
Alright, so the first two one, is what you think should happen, the emotions affect how you think it should happen.
And the expenses are the, the it's like the cloud in the dirt, right?
Are the things that that we incur along the way that increase the risk of it, not occurring, right?
8:42
So if you think about expenses in general, they are liabilities, they are risk that we take on.
And so if our goal is on top, is entrepreneurs is to increase our upside and decrease our downside, right?
That is kind of Entrepreneurship and business in general, right?
And actively thinking about decreasing our downside, our liabilities is a way of increasing the likelihood that our expectations are met, right?
9:05
And so, one of the biggest mistakes, and biggest evils that will destroy entrepreneurial businesses, is because they set massive expectations when they are emotional and emotionally deficient because they need to satisfy, you know, emotional needs that their parents didn't meet when they were kids.
9:20
They then incur expenses that they shouldn't otherwise have to meet these demands that are completely arbitrary made up in their minds, right?
And so I see this, what happened all the time?
It's like, hey, we want to scale.
We just hired for more people so that we can scale doesn't work that way.
9:38
Get the growth first and then, the growth will pay for the people.
Don't put the cart in front of the horse.
The only exception to this is if you have like commission only, you know, reps, like sales reps and things like that, but most other times, 99% of other times.
9:58
When you are incurring, greater expenses, it's not like it's should not be to quote anticipate growth, right?
Growth will pay the expenses and if you need to quote delay something for a smaller period of time so that you can Shore up your infrastructure.
10:17
Then you can do that and you would be amazed at how much flexibility there is, right?
It's much easier to solve problems with cash in the bank with, with contract signed And you're an entrepreneur, like solving problems is what we do, right?
And so, if you're in that state, think about how much eat.
10:34
Like, if you need to, if you have the immediate Demand, right, you will solve the problem and the people will come.
I promise you.
All right, one of the biggest mistakes that, I mean, I've made this one so many times.
I hired 25 support reps in anticipation of growth for our supplement company, Prestige Labs, two years ago and I currently now have for people that handle more business than the 25 did.
11:01
Think about that.
And so what happens is, when you anticipate growth, you don't even know what the growth is going to look like.
And so you basically just put people there, the culture of the team decreases, the morale of the team decreases there, being less efficient.
And when you have lots of people, you don't think about driving good process, right?
11:19
You just think like, we'll just throw more bodies at the problem, and that's a horrible way to go about business.
It's also not a good customer experience in the long run and so if we can adjust our expectations to be reasonable and based on process, Not outcome by managing our emotions and making decisions from a place of contentment, right?
11:37
So that we don't set these deficient expectations on ourselves in our business that we have to satisfy.
Because we must be a certain way by this time, then we won't incur expenses in risk.
That is undo an unnecessary that will that will likely destroy our business.
When it was 100% based on our false made up expectations about what we thought should happen.
11:58
Should.
And so when I look at the things that A ton do entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial businesses.
These are the three evil.
He's expectations, emotions and expenses.
And I told you at the beginning, that I would share the one that I think is the most deadly.
And it's this guy in my opinion.
12:17
Expectations.
Because what we believe because these are basically beliefs just said differently right another way to say this.
And this is, this is a really a really good way that I got from a different coach to reframe beliefs.
Is she said if you just call all your beliefs assumptions, they will be far more malleable and it's such a it's words matter, right?
12:42
And if we call our beliefs assumptions, they become far more changeable for ourselves.
And so if I say this is my Sumption.
What do you guys think rather than this is my expectation?
What do you guys think?
See how different that feels, but they function the same way, right?
12:57
But one of them is approachable, one of them is malleable one of them.
Can take me feedback in you inputs and you data.
And the other one is a must a should a have to write.
And so if we can readjust our expectations right and be focused on our product, over delivering the lighting the customers, right?
13:17
Being intolerant of anything.
Excellence in the process and because of that our emotion, stay more stable because we're not missing goals that we have to hit, right?
Which then create more scarcity, more deficiency more, more guttural feelings.
13:33
That then make us shorten, our decision making Loops, that cause poor decisions, and then, cause us to make poor decisions that create expenses.
All right?
So this is a loop that self reinforces and it can either be a virtuous or vicious cycle.
And so, it starts at the top and Spins all the way around.
13:49
And so those are the three evils of Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial mistakes that.
Hopefully, you can use some of these tactics to to avoid.
All right, don't don't hire before you need it.
Let the growth pay for the expenses when you're making decisions, try and extend the the space.
14:07
This is what I found effective for me and try and make decisions from a point of gratitude and contentment and then keep the expectations driven around process, not outcome.
And if you can keep the hike like, keep your high expectations but keep them on process.
14:23
Not own, what has to happen because when you reverse it the other way, you'll start making terrible decisions.
And if you can keep the hike like, keep your high expectations but keep them on process.
Not own, what has to happen because when you reverse it the other way, you'll start making terrible decisions.

Welcome back again to the iced coffee hour with graham Jack and Alex, where we will talk about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and all things.
0:32
Awesome.
I love that.
Thank you so much for making the time for us.
Oh, you bad, thanks for having me back again.
Well, education starts really early.
Yeah, how would you change that right now?
If let's say this, the current schooling system, which seems to teach you kind of had to stand in line how to think like everybody else get your homework done on time.
0:50
You gotta show up at it, you know, 8 a.m. at school ends at 3:00.
Think that's a good model, looking obviously everything.
Now, tell me your thoughts on that.
Um, I think so too, too broad, broad statements is, I think, the purpose of education is to teach people how to think rather than down to memorize and especially now, with technology that we have, if you can pass a test with having an iPhone with you, then, in my opinion, the test was poorly designed to, because it's not going to.
1:19
And then we have to rewind until like, what is the purpose of Education?
Right?
The education system overall, the product of This people who can add value to society, right?
That's that's the product of the education system, the raw units are humans, the output of the system is people who can add value to society.
Okay, cool.
So that's the if that's the system, then there's a lot of leeway there in terms of how we can get there.
1:39
I think the system that we have set up is inherited from the factory worker, you know, when it was being designed versus now, now I think we need a lot more problem solving skills than we did back then.
A lot more Divergent thinking processes and if you're not familiar this is a fun little exercise.
Sighs with school teachers right now is convergent thinking.
1:58
And so that means that there's multiple variables and one.
Correct answer.
And so it's like one plus one equals two.
There's only one correct answer.
And now they're even telling you, there's only one way to find the answer and if you don't find it the way they want you to find it, and it's also wrong which is ridiculous.
But anyways Divergent thinking is when you have multiple variables but multiple correct answers which is like how many different ways can you use a brick?
2:20
And what's interesting about that is that you can also have multiple right answers and some answers that are more right than Which becomes very difficult to grade but also how the real world works.
And we're rewarded based on how right?
Our YouTube video really is right or how, right our article is or how right?
Our product is and how we can solve problems.
2:37
Using more creative methods than trying to converge on a single answer.
Because if it's convergent thinking process, for the most part, it's already been kind of automated and everyone can do it right.
You get paid for what you can think of in the creative box of like what are other people not thinking of.
And so I think that more of the education system to be around diversity.
2:54
Urgent thinking and Divergent problem solving, you think that's ever going to happen?
No, mostly just because of the power dynamics that exist in like if you've ever saw the documentary Waiting for Superman and see who's one of the only movies that I've cried during because it was just the education system and it was just showing how there are so many impediments to it getting fixed.
3:14
It's not just one party.
Like you've got the teachers unions, you've got the funding for the schools.
You've got like there's all of these things that are almost all diametrically opposed to one another and then the only people really suffer the kids.
And then To me the country.
So anyways I do think the way that it'll have to get solved is that there is an alternative schooling system that gets develops that because of technology and of all Robert Kahn said this.
3:35
But technology democratizes consumption and consolidates production which means that if you're the best in the world you get to do it for everyone, right?
Which a lot of people don't like from a capitalist perspective, but that's all so silly, because I feel like there's just Pareto at work, but why would you not want the best math teacher teaching?
3:51
Everyone math?
Like, it makes sense now and because there's your The cost of duplication and now everyone's kind of understands his Zoom works and how like we can continue to using life virtually.
Like there's really no reason to have now it gets scary because teachers unions and what are all these people going to do for work and all that stuff.
4:07
But like just like the switchboards for when there used to be girls, who would switch for telephones, they're like well what you going to do when you know technology automates that like web 3 is just blowing up?
There would be jobs as we solve new problems will create new ones.
Yeah right and so to say like we have to keep something that doesn't make sense, doesn't provide value to the system For the sake of, it doesn't make sense to me.
4:26
And so, I think that it would probably have to be a new architecture where the best people teach, and then kids learn probably at their own pace, and the testing would probably have to change in order for it to be more real world.
And if we wanted it to be real world, then I think you need to match conditions which is real world.
4:45
You have your phone like now take the test.
Yeah.
Don't think that like the schooling system would need to be somewhat localized, though.
Like you can't have one person.
Teaching over too.
Big of a like a imagine one person controlling, everyone's mad.
Like, if you, if you have one math teacher, you know, that's teaching everyone in the country.
5:04
Don't you think that there's like an advantage to having?
Like, because each little parted each country has in, does he have to go to church?
Was in person?
It's more.
Like, it could be one system.
You'd be like it.
That's, that's more semantics.
You know what I mean?
And if the best person is more localized, by the way, they speak, whatever than sure.
5:23
But I mean, we're sitting next to Who's got a massive personal finance Channel.
And so if you're the best of personal finance, then more people will go to you.
So like that make sense?
Yeah, it does your schooling system does remind me.
I completely forgot about Jack, I don't think, you know, about this.
So in kindergarten, I had issues.
5:40
And in fact, my parents pulled me out of the school because after recess, they wanted all the kids to line up in order on this yellow line that led up to the front door.
And so All the kids are supposed to line up on that line.
5:56
The Bowers was ring and we all had to walk in one by one, and I didn't want to stand on that line and two teachers, got really upset at me because I didn't stand on the line.
Or, I wouldn't you want to say that?
I don't remember.
I think, at the point, I just didn't see.
I thought it was stupid or like, I just didn't get why I needed to stand on the line.
6:13
I didn't like standing on the line and my parents pulled me out, mid-year kindergarten to go to an alternative school.
And that's the school that didn't have any grades.
They had Assigned seating.
It was basically a big room and then discontinued by the way.
6:29
So this school went until 8th grade but no grades, it was either, you gotta check a check plaster or check - on any assignments that maybe and assignments were kind of like bs.
Anyway, they're like, you know, draw something or like, tell us to share something that you're excited about, but I loved it and that it's amazing though is that, but but that's what, that's what really helped me.
6:49
Because I hated like, I hated homework.
I hated test.
I didn't like any of it and I I just wanted to do my thing.
But even being in kindergarten, you were the same person as you are today.
Yeah, I did.
It's like you only do what you want to do when you want to do it.
7:05
And that's incredible that it's like traced all the way back in drink, Aragon.
Yeah.
But had riparian to because it like I would say that I was very different when I was younger because there was very much, like, if I wasn't on the other line, my daughter, like, why weren't you on the other line?
Like, you know, it's right.
7:20
And then that would be that that would be the end of that conversation and I would be on the other line the next morning.
And so, You know, it's great parenting to that.
They rest fairly you.
Do your thing, that is very true, but yeah, but I do think that really helps to have something that's, that's different, that's interesting to me, because, because you were an academic, right?
7:38
And if you could go back in time, do you think you would have spent so much time trying to do so well in school?
Yes, because I think if something's worth doing it's worth doing well, and that's more of like a personal belief was school worth doing.
Now, I think that it depends on what age because if you're learning to work hard and you're If you're like learning what hard work is, then I think that is a valuable lesson, the actual subject matter, you know, more or less irrelevant.
8:01
I think that once people understand math and reading then, that's, that's pretty much what you need to go and learn the world.
So that's, you know, if I were to, like make recommendations to college students, I would say be a math and English double major because that's everything you need for Life, much more.
8:17
So than the others, the right, even with math classes, shouldn't they be teaching you how to use the iPhone app unlike how to do Thin like, here's an iPhone.
We all get iPhones.
Let's add subtract here.
So you can do this using more complicated calculator.
I think that there's an element to it that had that should be there having a baseline of indulgence for math.
8:39
I think is useful.
I used to be really bad at math or at least I identified with being bad at math and it was until my mid-twenties where I decided I wasn't going to be bad at math anymore and so I actually stopped using a calculator which would make it seem like I'm contradicting myself.
8:54
Point and only did mental math for like a number of years and like calculated the tip, you know, on the bill with mental math, and I would try and, you know, do all the marketing metrics and all the sales metrics just in my head.
And then I would still use the calculator to check myself and then you get better and better and better at it.
9:10
And so I think there's like there's an essence of having like a semblance of like being directionally.
Correct.
So that you can make kind of large quick decisions, but in terms of like exact calculations, the calculator does make more sense.
Also just using Excel for most people's life is probably even Of the learning a calculator.
9:25
Like I bought a book in Excel when I was in college and I was like why are we not learning this?
Like every single job.
You need to learn how to use Excel green, it personal fight.
Like there's so many uses for it and I had to learn how to do all the.
It was just a book of the equations, like, you know, equals some.
And I was like, oh, that's how you do that.
9:41
Like, I had no idea.
And so I think those would be the more useful things.
But I mean a lot of people know that there's problems with the education system.
But, you know, they say, I hear I forget, I see, I remember I do and I understand that's Confucius and so I think if there were more Or like if I were to create a school around a skill, the school would be doing the scale.
9:59
So if I wanted to teach sales like they'd be selling, they wouldn't be learning sales Theory and so I think that there needs to be more application of the stuff to what people were going to use in the real world.
It's just so difficult to change curriculum.
So it has I think it's going to have to be an alternative path.
That's really flexible.
And they can't do the same thing.
10:14
The old old one did which is like this is now the way things are because then you'll get outdated to.
So there has to be a built-in kind of innovation wheel for not just adding but also subtracting what things are no longer useful.
Because I think that's what people have more fear of they just want to keep adding and adding and adding, but they don't also just like, say, this isn't really high utility.
10:32
What if we could start all over again?
We include this course right include this method.
Probably not.
So let's just let it go.
Yeah.
It's too bad.
That you couldn't create some sort of curriculum like that, though.
Like like a practical.
Just a two-year thing, you know, might be 10 grand, or something like that.
I don't want you would charge for that.
But for two years, practical life skills, selling Excel think Photoshop would be, would be on that social media.
10:54
You had to make a good Tik Tok how to keep retention, you know, how to stop.
This is just how to communicate, how to human, right?
And yeah, and we have to learn all these things on our own and there is the alternative education industry which you know you have a course.
11:14
And like you could depend on how you look at it.
Like a franchise is an education system, it's just packaged differently and so like there's lots of different ways of skinning, the education game but I think Turn it up.
Is the way that is going to like is the only way that I think it will it will emerge.
How would you reach out to somebody?
11:31
Because that's an interesting topic.
How do you get someone else's attention?
Let's say Jeff Bezos.
Elon, musk's like someone who's like, typically Out Of Reach for most people.
How would you go about teaching?
Somebody to have access to that person or even as get their attention would be hard.
11:48
I mean those are really extreme examples because those guys have everything, you know, and they probably have a lot of We're reaching out to them, so died.
I think the way to get there would be to have to go through like from the heart.
So it's just continue to network to to try and find out information that are that's not as public about the things that they like is anything that is publicly known that other people have already like God and him his favorite Jersey to his fate, you know, like those are, those are the obvious ones but it's the less obvious ones.
12:14
It just like you're trying to get noticed and they're like, huh.
And to be fair it would still be hard because I mean they are the richest men in the world like the amount of money they have is is hard to comprehend.
All right.
And so like there's no There's no monetary value, that can be delivered to them, right?
And there's really no status value that can be delivered them.
So it's like, how do I add value to someone's life?
12:31
And so, I think that if I were this is me just talking thinking a lot of our try to add value or get a gain access to somebody like that, it would have to be from the personal side.
Like those people have everything material, they could possibly want and so it has to be something immaterial like not in.
Yeah.
Intangible that I think would hit the radar.
12:48
Yeah, with Elon Musk I think it's privacy.
It reminds you that the Twitter the Twitter chat?
Yeah, whatever.
Who is the eye tracking is Jets.
Got his attention, got into DM, but now he's tracking the with the yacht's.
Yeah, well, I thought he was doing the Russia knocking that.
13:04
Yeah, yeah, I do.
I do.
Okay.
I try not to pay attention to news.
All right.
Yeah, I know.
This is a kid.
How old was he and sixties?
He always liked in high school.
He had 16 years old and he got Elon musk's attention because he was tracking his private jet.
Yeah.
And he would post the coordinates on Twitter like his jet went from This location to this location and then people could speculate from there.
13:27
What, why is he going to this part in Texas?
A lot is there may be something there that they're building.
Yeah.
So then Elon Musk DM, DM and basically just said like hey would you mind taking us down?
Like you know privacy is important to me.
Yeah.
And then the kids said no and Elon Musk offered him five thousand dollars and then the Kidd, countered back, fifty thousand dollars.
13:47
And then Elon Musk said, you know what?
Like, I'd rather, you know, I'd rather not pay for something like this or other words don't like that or he just Didn't respond which at that point sets up the narrative that people could just track him and he'll pay them off, which I think is probably yeah better to not engage with that.
It's blackmail.
14:03
It's emotional blackmail, exactly.
So, but now that that same kid is tracking Russian Yachts weird.
Yeah.
But he's getting a lot, but he's getting a lot of attention for it.
Well, I think he's important to mention that he's not just tracking them and posting tweets.
14:18
I mean, he's developing software to do this automatically at 16 years old.
So, A bright kid.
Yeah.
So he's getting a lot of attention from that.
I see them every few days now on the, the headline of like, CNBC CNN, you know, what's the general idea of them to people like them or not at with the Elon Musk.
14:37
It was 50/50 some people were really for it.
And some people were really against it and they thought it was creepy and invasion of privacy but look up to tracking Russian Yachts.
It seems like everyone is on, not everyone, but a lot of people are on his side on that one.
So for any think, I think that he's doing a service.
14:54
Yeah.
Yeah huh so you mentioned like during that that you don't pay attention to news at all.
Know why not I can't control anything so like there's no to me there's no added value.
Like I don't my life has not improved as a result of news at all.
15:11
It does get worse though.
And so for me like eliminating news is just eliminating a - it's like do I want to have cortisol today?
Sure, let me check the news.
Like you know, how could go for more stress?
Do you want some stress?
Let's go check the news because like I think I can't remember where this But it was the job of the news is to make everyone's problem your problem.
15:28
A journalist made this thing of like what makes something newsworthy and so is basically ways that they try and manipulate news in order to make it more interesting.
So it's like how do we make something odd or unusual or bizarre?
How do we make something more local to people?
How do we make it more recent?
You know, like recency is a component of newsworthiness and there was four other ones I can't remember, but it was just like there's a formula for what creates news and I don't want to be the product for news.
15:54
Because a lot of you don't know, is like new stations are private.
So like they're just like HBO, like think like they're just like, HBO, they have programming and people show up for their shows and they have commercials, which is how they make money.
And so, like their intention is to keep attention, not to, you know.
16:13
Yeah.
Disseminate truth.
Right?
That's not the goal.
Because the thing is, is like the really true stuff is not interesting and does, and will fail compared to a sensationalize news, like it's just dollars dollars and cents.
So they have Make it and that's just the nature of the business.
And I understand that I'm not pooh-poohing it but I don't necessarily need to subscribe to it.
16:30
You know, I mean like people want to give their attention to it so then there will be so many who will sell those eyeballs to advertisers but their intention is not to educate me.
Their intention is to make the world's problems my problem and I have enough problems and so I don't need to add more that are irrelevant to me to my list.
16:47
Yeah, so on the scale of understanding what's going on in the world.
Would you say you're closer to like a 1 out of 10?
Like no.
Nothing will be equal to 0.
Okay, probably a to.
What would you say?
You are G.
Oh gosh, probably an eight and a half to a nine.
Wow, I'm probably for your for, yeah, I'm super out of touch as well.
17:06
Yeah, really.
Yeah, see I spend all day reading the news and I see everything at what stock market or economy related news.
So I see everything that goes on.
But also worldwide events, have a big impact on that.
So I have to understand those events to be able to summarize that information if I need to.
17:23
So yeah.
News is something for four years.
Now, I've read everything.
I'd like to be able to read that so you could sell the eyeballs because you, that's exactly what he is right here.
Yeah, I got it is relevant, you know, recent stuff like that.
17:39
I'm continuing to move in this direction of like an anti information diet, but like when I work now I realized that I can just if I just remove my phone altogether from the room, my level of focus, just just goes if it feels like I'm on drugs because in It's crazy though is that especially if you have.
17:56
So now I just take my phone when I leave, but like when I'm at home, it's not with me.
Because anything that's work-related I have slack.
And unfortunately I feel like the vast majority of like the text messages that I get are usually requests there.
Things that people want from me, I want me to meet, want me to talk, want me to whatever.
18:14
And so, it ends, I end up just getting stressed from seeing all the messages.
So, I made up, just changing my number again.
But like, which I do every so often but just putting it away when I go to sit down at my computer.
I still feel like that go Stitch of like I want to reach for my phone.
I like there was a oh there's a pause Point here for like a split second.
18:31
Let me grab my phone just for that dopamine.
Yeah and so like I try to not do that and media sources social media and news in general, I don't consume any formal news.
The only news I get is as I'm posting stuff on social media so that I can get it out.
18:47
But I'm currently trying to figure out like a desktop version of that so I can just plan it.
So I don't have to consume.
It's just really hard.
Hard, you know?
I mean, yeah, these for me and like I notice if I start my day, consuming some social media.
Like my, I'm just not as sharp.
You know what I mean?
19:02
I feel like I'm a little bit foggier.
It's like you get overstimulated and then everything else seems less interesting, you know, by contrast.
So just eliminating it overall has been very very helpful for when you start doing that.
When my new executive assistant came in and I was telling my last night.
Yeah.
19:17
So this is crazy Jack.
Okay, so Alex is telling me if you want to coordinate to go to dinner, Edith, Texas number.
And I like, All right, so it takes the number and she's like this time.
This date does that work with you?
It's like, yeah, that works.
And she's like, all right, you're gonna go to this place at this time, I was like, okay.
19:35
And I asked Alice.
I said, hey, dude, did you know where you're going?
He's like.
Now, she just tells me where to show up.
It's great.
Like, how did you pick this place?
She knows my preferences.
Yeah, yes.
It's right.
Know where he's showing up.
What do you know who your who you're meeting most of the time?
19:52
Yeah.
She'll give you feel like we're so.
So, do you want to go to dinner with?
Graham and you're like no or yeah.
Mmm.
And then she's like, all right, I'll pick out of time.
So I was yeah, crazy.
Is that?
That's a seven know where he's going.
Like, I would want to know like this place or this place or what are the preference is.
Now it's just chop.
20:07
Those are all these micro decisions that you have to make that are like big picture irrelevant.
You don't mean like, what rest are we going to go to?
Wow.
What time were you like?
She knows that on weeknights, I want to be done by X type so that I can get the sleep that I want.
And so she just plant because like, if you think about all the micro decisions, you have anything about them ahead of time, you already have it.
20:24
You making process.
You just haven't like spoken it out loud.
Like for Layla knife.
We're going on commercial flights.
Here's a hack.
If you go to aisle seats that are on either side, you both get Aisle seats.
You get to be next to each other.
But you, rather than having that one person who gets the middle seat that has to, like trade-off to aisle seats works.
Great.
Right?
20:40
And so, she knows that that's our preference.
And so she will always go and try and find to aisle seats that are close to each other.
And if those aren't available, what's The Back-up, what's the decision making process.
So it's like you outline all of those things but you do it for everything.
So it's like if we're an event, what type of, you know, food are you going to request them always going to?
Probably at the chicken dish.
20:55
I want them to double the chicken, and I'd probably want some extra carbs in the side.
Cool.
So she knows that.
So when I go to events, there's like huge lunch and like, great.
I don't have to ask for it to your Dino's, the preferences are.
And so, and it took me a really long time to understand this because I have, I have gone through.
It's actually something that was like, really insecure about.
I've gone through eight executive assistants.
21:13
Wow.
Yeah, why?
I mean there's two to tango right partially me, partially them just being real, but I think that a lot of, I mean, fundamentally it's my fault because I didn't know What I was looking for, right?
And so if you don't know what you're looking for, it's very hard to find it.
21:28
And so that's why this time, it's been so great for me because she came in and she was a, you know, 20-year veteran executive assistant.
She's like this, how this is going to go.
I was like, yes, this is what I like I knew within a day I was like, this is going to work and every other one was like, maybe it'll get better, you know, like maybe they'll come around like I was like rooting for him but like, it wasn't, you know, great.
21:50
But this one day one, I knew.
And so, the difference is true executive, It is almost like a Time coach almost like a partner with you where you're both working to optimize you, right?
So it's not like Administrative Assistant, which is different, which is just like I will I will handle your scheduling and you know answer the phone and respond to emails and things like that but like a true executive assistant is somebody who's almost like a partner at the executive level, who understands business at a very high level, can make business decisions on your behalf, knows you're like personal preferences, things like that.
22:20
But for me, it's very much like a Time coach.
So when I wake up, Every minute of my day is planned.
And if I, let's say I finish a task that's supposed to take me, you know, 40 minutes and it takes me 20 to be like 90.
I've got 18 minutes what I do and she's like, I'll pull this from tomorrow and I'll slide this in and I'll see if I can move this to that.
22:39
And so that and like I had a handful preferences.
I was like no white space.
So for me on my count, I don't want any white space because I just wanted like from time I start the time I ended just wanted to be going.
And so by doing it that way though, it's just like I am just working on whatever is in front of me and she slides Things in.
22:55
And I just I'm just in communication with her of like and hey this person wants to do something.
I just sent it to her and then she goes and talks and says, okay do you know and I get a lot of podcasts Crest things like that.
And so, you know, rather than me having the awkward like, hey, like I get 10 of these day.
23:10
Like can you just give us some stats and what's your audience and things like that?
It's like that entire process.
She can just handle and I don't have to go like, look at their profile.
See what like she knows what my decision-making criteria is, for all of those things and what say yes I want to know and so it just allows me me to Outsource more and more and more of the decisions that are lower value.
23:29
Add to portfolio company growth, so that I can just purely focus on the things that have the highest leverage.
Has she ever scheduled something that you disagreed with?
Like let's say, let's say, this podcast is an example where she would schedule you on some like that.
You're like, you know, I don't want to do that though.
23:47
She probably will she hasn't yet?
But I mean, if she did, I would say, like here, like we have to update some decision criteria like in this instance this is why wouldn't and then I mean I wouldn't be upset because if I would only be not upset, but I would only be may be disappointed or whatever or frustrated or annoyed.
24:04
If the decision criteria that we had laid out with somehow not followed but if someone if I had it I have to.
If I have to add to it then that's just like an opportunity to make the thing better.
So like that's why I don't be upset about something like got it.
How did you find her?
Um an agency.
24:20
We've actually known each other for a long time.
Yeah we'd known each other for a long time.
She was an executive assistant of a really good friend of mine for eight years and then as their company grew and like you know, organization shifted around, made more sense for her to pursue a different opportunity and whatnot.
And so, we'd known each other already.
24:35
And so like I was always like, I need I need the her for me and then it just so happened in adopting her here.
Yes.
If you could say about, How much you gonna do to me?
That's what I was thinking.
Yeah that's the world.
Yeah, it's less than I'm we should take a guess.
24:53
I'm going to say probably a hundred and you don't have to say exactly but yeah, I'll say 70 now I'm I5.
Say 120.
Yeah.
You need to pay someone will ya like what somebody who has business Acumen, right?
And who can say hey I want you to you know, I want to I want to make some T-shirts for us and like, can you make some backpacks?
25:11
And by the way, can you figure out why the book is not on Amazon Prime?
Like why is it?
Not, why don't I have the little Prime think you just figured that out you want someone who can like go and just take that directive and just solve it.
Like, sometimes that's harder to find.
And for me, I also want to pay for experience.
25:27
So even if there's two people that were who might have equal ability, I will usually pay more for the experience because I don't want to have to have this person who's less experienced.
Learn those lessons on my clock.
I'd rather come with the solutions pre-loaded.
That's why I'm willing to pay more.
25:42
The fly business are do you fly before?
Private, mostly, it's been real economy.
Either black or Uber like the fancy ones.
Uber, Uber, do you mean like we got yours.
You have two people with outside my house.
26:03
The carry me everywhere.
Let's Throne.
Yeah.
And it's one of those like it's almost embarrassed to say it but it's like it's there's a handful of things that are really expensive.
And I feel like they are worth it and I try and spend the money that we have because it's the only way that money has utility for me rather than just making more money, which then like, for what point.
26:24
So if I have the opportunity to consume benefit for money, I try and use it.
And so, the speed and convenience that I get from private versus commercial is pretty significant and like short flights are like five grand.
So it's not like, you know, I mean if you're going with somebody else it's not a huge deal, you know, the longer flights.
26:41
If you're going cross-country, it's like a fifty thousand dollar flight, but, you know, it just depends on You're what you're looking for.
So it's a shorter flights.
We tend to fly private longer flights.
I'm also like more weary of small planes.
So I also will just, you know, fly first class on on the commercial.
Most Nation real quick.
26:59
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
27:19
Let's talk a little bit more about time management because it seems like you can get a lot of stuff done in a very small frame of time.
So like let's let's walk us through your day.
You mentioned in the last podcast.
You wake up, extremely early.
Yeah.
And just for the audience like it's not because I have like some like superhuman to someone.
27:35
I just think, I think I just fall I get tired early so like if you fall asleep at 9 or 10 like you wake up at 4 or 5 like it's not, it's not like a superhero thing, you know.
It's been seven hours like I can wake up now.
I'll tell you a couple things.
So number one is I don't have a wake-up alarm, I have go to bed alarm which is like, hey, you should be one, you know, by now I don't even really need to do it anymore because I've just been doing it for such a long time.
27:59
But when I started it, I wanted to set myself, a go to bed alarm.
So, go to bed around the same time.
I usually know what I'm going to do the next day before I go to bed.
That's kind of how I clear my mental plate.
And I do think and it sounds kind of weird and whoa but like I think that overnight my subconscious works on some of the problems because I feel like I always wake up with like really Eating Solutions in the morning to some of the problems I went to bed with and so it just gives me like great momentum to start my day.
28:23
But when we, when we wake up, my wife, when I wake up about the same time, we usually have coffee in the morning together, if that's kind of like our 30 minutes to just like hang out.
Chill.
Watch the sunrise.
It's usually between four and five.
Wow so we hang out then watch the sun in that time right you know time Rising the sun is coming up if it's not then we don't watch it but if we can we do and then from there I go to my office and I start working.
28:49
And she does her own thing and then we meet again for lunch, and then I go back to work and then that's my day and you can cut it off at a specific flourish for, it's not a specific hour.
It's like, you know, if I've got if I've got a call, you know, usually, my calls end around four-ish.
29:09
Do you work really hard at 42?
Basically switch off, like from work mode into like personal mode, where it's like a light switch or still open.
Like if something comes up with work-wise you're going to Handle it.
I'm gonna try to say this the right way.
I don't get the same level of stress that I used to from work.
29:25
And I feel like I've worked.
I've worked a lot on that side of like not being stressed by work.
And I think a big part of that was realizing like last year that I don't have to work like at all at all.
And so kind of confronting that and then realizing that I'm choosing to do this, kind of relieved, me of the, the stress that was surrounding them.
29:44
Like, if you don't like this, like basically, like stop complaining to yourself like you do.
Using to do this and you have no reason, like, if there's no point in you doing this.
And so not having the stress around, it has decreased any kind of negative stuff associated with it.
And so, you know, I'll stop taking calls it for.
30:00
But if someone's Laxmi, I was like, but I usually don't, I would say I delineate that from like I'm not going to sit down at the computer but I don't have like hard and fast rules.
If there's something that I want to do, I'll do it.
Yeah.
But how do you mentally switch off from work mode?
At that hour?
Because for me I find it very difficult if I'm focusing.
30:16
I can't take a lunch.
Jose.
I, even when I went wake up, I can't do just like a 30 minutes, just kind of do nothing.
I have to immediately.
Start wants to start.
I continued that all day, if I have a break at throws me off, but even when I stop sometimes I can't that's which is still on.
30:33
So I'm always in my head just like think you like getting your like don't talk to me too much, I really want to give.
Yeah and sometimes it's like you know it's I won't even have my phone, I'll just be thinking I'll just ride just like that quiet space, totally.
So I split my day so I should probably give more detail.
So I split my day between high-level Work, which is like me doing stuff and then me communicating with companies, which is usually the afternoon.
30:55
So until you know, noon.
So basically, you know, 45 until noon is when I get all of my work done.
So that's what I with own a build presentations, or if I'm a Content or if I want to write the book or, you know, the things that I do, that are like one of the companies wants to whatever.
It doesn't matter, I'll write down.
31:11
My thoughts are review stuff in the morning and then the afternoon is when I do, like, my communication with people, because for me, like, some people function really well late at night, I do, Don't I'm much better, like, super early in the morning and that's where I get my highest leverage on my time.
And so in the afternoons, when I don't need that Creative Juice, I can still be super effective on meetings.
31:29
I just, I'm not thinking like how do I say this framework differently?
Like, which is a kind of abstract concept and more difficult?
So I understand we're saying but my cut off my cut off her.
Like when I stop quote working, is it?
Noon is actually when I have lunch is usually what I'm done with my what I would consider deep work for the day and that's probably just because a difference in the nature of the Work.
31:49
Okay.
And then after four five PM, once you shut everything off, work wise or try to like how do you spend your time?
Do you just like relax with am a Seer?
So we actually do go.
Yeah, we do go out to dinner a lot.
A lot, a lot every night actually, everyone.
Yeah.
32:05
Guy at Mastro's.
Look, welcome back.
We see you all the time.
Like joking around.
Yeah.
Wow.
What's your favorite rest?
What are your favorite restaurants?
And what's your food budget?
Like, I mean, maybe you have no idea so we, I mean it's aggressive.
It's a lot.
What word very often just like realistically, we probably spend between twelve and fifteen thousand a month on going out to eat.
32:35
Would you say that there's like a return on that because you can relax so much that you can like cycle that back into like somewhat embarrassed by this but it's so was I think we talked about this last time is that like again?
Like if you could pay a dollar to go out, would you go out right?
32:51
So yeah, I would pay a dollar to go to Masters every night rather than staying in.
And so for us because we work all day at home like going out to get dinner is like the only real time I leave besides going to the gym and so like that's kind of why I like going out to eat has serves multiple purposes.
Not just the food.
33:07
It's much more.
So like we sit down, we get to connect we you know, we're served which is nice, it doesn't have to be five star, I would say like two thirds of the time.
It's five star restaurants and I think a big portion of that is because cuz of the convenience of where I live.
So currently, I'm running a place that's literally on the strip.
33:22
And so like, I have forty five star restaurants like connected to the building.
So, it's just, it's like, if there were Chipotle downstairs, I'd probably more polite, but it just so happens that it's Mastro's is the closest restaurant to me.
So I go there a lot.
So, like massive difference in price but relative price, not so much pretty much since we got to Vegas.
33:39
We've gone out to dinner.
Not pretty much, we've gone out every single night.
We've never cooked once.
So in terms of best places, I think Delilah's really good.
I think they have the best dessert in Vegas.
Everyone's curious.
Delilah's exceptional means are so many of them are really good because they're just, they're all the best places in Vegas in Vegas, is some of the best dining in the world's.
33:56
Like, it's just, it's crazy, but I will tell you this the marginal utility of five-star dining decreases very quickly, like, at the st.
Like you open the menu and it's the same stuff, it's like, you've got a Carpaccio, you've got, you know, steak tartare, you've got a tuna tartare, you've got, you know, some shrimp cocktail of some sort.
34:13
There's some fancier, bread selection that you can opt for $5.
Then you've got a couple salads and Then, you know, they've got they're really expensive, steaks, their medium expensive steaks, and then they've got the seafood selection.
If each lane sea bass, like, it's, they're all the same, but you don't look at prices at all.
No, no.
34:28
But and you seem like you'd be a big Tipper.
You're a big Tipper.
Yeah.
Because it's interesting after a podcast last time, unfortunately, we talked about this off camera, but you mentioned that you want to get rid of all of your money.
Like when you die, you're not going to pass it on to your kids or anything.
34:44
So, there's a pledge or something for that.
Well, I mean, there's the giving pledge Um you know, we already donated artists like our states have already been set up to be giving away.
I haven't signed any pledges for it but yeah and it's I mean well guess I guess we're going to get into it.
35:00
So so so I'll tell you a really interesting example that I'll drive this home.
This is like this was recent so my great-great grandfather.
He was a ruler in Iran prior to the Shah and so we were like I'm directly descended from him.
35:20
Now that sounds fancy.
It doesn't mean anything, which is going to prove my point.
He had 400 children from those. 400 children was my great-grandfather, he was one of 19, then there was my grandfather, then there's my dad, and then there's me, right?
And so he was a ruler of a country.
35:37
So you talked about like, wealth and status and everything, right.
I actually can't even remember his name.
And so that's just five generations.
And so the idea that we have of, like, I want to like, create a legacy.
It's like, You're not making a legacy, he was ruler of a country.
I can even members anyone related to him, right?
35:55
And so if you do that enough times it just becomes humans, right?
Like they're the difference and that becomes a very humanitarian perspective to.
Because if you if you mix Bloodlines enough times it's just people, right?
And you you take your jeans split up, split them, split them slow to me, you do it 10 times, you know half to the 10th.
36:12
Power is very very small number right?
In terms of what percentage of it is still you if you still have like pride in your biology, he being passed on which also gets into like having children versus not having children because then that's a whole nother like interesting can of worms.
But as a result of that kind of thought process the point of leaving a legacy in like, capital L Legacy of, like, this is going to last past, me doesn't really make sense.
36:36
Because the people who I'm leaving, you two will never know who I am, and it will get divided so many times as well, between all of those people would have to be such an insane amount of money which then would become a marginal amount of money once it's divided enough times.
So for both of those reasons wouldn't work but then on the on the close-knit basis of like well I want to pass it on to my direct descendants.
36:56
I just don't know many people who have been given lots of money who are better for it.
And so for that reason, it doesn't seem very beneficial to anything to give it to anyone besides just giving it back to everybody else.
And it's also kind of nice because it kind of relieves you of this pressure because then it's just realizing it for what it is which is this just a game, right?
37:15
Like what we're playing right now is just a made-up game to keep us occupied.
A pied.
And so these are just the, I mean, I gave the the casino analogy at the end of the last podcast.
But that is how I see it.
It's like, we're just accumulating chips, they're fake and I can't take them with me.
So, I'm just pushing back to the middle table, which is what they're going to be done.
37:32
Anyways, it's just whether you say, like they're only going to these players rather than all the players, but like Fast Forward, three more Generations.
It is all the players and you don't know the people anyways, yeah.
So like what does really matter do you want kids?
You mentioned, you mentioned, You know, the time commitment of a dog.
37:51
Yeah yeah.
Like well, you know, it's too much.
I can't imagine it a child.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think I would probably have different feelings about a child than it.
Would have been a dog and just so the audience can dislike me.
So this is my gift for everybody.
We had a dog and it just, it just went to the bathroom like 8 or 10 times a day and it was too much because like, it's like was too much horse that couldn't.
38:13
I could have somebody who care for the dog.
Oh yeah, I actually really like animals and actually and Was really like me.
It's kind of weird.
Daily goes crazy when you get in the house but like it's like Leila's like you have calming energy or whatever in and I mean, I don't know.
But like animals, do like me and I like them back like, we're cool.
38:30
Like, we get it, we get along.
Maybe it's because they know that I'm like, I don't, I don't need them.
You know, like we just your shows.
I'm an animal.
We're both just like doing our own thing, like, I don't need to take care of you.
Try yourself.
I love the cat.
38:45
I had, we had a cat that died after two years, but cats were way easier.
So dogs versus cats, like I like the cat goldfish would work, you know, whatever.
But anyways, back to the kid thing, it's something I'd give a ton of I've given a ton of thought to the pros, for me of having a child, are The Human Experience, which is just like, this is a part of the human experience that is unique.
39:06
And I think that would be interesting to go through that being said, going to prison is also part of the human experience.
It doesn't necessarily mean that I should do it.
Sometimes people are like, I think you and Layla would make great parents and And I'll say this, and I say this not as a pejorative statement to Parenting in general, but I'm using an extreme example to illustrate a point, which is like I could be in.
39:27
This is not disrespectful to people who may have this job, man, culture these days.
I could also probably really good gas station attendant, right.
I probably really exceptional that, it doesn't mean that I should.
And so just because I might be an exceptional Paradis mean, I should, and, like, in the cons column, there's a tremendous amount of risk personally that the person doesn't want to do what I want them to.
39:49
Right.
And so the fact that I still have this desire that I'm projecting on an unborn child is something that I'm not very comfortable with because like, if I had won, I would have a hard time saying that, I want them to be their own person.
I'd want them to be who I want them to be.
And so maybe that is the learning of becoming a parent is that you unlearn the, the expectations of projection that you have on the child.
40:06
But in terms of like my personal like fulfillment component, I mean, I'm very obviously, I'm very torn about it but there's so many guys that I've that I've like mentored that have taken steps toward me.
Like, please help me with business.
Please help me.
Me in these ways and I'm happy to and, you know, if I had to trade off I think we're talking about dinners last night but like the amount of time that a child takes.
40:28
Right.
Let's say it's I don't know four hours a day roughly but terms like head space and time.
Spent with Laura.
Now I was trying, I was actually trying to be really aggressive with for I'm being honest.
I was because I was genuinely being like really aggressive for.
I would imagine a child he likes while I'm here.
40:46
I'm gonna pay however that's like there's gonna be huh.
Bourdain.
It's like helping to hide what he meant.
Let's see, let's see.
Okay, so eight hours a day so full time job, right?
For the next 20 years, if I had a full-time job in the next 20 years, I could help 100,000 or a million people more than I could just to that.
41:06
Just so happened to share my genetics that eventually will get diluted out to nothing.
Is that how you base your decisions?
I mean off how many people you can get enough based on?
Yeah really.
Yeah I mean that's what we're like.
A lot of people want to have kids to give meaning to their lives, right?
41:22
And as a corollary, to this, whenever I see a lot of people doing something, I don't think, oh, that's a great idea.
I think, oh, that's a great path to mediocrity.
And again, that's going to talk most people because most people do it.
So this again, it doesn't have to just apply to Children.
You can think about it for everything which is like if you're trying to not be in the majority because you don't want to be average then it means that you have to by definition, not to whatever else is doing.
41:47
And so when people are like, I'm taking this action to have children.
I would assume that it's probably selfish because you can always count on people to be selfish.
It's not like humans only in this one instance or selfless right there.
Sawfish because they want to look at it be like it looks just like me.
That's why I love it.
42:03
You're just like me, right?
I love you.
I love you right?
Like and like I'm aware of that right?
And so that's why I'm like I try an audit.
Do I want to have kids just because I want to look at a version of myself, you know what I mean?
But then I'm also going to project on this kid's life when he might want to be a ballet dancer, whatever.
Know there's anything.
42:18
The wrong with thing about answer but if I'm gonna spend 8 hours it's just like I don't feel like I'm providing a lot of value, you know what I mean and like in terms of but it sounds like you're thinking of it from an Roi perspective, don't wanna invest all this and I might not get a good Roi compared to the guaranteed Roi could get eight hours of ever hear of helping other people.
42:35
Yeah.
And it's really Roi of like the world.
Yeah, more.
So than made particularly there was a brief moment where I am.
I like had an injury where I thought I was gonna be able to have kids.
My not turned black and I was like oh it's fine but I was like Very worried.
And so it was really interesting.
Is that during that period of time before I got it looked at I just was like, I'm not gonna be able to have kids like, that's it, right?
42:56
I'm screwed.
And who's weird, is that?
I ended up becoming almost I became so humanitarian in general, like, during that, like, it was like the desire to Pro generate went, from being specific to a child, to General to everyone.
Because like when you realize you can't have a child, then you want to still pass it on and I think this just like a human desire, right?
43:17
Of benefiting the Tribe whatever.
But like you still had this desire and rather than being able to get my filament out of out of one child doing that.
For me, it's like I was forced to just be like, well, I have to just give to everybody and so I think that was that was actually a really transformative experience for me and I think it's part of what has shaped a lot of like the thoughts around giving today in general, I'm a little confused and curious, not saying this is wrong or anything.
43:43
And in fact, I admire this but why is like the thing that you hold to the most weight when you're making decisions?
Visions.
How many people you can help that could be selfish in and of itself?
Probably widely really.
Wow, do you think being selfish is bad?
I like to believe that most people generally want things that are good for everyone.
44:02
So if they Pander to what they want themselves, they're generally helping other people that agree with that.
But do you think being selfish is bad?
Sometimes I think, I think if it hurts somebody else and yes, I think if it being selfish is at the detriment of somebody else, or if the net is bad for more people, that hurts more people than it serves, you you also have to Define You know, her I know and you can't completely.
44:34
It's not about being selfish, it's just hurting.
People is bad.
Yes, which is the thing which is irrelevant from this office action packed, right?
Then sure.
I think everyone, you know, many people would and that's bad in the little be sense rather than the big be sense.
It's like the universe.
So anyways, all that you say, I think people act in their own self-interest and that is and comma.
44:54
That's fine.
And we can expect them to do that and I act in my own self.
Interest as well and you're just naturally interested in helping people.
I think I'd get some level of like fulfillment from it.
I do.
I mean that's why I like the books 99 Cents.
The courses are free like you know and I plan on writing a bunch more books.
45:13
It's selfish like I think I think I feel good but I do it so I do more of it.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, 26 to 29 is the Of chunking up.
So the reason your lifetime wages, increase the most in the season is because you finally have a lay of the land.
You have perspective from which to make a judgment on what next moves to make.
You see where everything is.
Welcome to the game, where we talked about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:46
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished pesos musk, and Buffett a documented, their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy. 30 is the new 20 is complete BS.
Your twenties are the most important decade of your life and I'm going to prove it to you.
1:01
I mean, think about it, if you're growing a tree, the moment, a trunk branches off.
It's really hard to reach around the other side of the tree, right?
Like if the bridge is over here, it's very hard.
Takes a lot of effort to go to the other side and so the early decisions you make in your life.
Make a bigger impact Downstream and I know it's popular to tell people that everybody has time.
1:18
But here are the facts.
Fifty percent of adults are with a person.
They're going to marry in their 20s.
The median child is born in your 20s.
Your brain finishes its last major growth spurt in your 20s, your personality solidifies in your 20s and the Big Kahuna 2/3 of your lifetime wage growth happens in your 20s.
1:36
So I'd say 20 is 20 and it's important in my 20s, I accumulate over 20 million dollars of earnings after taxes and set myself up for a hundred million dollar net worth by age 32 and this is the definitive guide to crushing your 20s.
And I'm going to break this down into Seasons with the biggest dues and the biggest dogs.
1:52
So let's go high school to 20.
These are the years of Don't late teens are more about not messing up so bad that it costs you years to recover later.
It's like that branch.
That you have to go all the way around.
It's way better just make the first right decision, because you're at least already directionally going the right way then it is about making it all the way to the top.
2:10
It's the tree by the time you're 20.
All right, so like Charlie Munger says figure out what you don't want in life and then avoid it like the plague.
In fact you have a 97% chance of avoiding poverty.
So just already being on the right side of the tree if you do three things and so research has confirmed this a zillion times they call it the success.
2:25
What's number one, finish High School.
Number to give full time.
Work number three, don't have a kid until you're married or as I would just like don't have an unplanned child.
Now, I'm not saying you should or shouldn't do whatever you want, but if you're in the camp that wants to avoid poverty, then that's step one.
Take the highest percentage moves.
2:41
And if, for some reason you haven't one of those three, that's fine.
You just got to play the cards.
You're dealt after.
All Glenn Stearns, who's a billionaire, had a kid out of wedlock at 14 and dropped out of high school.
But let's look at the types of mood, he maids to undo his Bad Teens.
In his 20s, separate has the next season, 22, 23.
2:59
This is the foundational season.
Now, whether that's a job or a side hustle, or the main hustle, you're going to build your foundations.
All right?
And the interesting thing is the stuff you do in your early 20s, like the tree branch sets you off in a Direction, all right?
And changing course, brings you back to square 0.
Now the way to guarantee that you never move back to zero, right?
3:17
Is to do jobs that give you General skills.
So if you do sales at one company, you learn, a few things industry, knowledge sales working with the team Etc, Now the industry knowledge won't transfer if you start something else, but everything else will.
So my recommendation is not to try to make it in this season but to learn as much as you can, this is where you work for free and below your earning capacity in order to get a higher learning opportunity.
3:42
Because listen, you're compensated in two ways learning and earning.
And in your early years, you want to be compensated with as much learning as humanly possible because it'll set you up for for more learning later.
So what you don't want is to learn one skill and we try and make as much as you can off of it because you just short.
3:58
Change your long-term, learning you cap yourself, right?
It's like snipping off the branch of the tree, all right, and then that's it, there's no more growth.
So the more adjacent skills you can rope together over time the more money you make.
In other words, the broader, the foundation, the bigger the peak, and so, maybe a little example.
So, if you're like good at math, and okay, you get math skills, all right.
4:17
Well, then maybe you're like, I learned some bookkeeping.
So you go to an accounting firm, or you go to a company and you work in their financial department, as a bookkeeper.
It's a basic skill.
Great.
So now you Math to bookkeeping that's a little more valuable.
Then you study it.
You get your CPA, all right?
Now you're now you're an accountant, fantastic more valuable.
4:32
And then you start learning about taxes.
Wow.
Now you're an accountant who really understands taxes significantly more valuable.
And then you also understand Insurance structures and Truss structures, even more valuable.
And then, you start learning merges and Acquisitions, even more valuable.
And so, each of these things, these one plus one, plus one skills, compound and become significantly more value.
4:49
But if you didn't have the foundational skills of just under understanding basic accounting, then it'd be much more difficult to do Ma They later, right?
And so we want to make sure that you maximize as much broad exposure to as many General skills because you could do ma in a company that does fishing supplies or we could do it for one that sells media.
5:07
It doesn't really matter because all those foundational skills will translate over.
And so, when you're switching between opportunities, you want to make sure that part of it will transfer over.
All right?
So said differently, so if you're in banking, you could be on the retail side of making, it could be a teller.
You could be, somebody does wealth management.
5:23
Like there's lots of different sectors within banking overall.
You could also just be in sales and transfer the same function, to a different company and so you can either go within your industry in terms of changing direction or you could go within your function and change industry.
Either of those are good.
Smart career path jobs where you do get in trouble, is where it's where you make both jobs, where you going to a new industry and a completely new role because that is where you actually start at zero.
5:44
So you want to minimize the likelihood that you have to go back down to the beginning of the tree and just continue to Branch off in One Direction.
So the point is you want to gain as many General business skills as you can.
Because these are the things that that permanently increase your earnings as in.
You will never go below this level once you acquire these General skills.
6:01
And so for me, I worked in a small boutique consulting firm during my 22 23 years.
I work directly under the CEO, more like a personal assistant than an analyst which is my title.
They didn't do any training, but I did get exposure to big money and that shifted my thinking for me that was really valuable and since they didn't give me a lot of work.
6:19
I read about two books a week, almost entirely self, help, and watch, burner books.
YouTube wasn't even like really around that much that Was found in just a few years before that Instagram literally hadn't even come out like hadn't even been created yet just to give you some context.
So I felt like I wanted to be an entrepreneur and when I thought I'd learn what I was going to do, I decided actually didn't want to be in the defense Contracting industry, and had to decide between going to business school and starting my own business.
6:40
So I made a big move.
I kept the same idea of working under smart people, but I wanted to switch Industries.
So, when into fitness, because I like that now, I didn't do what I'm telling you to do, because I didn't have me to help me, right?
But Fitness was literally a different industry and a completely different skill set.
But I did know Fitness myself.
6:57
So that was my kind of one into me.
Able to have at least a leg in the right direction because that's what I spend a lot of my free time doing.
But what I did get right was that I went to the top of the industry each time.
So with the Consulting thing I want to the top and with the fitness industry, I went to the shop or at least as far as I could reach.
Was there was a seven-figure gym owner and I reached out to me said I could work for him and my skills are consultant transferred.
7:16
All right.
So this is where I did have some transfer over Consultants have to learn stuff really fast and the way they do that is they interview experts because experts already have sifted through the information.
So experts Buy you time.
All right.
So I use my skills, I learned as a consultant to approach Fitness which I liked as something to learn everything about.
7:32
So I emailed 40 gym owners.
One guy said I could pay him for an apprenticeship but he quickly saw that I was good at writing and talking to people.
So I had other General skills and so he started paying me after that, I'll be at minimum wage, but he still paid me something.
And I worked basically as his personal assistant to and within 90 days, he offered a partner with me on a location and I'll tell you what happened next.
7:54
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect for you can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
8:10
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
So now we're talking the next season, 23 to 26 the season of repetition.
8:28
Alright.
So after getting exposure to an industry, you'll decide whether you want to do more of that, stuff in that industry, or more stuff related to the skill, you learned.
And if you feel like, you aren't getting either of those things switch, as soon as you can, when you're picking Industries, I'd recommend picking one where money is made main reason.
It's my belief that you can fall in love with anything if you're good at it and you get good at it by starting early and doing a lot of it.
8:49
So if you shorten real estate, you could be on the deal side, the broker side, The Lending side The development side, there are lots of different angles.
Now you might start in the broker side and then decide you like the lining side more or your sales skills transfer and you'll be in the same industry.
But just in a different sector and one, major caveat have is that it costs a lot to change Industries so just be sure it wasn't because you didn't like the six people you were working with and it was actually the industry.
9:12
Overall this is a mistake a lot of people make earlier on because they like I hated that place I must hate media when really just hated the tiny 6 people that you talk to on a regular basis and they're probably another media thing.
So if you got into Because you liked it unless you learn something fundamentally different about how the business works.
9:28
Then it might just be the people and honestly, that's 90% the time what your enjoyment comes from, but make no mistake.
This is the season of repetition.
This is where you start to hone your craft through reps.
This is where you get 10,000 reps in.
And as much as I say to myself, Alex, you should have gone out more and had more friends and had more you know, fun times in your 20s.
9:47
I didn't and it paid off and so everything's a trade-off what you want now for what you want most and if you're not sure what Reps, you're gaining you're doing the wrong thing.
So you want to be in a major value-add Lane and you want to know the skill.
You're learning, so product creation, advertising, media, outreach sales, Finance, coding, whatever it is.
10:06
If you aren't sure about the thing that you repeatedly doing that, you're getting better at it then you're not doing anything valuable, all right?
But when you do that work, you give yourself and the world evidence of your skill, you build something valuable a track record.
For me, this is where I started my first business.
10:22
Honestly, I was a little Young.
But the guy who offered the partnership with me, I offered you advise me on the business, so he became a 10% owner in my business for free, and he helped me start it and I still felt like I didn't know anything.
So I ended up getting two more mentors to take a third of my business each and I ended up with 33% for myself but I learned a lot from each one of them different skills, all the meanwhile, every day, I was still working at the gym and selling selling selling selling all day long.
10:48
I close it for 4,000 sales the next three years.
That's for closes a day.
This was my Rocky cutscene I knew a little bit about Fitness, but I learned how to deal with employees process money, make contracts, buildup location, pick location.
And the main thing I got was the Reps in sales and marketing and open up five more locations in that period.
11:04
But once I felt like I was getting really good at it.
I made another big change and this change was the one that really skyrocketed my income which was the next season, 26 to 29 is the season of chunking up.
So the reason your lifetime wages, increase the most in the season is because you finally have a lay of the land if perspective from which to make a judgment on what next moves to make.
11:23
You see where The thing is right, you actually get how the money Works, where it flows, you see who gets the most of it and most of the time its upstream and this is where leverage begins to come in.
You need to start getting more for your time either.
Get more for your time by leveraging, the time of others, by being in charge of other people leading managing, Etc.
11:40
You tie yourself and you're compensated by percentage of the total value of the team.
And so that can either happen in a company where you're leading more people that are doing the thing that you learned how to do or you start a business etcetera, right?
And so that's when you're starting Leverage, People you can also leverage other people's money.
11:56
This is where if you want to start your own shop, you could use your savings or get a loan from other people to start it and people would give it to you if you had a track record, that's why it's so important.
In fact, there was a successful gym owner that I knew who wanted to start a gym after you came back from Afghanistan, he's a military guy, the bank told him that they would loan him, the money after he had three years of experience working in a gym, which syncs with the seasons that I'm telling you right now.
12:16
And so ended up taking a job, so they wouldn't let him the money.
So you want, any took a job at a local gym?
He worked his way up to general manager.
He saved his money And then he realized three years later once, he really understood how the business work that he didn't even need the loan to begin with.
So it ended up being the best advice I ever got because once you start knowing the game, you make better moves.
12:35
So when you're chunking up you move Upstream, you start your own shop, you own your own team.
You find the position that within your industry, has the most leverage and you pursue it.
For me, this is when I went from owning a few shops of my own to seeing franchisors in the license or just the ones who had the most leverage, they could make a percentage of what everyone made and that's when I started using everything that I learned during my Rocky cut. .
12:54
At my own gyms at other peoples gyms and that eventually packaging and license out to thousands of gyms across the country.
And that's when my earnings exploded.
But for me it wasn't until I was 27 that I became a millionaire and the year that I made my first million in profit.
Was also, the year, I made my second and third million dollars in profit, and basically, until that point, I had almost no money to my name.
13:13
All my money kept going into my gyms and to learning stuff that was all the programs.
All the workshops, all the courses, all the masterminds.
And I told you I gave away two thirds of my company to three different people in the beginning, because I I just wanted to learn faster.
All right, and so the thing is, it was very frustrating for those years like the three years that I spent doing the Consulting thing and I really didn't feel like I was learning as much as I should.
13:33
But I didn't see was that I was gaining access to people with significantly more money and it shifted my perspective of how much money could be made.
And the next season, was all about getting the repetition.
So, I could build my skill stack, right?
And that's where I learned.
Lots of different things.
And I knew what things I was getting the Reps on, and then, finally, once I had a lay of the land, I knew what moves I could make.
13:50
That would give me the most leverage.
And so here's what our community do for the The phases of your 20s.
All right, first don't dig yourself into a ditch.
You can avoid, don't get addicted to drugs.
Don't have an unplanned kid, don't get some crazy STD that you can never get rid of.
All right.
Second phase, get your foundational skills work for free or minimum wage to get access to the best people.
14:07
You can big caveat here the best people you can if someone's willing to pay you twice, three times four times more, but they're not going to teach you as much as the other people don't take it because you're short changing.
Your long term earnings don't make the trait.
It's a bad trade.
Third, Rocky, cutscene embrace the suck, don't complain.
14:26
Do the boring work.
Don't believe you've earned something that you haven't hustled for.
All right, the biggest pet peeve of everybody who's ahead of younger, guys, in the game is that they think they've learned something that they have it.
They're like, dude, I've been doing this for five years for like five years.
Is a blank, it's nothing right?
14:42
Like they talk about the 10-year Club, the 20, or Club, the 30-year Club in the 40-year club, right?
In terms of Entrepreneurship, because most people can't hang that long.
And so, you're like, five years in, you think you're over the world and you're not So find the best guy in the company and shouted them, do twice the level of effort.
They are because you have to make up for not being as good as they are.
14:59
All right?
So, do twice the work, do everything.
You can to get them to like you and give you their discretionary time.
So if you can get them to talk to you out of work, and hang out with you on the weekend, and grab a coffee, and grab a lunch and grab a dinner, grab some drinks, whatever it is.
If you can get them to like you, they will cheat you even more.
And this is the micro stuff.
15:14
This is the stuff that takes a 10x opportunity and turns into 100x opportunity.
That's why the learning is important.
If you go to this place to learn, Sure, you fucking learn and the best way to get them to actually do that and give you their discretionary time is to follow their advice ruthlessly.
15:30
Alright, people will always have someone if they see that person take Massive Action on their advice but you know who they won't help the person who asked for advice all the time and then does nothing or complains or bitches and gives excuses.
All right, so forth, once you have the rocky cutscene face done, you have a skill.
15:46
You now find the highest point of Leverage within your respective opportunity so you have to Chunk Up.
You have to get leverage, find a little Get more for your effort.
And if you can't see it yet, then you haven't done enough reps yet and that's because people can get in six months in the Rocky cutscene, a to be like this sucks.
I need to find more leverage, but you haven't earned it yet.
16:03
You don't have the track record, and if you can't see the opportunity, it's because you haven't done it yet.
If you've done it enough times and you put enough work in, you will very clearly.
See you lay of the land of where your next opportunity is it the path will always reveal itself to you as you keep walking and if you still are nincompoop and you've done 36 months of perhaps then talk to people who make the most money.
16:22
Money in your industry, ask them what the smart move is and how they got to their position and then have the nads to take the job.
Whether that's gunning for the promotion.
Heading up a new division, moving companies for starting your own, that's how you destroy your 20s, or at least that's how I did.

When I have any stressors in my life, I'm saying that I'm choosing my brain is choosing to make, meaning out of this, when there was no meaning to be made to begin with and so by doing that, I can play the notes of the piano of meaning.
That happened across the occurrences and circumstances in my life.
0:33
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
March of 2019.
My wife and I were walking together.
After just having finished a 4.4 million dollar month and she turned to me and she said, Alex, let's just shut it all down.
0:54
She's like, I'm so tired of this.
I'm so burnt out.
I just don't want to do this anymore.
And it was at that moment that I realized that in order to progress in the entrepreneurial game, we had to change the way we operate at the way we thought.
And so, if you're an entrepreneur and you're you're a business owner, the number one thing that I've seen that creates success is longevity, meaning that you can continue to play the game because at the end of the day, none of us is going to quit business or hopefully not quit business.
1:22
And so in order to decrease the likelihood that we quit, which is the only way to fail.
We have to think through our problems Defined framework and so rather than focus on the actual framework of the decision making, what I want to do is focus in around the state in which you can manage your own thoughts, all right?
1:38
And so, I've had to do with plenty of stressors as you can imagine.
So, if you're stressed in your own business right now, like, you know, add a zero to whatever your revenue is, and you'll have ten times the potential for stress.
If you were 10 times bigger or 100 times, this is the stress.
If you were a hundred times bigger, which depends on who's listening, we may be that for you and so I can tell you truthfully that the way that I've been able to eliminate pressure, which is created a longevity in the game for me has been through four strategies that actually work in the real world for me.
2:09
So, the first that I do, whenever I have any kind of negative situation is I go 1000x - alright.
And then I reevaluate.
So let me explain what that means.
So if for example there's something that's bad that happens we get a bad review or we get, you know, a client subset.
2:28
Or I have an employee who says something bad to another employer employee, that's key leaves or someone tries to, you know, a competitor, steal stuff and then starts back whatever it is, right?
There's a million problems and go business or you have cash.
Flow issues.
Are you can't make payroll whatever it is?
Right?
I like to think of this one, is my first, this is my like, my first line of defense.
2:46
The first thing I think about is, If this were to happen a thousand times more, right?
And this works really well with what I would consider like minor to medium-sized grievances.
So things that happen that are kind of everyday business that can, you know, bother you for a day or two days or a week, right?
3:02
Well, if you can just shorten that Loop of that cycle of you being disturbed, because thing is lots of those things are going to happen every single week.
A lot of times you just don't know about them, right?
Depending on the size of your business.
And so I just happen to know about it.
Now, it's so, first off, I like to think about that but second is all.
3:18
Do this, right?
Which is all imagine that every day in my life, this happens whatever that thing is, Right, customers upset.
Now obviously, if it's a core issue, you have to resolve it.
But in terms of like, it happening in my effective or my emotional reaction to it, then I think to myself, well, if this happened every single day and this happened every hour of every day.
3:38
At some point, I would become desensitized to it, right?
Because I had so much stimulus of this.
I would not be able to have an emotional response and so when I think and I imagine myself experiencing this - thing over and over and over and over.
Going to talk - visualization.
Then what ends up happening is, I've become immune to it.
And so I think to myself, well, if I can become immune to it, after a thousand tries, I can become immune to it on the first try because means nothing is actually changed only by perspective on the occurrence and in so doing you can short while yourself to that end outcome and then fast forward it to the present.
4:07
So you can live the rest of your day or less if you're weak without being emotionally disturbed and when you do that, at least for me, I feel like I make better decisions.
And so I think for most of us as entrepreneurs and business owners, We are judged by the marketplace by the quality of our decisions.
That's ultimately what it is, right?
It's just how good are the quality of the decisions that we make.
4:24
And so if I can decrease the likelihood that I make bad decisions and I can do it on a regular basis, then this is something that protects my mind and candidly it's what makes life worth living.
The second thing that I'll do is that when I'm preparing for something that that I need to start doing right?
4:42
Because there might be habits or things that you need to start doing it.
Not this is a, this is a slightly different example but it's I'm giving you the Different strategies that have worked really well for me.
The second one is let's say you wanted to start working out just like you know what, I've been neglecting my health or you don't start eating healthier, whatever it is.
Right?
4:57
Those are Fitness examples but just go with me.
What I will do is I will expect the worst circumstance.
All right.
So rather than saying, okay, I'm going to go work out and feel excited right?
To go workout.
I'm super pumped.
What I want to do is I want to plan and prepare my mental state for when it times to work out, when it comes time to work out, I'm going to be exhausted.
5:21
I'm not going to slept well and have a lot of business dress.
And so I have to expect that going into every workout.
Now, if I don't have that happen, then it's a bonus rather than Spec Ting, nothing to be my mental state.
And then when something bad does happen, then I have this reason, right?
5:36
And so it it really does go into truly expecting the worst case scenario and making the preformed decision to act.
Anyways, despite that because you have planned floor.
So, most people most humans have really good psychological resilience if we brace for it.
5:52
So if you're about to give someone bad news, for example, you actually have to let them.
Hey, this is bad news.
How you might want to sit down for this because people actually are very resilient if you give them a moment.
To emotionally brace themselves.
And so, what we're doing here is using this bracing technique on ourselves in advance of a situation that is likely to occur at sometime.
6:09
Between now, and when we die, especially if it's a habit that has to be ongoing.
Right?
And so what I do is I emotionally brace For the worst scenario.
All right, that's number two, you'll cook wise.
You guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
6:27
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of The thumb, it means the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
6:52
The third thing that I do and this is probably the one that I use the most.
It's really the one that I use the most actually, I'll save that one for last a different version of this.
The emotional brace is an extreme version, right?
7:07
So kind of this is, imagine the thing that you just said happened, that bothered you for a thousand times, then it stops affecting you.
The second one is you emotionally brace yourself.
The third one.
Is you imagine worst case.
All right now the point here is kind of like a pain anchor.
7:24
Okay.
And so what I mean by a painting Kerr, is it gives you perspective on your current issues?
Right?
So for this, for example, whenever you've had a family member died or someone close to you die or some of you even have a pet died, depends on where you're at in your life, right?
If you have something that was painful for you, right?
7:42
All of us benefit, we get the gift of perspective from those who died.
That's the, like, the one of the final gifts at any death occurs, that's in your proximity.
Many will give you right.
And so for me, I think about that - situation.
I really like, trying soak myself in it right.
Really try and like, put it on and walk around and what that painful state would be whatever, whatever.
8:02
Worst case scenario can imagine might be death of a spouse, might be death of a parent, whatever, right?
Or child, something horrific, right?
But if I can, truly allow myself to go there, Then what happens is, I get so much context and perspective on the little thing.
8:19
Like somebody bashing a piece of content or someone saying that they hate your ad or whatever, it might be the thing that is deriding you.
And all of a sudden that problem becomes massively minimized, right?
It becomes almost inconsequential.
And what I found is that over my life in the business, There are so many there's an infinite amount of problems.
8:38
Truly, there's an unlimited amount of problems.
I could think of so many things we should be doing, or we could be doing better or should not have happened, right?
But it's only because we put the word should in front of it.
That we have an expectation that is different than reality which creates the friction in our minds Kris, the dissonance, it creates the unhappiness that we have.
8:56
And so if I can imagine the worst case scenario and then actively minimize my current situation, then I usually can get right through it and most times.
What I found is that most problems shrink into a relevance within broader context, they actually never get solved, we just realized that we just don't care and that they are no longer meaningful to us and so that has been something that's been very useful for me as we've grown.
9:19
Because frankly, the bigger your company gets the more ability and potential you have to become stressed.
And I think most of us are here for freedom and so if you want freedom, then you have to, at least for me, I have found that I have to manage my mental state in order to continue to make high-quality decisions.
And so that leads me to the last one, which is probably my my Favorite and most used one that I use on anything and this may this may bother some of you and that's okay.
9:42
This is intense re universe.
Is that this is a this is a worldview that I have.
So if you are, if you are, you know, don't don't be trigger, you know, it's a don't take offense to this but I'm telling you what has worked for me and so I believe that the universe will continue to expand until eventually everything becomes a fine Mist over a long enough time Horizon.
10:05
The sun will give out all stars will extinguish and then everything will just become a fine mist and as silly as that may sound, it means that anything that We do this video, anything that I accomplished in this world will eventually disappear and be meaningless.
And so some people find that incredibly depressing, I don't, I find that to be incredibly meaningful because it means to me that I'm allowed to.
10:30
I am the only person that ascribes meaning to anything because it means that nothing has inherent meaning.
And so that means that when I have any stressors in my life, I'm saying that I'm choosing my brain is choosing to make meaning out of this.
There was no meaning to be made to begin with.
10:47
And so by doing that, I can play the notes of the piano of meaning that happened across the occurrences and circumstances in my life.
And so, when I think about it in this context, everything shrinks into a relevance.
And so, a lot of the concepts around like I want to build a legacy.
11:03
I want, I want to make an impact.
I want to leave a dent in the universe.
You're not, you're probably not going to leave a dent in the universe and even if you made some big advancement within 500 years, like it'll probably be forgotten.
And that would be like if you're the top point zero zero zero zero one percent, right?
11:19
It's unlikely.
But it is 100% like that.
Over a long enough time Horizon everything will disappear, right?
And by doing that for me, it decreases.
The pressure that I put on myself for having to I must I should I have to, like, I can't live without those thoughts.
11:38
That strangle me, right?
There's other things that destroy my ability to make decisions because I come way more emotional as a Of them.
And so whenever I have any kind of negative occurrence or a stressors that come up in my life, which are inevitable, I use this as my ultimate frame of reference, this is my ultimate trump card that I use to keep my my emotions at Bay and ultimately say I am the master of my own Universe.
12:03
I get to decide what has meaning and for me, I'll tell you what I have found most meaningful for me.
Is that my purpose in life to my knowledge at this point?
Point is to learn.
I love learning.
And so that is, that is why I make these videos because I feel like I am able to better learn how to think, I'm better learns, how to run businesses?
12:26
I'm better, learn.
I can better learn all of the aspects of everything by teaching it, right?
And I'm sure if you ever ever did a book report when you were in high school, you learn the one chapter you had to do your book report on or give a presentation on way better than any of the other chapters because when you have to teach something you have to learn it better, you have to learn the nuances of what make something work.
12:43
And so for me, even Cataloging these things has been useful for me because I think these are all the things that I do, huh?
But now I have a process that I can continue to use rather than use haphazardly just because I've just trained myself over time doing this.
12:58
And so I don't know where you're at in your business career if you're you know seven figures ready figures or multi figures your multiple companies, whatever it is.
Right?
This has been so personally impactful for me that it has helped me be in this for the Long Haul because If nothing has meaning, except for what I choose to give, meaning that, it means I can choose to only play games that I find meaningful.
13:23
And by extension, I will not fall out of the game or quit because the thing that I'm doing is the thing that that I derive the most meaning from.
And so I will be able to outlast longer players in that Pursuit.
And what happened is for me, my life becomes a glorification to an ideal that I create.
13:45
And so, for me, like the content, I will do everything I can to continue to improve on this.
I'm bumping, coaches, I'm going through courses to try and make the lessons that I have more engaging more entertaining.
More educational have more stories woven into them, so that hopefully, I can transfer these things to someone else because that is what I find meaningful not because it is eternal any meaningful.
14:04
But just because that ideal to me, has meaning.
And so, that is something that I believe is eternal values are Eternal and values will exist.
Even when everything Years in the universe.
And so for me, I choose to dedicate my content to those ideals.

Conor McGregor K with proper 12, boom.
There's the 600 million dollar deal.
The Rock had tear amount of tequila, which is now worth like four billion.
Kylie made the front of Forbes as a billionaire and she was 20 mr.
Beast.
He will be a sense of billionaire right now, the entire economy has shifted, the last century was a century about the power.
0:17
When I say power me, like energy, the wealthiest individuals of the last century were built on oil.
The biggest companies were all energy, companies fast forward today.
Four of the top five biggest companies in the world.
Are not built on the old oil that the new oil and the oil of today is attention rise and teens on tick-tocks.
0:37
The thing that is being pumped and drilled every day is the attention of the masses.
You have 24 hours a day that your ears are open.
You have 24 hours a day that your eyes are open.
And so the idea is how can we capture as many of those hours from as many people as possible.
0:53
And the war for our minds for me, the stuff is all about, like helping people connect the total Above a tension that exists is every human's eyes and ears, collectively 24 hours a day.
That is the pie and they're fighting for it.
People who are creating the platforms that other companies can come and drill their basically the digital landscape.
1:12
The envelope, the world, they're literally buying up the real estate of the collective attention that exists.
The oil tycoons, had to go and buy a state, negotiate haggle with the farmer to get his things the new world today.
They don't need to haggle with anyone, they just take it scarce resources or the things that are the most Viable.
1:30
And so oil was the scarce resource and now attention is the scarce resource.
And so that's why attention.
Is the new oil, a friend of mine.
Ryan Fischer just showed me a clip on his phone of a podcast that I did with him.
This is when I wasn't really actually, I didn't do any podcast.
1:46
I was it wasn't doing any speaking stuff.
Like, all I was doing was building Jumanji Prestige Labs.
I was like, screw content just run ads.
I don't want to be known.
I want to be rich and unknown.
It's funny because he was like, and now you're not doing that.
I was very against it and then what happened?
2:02
Kylie made the front of Forbes as a billionaire and she was 20.
And at the time, I was 27 and I think I had taken home 17 million in income, the year before I was on Pace to do like 13 to 15 that next year in terms of take home and I thought like I was hot shit and then this girl is seven years younger than me fucking crushes me in net worth and I was like, Wow.
2:24
And so it was just this huge belief shift for me was like, what am I doing wrong?
My ego felt hurt.
And so I started protecting myself and I was like, oh no Kris Jenner's for Mom, she's an absolute gangster, she was born into this royalty.
It's not that she did it it was someone else and blah blah blah ego protected, I feel.
2:39
Okay now and then put a beauty.
So low percentage of her thing for 600 million.
At the time, it's worth over a billion today.
Conor McGregor came with proper 12 and 12 months later, boom was a 600 million dollar deal.
Robots whale, and then the rock had tear amount of tequila which is now worth like 4 billion skip seeing this again and again and again to the point where I was like I You believe something that's not true.
3:02
And so I talked about how skills beliefs character traits are the three things that hold back entrepreneurs.
And this one for me was something that I believed about the world.
And I was functioning as though and it was not I was try and find those things because they construct our reality and we make our decisions based on the things that we believe to be true.
3:17
And so I basically was walking through a reality that was not real.
I then read a book mind of all rob a couch, this is Almanac which is really good really quick read and you talk about the four types of Leverage in the book, leverages the difference in what you put in, what you get out, the people who make the most Money or the ones who have the most leverage because everybody the same amount of time.
It's just who gets the most back for their time compounding.
3:34
Is that now that you've made that trade with your Leverage?
Is it going to compound unto itself and get you even more back?
Because compounding is a form of Leverage, and you've got a labor, you get other people to do stuff for you, which means you get more of your time back and you get output above that.
You've got Capital.
So, people give you money, you invest the money that other people give you and you get leverage by extension.
3:52
The last two levels are coats.
You got software and media.
So if you think about this, you make a piece of code and then 10 million people can use it.
That's But you put one time investment, you get infinite on the other side with media, to same way.
If I take however much time, it takes me to make this video.
One person a million people, a hundred million.
4:08
People can see this video, which is what gives it leverage when I saw that.
That was what made everything click for me, as to why these people were getting these crazy, crazy numbers.
When they had, like, I had her Kylie had a team of seven and she was doing 200 million a year.
It's like team of seven and was because she had a compounding leverage vehicle built with that her business.
4:29
And that was when I looked at my own businesses at the time and realized I had nothing that compounded nothing.
I almost became dissatisfied with the business that I had because I realized that whatever I wanted to do next.
I wanted to have a compounding vehicle something that multiplies unto itself over and over again.
So Warren Buffett could build Berkshire Hathaway because the money itself, compounds and compounds and compounds, and on a long enough time Horizon, when you keep rolling the snowball after you do that for 4050 years, you have a big fucking snowball.
4:55
You have to unlock one of those four types of Leverage.
And so when I looked at that, Pyramid.
I was like, well, I understand the leverage of Labor, so I've got that I'm now in a position where I have Capital that I can deploy.
Now, I don't have other people's cat because that's not what I want to do with my life right now.
But when I looked at software and media, I was like given my skills, Etc.
5:12
I could be better at the media side that I could at the code side, but I still wasn't there yet.
I looked at these people that are Ultra famous, I was like, huh?
Why still rather be anonymous?
Because they've got all these stalkers and Weirdos a good morning, honey.
When you get exposed to 10 million people, if you figure one percent of people are crazy, you got 100,000 weirdos.
5:30
Anyways, I go to have dinner with front of mine, Dean gracioso, who's he gets like weirdos, it come to his house and all that stuff.
And I was like, how do you deal with?
This is like, why do you think this, like, how is this worth it?
He's having down.
He was like dude, if couple weird letters, you know every day or every week is the price.
5:47
I have to pay for the impact.
I want to have he's like I pay that price any day of the week and twice on Sunday and there was just like this pause when he Set it between when he said it and we looked at me and I just felt like it hit me because I was like, God I'm being such a pansy, I want to make real business education available to everyone by say that that's what I actually want to do.
6:04
Then I need to match my actions to that otherwise they're just empty words.
I hate doing something that I don't get credit for later.
And so the idea of making a short that is going to float today and then disappear into the ether tomorrow, right?
Or make a post on Instagram, that's going to be gone in a week like no one's ever going to see it again to meet taking the scarce resources of my time and Having it vanish.
6:26
I couldn't make that work.
For me.
It was a huge belief that I realized the content is not.
The output is the input, the output is the audience, and the audience is, what compounds?
The audience is, what sticks, you're Gathering.
6:42
The scarce resource and the audience is the thing that pumps attention over and over again.
If you've got mr.
Beast, I think he opened up a restaurant in a local area and have 10,000 people show up at a local restaurant.
I don't think people realize that He's 24 and media compounds.
6:57
I will make prediction that he will be a sense of billionaire, not just a billionaire, but a sensibility under.
It's a becoming a master of media is a huge way of creating leverage because if Kylie can just point mr.
Beast can just point and then you have 100 million people who buy anything you have a billion dollar plus company.
7:15
But once that shifted in me, I'd stop seeing it as a waste because I thought if I got one more person who's going to see this short?
Or see this long, or see this poster?
See this tweet or This.
Whatever, that was the point.
The reason puta, The Rock Conor McGregor, Kylie were able to translate their attention into money one.
7:34
They spent a long time, building it, right, and amassing that attention because they knew that the moment they did decide to monetize it.
It was right there.
Think about how long The Rock has been building the brand of the rock before he signed his deal with Under Armour before he made term on a before he made zoa. 20 years, he'd been building this brand people piss and moan about the fact that, you know, they posted content for four weeks and Not famous yet.
7:56
One is, they waited a really really, really long time and they didn't ask they just they gave they give to their particular audience, the longer.
You can wait the bigger, they ask can be at the end the longer, the runway, the bigger, the plane that can take off from it.
The next thing is that the thing they chose to monetize from was on brand.
8:11
This is something that Their audience already.
Dug The Rock, signing the deal with Under Armour makes complete sense because Fitness is a core part of his brand.
It's about drive, it's about power, we stay hungry.
We devour that all of that is something that Under Armour wanted to tap.
In to do so, see their brand.
8:26
With the biggest brands that exist come from the endorsements of celebrities, we can't be Kim Kardashian a girl can't be Kim.
So Kim is the ultimate status.
Then, Dolce & Gabbana signs Kim and says where our shit people.
Then see the status that Kim has an associated with Dolce & Gabbana and then little lady who's got money and doesn't have status phrase, her money for the bag that she can associate with Kim to get the status.
8:51
That's the game.
Let's look at LeBron and Nike they wanted to say, Sign him because they figure, he is going to be iconic.
He is Iconic, right?
And they wanted to associate Nike Victory with somebody who's Victorious, because a brand can't be victorious in and of itself.
It's not a person.
It's so they got to find the people who embody, the spirit and the values of their brand.
9:09
They make the endorsement people make the association their mind and then they buy the brand to get the association of the thing they could never do.
But always aspire to the people who are the most famous.
You look at Rogan right?
He's got UFC.
He's also a really amazing comedian in loves the comedy community.
9:25
Fitness and biohacking in supplements and all and like brain stuff.
He loves all that stuff, aliens and UFOs.
And these are all totally different.
But the more Dimensions that someone can go deep on the more, they'll get an audience from Comedy, and then they'll cross pollinate them with fighting.
It's this total pollination, which ultimately compounds the audience even faster.
9:43
And so, these Mega stars go deep on many things and capture a bigger and bigger audiences that Compound on themselves and they wait, because they stay loyal to their brand and then they appeal to a segment of Their audience or they try to cut across.
The one that appeals to the most of them, it took me way too long to realize that the game had changed fundamentally.
10:01
If the Rockefellers were built on oil, the new generation of people are going to be built on attention, media will only become more expensive over time.
Advertising becomes more expensive content, creation, becomes more expensive.
It becomes increasingly fragmented to cost more to do it across different platforms.
The audience becomes more, valuable the cost of getting the audience becomes more valuable, which means the best time to start is now.
9:55

We just need to strip away the Perfection and get to the like if I directionally move in this way, over a long enough period of time, I will get there as long as I don't stop.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:15
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I have an interesting question for you.
So, in the last podcast, you mentioned that at one point in your life, you were religious can.
So what made you make that switch in your head?
0:33
From like going from religion?
Because I think you said, you were on, like, a one of those trips.
I'm sorry.
I forget what they're called.
Figured what made you switch that in your head to go from?
You know, this very, very spiritual belief to like almost the complete opposite of like life is life.
0:49
We die.
We die.
You know, fact, in fact, nihilism is a whole what made that switch in your head or was it like a long process?
I mean, it's a very long process.
It was five years.
It was very, very hard for me.
I will say this, the amount of messages I got from people who are Christian and Muslim and other Critters, you know, faiths thinking that I attacked him on the last podcast.
1:07
Like, I don't know how I can make that you got messages.
Yeah.
I mean you didn't get it yet.
Yeah, just like, yeah.
And I will say this again, my statements are not an attack on your religion.
They are simply an expression of what conclusions I have come to, and I'll say, right now, I'm wrong.
I'm wrong.
1:22
You're right, everyone?
Listening to do what you believe, you're right.
That being said, I was even going to at the time a Christian therapist because I was like, I wanted somebody who understood therapy but also like understood you know Christianity so they could kind of like work with me on these things and after like a handful of sessions, she just looked at me and she was like, Alex.
1:44
I think you just need to make a decision.
She's like, you just she's like you've gathered all the data, you've gone.
You've gone to the courses.
You did a college course on, on the formation of the Canon which is like how the Bible was actually put together.
Why things were put in why things were not put in.
You know, like you've investigated all this stuff and I was obsessing about it because I think for me until I understood like why I was here like nothing else mattered to me so it's like And some people that can just like walk through life without really thinking about it in some ways, I'm jealous, you know, they can just, they can just do that.
2:18
I couldn't like, I was like, why, why am I working?
Why do I care about money?
What's the point of all this?
Like, that was always my first and most important thought it's like once we answer that box and everything else kind of Falls underneath of it.
And so I think it's safe to say that there are very exceptional people who can make arguments on both sides in terms of like there's nothing, it doesn't matter.
2:39
And then there's really Ali, amazing apologists like Ravi Zacharias.
She's an amazing of all just who's a Christian.
There's just there's just a ton of guys, right?
And they're brilliant people and you can listen to both sides the arguments, but I think what ends up happening is that on some level, you have a belief and I'll rename that as an assumption because all believes our assumptions, but everyone has these assumptions.
2:59
And at some point you just have to say, like okay, there's stuff on both sides, the jury has to pass a verdict, right?
And to say that like we have cracked it.
Or like Alex has cracked it, the deeper you go in these arguments the more they're just other arguments that just continued to get pulled.
3:17
And that's why I just fell into this Rabbit Hole where I was like I need to start becoming a productive member of society because like this is just going on forever and that's when she was just like I think you just need to decide and for me the thing that felt more true.
So what I actually believed was that I didn't think any of it was real and I think it was because that initially saddened me and I didn't want that to be.
3:37
That's why I put spent so much time trying to like Logic my way in to believing because I do think it's a better life perspective to believe that there's capital M.
Meaning that there's somebody behind the scenes who's directing our lives so we can accomplish some greater goal, right Beyond ourselves, I just don't believe that.
3:57
I wish I did.
It's been 5 years trying to I just don't believe it.
And for everybody who messaged me and said, I really just need to talk to you for five minutes.
Please don't I'm good.
I'm very content with my belief and so for me now, I had to learn how to live with that belief and then kind of go from there, which is like, I don't believe that anything happens after we die and my evidence for that is that I have been dead because I have not been alive and I know what it was like before I was alive, which was there was nothing.
4:27
And I think that that's exactly what it'll be when I am not alive again.
So to me, I'm okay with it and that's fine.
And I know it's I'm not right, you know?
I mean, it doesn't like that's just my two cents out.
His two cents on the world and I think that people just need to figure out the belief.
4:44
Like whenever someone say it's a belief and I like well I don't think that I'm like cool like awesome.
As long as like your belief serve you great like I'm Pro you.
It's interesting once you I guess already the idea or you didn't get rid of the idea of religion but you just deemed it wasn't true for you.
5:02
Hmm you described in the last episode that we did with you that you became nihilist.
Hmm could you define Nile?
And for those watching and also once you did become a nihilist, how did that change your life?
That it change anything on the day-to-day?
Or did it just like basically reaffirm kind of what you already believe?
5:20
Deep down.
I think it it formally crystalized thoughts that I already had.
So it's like, you know, you have you these thoughts that are ill-defined or more and more fishing like once you put words to them, you're like, that's what I believe, right?
And so I think that once I understood like, I don't even know nihilism of this thing when someone's like, oh, you sound like you believe in those like oh, and but again, that's just a label.
5:38
So like Want a lot labels on things because it's easier for us to organize in our minds.
But like I just inherently believe that there is no capital M meaning, that's it, that's all I believe.
It's just that there's no capital M meaning to what we're doing.
There's little M meaning as in like I find this meaningful, I find this stimulating.
5:56
I do things that I enjoy.
Like those are things that I find meaningful little lamb but is me doing this podcast Big M Universe meaningful?
No, I don't think.
So some people would disagree with me that's okay.
I just that's just my perspective and so In terms of how it shifted my life, it actually in a lot of ways dramatically improve my life.
6:15
What was the worst thing for me?
Was the indecision that five years is really hard for me, because I just, I felt like I couldn't make progress either way.
Like, I feel like I needed to be there say, like, I'm all-in.
I'm going, you know, all down the religious path.
That's my that's the game, or I actually don't believe this and people could make the argument.
6:32
Well, there's probably a million Shades in between sure.
But for me, there wasn't this is it was either this or this for me and so believing that there was no inherent.
Meaning freed me from From a lot of stuff.
So this belief that I had to do it my parents a door or you know, listen to the opinions of others are and like be weighed down by judgment that I perceived to be there.
6:51
Which arguably probably weren't, right?
Those were the things that it gave me relief from and then the day-to-day anxieties of like running a business.
And like this person stole clients from you and I'm like, when we die, it won't matter.
It's okay.
Like, we'll move on like, it's just not going to matter.
7:08
And, and that's why I share it because they're Probably other people who were in the same boat as me and so like I'm just sharing it for those people and if you're not one of those people I love you and that's awesome.
Like I'm so stoked for you that you believe what you believe.
But if you're not one of those people, I do think that giving yourself the freedom to have whatever little and meaning you want out of that activities that you do is incredibly freeing because you, you get to, you get to do, what you define as meaningful, which is great.
7:35
I like that.
Who do you look up to Warren Buffett?
And Charlie Munger, probably my to, like Heroes.
My they've lived a life that I admire in a lot of ways.
I think that like in, like, my life goal was, to be like, King Solomon, just a wise man and I feel like they are like modern-day no King Solomon, King Solomon's in that they are wise, they accumulated a lot of wealth and they did it.
8:04
It living what I would consider, you know, Aristotle's, like good life, they did like their way.
And I just have a tremendous amount of respect for that, and I have a lot of respect for you Lon, you know.
It's, I think it's more, like, the people that I look up to are people who are just authentically them and just do things their way.
8:22
And so that is what I try to do.
And I think nihilism actually help me do that a lot because I wasn't trying to fit into a cookie cutter of like, you have to do these things this way.
Just most more, like I'm gonna do this, my way, you know, and that comma, and that's okay.
Period and that was very freeing for me.
8:37
And so I think those guys embody a lot of those traits.
A really interesting thing that I that I read was a lot of us, make Heroes out of our own deficiencies.
And so like the people that we look up to are the people that embody things that we wish we had.
And so, it's like being mindful of who you look up to is a great exercise and self-reflection it's like why do I look up to these people?
8:56
And it's probably because on some level like I feel the most pressure of not being me, right?
And so like the pressures around like I mean I My almost was in hardcore religious person.
Like, I am very, you know, honestly, susceptible like I am swayed by those things.
And so making the decision to choose, not to do that despite basically walking away from a community and all that stuff was very hard.
9:19
But if they'll write to me and so I feel confident in the decision, who do you look up to Jack?
Yeah, you grin all I would say probably mainly just my parents big Idols of mine.
Interesting.
Is it?
9:35
Yeah, I mean that's I think that's interesting.
I think a lot of people look up to their parents because I think they live a perfect life.
Wow I don't know, I just had, I really really admired.
They're great people, I love their philosophies and I think they're super nice charitable.
9:51
They're respectful.
Good people.
Screw it up.
They got a nice house too.
Oh, that's what it really looks the beach.
Well, you're just trying to get on Alright man, I love you.
10:06
Mom and Dad you guys the best seriously, just make sure to put me on title though.
I love you way more than my brother.
Yeah yeah it was the view.
Yeah.
It's if we're going to talk is like driving, right driveway, nice.
10:23
Good job.
We're talking like big figures, right bones?
Yeah.
The the house the house is good for us.
I would say, I guess like, I really look.
I like Elon Musk.
I don't want.
Be one of those people that's just like a classic person that just like idolizes Elon Musk, but he's pretty awesome.
10:41
It's like saying LeBrons.
Not a good basketball because everyone says LeBron took about it's like doesn't like that's why I had no problem admitting that ideas like a marble.
Bit more people admit.
It has nothing to do with his Excellence.
Yeah.
Right.
It's hard for me to look up to people that I don't know.
Super welfare.
10:57
I suppose like a easier.
If I know someone throwing through like anytime I Picture People I admire it's mostly the first things that come to mind are people that I'm familiar with, you know, that's really interesting because I think it's like for me like the entrepreneurial career path that I went on and went from having mentors to Heroes.
11:14
It's a mentors or people who like at least is that if I'm the of close proximity to kind of speak into your life and I think is as you continue to like say level up and I say that Loosely within the material success world, that's all I'm saying.
There were fewer and fewer people in my close proximity that.
I was like, I look up to you because I feel like I've are very kind of hit some of the these check marks and So I think that you end up moving up to like Finding Your Heroes and then that's like Charlie Munger talks about this, where he has all these people, his best friends are dead because it's like Benjamin Franklin and the people that he consumed all their stuff because he they became his mentor's.
11:50
And so I think that that at least for me was a shift that I feel like has continued to reinforce itself over time is like, the people I look up to are not in my life at all, but I still consume like, I've been tremendously impacted by Warren and Charlie.
Even though I don't know them, but you're saying, like once you check those boxes of the reasons, why you looked up to these people, then you could no longer look up to them.
12:12
Now, look up to them.
But, like, try to be mindful thought of how I say this.
But like, I'll give a very quantitative example.
If I if I'm looking up to somebody for, you know, their physique or something, right?
And then I achieve the physique that I want, then it's not that I don't look up to them, but like, I don't, I don't need more like I have, I have understood the lessons.
12:34
I don't need more lessons on this path, like I get it but what if it's not something like like it's more like of a mental thing?
Like you look up to them for their life philosophies or just their overall, you stands the philosophies, you can do, he's just check that off and really.
12:51
So there's like that mean, Richard feinman talks about this where the point is not to memorize one has to understand.
It's like once you understand something, it becomes a part of you and you take it with you and you can apply in a number of scenarios.
And so if someone has something or a perspective that you don't have the goals, I'd just be to understand and say that you can take it with you.
13:07
I actually really like that answer because I can relate a lot to that.
Because when I look at people, like when I watched people, for example, on YouTube, when I was learning you, let's say photography.
I didn't want to keep them as my mentor forever because then if I look up to somebody and I don't learn and I don't understand myself, then there will always be a deficit between my knowledge and their knowledge if that makes sense.
13:32
So I think it's always good to Too kind of want to understand things fully for yourself or you know, and I think there's also a sequence to knowledge.
So this is this is actually kind of interesting.
So if you think about when you learned math because it's a simple example, right?
13:48
Like first you learned like simple addition and then you learned multiplication and then when you went from your Edition teacher your with, you know, arithmetic teacher to your multiplication teacher, you are like screw my rhythmic to teacher, there was so much better stuff out there like they were teaching me Basics.
It's like will you had to learn Learn that to learn the next thing, right?
14:06
So it's not like, I poo, poo them.
It's just that, like, I no longer need that, I need something, I need the next building block, and so, I think that if you look at your life in those components of like maybe health and wealth, and relationships, and maybe, spirituality, Etc, like, you can look up to people who have an understanding of the topic that is more in-depth than your current understanding, or has an understanding that you prefer to your understanding, and then learn of them in that.
14:30
And if someone just continues to have a more and more in-depth understanding of it, which is why I think, Like the higher up you go in terms of like the people that you're looking at the deeper, their knowledge is on the subject which gives you a longer period of time to continue to look up them.
Right?
And so which is why it's natural that a lot of many people share the big public Heroes because those big public hearings have such a depth of knowledge compared to everyone else that they can stay public here is because a lot of people never never surpass them or never fully understand what those people understand.
14:59
But like, if you're close proximity, you assimilate the lessons and knowledge isn't Knowledge perspective from them, then like you expand your circle?
It seems from the outside that you've already kind of like optimized everything.
I don't want to say, you're set in your ways but you you're confident in what you believe and what's optimal this point?
15:22
What can you work on it?
What's your biggest insecurity who to go on?
Let me not your hairline, certainly not.
Oh man my biggest insecurity.
15:38
It's probably the Dual sided coin of ego and validation from others.
I still am sensitive to the fact that like I know that it still drives me and I don't like that it does.
And so it's just like, you know, just consistently trying to just peel back the amount that it influences, my decision-making processes, you know, like the simple example is the content example to make a video.
16:01
You think it's awesome.
People think it sucks.
And there's like, two sides.
That one is like you.
To serve a market place.
So you have to understand that part of it, but the other part of is, like, do I now suck, right?
Which is like, am I taking the performance of the thing and then, you know, projecting it on myself and I think that I still have a tendency to do that more than I would die.
16:17
Be happy.
You know, like I would prefer to not do that.
I prefer to take the feedback objectively as it is and have 0% reflect back on me.
But I don't, I'm not at 0% and so I think that's probably my my biggest insecurity is is The validation from others piece, I think significantly better at it than I was.
16:39
But I think it's still something that I want to work on.
Who do you seek validation from?
Oh, it's just like the unwashed, you know?
Just the masses overall.
Yeah.
And as a quick rewind on the point that you were making earlier like I think I've inherited a lot of the character traits not inherited.
But like actively try to ascribe to a lot of character traits like Charlie Munger and and Warren Buffett.
16:59
And I think a lot of that is because like when I look at old people they have really good perspectives on things and most of them.
Don't care about most things because they realize that life is short.
And so, I'm trying to live my life as an old band for a longer period of time rather than waiting until I'm 70 to realize that it doesn't matter.
17:14
And I'm going to die.
It's just that.
I think, once people get older and their death is looming, their priorities become much clearer.
And the the I think in entities is the right word and entities of Life become irrelevant Rises like who cares?
Like that doesn't matter.
17:30
I'd like because life is literally too short for them like they literally Have time for that.
And so trying to kind of project that into the present and trying to use an old man's Wisdom, in a young man's life is kind of my goal, but then what about a skill or something that you will work on that?
17:48
You don't yet, have, I feel like.
So I talked about this on my channel a lot.
But there's, there's there's three things that limit limit an entrepreneur rather skills.
There's character traits and there's beliefs.
And so, the beliefs are some of the hardest ones because you're not aware of them because Cuz you believe them, right?
18:05
We questioned all of our beliefs, except for those, that we truly believe in those who never think to question, right?
And so, those are the three things in terms of improvement.
So it's not necessarily just skills.
It's also like traits and beliefs.
I think that from a skill perspective.
When I look at like Leverage a vehicle.
I don't, I don't do.
18:22
I don't feel comfortable raising funds from other people.
That would probably be the next natural.
The next natural piece to my business career would be having some sort of fun structure for like The Investments that we're doing because we're obviously getting very good Returns on them.
18:38
I just there's part of me that I can see the value in the fund structure and having, you know, helping other people participate in SLO, you know, allowing us to do more deals but your bills Etc.
But there's a certain amount of autonomy that I, that I enjoy having not reporting to anyone.
18:55
And so I wouldn't want the investors to become a new boss because that, I know I would not like.
And so I'd have to structure the right way, was I think that is, that is probably a skilled efficiency that I currently have at least a depth understanding of capital markets from, like the fundraising side, that's probably the skill that I need to work on the most in the probably three to five-year Horizon real quick guys.
19:17
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this pocket.
19:34
That you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Alex, you should ask some questions.
Yeah, someone's you disagree with about what I said?
Alex?
Yeah.
Do you want me to disagree with more of your points?
19:51
Oh my God.
Yeah sure.
I don't know because I don't think what this give us give us some some either issues problems or things in your life.
Alex that you want to work on or that you want to improve my whole way.
We didn't problems and stuff.
We didn't do any of that.
Oh, let's talk about that.
20:06
You know what, G dad's is a problem in my life.
Let's talk about that.
So, as you guys can tell by looking at me, you know, I'm not the The peak of physical fitness, okay?
But that is definitely a problem in my life, that I think that I've neglected, and I think that I could definitely use like a lot of work on, and there's a lot of aspects to it.
20:27
But Alex, how do you do it to just conquer?
Because I mean, look at you, man.
You drink.
It's true.
I know this is a, the job on his like, is that a tighter shirt tho?
I just worked out this morning and I'm thinking the same thing.
20:43
It's incredible.
Thanks man.
I appreciate yeah, that's what I do it for this for that validation.
If he would just, he would rip it.
Yeah, it's stretchy.
That's the key, right?
That's the K.
So this is, this is a good question because I mean, I did this, I dedicated the first half of my professional career to this, and I would say that the nice thing is that the fitness we lost thing is a question that that has a lot of roots that can apply to other things.
21:07
It can apply to personal finance again, apply to Fitness and apply to marriage, like the concept of how you fix it, or the same.
And so I would ask you a In back which is Alex.
What do you think you should do?
What if you wanted to be better than you are right now?
What would you do if it would regards to Fitness?
21:23
Sure.
I already know what to do, I guess, right?
Yeah.
And so so the real question is now, what do I need to do?
You already know what to do?
Question is, why aren't you doing it?
Yeah.
So how do I answer that question?
Because I mean like, I was talking to Grandma about this the other day and I'm gonna get a really personal here guy.
21:43
Yeah, you know, I told Graham that at the weight that I met and luckily, I'm comfortable to talk about this, so please don't pulled back and I might be putting myself in a box here and I hate to do this, but I'm speaking openly.
I feel like, at my way you don't get to my weight by having like a small problem, right?
22:01
I think there's some sort of like emotional problem whether it's like, like something like a either another addiction to food, or like some sort of like, how much, how much, how much do you weigh right now, if you're comfortable?
Beside ask a better question.
Okay, why aren't you two hundred pounds heavier?
22:20
Probably because I can't eat that much.
So you do know how to stop.
Yes, I believe.
Right.
So here's what's interesting.
You do know how to stop.
It's just that you're stopping.
You don't have an issue.
You just stop at the wrong point.
So it's like I can't stop it.
You can't stop because otherwise, you'd be 200 pounds heavier.
22:37
Can you explain that a little more?
So, a lot of people were like, I have an issue.
You know, Ben Jeanne.
I can't stop eating once I started cetera.
It's like, okay.
Well then why aren't you twice as big?
Well, I can't eat that much cool.
Okay, so you do know how to stop.
22:53
We just need to shift when you stop, right?
But that's like, again, this only to break that belief.
The real real is, is becoming rather than thinking about the doing, right?
So you've probably heard the be do have right?
Like, you have to be a certain type like habits and how we create our identities are self-reinforcing right, we do certain things and because we do those things we Believe certain things about ourselves, right?
23:15
And because we believe certain things about ourselves.
We do certain things, right?
And so it's a, it's a constant reinforcement Loop.
And so like one of The Tell-Tale signs of someone who's not going to be successful is like, I'm trying to lose weight.
It's like no, that's not because like they've already identified themselves as somebody who's not going to lose weight and so there, we just need to wait for them to fail, right?
23:32
Because they're already there to you're saying this is outside myself.
I have to push myself to get there rather than thinking like I'm I want to become a healthy person.
And so when you are confronting the many Hundreds of decisions that you have every day rather than trying to Zone in, on the super tactical of like, I have to weigh this.
23:50
And I have to count this and whatever.
It's just simply like, what would a healthy person do and the scenario?
Like, at every point just like what a healthy person do.
It's like they would do this.
Like okay.
And the thing is is like you're not trying to be necessarily, right?
Just want to be less wrong than you are right now.
Yeah, that makes sense.
24:05
I think maybe that's where I kind of had a Dom fall because there was a point where I did commit to To weight loss.
And I me dye my head, I guess I wasn't right.
But in my head, I committed that, you know, this is a lifestyle change, right?
24:23
It's with me for the whole life and I lost 45 pounds which, you know, for me that was a lot.
But for some reason, and it was all that was in my head like every day when I would wake up, you know, I would be, it would be like, a conscious, like choice of, like, what I was eating, but, you know, and but that, but the thing is it Came.
24:46
So I don't want to say, I don't know if it was toxic, but it became so tired.
I'm going to use the word toxic that.
Like, that's all I thought about in my head and I don't know how to go back there without doing that again, because it was so that part was so detrimental to my health, but obviously, so is eating, so, mmm.
25:06
Yeah, they're both dead.
But the thing is, is like, I think you can take us season.
And not project it for ever, right?
So it's just for now you will have this kind of obsession around eating food and that's okay because you're making a behavior change, right?
25:23
Like it's good that it's at the front of your minds like that is, what is creating the change after you do that for a year or two years or three years, it will stop being as important because you'll do it without thinking about it.
And then it's not going to be a thing.
But most people who have like really exceptional physiques, we're obsessed with it for a of time.
25:40
Most people have exceptional marriages were except obsessed with the fruit for a time.
People have really good.
Finances were obsessed with it for a period of time and then there's just so many things that like you don't even think about or like well of course I use whatever.
You know apps use.
Like of course, I don't go out too.
I don't get appetizers.
When we got, of course, I don't buy name brands that like, it's just obviously, but when in the beginning, you have to put active attention because it's not normal.
26:02
What the goal is, just to get the activities that you're doing to become kind of unconscious competence, which is like you're doing them without thinking about them.
So they don't actually take well power because just how you've always done it but you have to get through the part where it's Not how you've always done it and so you have to allocate more attention to it.
I don't like judging yourself on the fact that it was quote.
26:20
Obsessive is like, so I but I think it's the toxic meant.
It's the mentality now, it's right.
So why was that?
Why was that toxic for you?
Well like what made that?
That impactful like it was literally distracting me from my work.
26:35
Like I would sit there and I would be working and all I can think about was like okay like at 5 p.m.
I'm like I obsess.
But numbers like I knew like and this is good, I think it's important to know this like I knew how many meals are how much count, how many calories the next meal, I was eating at what time my comedy calories.
26:56
I have left for the day because I was so focused on trying to be in a caloric deficit which is obviously like the key to losing weight but like I would be working and I would just think about it and then it would like pull me out of my work and you know, like like Alex said, I mean maybe it was a good thing but and then eventually of it just, you know, I stopped following what I was doing, which I in hindsight obviously I wish I didn't but it that's why I became I think a problem for me Graham.
27:30
But yeah Alex wouldn't you say it's better this Alex to find the root cause of the issue like to go deeper and say this is why I you know I'm eating a certain way this is what maybe Pause did and solving that underlying issue would kind of help everything else rather than just focus on the surface level calories in calories out.
27:51
Yeah, I hear what I hear what you're saying with the question.
I think a lot of us because if we have a big problem, we want to find a big root cause and sometimes it's not.
And I think that we have to give ourselves permission for, like, maybe just food taste good and like, we're evolutionarily designed to, like, have a super stimuli, when something is salty and fatty and sweet at the same time.
28:12
And so, we've gotten very good at pushing around.
Buttons.
And so like just saying like, yeah this is not because like in some ways it becomes this like huge Beast that I have to defeat.
When we sit like this, this one huge emotional issue and I had my kid, my parents, and when I was kid, I would eat ice cream and that's how I feel.
Good.
Well like you tell yourself these stories but I don't know how useful it is because then it just it just exaggerate the size of the problem rather than just saying like I am going to be a healthy person and make decisions that are in accordance with that and a healthy person.
28:42
If they ate out ones wouldn't be Oh, I guess I'm not a healthy person anymore.
They would just do better, you know, they would just go back to normal the next day and so like, you can start whenever as long as you start changing, how you identify yourself?
I think that's just like, that's the root of this stuff is like, how do you identify yourself and then you act in accordance with that identity.
29:02
Like if you are always like, I've just always struggled with my weight.
Well, that's what you identify with and so you're just going to reinforce that identity.
So we have to switch that there's a great book on this.
James Clear talks, its Atomic habits, really good but But you're going to live in accordance with that and so you have to stop saying, like, you have to stop identifying with the things that are not serving you.
29:21
I, I mean, I agree.
I just, I don't know what to say what's holding you back?
Alex gosh, we're going deep.
Um, I really don't know, to be honest with you.
I wouldn't you start today.
There's no reason so we could do that.
I mean, there's nothing.
29:37
But there was nothing holding me back yesterday, or the day before, which is a decision.
Yeah, exactly.
So you can make the decision whatever you want.
Yes, but it's a I think it's a hard decision, I guess.
Why wouldn't you do today?
There's literally no reason.
Well there is a reason because you're not doing it, so why wouldn't you do it while you're not doing this right now?
29:56
Because I think there's literally no reason.
Well that maybe there is like you said by there's none that I can think of I think.
Yeah.
I think the reason would be that Alex feels like he could do it at any time.
So why start today?
Because it's I think it's easier to start next week or the week after and I know this because I'm very much the same know what it's like Yeah, I agree with that because I feel like it's my choice.
30:18
But then that's so stupid because when I'm not sitting here I'm like, well, I also had the choice to started a year ago, right?
So isn't it, doesn't it get to the point where all of a sudden, the pain exceeds, the the pleasure?
And I don't think Alex has gotten to a point yet where it's painful, it's may be uncomfortable, but I think starting now is more uncomfortable than just, you might have to get bigger, what?
30:43
Yeah, you might have to go, God to get there like is I mean, the theme of the day, like you just have to hit you, or your version of Rock Bottom, you know, me for me, like my version Rock Bottom's, like, 15% body fat and so, like, for me, I'm like, like, what am I doing?
Like, I look at myself and I'm like, just do Pieces.
31:00
Come on, don't eat like an asshole, you know, and I got my shit together.
And so, like, the only difference like between how people look is just where they draw the line where they feel like an asshole.
I can't sit.
Like, all you're doing is just like saying, you know, like I feel like an asshole, if I have of, you know, 10% Of body fat.
There's some people who live there, there's some people were like that, Linus, 20% that line is 30%.
31:19
But what's crazy is that?
Like once you find maintenance, you just maintain the same way.
So it's like, for me, I just think, like, why would you not maintain it good rather than maintaining at normal because, like all you have to do is get there once and then you just maintain it.
So, anyways, that's, you know, Alex is perspective, but that's also because I came from somebody who really wanted outside validation.
31:37
And so the easiest and first place to start for me was my body.
So I started lifting those 13 years old.
So I'm like almost 20 years in this game in terms of like the lifting And and health and stuff.
And so for me this is not like we had.
We talked about at dinner last night, it's like this is not in any way time consuming for me mentally because like, I am a healthy person and I do these things because that is who I am and so it's not very difficult for me.
31:58
It's just difficult for people to make the change and I know that what you're saying, which is the, you know, when change occurs when staying the same exceeds, the pain of change, right?
And so it's like if your current existence hurts more than the discomfort that you will go through, then you will go through the new discomfort to get out of the current pain, right?
32:15
There's a million ways you can do it.
And that's why when you say like the root issue is like there's lots of tiny choose in Alex's environment.
That reinforce the current behavior is not one thing.
It's like, what's in the pantry, as soon as he walks in the door, like just like all of these tiny little things.
So like you can change someone's environment.
And I'll tell you if an interesting one that I actually read into includes book.
32:32
But so heroines very hard to get off of.
And that's a statement of belief, but I'll just, just bear with me in Vietnam.
I think it was 15%.
And then later, they thought it was 20%.
Of guys who went there.
Tried heroin Insane.
32:49
Like that's an insane statistic and what was interesting about that is that when those Vietnamese now became veterans and came back, 90% of them, never did it again.
And the reverse statistic is true of like us based addiction programs, right?
33:09
90% of people do heroin again after they leave the program.
So how can you have the most addictive substance, right?
And you've got a 90% success rate in One incident and then you've got like a 90% failure in the other and this one just wasn't even a program in this one was right.
33:24
And so what happens is people, if you can if you can pull someone out of the environment entirely, it's actually much easier to do because it's like you hang out with certain people, right?
And they reinforce those behaviors.
You you have cues in your environment, you have associated with which reinforce the behaviors.
33:40
And so like if you really went all in on something like this and you could apply this to any type of behavior, whether it was drugs or food or whatever is like honestly just changing everything.
About your life.
And then starting scratches, like, I'm making these big changes.
I'm burning the boats, I'm being this person.
And I will make these choices as a result of this in accordance with that is sometimes the best way to do it is like clean slate, but that might sound like a lot of change and so you can also just not do any of that stuff and just eat less, but it's just tackling the big issue which is like, why you don't care?
34:12
I'd say one of the biggest things that you guys are saying, where the what is it?
The discomfort of the Iron mint is so bad that it forces change and the discomfort of going through it is easier.
I will say, I mean I've had situations where going on a plane for me, terrible experience, right?
34:32
I mean, you know, just stuff like my, my wife probably wants to go parasailing.
If we go on vacation, I probably can't do that, you know?
And it's just like I feel like there's a lot of like, life that I'm missing out on and I've thought about it so deeply that.
34:47
I mean I've Right about it before.
Yeah.
But if apparently, like, it's not hard enough to change me, but I don't know if I need to hit rock bottom for, like me to make a change.
It's great.
It's a great statement because it is a good statement of belief to say, I don't need to hit rock bottom to make a change.
35:04
I agree with that.
I think that is a belief that serves you.
Yeah.
And so I just I don't know how to just click it.
Like I really don't we just start.
That's all there's no like there's nothing complex about it you just start you go home.
Um, you take away the stuff that you eat, that's not good.
35:20
That's it.
At the end of the day, you've got to be ready and we're not going to talk you into it, right?
Like if you not being able to live half of the life is not sufficient, then you got to find something that is, you know, a good friend of mine ran a super marathon and it was like, extremely difficult for him.
35:38
And he said, I think on social media who's, like I said a big bag of wise, so you didn't have one why he had to have a huge bag of just like, you just pull out.
Why after a while.
Or why after a why to keep him going through this thing.
It's like maybe you don't need one.
Why maybe need a lot of wise, you know, maybe don't have enough wise.
35:55
Do you need enough wise?
I mean at the end of the day, like this this change is yours, you know, you've got to make it and it's when it's when the reality of the condition is real for you like it breaks my heart, it really does.
I mean that like in the most sincere way, my mother was super overweight my whole life and she just recently last two years.
36:14
She's now in her 60s like my whole life.
Super overweight.
Like morbidly obese in the last two years.
And for me, that might be my, you know, an easy way for me is I don't want to live that easy.
Boom.
I don't eat like, not even a thought to me, right?
36:30
But when her physician and mind you my mother is a physician so like crazy, right?
It was only one her physician after trying, you know, she tried all these diets for whatever it was when she was like, you're not going to see your grandkids like zero percent chance.
36:45
It's not going to happen, you're not going to see him.
You're gonna die for that like There's no question and it was only in that moment that she decided to really do it and she always knew what to do eat less walk more like, it's not like it's not rocket science, right?
But for her, that was enough that whenever she was confronted with decision because you have 100 micro decisions that happen every day of my gonna take the stairs and I can take this and I'm going to walk my out to it.
37:06
I'm going to I'm going to grab this extra bag or not right?
Or whatever it is.
And so I think it's like if you have that at the root you will be able to make the change and then that will get you through the discomfort phase so that That you can change your identity and I love this again.
I read this in the atomic House book, which really good.
37:22
But if you look at identity, it's the root of two words, you've got entity, there's the Latin version of it basically being.
And then you've identified like identical, right, which is repeated.
And so, like identity is literally, repeated being is what we repeatedly do is, we are like, when you describe somebody, you're like, he's the person who explains, he's right?
37:41
Like, that's their, that's how we even describe identities.
What people do.
And so, the nice thing is that you don't win the Vote of identity.
All at once, it's just one voted a time.
And the beautiful thing is that you can just be like 51 percent, just like a vote.
Like if you just do a little more you win, you have to be perfect.
37:59
You have to do more, then you do bad.
And if you do that for a long enough period of time, like it will continue to reinforce itself.
It's a lot of people have a binary vision of like, what, quote perfect health style them looks like and it's silly and it's a farce and it'd be like, trying to pretend like you're gonna be perfect humorous.
Not going to happen, right?
38:15
But like, you could also read redefine Healthy is just somebody who like just doesn't bench, you know.
I mean, you're like, just like you already know the stuff, so I guess there's no point even getting in the tactics of this because it's just Behavior change.
And so I as I probably went to Too Deep on that, but it breaks my heart but it has to break your heart.
38:32
Yeah, I think for me.
Okay, so I yeah, some people have different reasons for why they're not currently doing it right for me, I have the knowledge, right?
I research into what I have to do, but blah, I'm like in my head to be honest.
I'm ready to make the change The one thing I think that is holding me back, the more I think about it is the feeling of like, I don't know how to describe it other than like imposter syndrome, right?
38:57
Like what really and maybe this is just kind of stemming from like confidence issues.
What really makes me think that I can do this.
Like and I think that that is what like is my biggest hurdle probably.
And I don't know how to overcome that.
39:13
Here's something cool.
You don't need to be confident to do this because your college don't care if you're confident, yeah.
But for, you know, Cal don't care if I'm confident or you're confident anyone's gonna finish college, do not care.
No, I understand.
No, I understand that.
But like, I mean, in my head, I need to be like confident about it to follow deadly malice favorably.
39:31
So why try to fail?
Hmm.
But it's one of those things where you can't let the past burn, you twice, right?
Which is like if you felt in the past, if you project that failure into the present then that that past failure continues to repeat itself by you.
Don't even trying.
It's like, we're looking at a kid who's who's walking, right?
39:47
And they For we're not like, think it's just going to be a crawler, you know, we don't say that, right?
But like, right now, you're applying that same like you say so much worse things to yourself when it's like if you fail.
So what it's like, it's a, it's a process.
40:03
You're going to learn to walk.
You'll learn to walk eventually as long as you don't stop.
That's true.
So basically what you're saying is if I'm not trying and failing like if I even if I'm like trying and failing it basically, it's better than just sitting here.
And being like well I'm not going to start because I'm gonna fail and just like so we'll get always say this.
40:23
When we say yes, you're going to fail.
Expect failure, it's like starting a business.
Of course you're going to fail.
That is part of the game, but saying that you stop doing something versus failing or very two, very different things.
If you eat a pizza one day, right?
But then the other rest of the week you're fine.
40:40
Did you fail?
No, right.
So it's like, we just need to read it.
Like it's we just need to strip away the Perfection and get to Like, if I eat directionally moving this way over a long enough period of time, I will get there as long as I don't.
Stop that was great.
40:55
Yeah, that was no, I'm good point.
Yeah.
You're everything that you're saying is is great.
I mean, it's for some reason it's just stuff that like, I don't not stink about, I don't, I don't think about it, I to be free, you'd have to pull this thread and I don't necessarily know that we have the time to do it on this podcast.
41:14
But like you have to figure out why your gut instinct was to say, Say eating healthy was bad.
Like that's basically like if I were to make this boil this down into simple terms, you're like I started eating healthy and I decided it was bad.
So it's figuring out.
Why you made that experience bad in your head and figure out like, because there's probably other things that eating does for you.
41:36
It probably relieves stress, right?
So it's like, great, give a nice thing is that there's lots of cues for stress in our lives.
So you have a number of cues that trigger the behavior.
So it's not just one, it's like you can get Resilient things.
And then have a really easy because like, like habits are created for, like, mental shortcut, so we don't have to make decisions and so it's like, I feel stress.
41:55
I can resolve this immediately with this thing.
I don't even think about it.
You're just starting to walk towards the fridge when you feel stressed, right?
And so to break this like man, we're gonna get way too deep into Behavior stuff.
So I'll just, I'll cut it at this which is you got to figure out why you not?
Why you didn't start yesterday.
And there's a reason that you have and you need to name the reason and it may be ridiculous.
42:16
Like some people are like Like it's just not convenient, cool.
Then make it convenient and then all of a sudden like it sometimes.
It's the tiniest thing I'll tell you this tiny example, which is I try and put face cream on every night before I go to bed.
It's like one of the habits that I really was like, I'm going to try and do this, right?
And when are The Maids, come sighs?
42:33
That's ridiculous.
When the Maids come to clean our place, I have like my bedside setup and then they take all my stuff that's like, right next to me.
And then they like move it along the back line of the bedside table.
So, like the creams, like, over a box and like, it's hard to reach And one of my bed, I can't reach it and after that, and I had to realize it because I was like, I'd get on a good routine and then like two or three days in, I would stop doing it and then I realized the only reason I stopped doing it was because I didn't see the cream and if I did remember the cream it was like I would have to get out of bed to go, grab it and then put it back.
43:06
And so I had to tell the maids leave them along the side and don't move them.
It's the tiny like these tiny things.
Just like I had a visual cue and it made it more difficult.
So I remove the visual cue because it was further away and then it got Harder rather than making it easier and making it obvious.
I think I have an answer for you actually.
43:22
Okay.
So the only reason that I thought about food all day in my quote unquote, a sea view is because I was hungry.
Yeah.
This time student.
You're not, you're not, you're bored.
If you could eat a chicken breast, like it's like, if you're like, oh man, I could go for a chicken breast, you're hungry.
43:42
If you're like, oh I could like go for a snack, you're bored.
I don't know, it felt Like hunger.
But yeah.
Of course, you don't know the difference.
Yeah, I don't know the difference, I don't know the difference.
You learn the difference.
When you're really hungry, you're like chicken.
Sounds great, like an apple sounds delicious.
43:58
You know what I mean?
But like when you're when you're bored.
You're like, man, I could go for some chips.
Are, I mean, like if you could go for a chicken breast that's dry with no sauce?
That's when you're hungry.
I think, I think you're 100%.
You probably haven't, you know, I think about it, guys.
I know this sounds.
44:13
So you're right.
It sounds stupid.
It sounds so stupid.
I think put like, In my head, right?
Until you said that, I was convinced that I was hungry all the time, but now that you said that, I don't think I was hungry and I know that sounds stupid.
44:29
You guys are like, probably from you guys are probably laughing every.
I swear to God, I swear to whatever you believe in.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Most of the times where I'm only little snack.
It's, you know, that Dead Space where you would normally reach for your phone.
It's like, well, I may as well just need a quick snack.
44:46
Now, if you haven't been hungry in years, So you don't know what hunger term is say about that.
I'm saying that you've been overfeeding for a very long period of time and so you were there you're such a surplus that the end and and stores that your body can take from for a very long period of time.
45:02
Yeah, I agree with you.
I think I just had like an epiphany.
I think I don't know.
This is so crazy.
I think I don't know the difference to be doing being hungry and being bored bored.
I know that sounds stupid.
45:18
Oh, it's fine.
I should very few people know the difference between Justin me Anna.
Yeah.
You're pretty Physically Active.
Yeah, I've been going to the gym quite a lot but I always caught my default is probably eating healthy but until I've started tracking calories I've realized that I've eaten more than I've expected but my default is still eat healthy, eat small portions but without tracking it I eat more than I think I do.
45:52
I just want to thank you for your time.
I didn't mean to bring you on the podcast and like bombard you with my physical physique.
Jeans or anything, but I'm sure there are other people who are listening who are deal.
You could replace this with alcohol, you can replace this with, you know, whatever.
It's the same thing.
46:08
My mind is just blown right now.
Like, I feel like, now I feel like I could do it and I just want to just reinforce this one point, which is just because you are hungry, does not mean you need to eat.
So you used being hungry as a justification for eating, you can be hungry and not eat.
46:23
You can be horny and not have sex with me is not your wife.
So just because you have a feeling, doesn't mean you need to take action on it, right?
So first, we had to delineate between the fact that most of time, you're bored and not actually hungry, but even if you are hungry, that doesn't give you permission to then.
Go eat.
Because if you diet, you will be hungry actually.
46:42
And a chicken breast will sound good.
So it doesn't necessarily mean that you have permission to eat outside of what you think you need to hit for your, for your calorie intake.
Is it just like a mental thing at that point.
Like I you already know the calories stuff, there's no point in getting into that.
Like you're like, if you really want to do it, you already know you Google it, you know, you need you less than you are right now and you would just do that.
46:58
So because you just reminding yourself that like you, you know, how much you're supposed to eat and just say I have enough to live.
It's just my body telling them you could you could right now, literally drink water and take a multivitamin for a year and be there's no Oh way, I promise you.
They've already done studies on this.
47:15
You can absolutely do it.
I mean, I'm not going to, but that's fine.
Yeah.
But I'm saying like you have more than enough stores, the last, you for a very long time.
So, like the only thing you're doing to eat is just like you're just moving things through your system, but like, that's it, they've done starvation studies and like your basal metabolic rate goes down.
47:30
But not by, I mean, it goes down by 30%, which is something, but it's not massive, and you're still going to have a high Biz metabolic rate overall, because you have more of you to feed and maintain like fat, Calories to keep alive.
Like you have that on you, but it still requires blood and nutrients to stay alive, right?
47:49
To like not be, you know, become dead tissue.
So, like, in a lot of ways, it's easiest to lose weight when you are bigger.
So you can keep saying that, as your as your refrain, it's like, I am bigger, which means it's should be easier for me to lose weight because it is yeah, I don't want to lead her on this tier good too long because I think we've gone on long enough.
48:07
If II seriously, I will come on.
Thank you.
I owe you big time.
Today the day Alex, I think so.
But I think yeah.
Yes or no.
Yes it is.
He kind of scared me with the like you're going to be real hungry.
48:25
I'm just like, oh but you know what?
I'm I think I've just been eating his I'm bored and I know people are going to think this is stupid.
Like Alex, of course, you're eating, when you were word but to me, I'm telling you, guys, like, I truly felt hungry.
Like, in my head, that was hunger.
And I thinking back I do. - yeah, I don't distract yourself, and that was kind of stupid.
48:44
So how much do you shouldn't be bored at work?
That's the real issue, but we'll talk about that after the podcast.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
No, you bet?
Yeah, it's a blast to have you on man.
49:01
Really should.
I was really looking forward to this.
Yeah.
Then even going out to dinner last night and I didn't, like, I genuinely enjoy hanging out but it's listening to you two.
Talk.
It's I learned so much and more than just like, like just like a friendship but also just the fact that like, I feel like I am like the student of so many things and like do just being exposed to different thoughts and a different way of thinking and a different structure is very few podcasts afterwards.
49:35
Do I just like just want to be alone.
This is always one of them because I have so much to think about Still we after we end this, I appreciate it.
And thank you guys for having me on.
I think it's chunking down and chunking up in terms of like thought process.
Just like why are we doing this?
49:52
And I think that's just been the core of.
It's just like why am I bothering to do this?
Why does this matter?
And so you know it does go back to my world view.
It is the seed that kind of like has borne all the fruit of the other things that I have.
It's just like, why am I choosing to like?
50:07
Because it is an active choice.
And and so, you know, I'm glad that the thoughts that I've had have been at least thought-provoking because they took me a long period of time to figure out on my own and I think they're know they can be unique to different people but for me that this set of beliefs has served me.
50:23
Well yeah.
And so I continue to believe them.
Thank you for coming on and nice time.
Appreciate it.
Thank you guys.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
If you want to be smarter, you can actually really make yourself smarter by simply doing things differently, by taking action, by changing your behavior.
And So the faster you change your behavior speed of change.
The smarter, you are welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:46
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished facing this musk and Buffett had documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please, share and enjoy.
I pulled my audience and 76% of you want to start a business.
It have it.
Most of the other stuff I make is for people who are trying to go from million to 10 million, 10 million, 100 million etcetera.
1:04
But today is dedicated, you guys.
And the spirit of this is because I went to dinner with eight twenty year olds who are in their senior year college, and they told me six months earlier that they all wanted to start businesses.
And six months later, I had dinner with them and I was like, hey, where we have those businesses and they're like, oh, you know, I'm getting my loc set up and I was like, that's not a step that takes five seconds in a hundred bucks on LegalZoom.
1:23
Like, what are you talking?
What did you do?
Last six months.
The answer is they didn't do anything.
All right?
And so what I want to do is actually break down what you need to do in order.
In order to start the business and make money.
And the good news is, it's easier than you think.
So, if you boil everything down to First principles of, what do I have to do to make money one, you have to have an entity set up what you can do on LegalZoom for 100 bucks.
1:42
All right, you wait, two weeks, they send you the paperwork.
Congrats, take paperwork.
Go to big say big, I would like a bank account.
Baking out, says, here here's bank account.
They give you checks.
They give you a credit card, and they give you an account number fantastic.
Now, take that go to payment processor.
Sign up for payment processors that you can collect money.
1:59
Once you have Those things, you are now officially able to transact.
Now, all you have to do is sell something to someone now, where people get stuck is what's the thing and who do I sell it to?
So, I'm going to give you the fastest track way to do that today.
So they're only six things that you can sell.
2:15
Anyone number one is a product.
Each of these have digital and physical versions of them, you can sell a physical product, which is stuff you get in the mail or can sell digital products like a PDF, all right.
The second thing you do is sell Services if you sell Services.
That's like doing a massage a digital service to be like software as A service.
2:30
That's a digital version of work that somebody would otherwise do the third thing.
You can sell is access so you can sell physical access to something like when you rent an apartment that's physical access to something.
Or if you sell concert tickets, it's physical access to something, right?
Or digital access to something.
2:45
That's where like you have rooms or you have experiences or whatever.
The next thing you can sell is risk, you have Digital Risk and you have physical risk due to risk is like Cyber attack.
Physical risk is like Insurance on a building.
You can buy and sell money.
That's what banks do when they loan.
After selling, you money, and you're buying money at a premium and there's digital physical versions of that because you have actual money that you have cryptocurrencies etcetera, can also bind some media digital versions of media, which is like something like this or physical versions of media which people forget about like books and newspapers.
3:16
Those are physical media, everything else falls into buckets of those things.
And so when people are like but okay, that's a lot of stuff.
What do I do?
My easiest piece of advice is to look at your past and figure out the things that, you know, A little bit more about.
So because of the people that you are friends with because of what your parents do, there are some industries that you may know a little bit more about like if your dad was a mechanic, you probably know more about cars than I do, right?
3:39
Both of my parents were eye doctors.
So I know all the parts of the eye and a bunch of stuff about eyes that no one really care about.
And I don't really even care about it, but I know it just through osmosis because I spend my whole life with them.
So there are things that, you know, that you don't even know that, you know, and I could probably tell you problems that people around me are experiencing every day.
3:54
And I'll bet you if you took some time you could solve for them.
So Step One is try and find someone.
Can provide value to that's what value is solving a problem.
The next thing you do is you're like well how do I get them to give me money in the beginning?
I recommend not trying to ask them to give you money, but I actually recommend you solve it for free solve the first 5, 10, even 20 people for free and there's a number of reasons for that one is because you probably suck, as you've never done this before.
4:17
So, it's probably better to not get people's money because in the probably be upset about so offer to work for free and more people would take you up on it.
And if someone doesn't take you up on working for free, ask them why?
Because the reasons they won't take you up on it.
Are called hidden.
Costs those are the costs in excess of the money that you would otherwise charge.
4:33
That's a reason somebody doesn't want to buy and so if you can't identify the hidden cost, then you can start solving those ahead of time.
And then ultimately make the thing you sell later, much more valuable.
So once you start working with these people to solve their problems, you'll start getting feedback from them about what to do to make it better.
4:49
Now, after a certain period of time, there's three benefits you get from.
This one is, you'll actually start to learn the skill, which is by far the biggest benefit of doing it this way.
Number two is, it's easier.
To ask people to do something for free because you're not asking for much.
Number three is that those people will a either leave you a testimonial, which you can then leverage to show.
5:10
Other people that you're good at your thing, or they will become paying customers themselves if you just ask them to because if you solve the problem well enough on a consistent basis, they'll ask you to do it again.
And at some point you can say, hey, I actually have too many free customers.
Like I have to start charging because I don't have enough time.
5:26
And what you just did was you artificially created or in a real way created Or demand for your time then you have Supply.
Now, you can ascribe a price to it while also getting good.
And then finally those people.
So subsection 3 of why it's good for you to work for them for free, is that those people can also send you friends and you could say hey I'll do this for free in exchange for two things.
5:45
One that you leave me testimonial into that.
You least give me the idea of a friend who might be also benefiting at this.
Now if at the end of the process they don't want to give you either of those things.
Ask them why and then say what would it take in order for you to do that?
And then go do that because it's very hard for people to die you multiple times especially If you met the terms or the conditions that they would do it on.
6:02
So now all of a sudden if we're fast forwarding here so you figured out the thing to sell.
It's one of the six, digital physical versions of those six items, you've identified, who you could solve the problem for.
It's the people that you can provide the most value to somebody who already has a problem that, you know, a little bit about because just as a side note YC has already done research on this, they prefer to invest in Founders who have experience in the industry that they're trying to solve either directly or adjacent.
6:26
And so I got into fitness because I had experience in Fitness.
So I knew a decent amount about it.
At least about the core thing.
I didn't know anything about business but I had half of itself, if you have to understand the Avatar and you have to understand the product and understand how to grow a business, that's a lot of ignorance debt.
You have to pay down and so the idea is, how much can I pay down ahead of time so I can start getting ahead and to be clear a lot of people obsess about their first business thing, it's going to be their last business, it probably won't.
6:50
If you're an entrepreneur you will start many business over your career and you will learn from the old businesses to apply to the new businesses.
And so my recommendation here is first Force Steps.
Get LLC take LLC to bank get account, go to processor, get way to process money, give away stuff for free until you have more people who are asking for your time, then you have time to give then start charging money.
7:14
That's how you do it.
And then once you do that, you start making the first dollar and the first dollar is the hardest one to make.
But once you make that one, the rest of the videos that I have here about how to take that first dollar to the millionth and hundred million and Beyond.
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
7:31
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, So if you understand how easy it is to start a business, the next questions you have to ask is why you weren't right?
7:54
Which is most of the times, the problem isn't that you don't understand how to make the business.
It's that you are afraid of doing it.
And so you have to identify what voice or what person you extrapolate in your head, who you think is going to judge you for doing this thing or rather who's going to judge you if you fail and so if you can isolate that voice and say you know what, it's not people who are going to judge me.
8:13
It's my mom and my uncle.
There's the only two voices I hear.
Then you can rephrase the question which is am I going to live?
Out their dream, or am I going to live out my own?
And ultimately, you may have to die to the identity that they keep in their minds of who you are in the path that you're going to be on versus the path that you choose to live with.
8:29
Because you can either just die for the rest of your life, living their dream, where you can die to their dream to live yours.
One of the other reasons that people don't get the business started is because they struggle with impulse control which is they cannot stay focused for a specific period of time on any task.
They are a slave to their impulses.
8:45
They want to go watch porn, they want to watch YouTube, they want us Netflix or whatever it is.
Is there they I got mentally masturbating to the idea of having a business because that's actually easier and more fun than starting a business is because starting a business is work, but you just have to decide whether you want to pretend to be a business owner and post about how you are pretending about your hustle, or you actually want to be a business owner.
9:03
And I remember the book that changed it for me was that they use this word called watch preneur and said, oh yeah, there's always people who are watching printers.
They want to be an entrepreneur and they like consuming content, they like going to the workshops, they like watching the webinars but they don't actually do anything.
And I remember at that point I had been reading books for almost a year.
9:18
We're of book after book, after book, about business, and self-help and personal development, all that stuff and I still hadn't done anything and that was when I realized that learning comes from changing behavior.
And so there's two definitions that you should know.
In order to understand how to start your business and be intelligent about it.
Intelligence is actually a speed its rate of learning, so somebody's very intelligent learns quickly.
9:38
Now, the question is, what is learning?
Learning is same condition, new Behavior.
So, if I show you a condition and you learn something, when I show you that condition, again, you change your behavior.
Now, if up to this point, you've consumed, lots of concept, you have not change your behavior, same condition, same behavior you have not learned.
9:55
We're not intelligent.
And so, if you want to be smarter, you can actually make yourself smarter by simply doing things differently, by taking action, by changing your behavior.
And So the faster you change your behavior speed of change the smarter you are.
And so people will see you from the external as being smart because of the actions you have taken and so if you can disconnect your judgment from other people worried about not start, Because you're going to live out their dreams, rather than your own, you can control your impulses so you can actually stick with it for a longer period of time and you consume information in order to take action on it.
10:28
You will start chipping away at it.
The nice thing is that if you continue to take action over a long enough period of time, you will win and you will be successful.
And a lot of people think there's a learning fallacy.
They feel like they need to learn enough to start going but the reality is you will learn more in your first hundred sales conversations than you will learn from a hundred books on sales and you can do 100 sales Relations in a month, and it'll take you years to read a hundred books on sales.
10:52
And the crazy thing is most of the books that are written about business, really?
Only makes sense.
Once you've started doing business because you actually have a latticework of experiences to hang the learnings on.
So I actually didn't read a book about sales and tight already closed for thousand bills.
I didn't even know that the world of sales training existed.
11:07
I just knew, I knew how to have conversations with people, to get them to give me money.
That's how I call it.
I didn't know whose sales, right?
And so if you want to learn the skill, the best way to do it is to just start trying to do.
Skill and you will learn so much more because to quote, Confucius, I hear.
And I forget, I see, and I remember I do, and I understand.
11:26
And so you're only going to truly understand the thing, by doing it rather than reading about it, watching about it, listening about it.
And so, the faster you can condense the time between, when you think you want to do something, and when you do it, the smarter you are because your behavior has changed.
So if you want to learn, you got to do so big decision that every entrepreneur has to make is you have to decide what type of artist you are, because entrepreneurship in my opinion is just another expression of art.
11:46
So either your art is the actual technical.
The thing that you deliver or your art is business itself and those are two very different types of people.
The artist who, for example makes really nice wallets right?
They make really high quality leather wallets that person if they continue to make better and better wallets will eventually have a point where they will have more people want their wallets then they will have time to deliver it.
12:07
That person has single choice to make.
They will either raise the price of their wallets because they believe that the wallet is their art because they love actually doing the making of the wallet, which is fine, the other version of that.
That is that they create a wallet business, which is then they start looking into Machinery.
They look into hiring and training people to replicate the same skills that they have in the wallets that they make.
12:27
They have a low-grade version and a luxury version.
They start making tears and I'm cell processes better.
Now, their art becomes business.
And so there is in my opinion, no, right.
Or wrong answer because you can make just wallet to make the best wallet in the world and be very, very wealthy.
Or you can create a business amount.
12:42
Make you all to be very, very wealthy, both of them work.
It just depends which one you enjoy most and if you're not sure, Start the one that cost you the least and then go from there because you know what you might wait like making wallets today and in two years you might be sick of making wallets at that point.
You can learn the new art form.
Start the one that cost you the least and then go from there because you know what you might wait like making wallets today and in two years you might be sick of making wallets at that point.
You can learn the new art form.

Going on, everybody happy Friday.
I want to thank you a quick video of this morning thinking about it.
One of my favorite closes that I use all the time, just kind of falls into the category of a Of / reversal, but it's probably mean if I had to think about it, if they're, this is probably the clothes that I use most frequently, when we were selling fitness programs, basically you get to the point of the sale where they're like, not necessarily in or out, but this is something that I would always just take to just like make the last, not the last push necessarily but one of the bigger pushes to get the prospect to close.
0:54
So I called the best case, worst case closed and I use it all the time.
So I feel like We'll listen best case, like let's look at best case worst case, right?
So best-case scenario, you give you an amazing shape, you become a, you know, an example for your kids, your husband looks at you differently, you like, you get into that the clothes that you have in your wardrobe, you talking about earlier, and like you fall in love with the community and you make a whole bunch of friends, right?
1:17
It's best tasting area.
I'm like, worst case scenario, you get done with the first month or your first six weeks, your first open, whatever it is, right?
And you say Alex, I think your long hair in your Stacks, look I really creepy.
P.
I don't really like your community that much.
And so then I just give you your money back, right?
1:35
And you still get all the workouts on us, okay?
So like best case scenario, we change your life forever.
Worst case scenario, you get a whole bunch of free workouts and it's on me like that's how much I believe in this program and that I believe I'm gonna be able to change your life, right?
1:50
And you're like and I was like keep going on that on that terrible night.
Angel was like kind of a confident Zeal of being like what I mean?
Like listen like think about how Something that we have to be in our product and our service to be able to make that kind of guarantee for you, right?
And so for me, I had 100% any reason satisfaction guarantee for any of the products that we sold.
2:12
And I gosh, I probably closed hundreds and hundreds of people with that.
And I think that I've only had two people ever take me up on that refund saying, you know what, I really wasn't satisfied.
And so I was always really clear.
2:30
It's for the service.
Okay, so I have 100% satisfaction guarantee.
Only service.
If you feel like you did not get the level of service that you asked, for, I'll give you the money back.
All right, so it's like you feel like you didn't get your $200 worth for this EFT.
Like I will give you the $200 back.
2:45
It is, it's your reputation matters a lot more and so I just don't want you to feel like you have anything holding you back in order to take the next step.
Because ultimately like I know by sending our fridge and could be nerfed nerve-racking or you just always scared.
So like, Let's just take that out of the way.
3:01
Best case you totally change your life horse case.
I just give you the money back and you're on your own right.
And that way, it's like it.
Overcomes the whole husband thing is, you're like, listen, you can tell your husband was a great deal, right?
Like there's nothing, there's nothing to lose and so that's that.
3:18
Best case, worst case closed.
I used all the time and it is, it is based around the concept of 100% satisfaction guarantee which if you don't have that out, I definitely recommend doing it especially for like, first months, or for like, a weight loss program that people are signing on to, for the front end.
3:36
Because it's like, I would tell people, like for our six-week challenges.
I'd say, listen, if you get 25 weeks and six days into our program and you tell me that we didn't give you the service that you pay for it.
I was like, I'll give you the money back, right?
And we just knew that we we're trying so hard to over-deliver that no one could really say that they didn't get the service.
3:55
And like I said, I only had two people take me up on it between six locations in five years.
So it's something that is really scary to say early on and I remember I just was getting really frustrated with this this lady once, who just like could not take the next step.
4:10
She was like, well what if it's not worth it or like, what?
If I don't lose weight?
It's like that.
It's like woman.
I was like, I'll give you your money back if you feel like it is not worth it, all right?
And she was like, really, I was like, yeah.
She was like, okay, no mistake day, I'll take that work really well.
4:27
And then like the next person came in, I was like, Lester, best-case scenario for And your life, worse case scenario, give your money back, right?
And then she was like, oh, and then just like one after another, just started falling down, like dominoes.
And I was like, man, I should make that a part of our program and then it starts in.
Then you tell your trainers that and tell your staff that you're like, hey we've 100% money back guarantee your satisfaction on service, all right, so like you guys need to be on point and then it's like, the thing is, is like everyone starts to like, kind of like sit up tall because they're like, yeah, like we're legit, like we put, like we put our, we put our money where our mouth is, Right?
4:57
We've seen with the best, but then, we back it up.
Up.
And I think it's super cool for the staff to hear that that you're like, you believe in them that much and it totally crushes from the Southside.
I mean, If you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world kidding.
5:20
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
5:36
All right, so please go do that now.
Then let's get back to the show.
I'm telling you, like, if you're not doing this and you don't have a risk reversal and like a satisfaction guarantee, when you're selling anything, you're just, you're missing, you're missing out.
5:52
It's it's, it's such an easy.
It's such an easy thing to make you more money.
And if you feel better and that person who just got sold that just feels at ease and they're kind of expecting like some really great service.
So like if you follow through with exactly what you said, you're going to do is actually even a stronger sale.
6:09
They're like, dang, like these guys are on point.
They said it was like money back.
Aren T and they gave it to me.
So anyways, guys, use that hook that was Val before you tag it into your sales managers or people in the post, help them out and PS or sharing more tips like this on Instagram.
6:25
I'm starting from scratch which, which is fun.
So you want to see me go from zero to a hundred thousand the next year.
Watch.
I don't show you how we do it, but anyways, lots of love, use the best case, worst case closed, risk reversals.
6:41
Work like crazy, do them and make more money and have more people.
All right?
Faster.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur, anxiety or happiness, and depression or Or being a bad husband or being money focused, or whatever.
0:35
The thing is that you claim to have a problem with I'm going to give you really the only mental framework that has ever worked for me.
Welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:50
I hope you enjoy and subscribe in this video.
I'm going to be talking to you about how to fix the character traits and deficiencies.
You have in your life.
So whether it be struggling with anxiety or happiness and depression, or being a bad husband or being money focused, or whatever.
1:12
The thing is that you claim to have a problem with, I'm going to give you really the only mental framework that has ever worked for me.
All right.
And so, if you're new to the channel, my name is Alex from Rosie.
I'm an acquisition.com to portfolio of companies is about 85 million dollars a year and I have nothing to sell you.
1:29
I make these videos.
Because candidly, I enjoy sharing some of the things that have helped us kind of get through things as we've grown our companies.
And there are a lot of people were broken.
I don't want to be one of them and so I'm going to probably piss a lot of people off in this video, I'm going to give you a heads up.
Second thing is I will be cussing in this video.
So if you have kids around, I would say you know muted or listen to it.
1:46
Another time.
Beyond that.
Let's dive in.
So I was talking to inaudible the other day and they were saying that they were having panic attacks, right?
And they were struggling with this issue.
And what I want to do is walk you through The process that I was explaining to them.
2:02
Now, at this point, they the recently the panic attacks started for this entrepreneur.
Ironically, is that they were talking to a therapist and the therapist is like, let's look at your past and dug up, you know, crap about their past.
And then they started looking at this thing.
2:18
And then they started getting, you know, anxiety, kind of remembering all these, these kind of past experiences, and whatnot.
Now, here's the thing, most therapists, and I say this with zero degree but I think most people People most therapists are humans and most humans suck at most things, especially things, they think they're good.
2:35
And so most of them are just normal people who did okay in school and now just like talking to people and don't have any fucking clue what they're doing.
All right, so here's the deal, here's the hot take what most of them will do is they will try and pull something up and say something to the extent of what do you make that mean?
2:53
What does that mean to you, right?
And the thought process behind this is, hey you have this thing, it's truly a feeling because you think that having anxiety makes you a bad person or makes you a bad entrepreneur or whatever thing that you say it has meaning right.
3:10
What do we make this mean?
All right.
That's the question.
What are you making this mean?
All right, so if you have problems and this is especially important with It could go Behavior, are reinforcing Behavior.
This is also one of the reasons that I actually do not stand for the whole day, a concept of standing up in front of people every morning and say hi, everybody.
3:27
I am an addict.
I fucking hate it.
It's literally like, owning this deficiency and incorporating it in weaving into you're constructing your identity, and you reinforce it every fucking morning.
It's Insanity to me the way to stop being addicted to something is to stop thinking about it.
3:44
Like, what does it look like to not be addictive?
Right, it looks like you just continuing to live your life, not even thinking about it.
What does it look like to not have anxiety.
It's not you doing your anti-anxiety routine in the morning and say, I suffer from anxiety or a struggle with anxiety.
3:59
It's not saying that and saying, I have to do these things.
I must I should I, I need to in order to not have anxiety because then you're thinking about anxiety, you giving xiety power.
And so, what I'm going to walk you through is the way to hold the space and own the Power that you have in your own mind outside of the thing that you were projecting the power onto.
4:21
All right, so the process that these therapists that are fucking retards will do is they will lead you through this thing where they try and transform meaning they say instead of saying it means you're a bad person.
What if we just said this is you know it's a good thing or it's not a bad thing, right.
4:38
So we try and transform meaning and I think that's like level one Elementary, you know grade school of of cognitive behavioral therapy.
Right.
I think that's great school, right?
But the thing is, and this is the problem because I've gone through the cycle which is why I'm speaking about the so passionately.
4:53
All right, and I'll tell you a quick story before I dive in.
So there was a period of time in my life where I was, very unhappy, all right?
And so I obsessed about happiness, right?
I read all the pilot positive psychology journals.
I read the books, I read the happiness equate you know me like I went through all of these things and yet after spending all of this time trying to obsess about happiness, I was no less no more happy.
5:16
Right.
And so that I thought to myself, well in one instance, I can spend lots of time and effort and be unhappy or I can spend zero time and effort and be unhappy.
Well, this one cost me less, I might as well start pursuing this.
And this is what happened.
I adopted this mentality and I will share it with you called, Fuck happiness.
5:34
All right, bear with me.
And so, what ended up happening is that I thought these thoughts and and whenever the idea of is this making me happy and all of these normal trigger thoughts of be like, I'm not happy, this isn't good, I feel Sad blah blah blah.
I would literally have this trump card that I would just pop in my head and be like fuck happiness and I keep moving right?
5:53
And so the difference between fuck happiness and let's think about how we should be grateful for things.
Is that when you say, Fuck happiness or fuck, the thing that you are struggling with fucking xiety, fuck whatever.
Is that it no longer has power because we're not trying to transform the meaning of the behavior.
6:15
We are.
Eating the meaning behind it all together.
We are transforming it into nothing into meaningless.
All right.
And so hear me out for a second.
I don't know why this is getting all spacing weird.
I've tried to fix a sink hundred times anyways.
6:31
So the reason this is so important, all right, is that when you enter these vicious reinforcing Cycles, so let's say it's like, oh God!
I'm afraid, I might have a panic attack tonight.
I don't want to have a panic attack.
You start thinking about having a panic attack, and then of course, you have a pen.
Attack, right?
6:47
Because the fear of the thing is reinforces the cycle and you can do this with anything, right?
It could be, it could be a guy with erectile dysfunction.
Like, I hope it doesn't happen.
I hope it doesn't happen.
And then it happens, right?
Because you're worried about it happening, not because the happening itself is the thing, right?
7:03
And I'm trying to use examples that purposefully people derive, shame from all right.
Because the thing is that the shame of the occurrence is the thing that gives it power.
And so if you remove the shame and bye By the way, the way to remove shame is to shed light on it so nothing can give you shame if you admit it openly think about if everyone knows the thing and you accept the thing or demon the thing meaningless.
7:32
But it no longer has powerful or view.
So, let me, let me give you an example.
So, this entrepreneur that I was talking about earlier.
They were telling me that they are having, you know, they're having anxiety attacks, that was preventing them from sleeping etcetera.
Right?
And I was like, so, They're like well you know I'm really working on it.
7:50
I was like why?
And they looked at me cross-eyed and I was like how long you been working this girl?
Like you know eight months and it was like are you less anxious than you were before?
They're like what I think a little bit and I was like, do you think you would be a little bit less anxious if you just did Jack shit and waited eight months from when you went from when you were bad until now they're like well, maybe I was like time does heal lots of wounds.
8:11
I was like, so you set all this time to get this little outcome and you could have just let time happen and probably had the same outcome, right?
Right.
I was like but let's take it one step further.
Why didn't you tell me how many bowel movements you had yesterday?
I mean, I didn't think it was relevant.
8:28
Exactly.
So why are you sharing with me that your panic attacks?
Because you think it's meaningful, you drive, meaning your brain is telling you that this is something, that is a problem.
So the thing is that the deeming of the thing, a problem is the problem and trying to change it or transform the meaning into something.
8:50
Else is in my opinion, just as bad because the way that you created the mess that you are in a vicious cycle of reinforcement, is that you found a thing.
And then you said, I will give this meaning And then he spent the rest of your time trying to transform the meeting.
9:06
When, if you want to solve the problem, the experience of having the problem solved is to not think about the problem at all.
And so what it is is actually reversing the process that created meaning to begin with which is removing meaning, all together.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
9:28
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money, you can get it by going to acquisition.com.
9:44
Forward slash leads his foe free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
I'm saying this because I've had so many things that I've struggled with in my life that I would consistently obsess about over and over and over again.
10:07
I don't want to have that happening at all.
I don't want to have that happen again and then it would happen, right?
And so in my opinion, the only way to overcome these issues is to you can you can slap the fuck happiness, concept on it, but it is to destroy the meaning of the thing itself and let it shrink into a relevance.
10:27
Most my opinion, most of the psychological problems that we deal with.
Are better dealt with not by trying to directly combat them, but by not giving them the power of our attention.
And there's a big difference here.
10:43
I'm not saying the thought of anxiety comes up, you say, oh, I don't want to think about it because then it's fear.
Fear, gives it power, shame gives it power.
It's not that it's looking at it and saying, why are you bringing this up?
This is irrelevant, this is a non-issue.
And so for the same reason that you can have noise in the background and you don't think about it, is that It's just noise.
11:04
And so what we do is we shrink the thing from being a signal that our brain deems, meaningful to noise that is in the background that we no longer ascribe meaning to all together and that is how it eventually shrinks into a relevance.
And then we only choose to allocate our attention towards, I think that we find meaningful, right?
11:23
And so what happened in my little fuck happiness?
Story is that I said, this is no longer a productive conversation.
I'd be like I'm unhappy like fuck happiness, whatever.
I'm going to keep moving and a funny thing happened.
A few years later, I looked up.
And I realized that I was significantly more happy than I was before.
11:42
Or as I prefer to say, I was significantly less unhappy which also gives less power to the thing altogether right now.
A different point that I want to bring up as I think it's equally important around this, this topic is that a lot of this This is a lot of the fear and the shame comes from perceived judgment that we have from an anonymous outside Society, right.
12:05
We have a voice or a series of voices that we believe exist that only exist in our mind that are judging us based on this behavior that we are suffering from, right.
One of the reasons that I like to own the deficiencies publicly is not because of you guys.
12:24
It's for me, I own like, for example, when I had, you know, when we were running and growing our first big business, which is the licensing business, I was always up front.
I said, I'm here to make money and the reason I said that was said that I would have no shame in making money because then if people in the future, we're going to say something like Alex is only here to make money.
12:48
I would then look at them and say and so hear me out listen to this dialogue, let's say I was attacked because the attacks that I'm saying, I'm going to portray as though is outside, but it's inside of our minds that we had talked ourselves, right?
So let's say somebody comes up to me a woman and says you're a terrible husband, right?
13:11
Most people say that there are two forms of a defense against this number one, the saying, no, no, no, I'm not a bad bad about husband, right?
And then giving all the reasons why I'm going to husband, right?
The other way to defend against, that would be to say, well, you know, being honest ones, not necessarily such a bad thing, right?
13:28
And so one is to dispute.
The other is to alter, right?
We're altering the meaning behind the thing.
The first is were combating and we're saying that we're not the thing, but still allowing the thing to have.
Meaning allowing a bad husband To be a negative connotation that we ascribe meaning to I think this is Meaningful and I it's - but meaningful and so I will say I'm not that thing or version 2 is this thing is Meaningful but I understand it and interpret differently, right?
13:55
Those are the two ways.
The second way is how most therapy works and I also think that it's bullshit and so here's door number three is that you look at the thing in the face and you say, end I think you're about husband and you're right. and, And watch them shrivel, they will be paralyzed because everything that they have exists to have a counter Force.
14:25
But if there is no counter Force for it to react to the thought process stops.
And so, if you struggle with these vicious reoccurring, consistent dialogues and at arguments in your head about, what's good and why should change and why you to be different?
14:42
Why does shouldn't be this way?
Just look at it in the eyes and second.
And I'm going to give you a really controversial example of what I think should have happened in a public scenario.
Tiger Woods. he was outed internet, manor house did or whatever it is you don't I mean he was publicly shamed for The the cheating thing right in mind.
15:07
This is not me condoning cheating.
This is me to illustrate a position of power.
And this is a public demonstration of power but you can take it in terms of how you can internally project that power on to the idea that you want to Vanquish.
All right?
15:22
And we don't Vanquish it by transforming it.
We Vanquish it by eliminating, the meaning all together, and letting it shrink into irrelevance.
So what tiger in my opinion should have done in that situation when they said you've banged all these girls And you were lying and blah blah, blah.
You should have said, yes, I'm a liar and a cheater but I'm the best fucking golf or there is next question.
15:46
What do they say?
Wouldn't you accept it?
There is no conversation and so try this.
In the next argument you have with someone a but more importantly with yourself is that if someone says, I think your X Y and Z, and you said, you're right.
16:02
Just give the power Just Just say sure you're right now.
What?
And so your point.
When your brain tells you something that you don't like or that you don't want to look at instead of trying to make it into something else.
16:25
Liking it.
Tuna relevant, observation.
Brain, why didn't you bring up that I have brown hair because it doesn't matter brain.
Why didn't you bring up honey?
Baumann's out yesterday.
This is a matter brain.
Why didn't you say?
16:40
Tell me how many, how many stairs I went up yesterday because it doesn't matter.
You don't find it meaningful.
And so, why am I now deeming?
This thing to be meaningful.
It's irrelevant to me.
It's it helps the conversation and it stops the cycle.
16:59
I say this and I know that I got passionate about this but I say this as someone who struggle with this for a very long time and so the only Psychotherapy that I was able to do was on myself and it was not through talking out all of these things and I know that a lot of people going to trigger a lot of people to say, hey, I've therapist they changed my life.
17:17
Good for you.
That's awesome.
Keep doing it.
I don't care what I'm doing is I'm trying to talk to people who have not had that or have done that and it's and it did not work for them.
All right.
And so I'm sharing the Most powerful mental model that has worked for me, which is purposefully staring at the problem and saying.
17:36
So what Your move.
And watch a Tribble and then moving on the fuck with your life.
So anyways, I love you almost a nation.
Appreciate you.
17:52
Thank you for giving me the attention that you did.
Today, I make these videos because I just, I hope that some of the lessons that that I've had that have served me conception, other people, at least in, if you're, in a darker place or you're struggling with something like anxiety or struggling with shame around some sort of activity that you have done.
18:09
I can tell you, the only way to struggle to deal with shame is to shed light on it.
Shade, shame only exists in darkness and the only way, Nothing has power is when we fight because we deem it meaningful or worth combating.
18:26
And so I think the only way to truly fight it is to not fight it at all and say it is not a fight worth having And then it will evaporate.
And so anyways my friends keeping awesome, lots of love.
I'll see you guys thought








0:00
I can guarantee you that you will be making more than people who have four year degrees.
The probably start making money by in the first year I was at Brooks house and yeah, it's seven, twenty two, twenty three year olds, at our house.
No cab one morning.
One of the guys was up early and he was like, Hey, right now, I've got a thousand extra dollars, like, where do you think I should invest it?
0:18
You know, I've got my 401k and I've got, you know, whatever stuff and it was cute.
It was so interesting to me, because like, she was looking for an investment vehicle that was going to yield him return.
I want to be very clear about this.
If you invest in the S&P 500, you know real estate things like that.
You start really early and you do it for a long period of time.
0:35
You absolutely will make money.
It is a very safe way to live life.
But the moment you start investing in kind of the asset side of stuff which is like, the S&P stocks in general, and you're not day trading, or doing that stuff because that's that's stupid.
0:51
The moment you do that is actually the moment in my belief that you're actually see seeing to want to make more income hear me out.
If you're 18 years old and you graduate high school tomorrow you are now eligible on the marketplace because you have no skills, aside your high school diploma you didn't know job fucked off the all-time, don't watch YouTube to learn stuff which not you, but just imagine in two days, You could go and become certified as a phlebotomist and go from making 750, or whatever.
1:15
The minimum wage is to what phlebotomist make at $25 an hour.
You would triple your earning capacity after two days and spending $500, if you can triple your income for the rest of your life, the $500 certification in two days.
Do you think it's worth the investment?
1:32
Probably.
And so the problem is that people think about the biggest investment as the stuff that they take their money and they put it into and I'm going to be over.
I'm going to beat right right now your ability to earn money to provide value to the marketplace and solve problems for other people is how you will be able to make money.
1:49
There's the value of the problem that you solve and what you charged for it.
The bigger that number is, the more you can charge that gap between their old problem and the solution that value is the percentage that you can take and put in your pocket as something that you have.
Now created in this and it could be a service, you could be products, it could be whatever.
2:05
Your earning capacity is going to be the thing that generates you wealth.
Do you want to be smart with your money and save it?
Absolutely.
Because that gives you way more that you can play with.
But when you're 20, even when you're 30 and in my belief, whatever age you are, I believe that you should take all of the excess money live as cheap.
2:21
As you can take, 100% of that excess money and invest it in education, that increases your earning capacity.
Because what happens is when you take that money like that phlebotomy course, right?
And you take $25 an hour or two. 2,000 hours a year.
You're now 250 thousand dollar a year income.
Cool.
If I can live on 20, because I'm 20 years old and I can live with buddies and we can eat ramen soup and whatever, and I got 30 left over after taxes, 25, whatever 25 Grand can buy you.
2:45
A lot of Education.
I would rather you or I would rather me or somebody who's 20 or somebody who's 30, take two thousand dollars a month, because that's what 25 Grand is, and invest it in courses, coaching mentorships workshops, and seminars every month.
I'm putting that to K.
3:01
Now, you could put 2 K into One opportunities you're like dude I think Real Estate School.
Cool we're not doing real estate as my passive income we're doing real estate is I'm going to get into the real estate game and I'm going to make it my active income.
And by the way, everybody who builds their wealth and realistic actively spending their time, real estate, don't believe what they're saying.
They're like, dude, I did this deal and I made x amount of money.
3:17
It's like, what was the process of finding deals?
How many deals did you look at how many conversations did you have?
How many buildings did you walk?
How many different General Contractors 2008?
There is another other stuff that has to happen.
Right back to the point, let's say that you take that two thousand dollars a month and you do that for four years and I'm not saying, do the four-year degree I think that is a play if you want to, I don't necessarily agree with it anymore in the marketplace.
3:35
It currently exists for years later.
I fucking guarantee you that you will be making more than people who have four year degrees.
The probably start making money by the end of the first year, the amount of, like, copywriting courses and books and programs, mentorships and even one-on-one coaching, like I think one-on-one coaching, is that a phenomenal way to learn a new skill?
3:53
If you're like, hey, I need to know how to buy media.
I need to know how to run an ad, go pay.
Someone who runs ads or teaches people how to run ads when you make that payment, your Seeing it as one class in your entrepreneurial degree, rather than this 112 thousand dollar investment has to make me Rich.
4:10
You can make that shift is like this is my course, like when you get your degree in college, you're not like, oh I'm going to take one class in Spanish, graduate and get whatever job I want.
No one thinks that way.
But for some reason, the think about that, when it comes to entrepreneurial stuff, you're not paying someone to think that they're going to be your savior.
4:26
They're not going to save you from your life, do everything for, you know, one person is going to teach you everything.
I'll do my best on this channel teaching.
I know, but you have something to learn from everyone, you know, like my dad wasn't the value that I thought I was just like you can still learn from that.
You want to go to the person who's providing the most value for free.
4:42
It's the easiest way for you to decrease your risk of purchase.
If you follow someone since your grandfather, YouTube you see the stuff they put out.
You're like dude, this is really good.
Like this is a lot of new information that I didn't know and it's like very tactical and I understand like, hey you already know that you like the person be you already know that you're getting value from the person from the content they have.
4:58
And so the likelihood that the thing that they have that Spade is going Be worse than that is low.
You know, hopefully, follow lots of people in a particular space, see, the one that you jive with the most, you like their teaching style.
You don't need to file this stuff for forever to like, belabor the decision, give yourself seven days because, you know, what's really even cooler than buying one person's.
5:16
Buy them all.
And then you'll know what everyone knows and then guess what happens?
You become just as good or better now you're making eighty thousand dollars here.
Well, now we've got four thousand dollars a month that we can spend on coaching and mentorships and learnings and courses.
In one night, I was saying to myself, like I'm going to be the number one student here.
5:32
Do whatever they say, I'll see what happens and I'll do whatever they say, I'll see what happens.
He want to replicate before you iterate.
Before you say, I'm gonna put my Alex sauce on for you do that.
Just make sure that you can duplicate what they're doing because then you earn the right to make the iterations.
Even if it's not perfectly, your style, copy it.
First before you make the iterations, if you see it as a bridge that has many bricks on it, you have to lay all the bricks and here's the bad part.
5:52
Let's say you've got 30 bricks on this bridge to make your first dollar.
The first dollar has to walk across the bridge, when you're 28 bricks in, you might not have made the first dollar yet, but you're a 90% of the way there and the speed with which People are able to Traverse or cross.
That bridge is how well they identify, which brick is missing and where they put their attention.
6:08
That's where a lot of people get disheartened is that they will start building new Bridges and get to three bricks and then they'll start building a new bridge 23 breaks and they have lots of half built Bridges and they never make it all the way across.
Let's see your videographer.
Are you like video stuff?
Skills stack exponentially.
You got a video skill.
Now you got an editing skill now.
6:24
You understand social media messaging copyright and branding.
Oh management operations in leadership.
See how that?
Person starts to expand.
You can imagine how their pay is going to dramatically increase because now you're a CMO, broadening your horizons and going deep in these other silos than all of a sudden you're not tripping or one.
6:42
Is you have to make that decision that you're not going to spend all your money on stupid stuff.
The second is that you are going to spend your money, not on the SP, but on the Essen me,








0:00
There's usually this massive gap between what people think is required to get the outcome versus what is.
And they're like, what if I double?
It's like, dude, it's not even 10 x, a lot of times, it's like 50 x.
The amount of volume, welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:18
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I watched your video on training your calves because my calves, my traps weren't growing and I watched the video and I was like, well this makes sense.
So I started doing it.
I started like, literally doing Cavs set 10 sets of calves every single day as well as shrugs and lo and behold.
0:38
It's only been like a week and a half and I can literally see them growing.
I was like, this dude was, right?
Yeah, every works out like three sets of week in the liquid goes are growing like no shit.
Like you walk around all day long, your calves can.
Take a lot more than three sets.
0:54
Like right right.
Well, I saw another older video you did or it wasn't a video as a post.
And you were think you said you did like, 30 sets, every workout, full body, every single day.
That was your, that was your workout.
I was like, holy crap.
That's a lot of sediment.
Doing it for a decade.
1:11
I've been training that way for a decade.
I've been training for almost 20.
Yeah.
That makes sense like a lot of times people and it's sort of, like business because a lot of times people like, why aren't I bigger?
Why, why I'm not, why am I not a Person why don't have bigger muscles, and it's like, because this guy over here's doing 30 cents a day and you're doing three and then it's the same thing with business like, why am I not making more money and you're just doing one tenth of the work or 1/10 of the effort that the people who are Beauties in Lebanon, 10th, a lot of the times, it's like hundredth the, you know, me like that's one of the things I told the story of the time to think it drives at home so hopefully, the audience will appreciate it.
1:46
So I was really early in business and I had my gym so I like you had like a brick and mortar that I kind of started out with This is my first gym and I was told to put fliers out, right?
And I was like, okay, I'll put some flyers out, so I put some flyers out from a guy who did was a really successful business owner and I ended up meeting up with him, you know, a few months later or something.
2:05
And he was like, how did the have those fires work out?
Like, they didn't really, you know, we got, like, I got one call from guys that I dinged his car, and he was gonna sue me.
And that was it.
That's all I got from the Flyers.
He's like, well, you know, what was your test size?
2:21
And I was like, what do you It was like, like, what was your test?
I like, would you test before you?
Did, you know, the main amount.
I was like, I didn't do a test eyes, you say?
Well, how would you put out?
There's like 300, he's like 300, he's like, I don't even test with less, than a, with less than a thousand.
2:37
I was like, what?
He's like.
Yeah.
And then we start doing it.
We do 5,000 a day now, is like, and here's your five thousand.
So he's doing a hundred and fifty thousand Flyers a month to drive business, into his small business.
And I was here, jerk.
Knopf about 300, you know what I mean?
2:54
And so like heated, 45 times, I think the effort that I did to get the outcome and it's the same thing with like DMS and phone calls.
It's like I know you had your rule of 100 and so over the last I literally got a message.
That said, so over the last eight weeks I sent 100 GM's and I was like bro it's 100, add 100, a day.
3:15
You did 100 over eight weeks.
That's 150.
Sixth, the amount of effort that is required.
So it's just like there's usually this massive App between what people think is required to get the outcome versus what is and they're like, what if I double?
It's like, dude, is it's not even 10 x.
3:30
A lot of times it's like 50 x.
The amount of volume or same thing with phone calls.
Like, I make 10 phone calls a day micro our guys.
Minimum quotas 200 a day for the call T here.
I mean some people just don't get, I'll give you different story because it happens.
All the fucking time.
I had one of our portfolio companies.
3:47
We're scaling up the traffic and I was like, bro, you need to make more creative, and you need to do it on.
A more consistent basis and it's like, okay, that's fine.
And I was like did we make creative every as like you need to start every 14 days.
You need to make to have a full creative day like create new ads, all kind of stuff.
And so I got end-of-day thing and he was like Hey man the first creative day went awesome recorded for ads.
4:09
Really excited?
Like what the fuck you do all day for?
I like, did we would do like 40, you don't even like minimum and when we were at like, you know, full swing because right now, for us, A cold calls.
On the German side was is now like 75% of the business.
4:27
But when ads were the vast majority, the business we were running like 30 to 40 new ads every three days.
He was like, why don't like yeah, bro.
Like I don't know.
It's just, it's like, it's just, there's just a massive different and he thought for was a lot and doing for every two weeks, he thought was a lot.
4:44
And so I'm like what was he doing before that?
You know I mean but like that's the thing is just like people are just had this massive discrepancy between what what is required And what they think will make them successful.
You think that's always been that way or it's being further perpetuated by Society.
5:00
Because, you know, when I I used to work for DirecTV and I remember, we were expected to make 200 dials a day, and if the phones went out or something like that is, there's a tech issue and we called up and we were like, hey, the phones are out our boss, would be, like, why aren't you already on the phone with the cable company?
5:21
Getting it fixed.
You calling me, you know.
And the expectation was so much higher and nobody was sitting there saying, well, you know, you got to Pander to people's emotions and feelings.
You just did your job and to, I recall, you know, in today's world, I've, you know, I've had a conversation with, like, a sales rep who wants to make all this money being a sales rep.
5:42
And I'm like, how many dials did you do today?
And they're like, oh, I didn't.
And I'm like, why did you do at least 30 by lunchtime?
And I like 30 by lunchtime, you know, I know that's just not enough hours.
Hours in a day and I'm like, dude, not everyone's going to answer, you can do 30 the next hour.
What are you talking about?
5:58
Like just the fundamental lack of understanding and acceptance around that.
Do you think that it's worse today because of like society and culture or you think it's just always been that way?
No, I mean, I think there's a slight degradation over time, but I think it's, I think it's cyclical.
6:17
So, I mean, like, there's lots of like macro stuff but I think it's like every 80 years or so, there's like the big pendulum that swings.
And so it's like, you know, like hard times.
Build hard, people hard people, build, good times.
Good times, PeopleSoft PeopleSoft people build hard times, right?
And so, I think that we're in the heart.
People, built-in are worth soft times belts off.
6:34
People stage right now and I think that, you know, we will have another hard time and it will build more hard people, I think.
Very likely that we will be the our generation will be the one that will have to step up in the next decade or so and become a harder generation which I think I think will rise to it.
6:52
I mean, I think people are amazingly resilient when they have no choice.
Like, if we think about human capacity versus like what is societally, accept it, like I think a lot about like really dark times.
I think a lot about like Auschwitz and slavery and things that were really horrific kind of human experiences.
7:11
And huge populations were able to go through it.
And those same people prior to well, obviously, it's Savory wouldn't work.
But like prior to that experience, you might have people who were softer and then they go through things like that and it really fundamentally changes them.
And to the same degree.
7:26
If I were to think to myself, like the difficulty of my life, compared to a lifetime of slavery is different rights, a different level of difficulty.
And so I think like knowing that that is possible gives us a lot more potential for Effort because this is like, we're so untapped and the amount of effort that we put forth into the Endeavors that we pursue awesome and makes a lot of sense.
7:49
So, let me ask you this kind of feeding off that because it's one thing that I've noticed is there is effort.
There's lack of acceptance around how much effort, but then I've seen a lot of people including myself, we put effort into the wrong places, you know?
Like we started talking before we began recording and your company's, you know, you guys you and your wife are doing a million And a hundred million dollars a year and you're in a hallway right now.
8:15
With no art on the wall, you too.
I thought it was the camera angle but do the thing with your hands like this.
Like literally, literally you can touch both sides of the wall.
You're in this this hallway and you're obviously beautiful condo in Vegas but like dude like you you know most people they have this big office with this nice views and this over-the-top stuff and these and maybe they have like crazy lighting and stuff.
8:40
Yeah, they just go overboard, but you're just like screw it.
I'm in this hallway and I'm just building this, you know, billion-dollar play.
Would you say that part of your success is the fact that you're basically just the ultimate minimalist?
Like, I mean, everything that I see from you, is Ultimate minimal, right?
8:58
It's like an iPhone videos for YouTube.
It's your logo is just acquisition.com.
It's just you and your website is just like black like, you know, you just eat tension, Ali, don't give a shit about Any of the stuff that most entrepreneurs obsess over?
9:13
Do you think that's part of your success rather than minimalism outside its form over function?
So it's not just because I think I think it can look similar, but I think it's a shade different, you know?
I mean like for like this tank top, this particular like white tank top that I wear, like, I bought 40 different brands and I tried different sizes on so that I could find the right white tank top for me.
9:36
And like, I bought all the pious rated barefoot shoes on Amazon, because I was trying to do, Because I realized I don't wear t-shirts, it was something.
I was like, I would, if I could eliminate t-shirts my life.
So, I don't wear t-shirts, I either where I have a beater, or I put, like, a flannel if it's cold, or I put a Hawaiian if it's hot and that's it.
9:51
And so, that's just like what I wear up top most of the time.
And then, like, with shoes, I was like, can I eliminate socks?
So, I tried all the barefoot shoes on, and then, I ended up realizing that I liked my Crocs the best.
But now, I'm just informed on it.
So I like got rid of all those and like, I work rocks, just about everywhere.
10:07
I figured out, I can work out in them, so I was like, great.
I don't have to have workout shoes.
Anyways, all that to say, I think it's just like what's the function that's required and I think a lot of times people miss the forest for the trees, you know?
I mean like I think that YouTube video stuff works even though the quality is poor because you know, the stuff is useful for people and then also for me from a form over function standpoint, if it takes me more effort to do the other thing, and I become less likely to do it as a result.
10:36
Then, the overall function goes down, so it's like if I do 1/3 the videos, And they're prettier, will I get the same output as 3 times, the videos that are kind of quick and dirty?
And for me at this point, I do that, I must say that I wouldn't like if I can figure out a way to get the function down, where it's like, really effortless for me to do nicer ones, I'll do nicer ones.
10:56
It's just there right now.
It's like, my, I don't make my money from being an influencer or whatever.
All right, well, I mean the quality.
You got to look at the categorization of quality because from a Content perspective, your videos and the content you put out is better than like virtually everybody else.
11:13
Like, you know, most people are like the 4-Hour workweek and stupid shit.
And you're like, literally giving actual hardcore advice that make sense.
And that is stuff that most people charged for and it isn't even that good.
In that case, would you say that the ability to focus solely or at least Focus the most on the point is just any view of like fancy cameras and all that stuff is just a distraction from creating amazing content.
11:40
And ultimately that's what people care about.
Thank you comes.
Second.
It's exactly that is like it comes to like it's I think there is some benefit to it.
I just think it is less benefit than people give proportional to their focus.
So it's like, let's say it's 80/20, you know, eighty percent comes from the content, 20% comes from the touch, I think people put 80% on the touch 20% of the content.
12:04
It's like, I think if you allocate the focus appropriately, then you'll get the outsized outcomes and I think fundamentally like, the people that move fastest in life are the ones who employ the most leverage.
And so, a lot of employing, Leverage in business, and whatever relationships is understanding, where the points of Leverage our, and that means that being able to look at a lot of variables and identify which of these ones has the most influence over the outcome and then ruthlessly focusing on that one.
12:32
Abel and and driving it.
And I think most people will focus on a lot of other variables that they don't see don't have a huge effect on output and the easiest litmus test for this and this is for anybody in the audience is if right now you're working you know most of your hours of the day.
12:49
For example it's not that you need to work more.
It's that fundamentally what you are working on is not effective like you might be doing stuff and you might be producing things.
Like you might actually be getting things done.
It's just that the things that Getting done are literally irrelevant.
13:05
That's how your, I mean, it's kind of like, cutting grass with scissors.
Like you can do it.
It just doesn't make it meaningful.
Which is really disheartening for some people, but it's also the truth.
Hey, Mose, an Asian quick break.
13:21
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright, so send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one?
Of my or laila's posts.
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
13:40
So then let me just dig a Little Deeper there, what are, what would you say?
Are two things that most entrepreneurs and especially you know, online entrepreneurs, do that they don't need to do.
And what's two things that they're not doing that.
They absolutely need to do.
I can answer the second one better than the first one because like my answer for the first two would be anything you're doing.
14:02
That's not these things look here.
I mean like right?
Like people do a zillion crazy things and so, with regards to the things that people need to be doing more, like if you boil everything that, like, again, what are the points of Leverage?
Like, what are the things that actually grow a business?
14:18
Like number one, if you can get more, customers number two is, you can make them worth more.
It's literally.
So everything flows down from the Equation at the top and every time we have quarter lease with the you know, the portfolio companies and things like that, like I always write it on the board as a reminder to just be like guys were either making this number go up, we're making this number go up.
14:38
What is all of these?
You know, these quarterly objectives that we're doing, how's it going to drive that versus?
How's it going to drive that, right?
And so like the two, most important things are getting more customers and making them worth more.
And so then it just depends on which of these things is the bottleneck within the business.
14:56
Yes.
And in the beginning and this is where a lot of people fuck up is that like 0 to 1 million 1 2 3 million ish in that range is you have to learn how to sell something to someone, right?
It's one product.
When Avatar one channel, very simple process, right?
15:11
Which is really just finding product Market fit, which is what they call from the software world is do people want the thing, you're selling?
That's it, right?
And can you get them to give you money?
All it is.
But going from like 3 to 10, for example, you can gas, like, you can gasps marketing, all you can just keep Acquire customers.
15:27
The thing is that like in order to keep doubling down on that you have to start, you have to double your sales velocity.
Every time you want to double the business.
So it's like I go from Psych 50.
Customers a month to 100 customers, multi-cell from 100, customers a month, to 200, customers a month, and I get from 200 to 400 and then becomes really untenable at a certain point to keep selling more people.
15:45
And then that's where the business will Plateau.
And so instead, the better way of growing the big business is as soon as you have product Market fit, which is selling shit that people, The want and they're actually buying from which use usually you're making one two, three million ish, right?
At that point you pause an acquisition and then you focus all of your effort on how do I retain these people?
16:05
How do I get them to never leave?
How do I extend the LTV per customer?
So that even if I sold the same amount, my business continues to grow, right?
And so usually, if you fix that properly during that period of time, you can keep the same acquisition numbers and then expand the business from three to 10 million with a lot less effort than clever.
16:26
And then then when you go and Jim more marketing into the business, then it just boom.
You're at 30.
Boom?
You're at 50.
You don't need mean.
And it's just that most people just think.
Oh, I started marketing that made me some money.
So I'm going to Market more to make me more money and it's not that.
16:42
I mean you will make what I would consider like you will become rich doing that if you just want to mark it a lot, but you will not become wealthy because you will not build assets that are valuable because people will not want to buy a thing that's purely built on just front end and and not tons of like word of mouth and higher LTD metrics.
16:59
And then what happens is the media Arbitrage that most people figure out in order to acquire the customers usually shuts down and then all of a sudden their margins compress.
And then it becomes untenable for them to acquire the amount of customers that they were and then overnight, they disappear, you know what I mean and that's what usually happens.
17:15
Whereas if you have a stable base of customers that continue to pay you because they like the thing that you're doing, it gives you the gross profit margin to then whether those storms and then build other channels, Got it.
So then let me ask you this you probably have a lot of data on this.
17:31
Next question already.
How many portfolio companies you have currently?
If you don't include the three that Layla and I still have big chunks of that, we sold majority of but we're still 25 to 40 percent owners in those companies.
We have eight, so eight, so a company.
17:48
So I would say that that's not one or two.
That's a, that's a pretty fair amount to be 11 between all of them.
Well, okay, so 11.
So then, Let me ask you this.
When you start working with a portfolio company, I imagine that you've probably helped or coached or somehow interacts with a lot of a lot more companies in that.
18:05
My question is you probably are seeing patterns, right?
Like as soon as you start working with a company, you probably see the same mistakes over and over again or you start changing the same things over and over again and they repeat.
Can you expand on?
18:21
What what are those repeated patterns?
Or what's the first thing you usually change?
That you just consistently.
See, I would say that there are, there are different archetypes of entrepreneurs, so just as a hair to that, like as a shade of gray or Nuance is that there are product driven entrepreneurs and there are promotion driven entrepreneurs and then, you know, the best ones can do both.
18:43
But most of them tend to have a leaning one way or the other, right?
And so if we have a product of an entrepreneur, usually we have to focus on acquisition stuff, right?
And that's I would say that's probably the minority of the the time I'd say that's maybe like 25% of time.
The other 75% of time, it's usually promotion driven entrepreneurs, at least the ones who come to me or maybe you're attracted to my stuff.
19:03
And to be fair, my buddies would acquisition.com.
So like maybe the promotion guys are more attracted to the stuff that I talked about, right?
And so with the promotion guys it's usually we have to fix back and stuff and so it really depends on what they're presenting with because like the way I see it it's like imagine you have a Mona Lisa painting.
19:19
That's the embodiment of like a 50 or 100 million dollar business and then we've got whatever their current business looks like which is Mona Lisa that has like gunshot and bullet holes all over it.
It's like okay how do we look at this and then just systematically fill in the holes.
And so two different businesses might have like gunshot holes in different areas of the painting that they currently have, that has potential to be a Mona Lisa, but it's not there yet.
19:42
And so we just kind of fill in the holes based on that, but big picture most companies that that size they have really, really shit Data Tracking.
So usually they don't have Consolidated metrics and that's a big one because it affects everything that you're trying to improve.
Like if you don't Have all the metrics and tracking around, like customer lifetime value, and your acquisition metrics and click to close and becomes really difficult to make decisions.
20:03
And so, then you're just shooting from the hip which is just not that effective.
So getting the right data in place second one, and this is probably pretty Universal.
Is that the talent at that stage is low so usually it's a genius of the Thousand hands model.
You've got one guy who's kind of like really pushing and driving everything and a lot of people just like help him out for her.
20:21
How?
Right.
And so what's required at that point is that we need to have like the first Like true mid-level leaders.
That's kind of like directors and managers that need to get put into place and sometimes those directors managers can level up even beyond that to go from 10 to 30 and sometimes we have to replace them and it just depends on whether they're willing or able to grow.
20:39
And so it's a, it's a data problem.
It's a people problem.
And then there's usually some sort of this is one that's not necessarily a problem but like what we're really good at is figure out the best ways to monetize businesses.
And so it's like how can we reconfigure, how we price?
How can we reconfigure the thing that we're selling or Create some sort of Ascension or some sort of tied and continuity to increase the lifetime value per customer.
21:01
Those are like the, I would say the three bigger buckets that we look at as like we got to get the data right?
So that we can make the Strategic decisions and then once we have the future you just engines we need to do to build a beautiful Mona Lisa painting that we want to paint then.
Who do we need on the bus is either there and then we need to get off the bus because I would say it's more than a third and less than half the time.
21:21
So in that range we also have to fire a bunch of key people or They like their key roles in the business but they are actually sabotaging the business.
And so we've had two instances are three instances and not necessarily been fires, a strong word, but like we have to fundamentally move the org chart a lot, right?
21:39
Sometimes we have to let somebody go but sometimes it's like it has to be a major move.
Like maybe the CEO is actually a really good CMO and he's not really a co-write, like, he just he's a Founder.
But like, if you look at Shopify, the founder, I came a name and I feel like an idiot.
21:55
Anyways, the Under, he's a product guy, and so he's not see if I even though he's the founder, he's just Chief product officer because that's what he loves doing.
And that's what he's really good at writing.
He found a CEO to run the bistec, see recognize his own deficiencies but a lot of times people's egos cannot take that.
22:10
And it's the thing is is always like what is the business require period and then like that's what it requires.
So whether it's you or something like that is what is required?
And then it's just having a conversation of like do you want to become that person or do want to find that person?
So what do you mean by their ego?
Gets in Way, people have attachments to the title of CEO, they're like, I want to be CEO my company like, well, I mean it's a business that requires a CEO like you do not need to be that person like Warren Buffett's.
22:38
Not see you of any of those companies, you know, I mean, does that lead into playing to your strengths a lot because, you know, for me, I've always thought, if I was going to be a see anything, it would be a CMO, not not a CEO.
Because the operational aspect of business is the part I like in the lease, I mean it needs to be done.
22:56
Done.
But it's the part, I liked the least I like, you know, I, I grew up watching Mad Men and thinking that was the greatest show in the planet and just coming up with the best ad campaign.
It was to me, that's like, art, you know, it's like painting, but you're painting with products.
Yeah.
So best people, see, whatever they do is, are so the best product guys talk about product?
23:17
Like it's are the best operators.
Talk about culture, and meeting and onboarding and leading like it's art.
I'm so glad to hear you say.
Say that because I have always my entire career said that, you know, I grew up in RS.
I was poor musician, played guitar and I never could get that to be successful.
23:37
And so when I started learning sales and marketing and building a business, I didn't really view it as a business you know because I was that I was at like anti-corporate guitar player and I was like you know fuck these guys like but then I realized that that is it's just a different canvas.
It's a different stage and I always viewed.
23:56
Dude, building the business and ads and marketing and creating products as art, not as, you know, I mean, obviously it's a business, but I viewed it as our and I've said that a lot.
So to hear you say that, it just lets me know, I'm on the right track with that thinking.
I think the art because it is sort of like, you don't, you don't need more money, you know what I mean.
24:15
And so it has to be something that you would do.
Like, if you would play music all day long.
If you didn't need anything ever, then it's just, and this is a lot of people won't like, what?
Say, but I'll say it.
Anyways, like to compete against the people.
If you're like, I really want to make money, but you don't really like business.
24:33
Like, I started in Fitness and then I realized I had a deeper passion for business, like I liked it more than I like Fitness and I was obsessed with business for a long time.
But like when I like the day I started my gym was the day fitness became number two, and then business became my first love and I'm still, you know, in my love affair, you know, with business, my long-term relationship with business.
24:56
And it's because like the only way you're going to beat everybody else is is to truly love it and if you don't I think it's very difficult to do that and I think it's just like maybe picking another metric or different bone to gnaw on but I have one quick thing.
I was pulling it up while you were we're talking about the art thing earlier.
25:12
So like a lot of marketers will talk about how their products are amazing, right?
Like, how many times have you heard people like Dawn?
Our course is also our programs, awesome our whatever, right?
They say that but the thing is is like and I've done this at like a couple of like workshops I've been invited to So then I'm like, all right, who here knows what?
25:27
They're, you know, they're CPM their seats.
ER, they're, you know, they're they're CPL their set percentage, their clothes rate, their CPA, the CAC like what, who knows?
All those numbers?
Everyone's like, oh yeah, 100% am I cool?
I'm like, what's your, what's your TTV, what your CHS, what's your NPS?
What's your turn with your activation points there seriously?
25:44
And they're like, what Mike, right?
So how can you say you a fucking good product and you don't even know what the fucking metrics are to track good product?
Well, I mean I think that just goes in the room, right?
25:59
Yeah.
Wow, I mean, and that makes sense.
Because, you know, if you think about it, most entrepreneurs are full of shit.
And even if they're like, no, I mean, look, I'm just going to look, I'll just say this.
Okay.
I've you know, I've personally worked with and you've worked a lot.
26:17
I work with tons of entrepreneurs.
One of the biggest things is online.
Coaches course, creator.
Ders, even agencies.
And I've always given blunt direct advice and I can't tell you, if I had to sum up my experience with most people and I was probably this way too when I came up.
26:35
So I'm not like judging, but it's really like, hey, you are currently full of shit.
And you need to understand how to not be full of shit.
And now, you can sort of really see the forest through the trees and see what needs to be done, because you've you have this Cloud over this lens.
26:51
Your your glasses are dirty.
You can't see the real world because you're stuck in this alternate reality that you've created and it's, I like it.
I like how you just broke it down.
You like, listen, do you feel that you have a good product?
That is a feeling that's an emotion.
That's some shit.
You need to talk to your therapist about what are the metrics?
27:09
What is the data telling you is the data telling you it's good or do you just feel it's good because you just want to wake up and think life's great.
So I think that that's a great point because as an entrepreneur, isn't it about that?
Isn't it about the data?
And Analyzing the situation and and making decisions and not about just feeling a certain way, you know.
27:29
Wouldn't you say that that ultimately is that next level is detaching yourself from that and just looking at it as it is.
Yeah and most people just don't know what ideal scene looks like.
And so that, I mean, the biggest threat that most people and I mean, I would say the biggest threat to all entrepreneurs is that they are ignorant is that we are ignorant of what it takes to be successful at whatever the next level is for us.
27:48
And so like this concept is one that has just like frightened me and like to my for my whole life which I think I heard Meyer and say this on stage and it was like really impactful for me, he said it was a close for him, but I just think it's a it's a great concept.
He said it's costing you a million dollars a year every year you don't know how to make a million dollars and to me that's the tax of ignorance.
28:10
So like everyone who's listening to this use, not making a billion dollars a year.
He's getting taxed by life far, more than the government is for just the ignorance that you have to not knowing how to do it.
And so that's always been the biggest Acts.
I've tried to pay down as fast as possible, which is like every person who makes more than me, knows more than me in some way.
28:31
And I just have to try and figure out what am I ignorant of that?
They are not ignorant of and a lot of people will throw stones and be like, well, that guy doesn't have ethics, or that guy doesn't have more.
Also, one of the big pieces is that there's always the compounding effect of time, right?
Is that, like, you might be on the right path, as long as you are making progress and that's a big one, right?
28:49
As long as you're making, you might be on the right path to a billion because like, Warren Buffett.
It my age I think was worth Worth 10 million in those days dollars.
I have to figure out that isn't today's dollars but like, you know, he was worth 10 million at my age.
I'm like, so, maybe it is the right path.
I don't know.
You don't, I mean, but also the world's changed?
Do you think one of the big things is like it's a to just expand on that like people assume they need to like someone to learn from them and I've always I've never understood why someone sets a requirement to personally like someone to gain value or Knowledge from them.
29:22
Oh yeah, I wrote that dunks.
Really good.
Tweet.
You don't need to like someone to learn from them.
That's great.
Well, I'm glad I could contribute to your Twitter somehow.
Hey man, I love that.
It's a great.
It's a great statement.
29:37
But, you know, navall said something that I thought was really impactful and it's like, this is something that took me a very, very, very, very, very long, time to understand.
So before I explain what that, that quote is most small business owners suck, And that is why they are small business owners because they are so bad at virtually all aspects of business.
29:59
That's why they are small, right?
Like the thing that separates small business from big business is skill, right?
And I you know, Market opportunities that are but like you can even get into like well picking an opportunity is a skill, right?
And we were like, well, that's easy.
He saw on B2B.
It's like what they want.
You something to be or whatever.
I mean, I don't think it's that easy but you get the understanding right and so no Vall said.
30:19
You only do sales are good at selling because you don't know how to mark it.
And you only mark it because you don't know how to build product.
And so I think there's a tremendous amount of Truth to that, which is like, if you build the product good enough.
30:35
And it takes a tremendous amount of effort to build an exceptional product that grows on its own via word of mouth because of all acquisition channels, only one of them is quadratic in nature, right?
Only one of them can multiply and compound on its own.
Every other acquisition Channel, you get an affiliate, it's a one-to-one relationship, you get, you know, you Dollar in dollar out.
30:54
Same thing.
With, you know ads it's like you put a dollar in, you get a fixed amount of maybe it's 10 to 1 but it's fixed.
So I put another dollar in.
I get another $10 out, but for something to be quadratic it's like I put 10 in, I get 100 and then I get a thousand and then I get 10,000 right, and, like in and it multiplies, and the only thing that does that is word of mouth, right?
31:13
And one of the things that's really interesting about the Internet space.
Specifically is a lot of people will start the business.
They'll shoot up because they'll figure out how to get ads to work, or whatever.
Whatever their actors there's General, is, they'll figure out how to do that and then I'll shoot up. - right and this is particularly for paid ad people, right?
31:30
And you know within six months or 12 months also they're like man my my cpms are out of control.
My cost of Acquisitions way you know above kpi like you know, Google's changed, YouTube's change, Facebook's change why they you know they throw that out there and the thing is is like it may have gone up by like 10 percent.
31:49
It may have gone up by 15%, but your cost of acquisition is quadrupled.
And so the thing is is what is The invisible hand behind the scenes, pulling the strings against you, and it's the same people were like, Word of Mouth doesn't exist.
It doesn't work anymore and that's horseshit word-of-mouth, 100% completely exists, its social media for God's sake, of course, of course, Word of Mouth works.
32:09
It's just working against you.
And so, right now, everyone has Word of Mouth that is about their business.
The question is, is it neutral?
Is it positive or is it negative?
And then actively destroying your business?
The way positive word-of-mouth can grow your business.
32:25
And so, the guys who have positive word-of-mouth, they see their cost of acquisition to continue to decline, even if their cost per impression Remains the Same or even goes up slightly because they have that quadratic compounding that's happening behind the scene, where, as the other guys are having that true that compounding, this happening behind the scenes, which is like, oh, I saw this ad from, you know, Johnny so and so I think it looks cool and then they message friendly like, AA, do heard the guy's a complete.
32:47
Your like, his product.
Shit doesn't respond to you.
The team sucks.
He just has a bunch of EA's in the Philippines who are bird like your support and it's terrible.
And they're like, oh, Oh, wow.
And then that person, the person who said the - think it's ask the question again about Johnny, another situation tells people, he prevented that sale, no knows why you prevented that sale, but that's a was prevented.
33:05
And then, the guy tells it to get another message, like, hey, are you gonna do that Johnny thing?
And he's like, oh no, I actually heard from Frank that it's actually a really bad product and they're like, okay.
And that's enough like it doesn't take a lot to get people to not buy.
Yeah.
And so it's just like you have this machine that compounds in the the easiest way to prove it is like, if your cost of acquisition is gone up. 3x.
33:25
But the cost per impression is only gone up. 30%, you have another thing that's working against you, which is like, how is Jim on still here, six years later.
Seven years later, right?
And still growing, right?
It's only there because it has at least neutral, or positive word-of-mouth behind it, otherwise it wouldn't exist.
33:44
We won't be able to acquire customers.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll the most valuable skill that you can have in order is product.
0:21
First then marketing, then sales and so right now, if you know how to sell it because you don't know how to Market, you know, how to build product.
Welcome to the game.
We talked about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
0:36
I always wished pesos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
There are three paths that every entrepreneur eventually has to take.
You have the path of the pure artist, the path of the pure entrepreneur and then a hybrid path, and I'll explain each one of them at high levels.
0:53
So the path of the artist is the person who loves doing the thing.
So you have an art form that your art form might be Plumbing.
Your art for might be carpentry are for might be coding software, might be making content, it might be making media, it might be making wallets, right?
Doesn't really matter what it is.
You have something that you enjoy doing and you do it.
1:09
Well, the second path on the extreme so that all the Other side of it is that you love business, businesses, your art form and it doesn't really matter what business you're in.
You just enjoy built.
Like your art, is how you build a business around monetizing.
The thing I would say that for me now that is my path.
1:25
That's what I enjoy the most.
Like I love working with different portfolio companies, whether it's solar sails, mortgage sales, physical products, software service businesses, brick-and-mortar chains.
Like, we have all of those in our portfolio and I love growing them all.
And that's because the art for me is the actual business itself.
1:41
The third path is a hybrid p.
Path.
And each of these paths can go all the way to the max limit here.
So an example is Tobias, Luca who is the founder and not CEO of Shopify.
And so he loves building Shopify Pages, he loves the coding and he loves the product.
1:59
And so what he did was he found somebody else to actually be the art where whose art was entrepreneurship and building businesses and have them build the business around him.
While he stayed focused on the main thing that he loved the most.
And so the key here is that there is no right path.
It's more about the path that works best for you during the season, you're in, because guess what?
2:17
You can also change paths later.
If you start in the artist path, you might transition to the hybrid path, or you might start in the ice bath and go all the way to the entrepreneurial path.
When I started, I really loved Fitness.
I was obsessed with Fitness.
I had spent years, I had competed in Fitness and so, all I read all day besides a little bit of personal development was like, macro counting different different ways to exercise different programming stuff like exercise, execution, different ways to layer workouts program, all that kind of stuff.
2:41
And I was obsessed with it so much so that the people that I Worked with her like, dude, if you don't start a gym, I'll pay for the gym.
So these stop talking about this stuff because I was obsessed with it.
The thing is that as soon as I actually started a gym, I realized I enjoyed business even more than I enjoyed Fitness.
And so you may be surprised if what you start because when I started I thought I'm just going to do the thing.
2:56
I love for the rest of my life, I started as an artist of fitness and I became an entrepreneur.
But let me play out all three paths to their natural extremes.
All right, so the artist at its extreme is somebody who continues to, not scale an Enterprise around them and continues to do the thing.
3:13
Extraordinarily high levels.
And so this ultimately goes from a commoditized price point to a premium price point to a luxury price point.
All right, so commoditize price point is like, if you're a plumber you do the same Plumbing work, everyone else does, right?
And you do it now.
If you start doing it really well, Word of Mouth starts to build and you can start raising your prices because you are now a premium provider.
3:33
You do better work, you do it.
Faster people come to you because they trust your work right now at the highest level it becomes luxury you become so advanced in plumbing, you can do it for massive building or you can do it.
It for luxury homes and you make it look ornate and awesome and cool and whatever, right?
And so in that instance, what happens is demand continues to increase for your services or your product.
3:54
And so, rather than increase the number of units you sell you just increase the price.
And so you still make significantly more money and a lot more profit in that business model, but it still keeps you doing the core thing which is that you like Plumbing you like making wallets.
You like being a carpenter whatever.
4:10
If you take that to its natural stream you can have incredible artists.
Sell their paintings for millions of dollars a piece and they don't have a massive organization around them.
Because their main thing that they focus on everyday is the art.
Now there's obviously elements of Entrepreneurship there because they make money they transact.
4:26
So, by the definition, they are entrepreneurs, but they're focused.
They're type of graph, I would say is that they are an artist first, the hybrid version is Tobias.
Luca is somebody who started as a shop, you know, developer who built the little website because he wanted to make something for I think there's a surfing company or something like it's some sort of physical products business.
4:43
That he didn't like the tools that are out there and he started making it.
But then other people because the product was so good started asking for it.
Now, he could have just continued to raise the price that thing, but at a certain point, especially with software, it made more sense to make himself Chief product officer.
Rather than CEO, he was chief of product and then hired a CEO and Harden, executive team to build everything else around him.
5:03
Now, on the org chart, because he's a big shareholder, he has a lot of sway.
But on the actual chart itself, he might be over here not necessarily at the top, because he doesn't want that life.
And so You could go transition from the pure artist to the Tobias, Luca model where you still do your art every day, but then you find the people.
5:20
Now that does require skill because you need to have the perspective from which to make a judgment on, who is good enough to be able to leave your company.
Now, that's where having outside advisors and things like that.
To help you find those people who you do trust.
You already have that skill who don't have a vested interest in your business.
So then give you the cleanest purest advice and the way that I layer that advice, at least way it so that you can think about this for yourself.
5:41
Is that the highest level of advice is someone who has been there, done that themselves and taking other people just like me to where I'm trying to go multiple times a level below.
That is someone who has taken multiple people like me where I'm trying to go.
They haven't done it themselves.
The level below that is someone who's only done it themselves and helps no one else the level below.
6:00
That is someone who saw someone go all the way themselves or saw multiple other people go there themselves below.
That is only seeing one person and below.
That is your mama uncle and, and your neighbor telling you their two cents about how you should do business.
When they've never Run a business and have no, no right to have an opinion.
6:16
And so I rank my advice and how much weight I give it based on that scale?
And ideally I want to really only look at the top one or two for my sources of information and the big caveat here, they either have to have a lined interest with me, or no incentive at all.
You just want to make sure that they aren't incentivised to tell you something else, that's the main key.
6:36
Now, if you can look through that, you can leverage their experience to find the right people to fit inside of your business, to build the business around you.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
6:53
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
The third path is that of the entrepreneur?
That's the person whose art form is the businesses.
7:10
And so, rather than thinking about making wallets and making more wallets.
The business itself is the painting and so they will have multiple paintings in their career that as they develop as an artist.
So too does their expression of their art and so the types of businesses, they build get bigger, more complex, more ornate, or simpler, right?
7:27
Just depends on what type of entrepreneur they are right.
And so for me, I'll tell you right now, the amount of businesses I started I started a A nonprofit online training business.
I switched to a for-profit training business and then I switched to a brick and mortar gym.
Then I had a chain of gyms, then I had a gym, turnaround business.
7:45
I had a chiropractor agency, I had a dental agency, had a corporate Wellness contract thing that I did, I've had an e-commerce business.
That's old physical products that a software business offers a service B2B.
And now I have private Equity Firm.
So, there's the businesses that I directly have founded and I'm 33.
8:02
And so, as you develop as an entrepreneur, you're are Will change and it will be continually changing expression, of who you are.
So the biggest question is, which of the three are you?
If you love the actual doing of the business, the thing you do the product or service you deliver?
8:19
That is your art.
Then I would say start with the path of the artist and if you're good because if you really do love it, you should be able to beat other people who don't love it.
And so you should naturally through word-of-mouth, be able to get more demand than you have supply of time at that point, you'll have to start making the decision.
8:35
Am I Going to go hybrid or are going to go all the way entrepreneur.
If you're starting out right now and you just love entrepreneurship in general, and you don't really care what you sell, you just want to make money.
Then you probably more the entrepreneurial path.
You're just want to hustle.
You want to figure out needs in the marketplace, figure out stuff that people are buying connect the two dots, build the organization around it, put it operator in charge and then let it run and make cash flow.
8:56
That's the entrepreneur path, the middle path, the hybrid path is usually someone who starts as an artist and then becomes that because they still want to build the beginner.
But they don't want to sacrifice thing that I love the most, which is actually building the product.
And so, this little product thing as a side note could also be marketing.
9:15
It could also be financed.
It could also be like, if you like a certain component of the business, you can own that component of the business and have someone build it around you.
And so, I use the device, like a example, because it's probably the most natural for people to understand.
But you could love a different function of the business.
You could just be the guy who loves fundraising and you just love raising funds and that's how you build your business and you get everybody.
9:35
Surround you to run it or you love marketing.
Steve, Jobs was a mostly marketing.
Well, Steve Jobs.
Is it was a good.
You could do everything but, like, bad example, but it was a marketing genius on the list.
And so the idea is that you will still leave your thumbprint on different aspects of be more heavily involved in different departments, the ones that you love the most, but at this point you do it by choice rather than do it by obligation.
9:58
And so identifying which one you are is?
Do I love the thing or do I love the business of doing the thing and then walking that path down.
And the best news is you can always Change your mind later, the most valuable skill that you can have in order is product.
First then marketing, then sales and so right now, if you know how to sell it because you don't know how to Market, you know how to build product.
10:19
If you know how to market, then you can sell lots of stuff but you're only going to sell it once because the products usually not that good.
If you know how to sell product, you will get more promotion from your customers than anything else.
And that is ultimately what skills, the Enterprise marketing can scale anything to a point and then what happens is the marginal cost of getting the next customer continues to get So up and up, and if you don't get Word of Mouth, referrals from customers who use your product, then eventually it becomes untenable in your company will Plateau.
10:43
And so the key to building a very, very big thing that lasts for a very long time, is have an exceptional product.
This stuff is stuff that I used to hear all the time when I was younger entrepreneur and I get that, you're like sure.
But how do I make money?
And you know what?
If you just sell shit, you can make money.
If you Market shit, well, you can make even more money.
11:00
But if you learn product and what happens for most entrepreneurs, that they actually go in that direction, they just learned how to sell shit because It's the easiest skill to learn.
You can learn it in a couple weeks, learn how to mark, it takes a little longer.
You learn how to write copy.
It's really just translating the persuasion of sales in two different types of media and selling too many people at once product.
11:18
If done properly gets people to promote on your behalf.
And there's way more of them than there are of you.
And so, the highest leverage thing you can do is make an exceptional product that other people want to promote for you.
And so, my first real big experience with this was the book.
So 100, our offers is a bug as 99 Cents.
11:34
You know, Amazon that it continues just like right now it's those 25,000 copies a month with no paid ads, it just sells 25,000 copies a month and the reason for that.
And a lot of people who knew me from high school or new me from college or like, dude, is so crazy.
Some guy I know from work is like, dude, you got to read this book and it was your book and the thing is is like that is how those books sales happen.
11:54
And so, if you can get your product to be that way or your service to be that way, that amazing.
Then you never need to spend another dollar on marketing ever again, because people do it for you.
And that ultimately drives the most marginalized.
As you scale the Enterprise in a compounding fashion?
Because if you don't scale it that way, then all you have to do is consistently spend more money on ads, hire more outbound, people get more Affiliates, but if you get it from the product-driven perspective first, where you have more people who send you business, then people who leave just based on how good your product is that continues to compound to the end of time and that's the business you want to build.
12:27
But to be clear you can make money doing any of them.
Be make the biggest money doing that one.








0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
0:22
I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I was CEO of one.
Business.
And so I said, oh, I'm outside of the day-to-day, I'll start another business, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:39
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So when I was 28 years old, we made Twenty Eight billion dollars and Seventeen million dollars in profit.
And the next year, I made one of the biggest mistakes my business career which was I started another business.
And so what I ended up doing was I was CEO of one business and so I said, oh, Outside of the day-to-day, I'll start another business because there's this big pile of money right here that I can't say no to because I'm a capitalist and I should I should definitely do that.
1:07
And so the next year we did 37 million dollars in top-line revenue and and we did 13.4 and profit.
So my profit went down and murder of a revenue went up.
Now I could try and you know BS you and tell you that it was because we reinvested in new infrastructure and all that stuff and we did.
But candidly it was because starting the business at that time, given the skills that they had was a mistake.
1:26
And so what I want to do is talk to you about a conversation that I had.
Had with my neighbor who was a trash man and he went from trash man to Cashman and sold his.
His business for multiple eight figures and we were talking one day and he was really excited.
1:41
I was like, hey man, what's going on?
He was like my non-compete.
It's today.
I was like, oh well I mean what does that mean for you?
You know he's like well I'm going to start another business so I was like what do you start do?
This is exciting.
New chapter etcetera is like a woman to do the exact same thing.
1:57
Again.
It was like what you mean?
He's like, I'm going to build the exact same.
I'm trash company and I'm going to sell it to the exact same company.
You bought my first company, what you this opportunity to start with all the capital and all the knowledge you have now you will do the exact same thing.
Don't you want something like new and different?
2:13
And he was like, no, he's like, why would I start over brand-new?
He's like, I'm so good at trash.
And I spent the last three years working for the company that bought me.
I learned stuff from them, and I already had my knowledge that I came in with, you know, with my own company.
So, I understand the scale even better than I did before and I know how to start it from the from the ground up.
2:29
And what you have to understand about my neighbor is that he's not a warden or Harvard MBA, he's not some like, statistical Math Genius or anything like that.
He's a blue-collar guy from Wisconsin, who maxed out his credit cards to start a trash business where he literally was the first one, picking up, trash for residential homes in one night.
2:46
And then he just scaled that business through word-of-mouth and service with a smile.
And there's a lot of things that I feel like I learned from him, that I see all these people that reach out to me and their sons.
People were much more than I am, who reach out and they're like, hey men, like I've, you know, I've got this, I had a conversation the other day with an agency owner, who sorry, an agency coach, he coaches agency owners on how to scale their businesses news, at probably five or six million bucks a year.
3:08
And he was like, I'm thinking about going into General business and I was like why?
And he was like well it's just I'm people are asking me for you know how out there and it's I'm just turning down money and I was like duh that's the point.
The put like a strategy means knowing what you say no to and you know I shouldn't be necessary.
3:27
Shouldn't like just because somebody asked me For something doesn't mean I should change my entire business to say, yes?
Right.
You have to know who your avatar is and who it isn't, because otherwise if you try and be, you know, every every was it all things to all people.
You're nothing to no one.
And this was a huge mistake that I made earlier on in my career is because I didn't understand the the growth that I had to do was not through doing something different and new and exciting.
3:50
But the growth was going to come for me sticking with it was from developing the character traits of grit from developing the character traits of stick-to-itiveness from Open the character traits of perseverance of focus.
And I think that at all levels in business, you get seduced by woman in the red dress, which is the analogy that I like to use because at every level in business, like, if you know the Matrix, there's a woman in the red dress, who walks by Neo looks again, and then it's an agent pointing a gun at him.
4:15
And I think that a lot of the opportunities that come around towards us as we scale up, and it happens at all levels of business, every one of them, look, seductive and attractive and at every level, it actually becomes more and more attractive and you have to kind of defeat them, emotionally, Because it's so hard to turn down.
4:30
You know in the beginning you have to turn down ten thousand dollars then you have to turn out a hundred thousand dollars and you have to learn to turn down a million dollars, then ten million dollars and you know for me it turned out I wasn't able to turn down about, you know, 20 or 30 million dollars a year opportunity when I was doing about 20, 30 million dollars a year.
4:46
And what ended up doing is it cost me a tremendous amount of time and effort and probably lost growth on my main business at the time because I didn't know what I didn't know.
And so what I'm training with you guys, Mosey nation is hopefully the lessons Lessons that I learned from this, which is you can't be CEO of two businesses.
5:03
You can't serve two masters.
You have to.
If you were the one, running your business and CEO, make no mistake, is the one running the business, even though if you're not doing the day-to-day just because you're like, oh I'm an owner, you get paid for what you do, you get Returns on what you own and so if your business cannot run without you and you're like no I can run without me just because it can run without you for a day.
5:20
Doesn't mean Camp.
You can run without you, you have the attention.
It's the shower time headspace where you're thinking about new ways to improve the business, you're thinking about your threats, you're thinking about Innovation your thing The team members need to Circle back with.
It's the small nuances that create the Excellence in the business that your head space has to be dedicated to.
5:36
And when I split my attention, and I became CEO of two companies, and I was split my term to serve two masters.
I basically made the same amount of money and I just did this, and I think what ends up happening for most people is that one of the truths that I've observed is that the amount of money that I make is only proportional to the skill that I have as an entrepreneur period, that's it.
5:54
And so, if you start more businesses, you're just going to end up.
Up leveling out.
And so even though it looks like small unattractive, it's a small quick win that were choosing to take rather than confronting the hard brutal facts of why is the business I'm currently doing?
Not growing and if it is growing, well, is there a way that I can grow?
6:12
It better, you know what I mean?
Can I improve the product in a new way?
Can I, there's all these things that we can do to improve the existing business and I'll tell One More Story to drive this home.
So I got reached out to you by a guy that I went to high school with and he owned a general contractor business.
And so I was like cool man.
Like what do you guys do when you guys specialize in?
6:27
He's like, oh well we do a lot of Moves.
We do a lot of roof repairs.
We do new roofs, we do.
He's like, but I'm also doing like real estate stuff and Contracting and flipping, and all this other side also, like man, that's a lot of stuff was like, why are you doing all those things?
And he said, you know, I need to grow the different revenue streams, the business, and I was like, dude, there's, there's like 200 million homes in America that have roofs as like the biggest roofing companies in the world are billion dollar companies as like, why why do you feel like you need to do more things to grow bigger?
6:55
Because what happens is the better, you get the bigger you get yet, it's not the bigger, you get the better, you get better, but gets bigger, not the other way around.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
7:14
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
7:36
And so the deeper you can sink your roots.
In the more time you can put under the bar, this has been my finding the better, the business becomes and then as a result, the bigger it becomes.
Because it comes from the disproportionate gains and knowledge.
We get at the end of the track, not at the beginning right in the first, you know, year of whatever business you do, you're going to learn more than you ever will about that business than any other time.
7:57
But learning what you learn in the first year, is not the stuff that makes you better than the rest of the playing field.
It's learning what you learn in the 10th year in the 20th year, in that same business.
That gets you, the disproportionate returns.
And so the easiest way to think about this is like if you think about the Olympics because they're on right now or they are, hopefully, when you're watching this, who knows.
8:15
But the Olympics, right?
You've got sprinters.
And if you were the best friend in the world, you win the gold and you might only be one tenth of a second better than the fourth best friend in the world.
I don't know track metrics, but you get the idea right.
And so even though you're only this much better, the real world implications of being this much better is that it's from being gold and getting all the endorsements and Nike and Adidas and all the stuff versus being In getting almost no notoriety and I think the same thing happens in business, right?
8:40
It's a winner-take-all world are often times and the way that you can combat that is being able to develop the stick-to-itiveness.
It's the grit of understanding that your knowledge will compound with time.
It's using time as an asset, instead of a liability.
It's not being in a rush.
8:55
It's understanding that the growth account comes as entrepreneurs doesn't come from new.
It comes from from doing the same, it comes from volume, right?
Which is one of the core tenets that we have at all of our He's is do the boring work, right?
We're willing to consistently confront, the hard fact of like, okay, if we're not growing that it's our fault.
9:12
It's not because we need to introduce a new thing, it's because we need to confront.
What is not happening.
Why aren't we getting more word-of-mouth?
Because fundamentally if our thing was so good, that every single person should tell their friends, and we shouldn't even have to Market or so, right, because we should be so good at that.
So there's always areas for improvement that we just don't want to confront because it makes our egos feel bad and then we try and use our business to satisfy our interpersonal.
9:31
Needs its try to satisfy our insecurities and the holes that we have.
Because we want to To have more attention, we want to have more status or we want to have more interpersonal relationships, or we want to have novelty in our life and we use our business to try and satisfy a personal needs.
When in reality, the business is only there to serve the customer.
And so this was one of the biggest lessons, one of the hardest hardest lessons, I've had to learn.
9:52
And to make this to drive this last Point home to make this real for everybody to show you that this isn't me just saying this, when I started my first five years in business, I think I had like 11 businesses And it was only once I chose to commit to one of them that I saw the disproportionate returns in my life and it was through sticking with it for a long period of time.
10:10
Riley, like, I had my chain of gyms, right?
And then at that after that point I was like, I'm going to start an agency.
So I started a Cairo agency and I started a dentist agency and I started I had another thing I can remember was I going on and I had my six gyms and they were all different types of models that different Partnerships.
10:26
I was spread so thin I was all over the place because I kept thinking the false premise, which is one of these things will take off when the reality of none of them will all Any of them could, but none of them will if I have all of them.
And so, you have to pick and you have to commit.
And the thing is, is that I think a lot of things that come with success, or not, intellectually difficult to comprehend, their just emotionally difficult, which is why most people don't do them.
10:48
Most people understand that you have to, you know, spend less than you make, right?
But no one does it.
Most people know that you if you want to lose weight, you gotta eat less than you burn, right?
But people don't do it.
It's simple, not easy.
And I think that a lot of times in business, at every level of the game, you have a More attractive opportunity.
11:04
You have a woman in the red dress, who walks by that you have to say no to because that's what it means to have a strategy and that's where the compounding Returns come from and that of doing more of being able to stick your head down and continue through what you said you were going to do is what creates the growth.
And so there's a story that I heard about Henry Ford and he was, he was walking his Co office was here and he walked past marketing every day.
11:28
And so you walked every day and walk every day and you'd see this campaign that they were running, right?
And after like three or four months he was like, hey John, he's like dude why don't you stop running this ad.
He's like I'm so sick of it and the CMO smiled and looked at it was like we honestly haven't even started running it.
11:45
And so we get sick of these things in our business that has nothing to do with the marketplace.
It's only because of our own internal needs.
And so we sabotage things inside our own business because we want to satisfy things inside of us that have nothing to do with business.
And so, I think what happens is that's why I say, like it's skills its beliefs and it's character traits.
12:00
And so, a lot of times I think to get to the next level, we have to look at Often think, you know, for me you know, which one of these things do I lack?
Is it a belief about the world that is incorrect?
Is it a trait that I have not developed yet?
Or is it a skill that I lack?
And so I think a lot of entrepreneurs get stuck because what they do is they start doing too many things and they get spread to thing because they like to recreate chaos in their lives because whatever traumatic childhood story, they tell themselves about, you know, how they had chaos in their early life.
12:25
They try and recreate it in their business because that's where they feel comfortable.
So consciously and you have to unlearn those patterns in order to be able to consistently grow because honestly, the businesses that we have are fairly.
Boring.
I'll be honest with you they're not they're like they're not like crazy exciting all the time you know like we do the same things we Market, we sell we provide value, we get referrals and we try and do as much as that as we can over and over again but that gets boring and that's why do the boring work is one of the core tenets that I have and it's one of the hardest learned lessons that I've learned in my business career because you have to say no at every level and so my goal for this channel Mosey nation is that you can hopefully learn from the many failures that I've had so that you don't have to experience them for yourself.
13:01
That is my hope.

0:00
I have shed friends every season of my life.
My close circle is always been very, very small.
Very, very small.
Very, very small, very small, non-existent.
I also feel like I grow really quickly because I don't hold onto things along the moment.
0:17
Something, doesn't provide me value?
I shut it.
I think about my life, in three to five years.
Season's first I was a high school womanizer for the most part and then I was also like really deeply angry.
I had high school friends that when I left High School.
I basically stopped being in contact with them and then I had my come to Jesus, where my dad was like, you suck is human, you have terrible reputation, maybe you should stop being who you are.
0:38
Cleaned up my ACT, I stopped drinking nearly, as much as I was, I started going to school and studying 12 hours a day, present the fraternity.
And that was my college season.
And I had College friends, and then when I left College, I pretty much stopped being contact with anyone that I went to college with most people suck at most things and aren't Bound for greatness because of who they are.
0:55
And the choices they're willing to make the stories about friends leaving the hometown.
And no longer remember where they're from is one that is told by Society because Society is the majority, the majority of people get left behind.
If you look at the things that you want to get in life, there's a price for them, you don't buy everything, you see in the mall, why not?
1:14
Because you don't want to pay the price, just because you might think that a shirt or jacket is cool.
Just because you think an outcome is awesome, you might not be willing to make the trade winners and losers have the same goals.
The goal doesn't make you unique, it's the willingness to pay the price that makes you unique.
It's like everyone's to be rich.
One of the reasons that I cut people out sooner than most is because I do not like the labels they speak over me.
1:36
One of the big things with identity is the labels that we say about ourselves.
I am X, I am impatient.
I am angry.
I am whatever.
Right?
I am poor.
I don't like saying it.
People in your past, have the identity that they know you as and then they will speak and they will beat that labeled you because you're not matching their pattern.
1:55
Why are you changed?
You are xur why and you're trying to not be that because We're doing something different than changing your growing, but they see it as change.
And that's why the best response in the world to someone who says, hey, you've changed is a.
Yeah.
You have it.
The amount you like or love someone is directly proportional which were willing to give up to maintain the relationship.
2:14
For example.
If there's a piece of shit car, right?
You work on it all the time.
You might say that guy must really love it because of how much time you put into that thing.
This guy must really love his country because he's willing to give his life for it.
What are you willing to give in exchange to maintain the relationship?
If you're not willing to give up basically anything, Maintain their relationship.
2:31
Then, how much do you love them?
I think it's been a very helpful filter for me to say not, do I love my friends but which friends do I love the most, which friends am I willing to sacrifice the most to keep the relationship?
And I am a big believer in utility.
There is an exchange.
In every relationship, you get something and they get something back, people don't like the idea that relationships are transactional, But they are transactional just has a commercial vibe to it, but if we just think about it as from a behavior standpoint, you've got two things that can happen.
2:59
Behavior is reinforced or it is punished.
That's it.
We have exchanges quite literally with people.
Those exchanges are either reinforced or they're punished.
Part of the strength of the relationship is, how long you're willing to wait for the next time that relationship is reinforced.
If you have a long history of positive experiences with the person, you're willing to wait a longer period of time if they're going through a breakup.
3:18
They're having a hard time to keep the relationship.
But at some point, even if you've been friends with him for 10 years, if there's just not any positive reinforcement.
At some point you do cut it off, the people who were surrounded with when we grow up it's very unlikely just from a population standpoint that they're going to be great statistically that they're going to be the top one percent or point.
3:37
One percent is unlikely so it would make sense that you change your friends over time.
Why do people get so weird about keeping relationships that don't serve them.
I think it's just because we have a societal story around it that you're a bad friend, but I could also think of me being as a good friend to my next From that I just made room for there's gonna be a friend who's going to move in to my spot on my buddies.
3:55
Calendar who does want to do fantasy football?
Who does want a drink with him on Sunday?
So it's not this like, all right, I'll go to the game with you but I'm not drinking, dude.
Not going to come on, man, because the other guys, like, yeah, shots all around, they're going to have a blast.
They would better be served with people who want the same things as them just because I'm not seeing them anymore, doesn't mean that I don't wish them well.
4:14
But if someone only tells you the stories of when you got fucked up and why you did that stupid thing, they're encouraging and retelling the story of who you used to be.
Then you want people around you who don't believe the lies you used to tell about yourself.
The character traits shift is not a binary.
It's how patient are you?
4:30
How kind are you?
How loyal are you how honest are you?
And so you want people who encourage you in the behaviors that you want to be like in.
This is why I like shedding identities is such a core part of Entrepreneurship is that you have to be willing to say I am no longer this way.
I will no longer behave in this way and I don't accept that reality is truth.
4:49
Many of the people I had around me.
Hey we're willing to pay the price that I was willing to pay for the things that I wanted but also wanted me to give them more than I was willing to.
And so I'll give you a story that will paint me in a bad light and that's fine.
There was a teacher that I grew up with in high school.
He's the one who stayed with me after school for a year and worked out with me two hours a day and you taught me how to work out.
5:10
I got in shape, got more confidence, better at school from their that snowballed into me getting the fitness, huge Catalyst snowball.
Somebody heard that story and then found the teacher and they linked us.
He was like hey man, I'm not asking for.
Otto.
Love to just have like a 2-hour quality every week.
I was like a 2-hour call every week was like I don't even talk to my mother that much.
5:29
I'm talking anyway, that much talk to my wife, that's it.
The value, the relationship was in the past, maybe like, Alex, you're a horrible person and that's possible.
Maybe I am.
I was not willing to give two hours a week. 100 hours a year for the rest of my life, to pay a debt for somebody worked out with me as we only have so much Juju.
We only have so much time with so much Focus, so much energy that we can pour into things and if you're not putting all your energy in One Direction, it's scattered and Then you don't move this fast.
5:52
My closest friend, I spend one hour a week with every week my closest, friend like clockwork.
It's my highest party meeting.
It is something that brings me joy and we get lots of exchange with one other.
He's Wonder helps you write my book so I can Kashi dr.
Kashi here.
I get a lot from them.
Now, if I didn't get anything from that over time, slow down the communication between us.
6:10
I would make it every other week once a month, if you slow down your communication Cadence with someone how frequently you see them.
And when you accept invitations, it naturally Fizzles but if it gets to a point where it's someone's like so close that it would be obvious in a conversation used to Add, I encourage you to just have it.
You want to be a kind person.
6:26
And the way you are kind is that you tell the truth and you just be honest.
And the easiest way that I can tell you to be honest is you know when you talk about somebody behind their back, just say it to them.
So yes, Andres been like all over the place lately and she's like, I don't drink it a little bit too much Sandra.
You've been all over the place lately.
6:41
You've been drinking a little bit too much, I'm just not sure if I want to say with that right now.
People don't have the balls to do that, but if you do that, I promise, you either have better relationships or you'll be done with this Mickey Mouse bullshit of not even being.
In a real relationship and not wanting to confront reality because you may have a shot at getting them to realize that they're not on the path that they wanted to be on because you were friends with them at some point.
6:59
And so either your goals have changed or there's half if you listen to Kobe's interviews where he talks about his friends, he says very explicitly.
That he's willing to put everything on the Altar for his dream.
Now, some people make make the argument, that's not quote healthy.
The question that were answering her is not how do we do healthy stuff?
7:17
Question is, how do we become the greatest?
People will judge you.
On how you spend time and their judgments are simply Expressions that they would not spend their time the same way you do.
Hey, you work a lot and I could say, hey, you don't to the same degree.
It's like you spend so much time with your kids Right?
7:35
If I say it like that, be like, wait, no.
I'm supposed to it's only the supposed to this.
The thing that gives all the emotional charge, these conversations, otherwise it's just observing reality.
You can't expect to do the same thing.
Everyone else is doing and somehow achieve a different outcome.
Once you have the vacuum of friends because you'll probably have weeded people out, then the best thing to do is join communities and then you'll make friends people in those communities who have the same goals as you and then if you crush it because you understand, that volume is the answer.
7:57
And time is the ingredient.
You're going to rise in that community and you'll gain more status.
And you'll start hanging out with people who are the top of that community.
And then you can leave LeapFrog into other communities.
It's just lunch tables on steroids.
I've wanted to live a rare life and so I will have to be surrounded by real people.
And real people are by definition rare are not common.
8:14
My Hope Is that the people that I meet now are trying to go all the way with me.
I want to do epic shit if I die and don't you epic shit I will be bummed.
How much am I willing to endure or sacrifice in order to maintain that relationship that I have with my dream.
If I have many, many friends over different seasons, I'm totally cool with that.
8:33
Thank you for that season.
It was awesome.
So, I don't believe things need to be forever to be good.
So, I don't believe things need to be forever to be good.








0:00
When I start a really long time trying to narrow it down, because we believe in three values rather than five or 10 or whatever, because you can triangulate thinking, it's very difficult to map, five values or ten values against like a decision.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:20
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I don't know if I ever told you this.
I might have told you this but you a conversation me and you had I believe it was the first time we met.
It was backstage at fhl, right?
And I had this course that at the time was like the hot Facebook ads course.
0:37
Right.
And we're standing back there and I'm, you know, back then I was this little pudgy, skinny fat, dude sitting there, all with those stupid bunny here, had on my head and stuff.
And you just I can sense your disapproval like through your, through your Pores.
0:54
And I said to you, I was like, hey man, like how's it going with Facebook as whatever you're like?
Oh like, yeah.
At the time you were like, I don't know how to do Facebook, as I suck at them.
You just were like, just, I don't even know, and I'm like, well, what is your Roi here?
Like, I don't know.
It's like 20 x.
I'm like, wait a minute.
1:10
What am I?
What do you mean?
20 exit?
I'm like I'm at like 5 x at you know spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
What wait how are you doing this?
You know and you're like oh like our cheapest.
Sonic 216 grants.
I don't give a shit what our Facebook ads cost and when you said that my entire world changed because at the time we were push anywhere from six to a million six, hundred million a month on a thousand dollar product and when you said that immediately I realized that.
1:40
And this is something that I see other entrepreneurs.
Just don't get they believe everything revolves around what button you push in the dashboard and this is life, right?
This is reality in entrepreneur world.
Is you got to push this button, you To know how to do this thing with this look like none of that shit matters if you have, if you don't have good creative and you don't have a good product that you're going to in the margins on make sense.
2:01
So when you said that, I was like, wait a minute, there are far more important things in this world, then these little Tech things.
And so I fundamentally changed my business model and I met, I went all in on high ticket and since then we were just able to we went for spending like, you know, 700,000 to make a million to spend.
2:23
Like 80,000 to make like 600 that it was just nuts and you just revolving around that.
And so I don't know if I ever told you that but that that that one conversation because I'm the type of person when I hear something, that makes sense to me.
I'm like Ali and like, I'll burn the walls around me and build something new, you know, just to make sure that I understand at a higher level.
2:45
And so I read your book last week, Jim lot, secret secrets, and what I thought was yeah, of course I did.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, one of those interesting about it, if you do Ctrl H on like a digital copy and you replace gym with just water product, I thought about it, I like really considered just literally relaunching it and just call it like, coaching Secrets because his gyms are coaching business has the brick and mortar.
3:10
So I think that's why we were able to actually build our licensing business, with Jim launch.
So quickly was because, like, I had already spent five years.
I didn't know as a coaching business, but like when people come into the gym to work out and lose weight, like your coach, Like, it's what it is.
And I had a staff of like already knew all this stuff but I didn't know I knew it.
3:27
So anyway, so yes, that Biz that book is 100% a play book on how to build a coaching business.
I know this is reading it and I'm like, I'm like, nobody's reading this fucking book.
I got my God, that mean for free coaching, their the gym people are, but the coaches are like, oh, it's Jim, it's Jim stuff.
I don't need that.
3:42
And I'm reading it and I'm like, what you do is just crazy to me.
So let me do this.
Let me ask you a couple of rapid-fire tactical questions because I always like to get some soup.
Pert.
I mean, I love the high level stuff.
It's the most important stuff, but from a tactical perspective, right?
3:58
You mentioned word-of-mouth tactically.
I'll just, just to kind of like set the stage.
I'll give you, I'll give you one tactic that I've used for Word of Mouth.
I love to know how you engineer word of mouth because I'll give you an example.
We used to do webinars.
4:13
When I would do, I would have like, a free Facebook group or some sort of free community.
I would do a live webinar.
And then what I would do is I remember hearing about this thing called Shrilling or Shilling.
It's where you hire people to come into a room and you pay them to buy the product and say, hey, I'm buying the product, it creates crowd psychology or mob mentality and everybody buys.
4:35
Well, I don't like and it's illegal, it works so good at Celia.
Well, I don't like to do anything illegal, go to jail or getting in trouble.
So I thought, how can I get that same effect, but do it ethically.
So I made this little technique called the ethical shrill, and what I would do is at the webinars.
Hey, listen, you're in the free group right now and say, you got on this webinar, Once you buy, I want you to go into the free group and post.
4:57
Hey, Dan, I just bought the program, please.
Add me to the student group and we sell 50 people on the webinar, 50 people in the group would go and post that, and then people who weren't even on the webinar, they would just freak out and start buying the product.
5:12
They be like, what are you buying, where is it, and they'd send them the order page and we do 100.
We double the conversion on the webinar, and there is a huge chunk of people wearing them.
On the webinar.
And I know that that's a very like specific sort of short-term word-of-mouth, sort of hack.
5:29
But tactically, since you believe that word of mouth is like one of the best things.
Like if you were to go to a company and say, Hey listen here's how you're specifically.
How you're going to increase your word of mouth?
What would you tell them?
This is a good question, so there's two.
There's two kind of components to this.
So the first one is like there is what I would consider a linear way of doing Word of Mouth, which is kind of what you outline.
5:50
And there's a lot of different tactics around that.
And when I say linear, it's kind of a thing earlier where you get a one-to-one relationship, where you say, every time we do this, we get an additional 20 percent or whatever it is, right?
And so those ones are, you know, like when the sales guy closes somebody's like, hey do you have any other, you know, gym owner, friends or do any other other people who might benefit from same thing?
6:07
Like, just asking that question.
We just get referrals and we can bring it in, right?
And so, like, little things like that people, like well obviously, but then no one does it, right?
Like that's that's the thing.
Is that?
Like no one does, right?
And so, in terms of like engineering, the customer experience, like, for us, the thing that gives you the quadratic returns and like I was saying earlier, there's a million ways you can do.
6:27
Like, we call the hinge method where it's like, you the person that is your customer and then their friend and you a three-way message, we called the hinge and then that's how you bring them in.
If you're in an in-person business, you're like, hey Sandy.
Do you have any friends who would like this kind of thing and if they say Yes, and you're like awesome.
6:42
So how about this, you take their phone from them and then you take a picture of you and her and then you text it to a thread with the three of you.
And then that way, it comes initiated from the friend with you already being the report kind of being shown as you in person with this other person.
6:58
So then they can't ghost.
You the can't be rude to you and then you already have so much more like, you know, like and Trust just from that little exchange, right?
So like that's like there's tons of little tactical weed stuff that's like that, you know, we could spend probably the The, our just going over, little things like that, but the big ones are the metrics that I was saying earlier, right?
7:18
It's how can we drive time to Value?
How can we increase the emotional win that the speed with which someone experienced an emotional win in the product, right?
So like one of the companies we have the way that their business model works, is that it takes like 90 days or someone from the day, they start to the day.
7:33
They basically make their first dollar doing this thing, right?
And a lot of times it's like real estate deals like something like, it might just take a long time for someone, you know, can Money and so rather than just say, like up life sucks, I guess that's just what it is, we think, okay, well, how can we, how can we give someone a win in seven days, right, how can we, how can we get as material of when it's humanly possible and then how can we string them along with emotional victories in shorter time periods?
7:57
And then of these emotional victories, which of these are activation points.
And so, the way that we find out activation points, as we look at what are the customers in this works better when you already have some business that's been going on for a meaningful amount of time.
You say, what are the my favorite customer?
Right?
And so, then we say okay, well, these are the people that I love working with using ones that crushed it for me, etcetera.
8:16
And we said okay, what experience that they have and what steps did they go through that?
Other people didn't go through.
And so usually we can find a few key points that along their life cycle.
That if we can just then reorient, everyone towards those activation points, it's like hey like clickfunnels figured out that if someone makes their URL with the landing page there like they stick five times longer, right?
8:38
So then all of a sudden they had to they created that as part of Onboarding.
And then they started paying for the domains because they just wanted everyone to do.
Is they need they got five times stick, right?
And so it's what, are these non-traditional kpis?
We call metrics that matter.
Right.
Mgm's that we can drive their activity based?
8:54
Which is like okay if someone and I like for Jim on for example it was like I don't talk about the perfect because it's their companies and I don't to show their stuff.
But like for Jim lunch, for example, we knew that if we could get someone to close a two thousand dollar sale and their first seven days and this is people who are used to selling $99 things like we can get them to close.
9:11
A 2000 or high ticket sale in the first seven days, we massively, extend the lifetime value of a customer and then secondarily.
If we can get them to collect 20 thousand dollars in their first month with us.
That like they're in.
Yeah, I mean, like they're in for a year, you don't even know.
No questions asked.
9:26
We are Roi the entire program, the first month in cash collected.
So it's how can we engineer these handful of events and in a b2c business, it might be like, we lost driven, so, it doesn't have to be money, right?
It's just like, what is What is the Closest or a chunk down outcome that we can express to them.
9:44
Prompts them would be meaningful them that they would then.
And for like clickfunnels, if you have your own site and you see your domain, there's like this feeling of ownership, feeling of accomplishment.
That's so see, that's not about making money.
But this is what are these micro events?
And so you do is you take the best guys, you map their customer journey, and a lot of times you could do that qualitatively to you interview.
10:01
All your best guys, me say what was like really meaningful or some of the big magical moments you've had when you're working with us and you get this big list of them?
And you're like, all right, well, these ones we can and Denier this one, we can totally engineer and then you start building that into the customer journey to increase the lifetime value.
10:17
And then that's what ultimately drives, the word of mouth.
So all of that to go back to like, what is, what drives word-of-mouth exceptional product, and if you get exceptional product, how do you build exceptional product, you build experiences that drive the results that people want in a choreographed way.
So, to sort of put a different perspective on that for these online coaches, you almost.
10:35
It's almost like you funnel, hack yourself?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I've always I've always said.
The you know, the the only person you should final hack is yourself because you know if you got some 80 year old dude, with white hair selling the same product that you sell.
They're gonna have a different audience are going to have different objections, are going to have a completely different experience, you know, then then you and I remember you saying it, I was a YouTube video or something.
10:58
You were like, hey the easiest way to increase the amount of customers you get.
It's just hire a spokesman, have them say the same stuff you're saying and you'll attract new people like you you're like this big Big Hulkamania dude, right?
And maybe some like you know timid soccer.
11:16
Dad is just going to automatically not like you because you have muscles and he does and he just gets it in his head right?
Or maybe somebody who could be anything really an old Asian lady.
You know I mean like even just going you know I mean like more the other direction.
Yeah or maybe somebody dated a bodybuilder and he was an asshole and they've developed this.
11:34
This idea what it could be dumb stuff but you put somebody else on there.
They say the same exact thing.
Boom.
You got a customer and that leads me to To my next question.
So this is one of the things that we do this presentation of building right now.
But you can see each of these people are people that are now, like, faces of the company, which is what allowed us to sell it and also attract different demographics.
11:55
It's like, alright, we've got either our city.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I agree 100% And so it's like we have to attract different email me that that slide deck to Danna, but let me ask you this.
A lot of people that listen to my stuff and and And, you know, my just anything, my YouTube whatever, they're, they're either online.
12:15
Coaches course creators or they have some sort of business that revolves almost entirely around their personal brand, meaning it's them, right?
So so when people buy from them, especially if they buy High ticket, they want them.
They want to interact with them, they want to talk to them if they say something, it's they need to hear it from them.
12:34
Etc.
Etc, etc.
You know their staff or this is not good enough.
And so for somebody who is in Apparently, the bottleneck of their business because it's pretty much based on their brand.
Like, I noticed it when you run ads, it says Jim Lots, it doesn't say Alex her Mosey, but most of these personal brand based businesses, they run it with their name.
12:53
What is the biggest piece of advice for other thing that they could do now to start thinking about how they can remove them?
Still make the same amount of money, still grow their business, but remove themselves as that, that bottleneck.
Like if they got hit by a bus, would the company still run type of thing?
13:09
Yeah, so I mean, I mean, it's easier, it's easier to transition to customer-facing first, like it's a good intermediary.
Is that instead of marketing, your face, you Market, all your customers results, right?
And you can do that from a brand and so that slowly starts to build the brand and then people are like, and they associate these successes with the brand new start building brand Equity, right?
13:30
And then I have a big slant or penchant for database marketing.
And so it's something that I never hear anybody talk about.
I still haven't made a training on it because I it's like so secret sauce.
So fucking good, but I'll share with the audience.
The reason, most people don't mark it with data is because a they don't collect it, right, and they usually don't collect it because it's probably not that good.
13:51
And so it's usually like fix their, like, start collecting it, realize how bad it is.
And then now you can start driving to fix it and then once you get good data back from like like I can tell you all the metric and it's in every video.
It's in every piece of copies on every landing page is like we on average triple the profit of a brick and mortar business.
14:09
Brick mortar gym in Twelve months have seen that in your ads, you always go back to that, that's true.
Right?
Because that's that's the logic and I actually tend to have probably I'd say a relatively contrarian view on persuasion and I think that it's the higher up, the ticket amount.
14:26
The more logic is employed in the purchase because like, if you're, you know, Camille like you're closing a 10 million dollar deal, it's not like, let me tell you this Epiphany Bridge story when I was like, you and I didn't have a 10 million dollar, you know, I mean, it's just like it's a different buyer.
Higher.
And so the higher, the ticket price, the more I think, logical reasoning.
14:44
You have to employ to get the yes because this is my belief.
They're there because they wanted already emotional, they want the promise, right?
And what we're doing is giving them the logical reasons to justify the decision.
And so most people if you make the promise, they just immediately don't believe you.
15:02
And so then it's how can I, they want the thing?
They just don't believe it.
And so it's like, how can I help you believe in a lot of that?
For me is giving them logical reasoning around that.
And if you've noticed any in any of the, as a gym on Trends in general, a lot of it is Data driven.
It's just like guys, Like this is the average, you know, amount of leaves that are guys, got.
15:21
This is the amount of sales that they're able to generate this, the amount of extra cash are able to add.
This is how much we cut their turn the sandwich.
We like, this is the data, I'm like, and if you're below these benchmarks, we can help you get to these benchmarks.
And if you're above it, awesome, then you don't need us.
You don't even like cool.
And if you expect that you're going to learn the same amount just iterating on your One Gym spending your whole life, trying to fix it, where we can iterate across 1,000 gyms and learn every month.
15:45
So much faster to create the best model then power to you.
I mean, but I don't think that's reasonable, but if you want to believe that awesome, right?
It just makes these very, very logical conclusions.
And the thing is that, the point I'm making here is that when you have data based or logical arguments, anyone can say them, right?
16:02
Some of the more charismatic, emotional driven maybe storage or like, if you have an origin story, a lot of people resonate with etcetera.
Those would be things that will build the founders business in the phase.
Space business, perlier right.
But if we could transition to customer stories, we can transition to more database marketing.
Then you level up, and And the problem that most people experiences that they create unsubstantiated claims, right?
16:23
And so the first reason that we collect the data is so that we can substantiate our claims and so we can be compliant marketers, right?
The thing is a lot of people don't like the data that they collect, right?
Because it's right because it turns out only 20% of their people even log in, you know what I mean?
Like, stuff like that.
But you can still always figure out a way to show, hey, of people who a logged in showed up, to 44, coaching calls, or whatever it is, right?
16:48
And sent the emails that we told them to send.
This is the this is the average parent.
So then all of a sudden it's like I didn't say everybody but I'm saying of the people who did these five things, and here's where it gets cool.
When you have the data that you can, you can substantiate the marketing.
You also use the activities that generate that outcome that you slice the data with as the guarantee points, right?
17:09
And that's where your customer experience starts driving towards it.
Then all of a sudden you this harmony between, how I marketing that gets the best outcomes the client experiences someone go.
Through because they're like well shit.
I I mean if I have to attend for coaching calls, send this email and XYZ to get that guarantee and that outcome, then I'll do it.
17:27
And then all of a sudden, the client outcomes improve even more.
And so it becomes this virtuous cycle of like you said, funnel hacking yourself, and saying, like, what are the best guys doing?
What are the key activities?
Great, I can slice the data and show that because I just looked at it that becomes my front end that's data driven rather than face driven.
17:43
And then the client experience is identical to what I told them it was going to be.
So you have this this parallelism which is Of the biggest issues that happens a lot of businesses is they promise this thing, and then their onboarding, the product was totally different because they've been changing their hooks changing their offers changing their funnel.
But then they sell the same product.
And so there's this disconnect between what I bought and what I got, right?
18:01
And so it's really, you can improve a business just by like being consistent.
This is what you said, this is what you saw.
This is what you get, right, A lot of times, it's one of the easiest ways to increase the value of business, right?
And so it's doing that across the board over and over and over again.
And it creates a virtuous cycle that improves the puppet.
18:18
Awesome.
Awesome.
That there's a lot that you can impact from there and I think that if anybody listening is really listening, they can Implement things.
You know, like, as you were saying and I was thinking, OK, Google form and then I had this insane thing.
I was like, one of the questions would be like if there was a magical telepathic, fairy that asked you, if you did everything, we told you to do.
18:41
And if you lied, you would lose an appendage.
Would you say that you followed our advice?
Yes, or no.
And then and of the people that said, yes, how much money did it make?
How much do they increase their business?
Etc.
Etc.
You know, one final question in your dealings right whether it be a dinner meeting somebody at an event doing business with someone portfolio company whatever, right?
19:06
What is the one characteristic quality or there is a red flag that you see in an entrepreneur where you're just like nope I'm not going to even associate with this person and then on the flip side, what?
The one that you go, man.
This this is somebody, I should know part of his two sides of the same coin but the second one probably has a little bit more explanation.
19:26
So I mean the red flags always ego, okay?
Always like it's always ego as he go like, as for personal life, that's for business, especially they spent more than anything for portfolio companies.
It's the number one thing that we look for is humility and there's a variety of reasons but like, ego flows to everything.
19:48
Close to coachability, it flows to their ability, to be to learn and change their character traits to become what is required like a lot of flows from ego.
And like a lot of the ability to lead like being a servant leader comes from humility and to build a 30 million dollar fifty million dollar, hundred dollar company, like you need to have that in my opinion.
20:07
So I think a lot of like there's, you know, there's these charismatic leaders that exists but the, you know, Jim Collins is written a lot about this and like, degrade in both the last.
And a lot of these things he talks about, like that, 5 L who puts the customer first, who puts the company first, who doesn't try to take credit and you always takes blame and gives gives away credit to everybody else and it's honestly very rare and that's why the vast majority, you know, right now we accept point two percent of the companies that apply, you know, to become portfolio companies.
20:40
So it's, it's not you mean, it's an investment model, it's different, you know, I mean, in for us, it's like, I only need one Facebook.
Like, I don't need to have 100.
You know I mean like the biggest company we have does 250 a day so you know I mean like I don't need a lot of ask you what industry, but I know you're not going to right?
20:59
So like there's you know I mean like we have some some companies and they've grown a lot, right?
And even that one we grew by just simplifying everything and just saying what are the points of Leverage and I'm going to wrap this with something that you said earlier which is like you realize the high-ticket thing and then that was a huge like Breakthrough you know in your Grant I remember the conversation, really?
21:18
Like, so what were you were saying that you're selling you know, all these courses and at the time if I recall correctly, I was getting 101.
Yeah, that's right.
It was some disgusting, you know, I'd because I remember that I gave a presentation at that one, and I remember the bus station and the thing is, is I was like, yeah, man.
21:35
I was like, I feels like a lot of work.
It's like, you gotta sell like that's like, like 500 customers.
Make 500 Grand.
I was like, I need to sound like not that I need to sell a tender that I need to sell.
Like a twentieth of that I was like, yeah, I just sold like 40 people.
21:51
I would make that money, you're like 40 people and I was like, yeah and I just remember that because like I think that was where it's like a perfect example of, the audience of like, finding points of Leverage is like, is the leverage in my ability to buy an Arbitrage media and do all the tech little optimizations?
22:10
Or is there one Domino do the Tim Ferriss illusion, right?
Or is there one big leverage point that if I just crank that one, everything else?
Falls into place, right?
Like if you, if you can figure out in the, in the reverse way, isn't it?
The answer is not raise your prices.
I mean, sometimes it is, but that is the outcome of the deeper thing, which is figure out a way to provide more value.
22:29
And so, like, if you can find a way to make someone a million dollars, you can charge 250 Grand.
Right.
Right.
Like the reason we come with the portfolio companies and I have this visual that I just made yesterday about it.
But like we come in and we had we, you know, we get a minority stake for all the interest that we do.
22:45
But it's also because like, if I create 50 Million dollars in net worth for an entrepreneur.
Is it unreasonable for me to ask for ten most people would say no?
Right.
It's like well how do you sell stuff for ten million dollars?
It's like we can make some 150.
That's how you cell phone antenna.
That's how you sell stuff for 10 minutes.
23:01
So you acquire the skills to do the thing.
And most people want to sell stuff for 10 million, but they have 100,000 or skill set.
And then what happens is, they destroy the reputation and then the word of mouth monster comes and eat them.
Eat them alive, right?
And so you ask about what is the thing?
That's big red flag, which is you go.
What is the thing that You know, we look for its three things and they're the values, the company.
23:21
So it's the same thing that I look for our personal life.
Same thing that I look for in employees and same thing, we look for a portfolio company.
So when I spent a really long time trying to narrow it down because we believe in three values rather than 5 or 10 or whatever, because you can triangulate thinking, it's very difficult to map, five values or ten values against like a decision.
23:38
And so, the first one is, do we believe this person's unimpeachable character?
Would we be proud to associate with this person on and off the field?
Right?
And like being proud, not just like, Being associated.
But I be proud.
I brag about my association with this person, right?
That's unimpeachable character, right?
23:54
In all ways, and it's on and off the field, which is hard.
Because some people like week, you don't hire someone because some of their personal decisions and like yeah 100%.
Yeah, because extreme is can't differentiate, it's hard to give advice, you know what I mean in general, if people think that you you know cheated on your wife like peep it's harder for people to do that because even if it's good business advice psychologically, it's difficult, right?
24:16
And I'm a realist I think that people are not going to be persuaded by this person.
Are they gonna have all these chips stacked against them?
I'm just, I can just choose to make a different bet.
You don't even like, I can just choose to vote on a different jockey that on a different different jockey, right.
24:31
It's all is.
So one is not a peaceful character.
The second is sincere Candor.
It's not like can they not bullshit me?
That's not what zero Cantor has.
Since your candor is a, can they have the hard conversations, both taking the hard feedback and incorporating it?
24:47
And that is an element of humility and then also have the empathy to care about the people on their team and give them feedback when it is required.
And a lot of people avoid those conversations, the real conversations, it's easy to just like you know, just give the you know, no BS, whatever like direct stuff.
25:05
But like being like hey Shirley you seem like you're your head's not in it lately and the team thinks that you're slipping and I want to figure out what's going on right now.
You know, we gave you that piece of feedback the other day and I felt resistance and it felt like your ego flared up, right?
25:23
Like hat.
Like you can you see my tone changes because like, to have these conversations, it's not easy, right?
And if you're going to build a 30 or 50 or 100 million dollar companies, the only thing that we're interested in investing in is entrepreneur.
So we thinking get there, right?
And so that's number two.
Number three is competitive greatness because sometimes you've got an amazing human but they're just like really content and I want to be honest.
25:47
There's nothing Wrong with that.
But make us a good company does not, you know what I mean?
So like, right, right, like sometimes it takes a little bit of teeth, you know, I mean, it takes a little bit of competitive drive, and desire, and sometimes that comes from fear of failure.
26:03
Sometimes it comes from insecurities, sometimes sometimes, and the ideal way is that?
It's a pool.
Not a push.
That's the perfect world.
But I accept somebody who is competitively great.
Michael, Jordan was 100% push not pull, right?
But he was still the greatest right in.
Like I I accept that there are different forms of fuel and I just want to make sure that whatever we are doing business with has one.
26:27
Look, look, guys.
You guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
26:51
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world.
Someone else.
I was going to try to sneak in one more really lame interview question like what's your number one interview hack but I already know your answer.
It's find out if Laila harre Mosey has the sister.
You told me this recently, you said you know find a basic like find a wife or husband that can be your greatest partner and can really help you grow.
27:16
And you know it's such it is kind of unorthodox advisor at least uncommon advice, you know.
But I thought that was who's the person you?
The most time with rights your your significant other and if that person is not supportive and and maybe even pushing you to go further, then, you know, my grandfather on my father's side, he was a German physicist and he always used to say constant exposure, always leads to some form of contamination.
27:43
And so if you are around someone all the time, that is not supporting you that's not supportive of that is you know Against the Grain, it is going to effect you no matter how much you try to separate it, no matter how much you try to be.
Independent.
And so I really did love that advice because it, it made so much sense.
28:03
You know, answer a question you didn't ask.
So I bet that's always my big question, what's the question?
I should be asking you.
So to find this.
And I'm actually thinking about this overall to, because I was having a branding conversation yesterday with our creative director, and I realized that, I think there's a parallel between branding and finding a maid.
28:23
So, hear me out though, I'm still working on this Lobby, I'm open to But I feel very confident in saying that there are three components that make a good marriage and obviously, you know, we're five years in and be like, I know you're young.
All right, cool.
I'll just wait 20 years and then people listen, whatever it is really.
And like my only my only dispelling of that is just that like the average marriage.
28:43
Married person spends two hours a day together, 45 minutes of that is watching television, 35 minutes of that is eating and 24 minutes of that is doing house chores and so the remainder of that time from that is like 20 or 30.
Minutes.
And that is it per day, right?
And so compare the amount of time that way and I spend together as like, we've already been married 45 years based on the amount of time that we spend together.
29:04
Oh, dude, that's a great point.
Just as a different, you know, different view different lens.
So I mean, I know somebody who literally only see each other on the weekends because they both work full time.
It's like, well, you spend one day a week together, you know?
I mean, like that's nothing.
Anyway, that's not my point, the but there are three things that I think create great relationships in general, the first is aligned Mission, which is Do we want to go to the same place, right?
29:29
And a lot of people don't even talk about this and it's like this is the life I want to live.
And for me it was like I want to do big shit and where I want to go will be hard and treacherous to get to right.
Are you down for that Journey?
29:45
A lot of people are not comma and that's okay.
It's just that they just might not be your person and these requirements that I put here, most people will fail as they should.
Should because you only need one.
Like I remember when I was I was in college and I was like this is all the things I'm looking for and someone's like and I was talking to a girl who's he was pursuing me and they were like, G's like, good luck finding that.
30:11
And I was like, I only need to find one.
Oh man.
That's such an amazing perspective on that because that dude, that that hits home because it makes sense like you, there's a cell.
There's all these fish in the sea but you have all these standards.
30:27
Yeah, but you only, you only need to find it once.
That's that's, that's a great perspective.
Yeah.
Like being hot is a price of admission.
It is not the guy, you know, I mean, like the end all be all that means like you have a ticket to play in the show, you know what I mean?
So one is aligned mission.
30:44
The second is similar values, right?
Or ideally, you know, same values which is, we know, we want to go.
But how do we want to get there?
It's a big part.
Some people want to get to the same place and they want to go out of a very, go about it very differently.
They have different values, right?
31:00
And the reason that's important is because you're going to get stimuli that that come in your life, you can have things obstacles.
And if you're presented with the same data, ideally you want to make this come to the same conclusion.
You want to make the same decision.
Ian.
And so, the variables that you weigh, and how you assign weight to those things are going to be your values.
31:20
And so whenever Layla and I because we've now been doing this a lot, we made a lot of decisions together a lot of big decisions.
If we ever have a time where we're not like, on the same page about something we don't immediately like fight it's just like what data do you have that?
I'm not working with because I'm making this conclusion because we have the same values.
31:37
We want to get the same place.
I'm making this conclusion based on these things.
What are you?
Making your conclusion off of and then she'll share her.
I'm like Didn't think about that?
That's a good one.
Or I'll share something.
Should be like, oh, totally to think about that.
That yeah, that makes complete sense, right?
And then we're like cool.
And then we are able, like, we haven't had, we've only had one decision in art art Merit that we disagreed on and I bulldozed Layla and it was the wrong decision and I was like, I'm doing it, you know what I mean?
32:02
And I should have done that and that's the thing and so like we have always come to the point where if we don't agree, we don't do, we don't do.
Whatever it is.
Like if we don't have any decision or a personal one it was business is business.
Okay, and the third piece so I mission where we want to go live values.
32:17
How we want to get there, right?
And then the third is, I like to say similar interest or you can say lifestyle, doesn't really matter what word to use, right.
But it's like, what are the interests that we have?
Because like, you might, like, you want to go to the same place, you want to go through the same way, but it's like, if the day-to-day we don't share interests, it becomes more difficult.
32:35
Like if I was, if I had somebody who is super driven had the same values but then like Wasn't into like Fitness.
It all like, didn't like exercise didn't like eating, you know, eating in a way that made sense, like didn't like, you know, walking, you know, just like, just like what are my day-to-day things that I like, or maybe they just love television.
32:53
I don't know.
Like it just are there things that they have that are interest that I'm like, I have no or maybe they're really big artists.
I'm not an artist.
I'm not into art really love museums and I'm like, fuck that sounds horrible.
Right?
Because I don't want to spend any time doing that.
Ready for that.
Like there's nothing wrong with that.
33:08
It's just like not my vibe, right?
And so, it's like because if we can have a lined into like the mission and values is Baseline, right?
And if we can have the similar interests, then we're going to spend more time together and then when we get both exposed to stimuli, we will both adapt the same way.
33:27
Whereas when people have different interests, they spend time being exposed to different things and then they end up adapting to the things that they're exposed to, which sometimes can be in the same direction, but sometimes it cannot be in the same direction.
And so you grow apart, right?
And So the similarity that I'm seeing this with, from a branding perspective is like what like, what is a brand right after?
33:47
I've been trying to break this down as like, what is bred to be like dude, I love your brand name.
Like what does it mean?
Right, so I'm like I think on some level, it's like there are some people who are aligned with me on the mission of what I'm trying to do.
And they're like, I think this is dope.
I'm down to, like, go along with you, right?
Go along for the ride.
And then they also aligned with the values of like how I want to get there like Gary Vee and I probably have similar missions but different values not a bad way.
34:11
You know, I mean, like we just do, you know, just do different things, different people, you know, I mean, it's nothing wrong with that, right?
Same thing is like, there's another girl who might not be your wife, but she might be someone's wife, right?
Just just different, right?
And then different interests, right?
And so if I think the brand, it's like this, where I want to go this, I want to get there.
34:27
And then this is like my day-to-day, my calves, my work, my dessert stuff.
My, you know, I mean like these are the day-to-day interest that I have and I am a minimalist / function of functionalists, right?
And so and so if you think through, Oh, those lenses.
I think.
34:43
Anyway, that's, that's what I think.
It helps build relationships and I also think it might be able to build a brand because I think brands are really just relationships with a mass audience.
So same mission same values.
Same day to day.
Desired ideal environment.
35:00
Oh, and hot, you mentioned that and I'll say this, they should be hard for you rather than Rob clock for everyone else, because sometimes he's not in the key holder.
If you're yeah bikes, Percent, 100% awesome.
And I'm gonna tell you, you know, I think that if we just clip out the last 10 minutes of this interview, you no one would ever need to buy a relationship course.
35:21
Again you could just watch what you just said that was like the best relationship advice leaving because it was just so brutally tactically honest, you know, just Stripped Away all the bullshit, you know, so that II appreciate that.
I definitely learned a lot from that Alex man.
Thank you for coming on and sharing all this and You know, I try to ask some more tactical questions and pull out some some real nitty-gritty stuff.
35:47
So I appreciate you sharing all that and getting into the weeds and not doing what most people do, and go on these long story tangents that are irrelevant, you know, I love your directness.
So thank you so much for coming on and I think people are really, really, really going to enjoy this interview.
36:05
Thanks for having me.
Thank you to the audience.
Thanks, man.






0:00
Requires you guys already know that?
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, I'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
0:24
It means the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world with someone else people who are wealthier, Don't do more than you do.
They get more out of the effort, they put in there.
Not moving faster.
They're just getting more credit for the stuff they do.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:44
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos Muskan Buffett a documented, their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I'm going to solve three massive business problems.
I'm going to take you from 10 to 100 million dollars.
I'm going to walk you through the framework so that you can apply this to your business, your work, or your personal brand.
1:03
And if you're just getting started or you have a five hundred thousand dollar business or a 1 million dollar business, the same framework Supply to you.
It's just at different levels of scale and all you do is, you remove or add zeros but the same Concepts work.
And if you don't know who I am, my name is Akshay Rosie.
I own acquisition dot-coms portfolio of companies that were 200 million dollars a year, and I make these because I want you to grow your business and eventually, Hit us up so we can invest it in help you scaled further beyond that.
1:26
And, by the way, these are real business problems from actual businesses, from an event that we were asked to speak at and do Q&A.
And so, this is the real stuff.
This is exactly how we solve these problems in real life.
There were three different business owners that presented with different problems, but actually had the same much larger problem.
1:43
And so one was an appointment setting business and they knew how to set appointments and build outbound teams for agencies coaches, Consultants.
Whatever the second business was a marketing agency for HVAC Business owners.
So they were able to get leads through local campaigns for a check businesses.
The third was actually very big influencer, we're talking like 30 to 40 million subscribers across all platforms, who came?
2:02
And we're trying to scale their business with the objective of making more money and so each of them had very differently, phrase questions but they were all suffering from the same constraint and it wasn't what they thought it was.
And when we look at businesses to invest in it, acquisition.com, we operate off of a singular concept which is the theory of constraints which is that a business will grow up to its constraint and then it will grow no longer which is Same concept as your strongest is the weakest link and the problem is that most entrepreneurs continue to work on the things that they enjoy rather than the things that the business needs.
2:30
And so they think that they're solving problem, which they may be, but they're not solving the problem that matters most and it's usually because they haven't actually identified, the correct constraint, and so, here's how you know, if this is you if you continue to work 16 hours a day but you're not making more money or the business isn't growing.
It's because you're working on the wrong stuff.
2:47
You're solving the wrong.
Problem is in the reason that we focus on the constraint is that it is the opportunity.
That print additional incremental level of effort that you apply to it.
It's the one that yields the most outsized returns because for example if you have a three-step sales process and you get 50% to go through step, 15 percent to go through Step 2 and then 50% to go through, step 3.
3:09
You could improve each of them by 10% and you go from 50 to 60, you go from 5 to 15 or you go from 50 to 60 again, but which of them makes the biggest difference in your business.
Going from five to Fifteen trips.
Paul's the business, whereas the other ones only incrementally improve it by 20%.
3:27
And so that is why we try and ruthlessly folks on what the constraint is because for the work we put in, we get more out and that room, big picture perspective is how the people who move fastest in life aren't actually doing things faster.
They're just doing more of the right stuff.
So the first business that asked the question was an appointment setting business.
3:45
And this guy, specialized setting, creating outbound teams for agencies, Consultants coaches, Etc, online businesses.
And he was saying that his problem was that he needed to get more customers, which by the way, most of the time that's not the problem.
It's usually because the customers you have keep leaving and that's the real problem.
4:01
Now he had an issue because he had a very low quality of customers.
The vast majority of customers didn't make enough money, they didn't stay long enough.
They didn't have enough skills Etc.
Right?
And so that was what he thought he had to solve.
All right.
That was business.
Number one, this is number two, was the HVAC agency.
4:18
So this is a business that markets for HVAC HVAC companies.
Typically small businesses, they had 50 or so clients in that Niche and they're running campaigns across 50 different, local markets and for them.
The problem is that most of these business owners are not sophisticated.
They don't call their leads fast enough, and they ultimately turn in 3 to 5 months, again seems like a similar issue.
4:41
The third business was the big influencer business.
Do, you know, 30 40 million subscribers across all the platforms?
And when I asked them, what problem you're trying to solve, they said, we want to make more money and the reason that's important is because if they had said, we want to continue to build our brand more, then I would have given a different answer, but because they want to do to make more money, they were focusing all their attention on.
4:59
How do we get more high quality videos out and mind you they have 30 to 40 million subscribers across all platforms.
And if we're thinking about this from a, what's the constraint perspective around making money, then do?
We really think that adding another 10 million subscribers is going to be the thing that's going to make them the most money or do we try and focus on what is probably the constraint, which I'll tell you in a second now to solve a business problem.
5:22
Number one, the appointment setting business, I said okay my friend of all of the companies that you've ever worked with which of them made the most money off of the appointments that you set.
So given the service value that they delivered, which of them were easiest to work with and made the most money off of what you did.
5:40
Right?
And he had a very specific answer.
What type of Avatar?
He did best with, right?
And so there's two directions for that business.
One, is you Niche down on your service delivery?
And say these are the only types of businesses I'm going to take because they're going to be worth more stay longer refer Etc, and then you can package all of your offerings and all of your messaging around that that is probably the easiest next step for that business.
6:03
But the highest leverage Next Step, as in like, if I were going to own this business and I transplanted my brain in my experience into his body, I'd be thinking well, Well, I could do that and that would probably grow me in the next one to two years, but if I'm trying to go for 10 years, then I want the opportunity that's going to pay me for the work.
6:19
I do today in five years because most business owners, the reason they don't create valuable businesses because they have to keep doing the same work over and over again.
And they don't get credit for it.
Because if you have to sell 10 new customers this month, to stay the same size.
You have a larger problem, which is that, at the end of the year, you still have to sell another 10 customers to stay the same size which means you're on this hedonic treadmill of That never seems to end and until you solve that much bigger problem, which is the constraint of the business.
6:46
You're basically sentenced to this terrible, Atlas like existence of rolling, the boulder up the hill in the rolling, it back down every day, every month.
Right.
And so he could Niche down, or what I would do is that I would say, hey, either partner with that business and say, hey, we'll go fifty-fifty with you on it because if I know how to build a pound teams for 20 different companies every month, then I could build a massive outbound team for this business.
7:10
And so he might have been doing five or ten million dollars a year and his little appointment setting business.
But if we look at that as one Department of a significantly larger business that does 50 or 100 million dollars a year, that it makes significantly more sense because what would the, what would the marketing spend be of a business that's doing 50 million dollars a year.
7:27
Realistically, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of five to ten million dollars a year is what the actual spend would be for that department, right?
Well if he has that, that he could own half of a 50 to 100 million dollar business that he grows over the next Five to ten years picking the most valuable business that he sets appointments for.
7:46
And so he could either partner with that business or spend a year or two, learning how that business works.
So that then he owns both sides of it.
He knows how to get generate the points for and he knows how to scale and deliver, whatever the service is that he was setting appointments for, those are life path choices.
8:02
If you partner, you can usually go faster, but you give up some of the upside because you slice the pie it's up to you.
But if I were in that opportunity, that's how I be.
Thinking about it because the real constraint wasn't that he needed to sell twice as many customers.
The constraint was that he had his doing - with setting up shitloads of outbound teams and every month he has to set up new outbound teams and didn't get credit for the Uptown teams.
8:24
He got set up last month, but if the team that he built was 50 outbound guys this month.
And then next month, he starts at 50 because it's all within the same company and then does another 50 and then another fifty, six months later, he's got 300 outbound guys that are all still working for him.
All generating Revenue that Is owning a slice of all of it rather than just the service fees, which have a very low multiple that no one would probably want to buy because of the massively shitty, customer base that he was selling to.

Originally the second business was the HVAC company.
It presented very differently than the appointment setting business, but you can probably start to put some of the pieces together and that's kind of the goal for me, for you Mosey nation.
Is that like, if you can start thinking this way, then you start thinking with higher leverage, some of the opportunities that you pursue, because if what you do every day doesn't necessarily change, but how much You get credit for it does, then you get more for what you put in and fundamental people who are wealthier, don't do more than you do.
9:18
They get more out of the effort they put in there, not moving faster.
They're just getting more credit for the stuff they do and they're getting paid on stuff.
They did five years ago, whereas you are only getting paid oh, stuff, you did last month.
So in this HVAC business, if he's able to generate leads and fill up 50 different HVAC Services pipelines because of his marketing prowess, he probably has the marketing skill of a 50 to 100 million dollar, HVAC business.
9:43
And so if you're catching the common theme here, if you're doing a million dollars a year in Revenue, you might think, man, I'm only got a million dollar business, and if you're like, I wish I could have that.
That's fine.
Just put a pin in it for a moment, but that million dollar marketing business, is, is charging fees here and the business is only work with them, because they're making five to ten times more than that, on the services they're providing.
10:08
And so, if you have a five million dollar marketing, Agency.
Then it's reasonable that.
Some of the clients that you serve are making 50 million dollars in Revenue off the services, you're generating and you're getting none of that.
You're only capturing the service fee.
And every month you have to go get new clients because some of them cancel because they are doing the other things that are required to be successful, which anybody, who owns it?
10:27
Marketing agency knows your clients never do their job, but there are agencies who do more and more of the work to try and guarantee success.
But the more steps you take towards owning the result, the more you're basically just doing the business for them.
Is not necessarily the wrong mindset because you always want to deliver more value to your customers but at a certain point you are the business and so it makes sense for you to own the economics of the business.
10:50
And so again we're presented with the same path as we had originally now this one was already an inch down and so either you got to learn the HVAC business or you partner with someone who already knows it and either they can start something from scratch.
I would usually try and take an industry video as you know 10 plus experiences in HVAC and has grown a company of appreciable size or you could buy one.
11:10
Because if you're a company of this size, you probably could buy one and with your marketing prowess could juice the hell out of it.
And the thing is that most people will try and buy it.
But then also try and keep this agency thing going but sometimes you got to take a half step back so you can take 20 steps forward because and this is a common saying that we have it acquisition.com is that the fastest way to build a 10 million dollar business is often not the fastest way to build 100 million dollar business.
11:34
And so, for example, if you wanted to build a building that was ten stories tall, you start with a very different Foundation.
Now, imagine you built a 10-story, Adding and then said, okay, I want to build 100 100 story building using the same Foundation.
You wouldn't be able to, but that's exactly what most entrepreneurs do when they're trying to scale.
11:49
And they wonder why they're stuck is because they built it wrong to begin with because they were in the wrong opportunity vehicle.
So if you're one of those agencies that is in this kind of spot, we were like I over-deliver for my customers, I have a handful of them that obviously do way better than other ones path.
One is you just started on your own because you know, a lot about it because sometimes people are agency owners did come from that space learned agency and you probably Learned a little bit more about how to scale a team.
12:12
And now you can probably re-approach that with new eyes and new learnings and maybe you will be able to build an HVAC business version 2, is that you find someone who already has done an HVAC business.
You partner with them, they get some slice of the equity that's negotiable.
Depends on how good they are and what their experience is some slice between you know, they get five to fifty percent of the deal and you guys start one together, option, three is that you either approach the the top few guys, you have and say, hey instead of doing the service thing, let's further a line.
12:40
Let me take For even more of this acquisition, you know, perspective and let you know, let's partner on this.
Now in that instance, if they're really good company and that's why they're performing, you might not get 50%, you might get 30%.
But again, if you think like one of the big things that took me too long to learn is that it's the size of the slice of the pie that matters not the shape of the slice of the pie.
13:01
It's like lots of guys obsess about having a hundred percent of the pie and this was me for a very long time.
They obsess about the shape of the slice rather than having a slice that It's like this of a much bigger pie and so just so, you know, the average IPO founder when a company IPOs owns 12 and a half percent of the company they found it and that's because the more people you make money, the more money you ultimately make.
13:24
And I would say that the agency types that lend themselves more to this are the done for you, more transactional acquisition agencies.
What I mean by that is like if you're really good at a lead gen strategy, using some sort of type of platform or a really good at like building and scaling sales.
13:40
Either outbound or even just closing teams like done-for-you closing teams, all of those are agencies, that plug very naturally into businesses.
If you're doing some sort of like, if you have like a creative shop or you do a lot of design branding, those ones tend to work a little bit better as like their own companies and also because L TV on customers who actually understand, branding tends to be significantly higher and you can build very about valuable companies.
14:04
There, it's very, it's not often that lead gen companies in and of themselves.
Elves become inherently valuable the exceptions to that or when you own very large media assets.
And that generates you tons of leads for free.
Like if you build the number one ranking thing for mold removal in the United States and then you rank that, get all these leads in.
14:25
You sell those leads that tends to work but the vast majority of people who are watching this are not in either of those camps.
They are very tactical in the fact that they know how to set appointments.
They know how to generate leads etcetera just using paid ads or whatever method they have.
And if you have one of those agencies it makes More sense in my opinion to capture the much bigger opportunity.
14:43
Get a slice of that.
Then something that never really gets a ton of value.
It's not often that someone capitalizes.
It makes it very viable business there.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
15:01
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, The third example was the influencer who had, you know, 30 40 million subscribers across all their platforms and I say 30 to 40 million because I don't remember what it was.
15:21
I know what other platforms have like, twenty eight, so I'm assuming it was more than that across the rest of them point being when I sat down with them.
I said, you guys are trying to take your 97 out of 100 Media company to a 99 out of 100 Media Company.
When the objective you said was to make more money and you have no product that you sell.
15:40
And so all of your monetization relies on spot.
Starships and add an ad Revenue, which is typically the least efficient way to monetize because fundamentally anyone who pays you for a sponsorship is making a significant.
If they do it on a recurring basis, they're making a huge Arbitrage on your brand, and your value.
15:58
And so, you capture that Arbitrage of, they're paying you a hundred thousand dollars for every video.
They might be making a million dollars on every video and would it be nice to own half of that and not only own half of it, but own it in terms of like you're making the money?
They're making but also you have the equity in the company that has significantly more value than just the ad Revenue that you get for making a video or doing a shoot.
16:23
And so when I was talking to this individual Creator, I said like you are you've identified in my opinion the incorrect constraint you're seeing your business as this box of media and trying to make more better videos which if you want to do brand and just continue to build the brand before making ask, that would be the right problem to solve, but they are at 97 out of 100 and realistically.
16:41
If you look at stats, Is there a point zero zero, zero, zero, zero, one percent Creator.
So, do we really think that their constraint of their business?
Is that they aren't good enough at marketing?
No, probably not what they really had.
Was the media Department of a business that like given the amount of Impressions they had and this is going to sound like mind-boggling to say, but given the amount of prescience that these guys were getting which when they don't make videos, we're getting 100 million views a month when they don't post anything new, that kind of thing.
17:12
Is a company that's 100million Plus in revenue, and so they have the marketing department.
But what they don't have is a sales department.
They don't have a product department, they don't have customer success.
They have none of these other departments.
There's your out of 100, on all these and so the constraint isn't going 97 to 99.
17:29
It's going from 0 to 20 on these ones and that's where they would get an outsize return because if for example, they made the same ad, they would that some outside company would pay them to make for whatever the product.
Was if they own the whole thing, even if it was a mediocre product, they would make five ten times more money and they would actually make a stronger brand Association because rather than flip-flopping between, whatever thing had paid them that month, they'd be able to consistently talk about the benefits, they be able to integrate it in their content rather than making hardcore right hook ads, they could make jokes about it.
18:01
And they could weave it in, which would ultimately build the long-term brand that hat would be significant more valuable.
So if I'm in this guy's position, what are the choices I have here?
Version 1 is, if I've got an Has your consistently comes to me, depending on the size of the business, I may be able to negotiate some sort of equity thing, rather than getting paid with cash.
18:23
That's option one.
I think that's the best option because you aren't like they already have all these other boxes built up and then you just add your box to their larger conglomeration and even if you're getting 10 or 20% of the company, if it's a big company like for these guys, they're only partnering with very big companies already and so, getting even 10% of a company.
18:42
That's Is worth a hundred million dollars and then you put all of your effort behind it and make it a two or three hundred dollar company.
That's a significantly better outcome for many of them than what they're currently getting.
Paid just hand-to-mouth video You Know, video to paycheck, right?
The second option is to say, okay, is there a category of products that continue to pay me the most out of all the advertisers, okay?
19:00
Well the once you perform the best or problem, give me leading indicators.
Just do what Amazon does.
See what's already selling and then clone it and make it your own and put your name on it and put a couple of your own little personal.
Quirks that you wish, it did better.
And that you see in your comments of people who had bought the product and complain about it, whatever, fix all those things and make your version yours and better.
19:23
And if you do that, then you own the entirety of that thing.
But in order to do that, you probably, if it were me, I would go snipe some of the topics at some of those companies and say, hey, you're currently an executive here.
Would you like to own a slice of my thing again?
19:40
I'm happy to own 70%.
And get three of the best guys over, have them build their boxes behind my thing, and they're happy to do it because they're currently getting 0 or 1 percent, and you can give them 10 each and they see the bigger opportunity because they also know that 50% of sales are coming from your channel, right?
19:58
And that's the kind of Leverage you have, because if you are a huge percentage of the traffic for one of these larger businesses, then you usually can negotiate bigger chunks of equity and you could go right in.
That's the fastest and easiest way the longer maybe bigger money way is if you do it all yourself, but that's all Use the trade that you have to make as an entrepreneur's.
20:14
How many new skills do I have to have in order to pursue this new opportunity versus the ones?
I currently have the third opportunity for them is actually is neither of those but it's probably the least operational risk for them is accepting the fact that they just like doing media and that's what they jam on and they don't want to touch either these other business components and saying and then kind of more hardcore branding themselves as a creative shop, that knows how to make viral videos that they can transform into ads.
20:42
And that's Where you go from being a really good Creator to being a Madison Avenue agency that makes ads that Crush.
Because if you are skilled enough to become a top, one percent point zero zero one percent Creator, then, you know, stuff better than 99% of AD creative shops out there and you would be able to get huge Brands to pay you to make ads.
21:03
Because here's the unlock, is that most influencers are getting paid based on the Impressions that they are getting the brand for free based on their audience.
Where the real money is made is where you take that Tick, Tock video that YouTube toward that Instagram video, that YouTube video, whatever it is, and then they put a million dollars of AD spend behind it when it's already shown as a winner and then it goes from being shown to five million people in your audience.
21:28
To 100 million people that it converts from cold, that is where the real money is made.
And so, if you brand yourself as an ad agency, and I mean this in the high at agency world, not like, local business, like me, run the Facebook ads for you.
But real creative agency, you now are no longer monetizing your audience but your skill set to make videos that go viral.
21:51
That is a more valuable skill.
Oftentimes then the size of the audience paired together, even better, but adspend has no limit on reach as long as its profitable.
So they can always expand beyond your existing audience, which means that you get to capture all of the upside based on how skilled you are as an Advertiser.
22:10
So those would be the three paths for that.
Business.
Now, if you're following along, what I want you to think is not like, okay, well I'm not one of these three businesses.
Now what I should do but it's actually the framework that we approach.
The problem with, which is 1.
What problem are we trying to solve?
All right?
22:26
In each of these businesses, they wanted to make more money.
The next one is over.
What time Rising.
