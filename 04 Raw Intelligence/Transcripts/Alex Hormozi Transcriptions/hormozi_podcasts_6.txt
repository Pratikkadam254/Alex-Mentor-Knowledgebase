Interesting In a world where entrepreneurship is not always celebrated and capitalism is often vilified, is that just a contrarian stance or do you think that people are a little crazy to not see the value of business?
1:25:27
So if we're to zoom all the way out and just think about the economy as a whole is allocation of resources just time, energy, money, etcetera.
Capitalism in and of itself is the is a is a system about efficiently allocating capital.
1:25:43
Now there are trade-offs with that because if you have a pure capitalistic society then there are a lot of other things that we say are important to us.
Like we believe people should have healthcare, we believe people should have a place to live.
We believe people should have education and you know services for their kids when they're younger or whatever it is right?
We have these beliefs and so we make trades based on that pure idea of capitalism, because capitalism can absolutely be pure.
1:26:03
But most actually, I don't know of an economy right now that's a true pure capitalist because most humans say that that market is too ruthless and so we're willing to make some trades.
And that's where legislation where we actually artificially move the incentives of the market to incentivize certain behaviors.
1:26:19
The problem with governments as an allocation vehicle for capital is that they are 110th as efficient as private because it's not their money and they never earned it.
And so you get really good at capitalism by allocating resources well and getting a return on your resources.
1:26:37
You don't get you.
It's very hard to get fired in the government and you manage billions and billions of dollars.
And the requirements to get in are not as high as they are to spend even a modicum of that kind of money in the private sector.
And so you just have to be more efficient with what you have because you have to survive every day rather than having a guaranteed stipend from the whole country that gets taken off the top before everyone sees their paycheck.
1:27:01
And so if government can solve it, private sector can solve it better, faster, cheaper.
The only real issues come into how much regulation do we put on top to, to prevent bad actors?
Worse.
What?
I mean that's the whole concept around, I mean, you know, this.
1:27:16
I'm just saying for the audience around like why we try and break up monopolies, which now we've just given up on because they're bigger than governments.
But we we do that because we want to protect, you know, we want the capital society.
Competition in general is good for society, tough for the competitors.
But if you have 10 dry cleaning stores, the best dry cleaning store will win and then everyone gets better dry cleaning.
1:27:37
So it's good for society.
It's bad for the nine guys who fail.
And so I do think that entrepreneurship is the way that we solve problems and I think that there's usually an innovative way to solve any problem if we have enough knowledge to do so.
1:27:52
I mean and Elon's proving that with kind of first principles approach to like can I rock, can I launch rockets at a time the price, Well, where do we get our metal from, right?
Like what is required for a rocket, right.
So we have to get this from here to here, let's build from there, right.
Rather than like well, we have to go for this guy who's our contractor for space navigation.
1:28:08
Well, why can't we make space navigation?
Well, you know, like and then again though and then the prices expand And so that is my TLDR is that I can't learn everything.
Everyone has a unique life.
They are uniquely positioned to tackle opportunities that I only have one lifetime to live and I might be able to solve two or three big problems in my lifetime maybe.
1:28:32
But if everybody has these skills, then I think when I die I will be proud of the meta contribution, even if I don't capture all of the economics because I'm going to then die and then someone else will have it and it doesn't even matter anyways.
And so I I there's an element of that that just makes me feel good about it, that drives me forward.
1:28:51
Like the 17 year old who's going to sleep with the book under his pillow to serve, you know, provide for his family with the one goat they have.
I think that if I can equip that guy that he can do whatever, like he can solve problems that I never could.
And so I don't think it's my life purpose to build the next rocket or cure cancer.
1:29:08
I just don't think that's in my skill set.
It's also not in my interests.
But I think I can help equip the entrepreneurs who will.
I love that man.
I hope more people hear that message about business.
I think that to your point about serving people in a more efficient way, in a way that they prefer is so powerful and to watch it slowly get villainized of as I've gotten older has really been sad and I think will lead us down a super dark path.
1:29:35
Tell me, for those that are just listening and aren't watching across the bridge of your nose on a nose strip, it says the one of zero B1 of 0.
Excuse me, what does that mean?
So one of our kind of big themes in our content creation at Mozi Media is one of one content or was one of one content.
1:29:54
Meaning I don't want to do a breakdown of Coca Cola's business model because literally anyone could do that.
That's a book report.
A college could do that.
Anybody could do that.
And so I only want to make content that I can make.
And so one of my big rules of advertising is show what only you can show and say what only you can say.
1:30:10
And so if you're the the only triple black belt something in your local area, then say that and then also show what you can do that other people can't do.
And if you don't have that reality, you either need to niche down and make it a much narrow thing that only you can do or you get better and can beat more people and you expand it.
1:30:27
But that's fundamentally anyone can become a category of one if you go narrow enough and then you just continue to expand over time.
So the one of one content was the concept that we've adhered to now as the team started to see what was going to happen for the event and how much we were putting into it and all the free stuff we were going to give away and how much money we were choosing actively to not make.
1:30:48
They were like, dude, no one would do this.
They're like, this isn't even one of one.
They're like this is one of zero and it was like, that's it.
For 18 months I've been looking for like a saying or an ISM that was short and could encapsulate many of the values, skills that can be learned, that I believe are important and that one of zero concept which I love because also from a math perspective one of zero you know 1 / 0 is undefined and so it's really about being beyond definition.
1:31:20
Writing your own path, you know, keeping promises in a world that breaks them, delaying expectations, giving 1st and giving over and over again until they ask or even if they never ask, and trying to live your life in a way that you earn your own approval by the end of it.
1:31:44
And I think that's what one of zero is all about.
And so for me be one of zero and that's a that is a brand that I I really wanna stand behind because that's what I believe.








0:00
It takes focus and determination and perseverance to continue to build something big.
It takes years, not months.
And so you have to have somebody can lock in on a target and drive towards that for years.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:18
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I want to talk to you about some of the things that we look at in the companies that we're looking to invest in and you can take these frames in terms of how we perceive the value of a founder and or their company and how you can translate it into your own business.
0:41
So you've probably heard that fundamentally I'm going to look at the founder themselves and I'm going to look at the opportunity they're pursuing.
So there's kind of two elements here or really three.
There's The Who are we serving, how's the business structured and who is the founder, right.
And I have a 55 minute presentation that that goes on this in a lot of depth, but I want to give you the the back of napkin quick look at this.
1:03
And so if I'm looking at a founder and just if you guys are curious, 80% of our decision is weighted around the founder.
Here's why.
And I can change the market that we're serving.
I can change and improve the business model that we're using.
I cannot change the founder.
And so that is where 80% of our attention goes in terms of whether or not we want to take on a business, right.
1:22
If the, you know the business is doing 3 million or more a year, you know there are service, you learning coaching type business like if they check those boxes, they're US based, etcetera, like cool, like we have the basics out of the way and as long as I don't hate the the market that we're serving, then I can see and obviously a lot of times there's plenty of improvements to the business, which is what we're there for, right.
1:41
Then it looks honestly all at the founder.
And so I want to tell you some of the things that disqualify people for us, all right.
So this will hopefully be hugely enlightening to you in terms of looking inwardly at your own character traits.
Because there are three things that kind of comprise the entrepreneur themselves, as I see it.
1:58
Right You've got belief, skills, and traits, all right, The beliefs I can change or break, right?
So if someone's like, I just don't think we can charge more than that.
I can break that belief.
I feel fine about that, right?
Skills I can help them acquire Skills like where I can fill up their team with people who already have the skill to help grow the business, right?
2:15
So skills and beliefs are things that I can fix more easily from the outside.
Traits are the ones that are very, very difficult.
And so when we're looking at these businesses, the vast majority of the time, our biggest focus, if they meet all the other requirements of like is this the type of business that we want to go after.
2:32
It all falls on the founder.
And so I'll tell you the two biggest or probably three biggest, I'm just thinking out loud or just from the just the cause I've taken the last month or two, the biggest red flags that I fuck, you know what, I'm just going to say them all.
So number one, and this is the biggest one, right?
And I'll give you the second biggest one last, All right.
2:48
The biggest one is ego like, And The thing is, is it's not just having a little bit of ego.
Most people are not just raging arrogant assholes, right?
Most entrepreneurs have to have a certain amount of confidence in order to do what they're doing, and I understand that.
But if we sense even a hint of posturing or take away selling stuff like that, it's just an immediate pass.
3:11
It's like, Nah, I'm good.
Like, I just, I don't need to do this.
Like, I I wish you the best.
And you know what?
Some of those guys are successful, but it's just not what I want to work with for my life.
Right.
And so number one, and by far the number one reason that we disqualify companies is that we find some sort of ego within the founder.
3:28
The 2nd is focus.
All right.
So if we have a founder, and this is kind of in, in two ways, you can look at it.
Some founders come in and they're like, well, I have six businesses.
Immediate.
No, Right.
No, thank you.
You can't focus.
No, thank you.
So that's the, that's the macro one.
But even on a micro level, if someone scatterbrained, they're all over the place in the call.
3:46
They can't keep a train of thought.
It's like it's going to be impossible to communicate with them because they can't focus on what we're even saying, right?
And so it would be very difficult to implement change because they can't even hold their own attention for like 5 seconds.
And so first is, do this person have an ego?
Second, what's their attention span, right.
4:03
How focused are they as much?
Perfect.
Because it takes focus and determination and perseverance to continue to build something big.
It takes years, not months.
And so you have to have somebody who can lock in on a target and drive towards that for years.
And that takes focus and that takes discipline and disciplines, means saying no, right?
4:19
I mean saying no to a lot of things a lot of people don't.
They don't want their.
No muscle is too weak, right?
It's not strong enough yet.
All right?
And so does that take time to develop?
Absolutely.
Do I want to take the time to develop with them?
Probably not.
Right?
So #1 ego, #2 focus, #3 emotional reactivity.
4:37
So if I see someone who I sense, I think is going to be emotionally reactive, they're going to have ups and downs and swings, then I know that what's going to end up happening is I'm going to become a therapist rather than an advisor of the business.
And that's not the role that I want to play.
And so although I feel like I can play it, I do not want to or enjoy it.
4:56
And so when we see that, that's an immediate reflect.
So if you, if you feel like yourself, you're you, you come in hot one day, you come in cold another day, you, you, you say, hey team, we're doing this today and then you're like just get and then you get emotionally And a lot of times the focus and the emotional reactivity a lot of times go hand in hand, not always, but oftentimes they do.
5:15
So somebody who's usually very emotionally reactive tends to be scattered and all over the place, but not always the reverse.
Some people are very emotionally fine, but they're just scattered as fuck, right?
Which is a pain in the ass and hard to deal with.
The next one when it comes to founders is what's the leadership dynamic look like?
Do we sense any kind of strife, interpersonal drama, misalignment, resentment, anything that we can kind of suss out, You know what I mean?
5:39
During during the diligence process is usually a red flag.
So this is like unsupportive spouses is usually a problem, right?
Or if we have, you know, Co founders and one person has less equity and they feel resentful of the guy who has more, that could be a problem.
Or if we just have a super complex cap table, which means that there's a zillion people who have ownership, it's like, oh, there's too many people who have a voice in this.
6:01
It's going to be a pain in the ass to get stuff done.
Is that to say that you can't do it?
Absolutely not.
It's just not something we want to do.
Mosa Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
6:19
And if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And so those are the four big ones that we're looking at when we see a company that's coming in as #1, do they have ego, #2?
6:37
How focused are they on a macro level, as in, do they have lots of businesses or do they just have one?
And then on the micro level, can they just focus on what we're talking about right now without going off on crazy tangents, #3, what is their level of emotional reactivity?
Like if we say something, do we think that they're going to get charged up and then crash and then have these constant ups and downs of, you know, emotional roller coaster which none of us want to be a party to?
7:01
It just makes running a business difficult and it also makes it building a team very difficult because people just don't want to deal with that, right.
And so if you're that guy, if you can identify with that, work on it, you know what I mean?
If you can identify with, with with having poor focus, work on that.
And the the way you work on focus is by one, removing things and two, saying no like those are that's what you that's the tactics of of focus, right, is that you look at your calendar, you remove things and you say no to future things.
7:30
That's how it works, all right.
And there's a video made called The Woman in the Red Dress, which you know dives into this in a lot more detail.
All right.
And then the 4th one is the the leadership dynamics at the top.
And a lot of times this is the dynamic between the Co founders.
Sometimes.
We had an instance recently where we had a founder who absolutely was like, I have the best operator in the world, this person's amazing, blah blah blah, blah.
7:50
And then we got on the phone with the operator and we were like, this is a train wreck.
This person has no idea what they're doing.
And so then what happens then is then it makes me question the judgement of the founder, right?
It's like, is this person so unaware that they can't see this?
And part of that sometimes can be ignorance, Like they just don't know what it looks like.
8:06
And so they think this is what a good operator looks like.
But sometimes it's the like, their judgment of character in others is also off, which is a deeper issue because it means it's much more difficult for us to get them to hire good people to scale the company, right?
So like, if you have a terrible people picker, that's a hard problem to fix, right?
And so the best way to solve that problem, if you're curious, is to not and rely on people who have good track records.
8:26
And then Start learning more and more what those things look like and then start replicating and have multiple people test your hypothesis around someone's like, this is what I'm thinking.
Are you seeing the same thing?
All right.
And so that can improve.
I'll tell you somebody who has an amazing picker, like freaky good is Layla.
8:42
I think Layla is a better picker than I do.
I think I'm decent.
But she's like Sixth Sense.
It's weird, you know?
The other day we had one of our companies on, and it's a company that's been doing really well.
And we got off the phone call and she was like, they're not telling us something.
I was like, what she's like, they're just not telling us something.
I don't know what it is.
8:57
They're not telling us something.
And lo and behold, there was some major issue that had happened in the company.
And we found out through another Grapevine reached out the founder.
He's like, I was really embarrassed.
I didn't want anybody to know.
Why do you want you guys to know?
And obviously we handled it, but it's like, it's freaky.
And so I mean sometimes.
And like I I hired permanently hired Layla to shore up my deficiency there.
9:17
Because when I met Layla, my people picker was pretty bad.
Like pretty bad.
I did not.
I picked terrible.
I picked bad partners.
I picked bad back teammates.
I picked people who didn't compliment my skill sets.
I picked people, You know, I just, I just had a terrible job with this.
9:32
And I I tend to be overly trusting, and Layla shores me up on that.
And so we're kind of getting yin and Yang.
And so for those four things, if you're like, well, hell, Alex, I have all four.
Well, you can work on them one at a time.
All right?
So if your ego, it's like, talk less, listen more and realize that you're probably not right.
9:50
And the easiest way to test this out is think about yourself five years ago and how wrong you were there compared to who you are now.
And think about the fact that there's a version of you 10 years from now that thinks about yourself as a complete idiot.
You can think of yourself as a complete idiot 10 years from now.
Then you're probably not as right as you think you are.
And so I think the goal is usually to be less wrong than more right.
10:09
Just as a mental frame for the focus issues.
It's eliminate and saying no for the emotional reactivity.
For me, I, you know, I just, I move everything to death, life and death immediately.
And then that centers me.
So something bad happens.
Am I going to die?
10:24
No.
OK, great.
And then we move back down to reality, right?
And so I think if you can develop frames around managing your own stress tolerance and increasing your tolerance, your own stress and how quickly you come back to baseline will yield spades.
Another quick hitter on that is don't make decisions when you feel emotional, all right.
10:40
Now guys will have a harder time with this than women do.
But like, in terms of recognizing when they're emotional, because yes, men, we have the same amount of emotions as women do.
We just portray them differently.
I can feel when I get angry, right.
I could just, I'm just, I'm heightened you know what I mean at my my awareness is is faster.
I'm shorter, I'm more aggressive and I don't make decisions that I don't talk to teammates when I'm in that state.
11:00
And that's usually when I just give it a night to sleep it off.
And a lot of times that has saved me many, many terrible decisions and many things that I I shouldn't have said that I did not end up saying because I just gave it a little bit of time between when the emotional thing happened and when I responded.
And so if you want to decrease the emotions that you have your emotional reactivity, increase the time delay between when something happens and when you react to it.
11:23
Because big picture hours in business almost never matter.
Like almost never.
Like really like an hour, 2 hours a day almost never matters.
But what you say will matter for a lifetime.
11:38
So just think about that, Like, just increase the time between when something happens, the stimulus and your reaction, and you will in general tend to make better decisions and say the right thing.
And then with founder dynamics, clean that shit up.
Clear roles that have to be defined between who does what rather than lots of overlap, lots of mish mash, making sure everybody's OK with the way that they're being compensated and that any kind of interpersonal dramas are aired.
12:01
And so there's the four things that are the interpersonal dynamics of the companies that we're looking at when we want to invest.
And if you have those things, you can look at how can I clean up my own personal space to increase my traits?
And the reason this is so important is that you're not going to build a big business if you are not worthy of building a big business, right?
12:16
Like the world doesn't care how much you want it, right?
The world only cares who you are.
And so I think you have to work on yourself to do the things to become worthy of of the things that you desire.
So lots of love everyone, and I'll see you guys in the next one.








0:00
The easiest cue that we can use to change who we are, to change character traits that we find undesirable is to simply ask ourselves when we're confronted with the decision what would this type of person do?
And then act in accordance to that.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:22
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it.
For the rest of us, Please share and enjoy.
The hardest respect to earn is one's own.
And I get questions all the time in terms of like how do you create these businesses, how do you sell stuff, how do you live your life, all of those kinds of things.
0:43
And I was talking to a good friend who'd come back into my life briefly that we'd known for for many years and we actually started at the same time together.
And ironically there was a, there was a period of time, not ironically, that he did significantly better than me.
1:00
And then just from a financial perspective.
And then I ended up passing him and we met back up a few years later and he was a little bit down.
And the conversation that we had was really enlightening for me and the conversations we've had since.
And so I wanted to share that with you.
And the main purpose for this, as I'm getting to it, is to underline how do you actually do this stuff that creates the wealth, the empire, the status to all that stuff?
1:28
And I think that this is where people get really tripped up.
And the reason I say that is there's kind of three elements to the the, the goal, right.
So you have the external result that you're looking for, which might be make more money, get a six pack, whatever.
You've got the processes, behaviors, activities that result in that goal, right, being achieved, which would be like doing the work.
1:50
And then the third aspect is being the type of person who does those things.
So basically identifying with those types of behaviors or being the type of person who does those types of activities, which then creates the reward, right.
And so I think James Clear talks about this in his book Atomic Habits.
2:07
But there's a lot of behavior psychologists who've who've touched on this point, and you probably have heard B, do have at some point in your personal development journey, and if you haven't, welcome to the game.
And so one of the things, and this is what I wanted to give to you in this is a keystone habit that has served me very well.
2:25
And it's only been in retrospect, explaining it to someone else that I kind of had more clarity on it, which is why I'm sharing it with you, which is when I have something that I want, that I do not have.
So I have a desire, which means I've made a contract with myself to be unhappy until I get what I want, right.
2:40
And so I have this thing that I want externally, and I think I've had enough experience with this to know that simply writing down the goal means nothing.
And so I think this is contrary to common belief or practice, which is like people write down their goals are more likely to succeed.
Sure.
I mean, having a direction is more likely to achieve than than not having a direction.
2:57
So I'm not going to disagree with that.
But here's an interesting statement that may hit you, which is that winners and losers have the same goals, right?
Everybody in Olympics has the same goal.
Everybody who's in business has the same goal, right.
They want to increase how much money they're making.
You sell more products, get more customers, etcetera.
3:12
So the goals are actually not that unique.
And so the fact that we're writing them down, sure, it's a first step because we have to have a direction in terms of what are we trying to accomplish.
Sure.
But I think that what you'll see that is different because if you look at two people with the same goals and one person achieves them, the other person hasn't, then it can't be having the goal.
3:28
That is the main driver of success, right.
Right.
And so then you get you know you dive a a step underneath that and you look at what are the behaviors that created that goal.
And now we get much closer to the things that are actually driving the progress.
What gets more interesting at least to me is if we know the activities that are going to generate the result we want.
3:46
So maybe it's we want to get more customers which means we need to advertise more and I use advertise by the definition of what the word actually means which is to make known.
And so if we do activities that make our products and services known like doing more private communications which would be one-on-one reach outs, one-on-one cold calls, one-on-one DMS, one-on-one emails etcetera prospecting or one to many.
4:04
So public communication which would be you know broadcasting across different platforms for media, right.
So you have radio, you have, you have, you could have an e-mail list, you could have actually that would be an example of a high version of scale of the original.
So I apologize there.
But like making posts on social media, things that are public forum where people can find out about it, right.
4:22
If you do more of those things, more people find out and that would be the activity that's associated with getting more customers, right.
But The thing is, is that people will know what that activity is, right?
They will know that inherently they should be doing more of it and yet they don't.
And so that is kind of the purpose that I wanted to drill down in this short video today is why not and what is the way that we can try and correct that or fix that.
4:44
And so I wanted to give you the simplest single hack that I have used inadvertently and seen a tremendous amount of success.
And that is asking myself the question, what would a person who does this type of thing do in this instance?
5:03
And so the, the one that I'll tell you that I've repeated a lot to myself over the years, probably over the last five or ten years has been the repeated chorus of what would a wise man do.
And I think it's because I did not consider myself to be very wise and I acted many ways that were unwise earlier on in my life.
5:22
And I still continue to do so, but I try to do less of it right.
And I think that and I'll, I'll borrow this again from James Clear's book, but like your identity is much more of a weighing system.
Actually that's not from this book, but like it's much more of a voting system where you, you cast votes on either direction based on your activities of what type of person you want to become.
5:41
And I think the simplest distillation of that concept is simply asking the question, what would this type of person do?
And so if you can use that as the refrain that you come back to over and over again, the chorus of your day, that gets repeated over and over again, I think it's much easier than trying to remember the 50 point checklist of all the activities that you need to do to achieve the goal, right.
6:06
And so in the, in the the friend that came back in my life where we were having this conversation, you know, I just distilled it down to like what would a billionaire do?
And so when we're confronted with these crossroads, right, you wake up in the morning and you're like, I don't know what I should start on.
It's like what would a billionaire do?
And so basically what you can do is have a certain refrain or chorus that you ask yourself what would this type of person do?
6:28
And that type of person, when you ask that question, is who you will eventually become as you continue to cast votes that reinforce the stories that we tell ourselves about who we are.
And those are the things that create long lasting deep change.
And what's more about this is that these changes when they become internal, when they become ingrained in our behavior, they become effortless.
6:50
But it takes time.
And so I think that the mental cue that I have given myself inadvertently over the years, I don't have a lot of courses that I refrain to or that I come back to over and over again.
And so I tweeted about one and it got shared a zillion times with his.
7:06
What would someone 10 times smarter than me do in this situation?
Right.
And a different way of saying that is, what would a billionaire do?
And and word it in whatever way that resonates with you, right?
But I think rather than having that big checklist, you can put just a little post it on your computer or wherever you work.
7:22
That's a reminder to yourself that this is the type of person I want to become quick wise.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
7:45
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me and more importantly it may change the world for someone else.
And in order to become this type of person, I need to do these things because those actions will reinforce the thoughts that I say about myself.
8:06
Because the whole concept behind affirmations that I do not like right which is I am a you know I'm a lion, I'm a tiger, I'm a whatever right is that just saying them doesn't make them true unless you're a crazy person and most of us are not crazy I think, right.
There's plenty of crazy but you don't get me wrong but you're probably at least semi sane, right.
8:24
And so if we have, you know, this degree of sanity that's on our side, then what we have to do is create something else, which is evidence, right?
We have to give ourselves evidence that we are this type of person in order to become that.
But how do you have evidence that you are going to be this person when you when you have none?
8:39
Well, it starts with activity.
It starts with doing the stuff.
And so once we know who we want to become, then that can direct the types of activities that will be in accordance with that.
And the reason I like this better, too, is that if we're trying to reinforce an identity or an identity trait about ourselves.
8:55
And I I just learned this.
And this is a really good habit, I think, that I've picked up over the years.
But breaking down the etymology of words is really, really cool.
And I think really teaches us a lot about the words we say.
And words matter a lot because they are the things that encapsulate thoughts.
9:13
And so if you change the way you speak, the change the way you think, right.
And so a classic one, which is like, I didn't really like the word philosopher because I thought it sounded really fluffy when I found out the etymology behind the word, which is phile, which is to love or to like.
And then Sophos, which is knowledge or wisdom, it's lover of wisdom.
9:28
And I was like, well, shoot, I am a lover of wisdom.
And so now I actually have a very positive association with the word philosophy or philosopher.
And to the same degree identity comes from, like, I don't remember the actual Latin word, but entity is being right like just beingness and it's in of itself and identical, which is repeated.
9:47
So repeated beingness is what your identity is.
So what your actions, what you do literally becomes who you are, which means that we can't actively change who we are by changing what we do.
But it is a reinforcing secular path of like, I am this type of person and therefore I do these things.
And because they do these types of things, I am this type of person, right.
10:04
And so it's the chicken or the egg, but at some point we need to take action in order to do that.
And so I think the simple and easiest cue that we can use to change who we are, to change character traits that we find undesirable is to simply ask ourselves when we're confronted with the decision, what would this type of person do?
10:22
And then act in accordance to that.
And I find it much simpler than having the lists and having the the daily routines and the things like that.
Because if you are this type of person, you will do the types of things that that type of person would do.
And that also comes down to the many decisions we haven't accounted for yet.
10:40
You're going to be confronted with situations that you have not predicted.
In fact, the vast majority of us don't predict things well.
In general.
It's because there's far more variables and we can possibly comprehend.
And so I think it's much more useful for us to think about ourselves in terms of if I were to encompass all of the things that I would like to be right.
10:59
And that's why I think the the what would Jesus do?
Was such a powerful statement in the Christian community overall.
And candidly, people outside of the Christian community could use that same exact thing.
Which what would Jesus do in this instance And probably get the right activity and become more like Jesus, right, Which is the entire goal of the Christian faith.
11:16
And this is not, this is not religious.
That's not my point here.
But it's more so that what we repeatedly choose to ask ourselves, which creates our identity, which then creates the tasks that we do in the activities we spend our time on, reinforces the story that we tell ourselves, who we are, right, or what type of person we are.
11:34
And So what I shared with this individual, as I said, you know, what do you want to become?
And if it's like a billionaire, it's like cool, then what would a billionaire do?
And always asking ourselves that question.
And the reason that this was important, when I was talking to this individual, I'll read you the texts that I had, that I had said to them because they got shared all over Instagram when I, when I, when I tweeted them or whatever.
11:52
Is that after he left, I said here's a thought for you.
So I was just like thinking about the conversation we had and and he had felt kind of shitty.
And what's interesting about this is like as an aside as you level up in your life and this is just an observation that I've had, is that like you will simply change who you compare yourself to.
12:10
And I think Jordan Peterson talks about this in some talk he had, but I I find it very true, which is you.
You just change who you compare yourself to.
And so you always find a way to make yourself feel terrible.
And even for the best in the world and stuff, you'll just look at people who are better at other things than you and compare yourself to them to make yourself feel bad, right?
12:26
And so this is what I said to him, and I'll share it with you.
I said every winner and every loser have the same goals.
What separates them are the activities.
They commit to committing to the activities.
That is the goal.
So commit to the activities.
That is the goal.
So when you make a lot of money one month you've achieved.
12:43
I'll say that again, when you make a lot of money one month, you've achieved nothing because the goal is the activities.
And then later I said, do me a favor, instead of writing down your goals, just write down what would a billionaire who lost it all do, or what would a billionaire do to keep it simple.
13:01
Or whatever version of yourself you want to be the doing and the outcomes will happen as a result of the main internal identity shift, which you can reinforce many times a day by asking yourself that question at each crossroad.
And so I think that was relatively, you know, I think it's a good point to to end off on, which is the only tactical ask that I have for you, is to simply write down what type of person do I wish to become.
13:22
And then make that the chorus that you recite to yourself when you're at your your crossroads, when you're at your decision points that are going to create who you are on a repeated basis every single day.
And I think going back to that refrain will be all-encompassing in terms of what would Jesus do applies to a zillion scenarios but everyone, at least in the Christian faith.
13:41
And I use it because it's a very simple catch all, would want to become more Christ like, right?
And so, whatever the Christ version is for you, we can steal from that concept and continually reinforce it by asking ourselves those questions.








0:00
We have to give it our fucking all because like, the whole team's here.
If they're getting a leader like you, leading them like they're amplified.
I get so nervous before these things.
What can we do here to help build that culture of positive reinforcement?
0:20
You know, it's like you get like frozen.
I know I've been.
I'm reinforce our culture and values.
We're having our first full acquisition.com team meet up here in Las Vegas.
So over the next few days, we're going to be talking about the vision for the culture of the company and I thought it'd be super cool if we could record the behind the scenes.
0:42
So we have me and then we have Alex and then a break.
Is that how it's going?
You guys could see what it's actually like.
I think what I'm most excited for people to see from this team meet up is just what it really feels like to have a high performing team.
So if you're interested in working at acquisition.com, you've ever looked at our careers website or if you've subscribed to Mosey Talent, this is kind of what it looks like on the other side.
1:04
So I felt like it would be really valuable to give people insight into that.
I've never been a part of an environment like this where people are genuinely rooting each other on.
Yeah, being a remote company, I love that we we actually have events like this where we can actually step back, meet each other in person, put faces and personalities to names.
1:22
My name is Tobias Allen.
I am the Director of Marketing here at Acquisition.
So I think one of the things that Alex and Lela have done for reinforcing both the values and creating a culture that people are excited to be a parcel is actually living the values.
Next speaker.
All right, you guys will notice that Jason and Trevor are filming.
1:42
So we are filming the next two days.
Now they are primarily filming myself and Alex.
They were going to ask some of you if you want to add to the film.
In discussing with the team, we all felt like it would be so cool to show what it's like when the team comes together.
1:58
And I think a lot of people, they assumed like we ruled with fear.
It's actually quite the opposite of that.
I think that we've created this environment where people are high performing because they love what they do, not because they're scared of the consequences of if they don't do the job.
That's why I really wanted to display this in the vlog as I just felt like it's invaluable for people to see it because I think it's one thing to say what you do, but it's another thing to show it to people.
2:22
So I'll tell you guys a story.
My first job out of college was 24 Hour Fitness.
What I didn't realize was that when I got to 24 Hour Fitness, I actually ended up with one of the best leaders that I could have asked for.
His name is Mike.
In hindsight, the reason that that job was so enjoyable, you know, he had very clear communication.
2:40
He always did one on ones and took time to see like how do I feel?
What's my development like?
Like So then they actually asked Mike to go open a new location.
You know you've got not Mike coming to take over.
And I will never forget the first meeting and he sat us down and I've never heard someone say fuck so many times in my life.
2:58
He was like, you fucking young motherfuckers Listen up cuz here not doing any more of this shit, OK?
We're going to we're going to get our numbers up and we're all like our numbers are up.
You know, like the things he was saying made no sense.
He just continued to swear at us, yell at us.
It was the first meeting.
3:14
I was just like, holy crap, who's this guy?
It was just complete polar opposite.
I remember we started gym launch, you know, years later.
I kept thinking to myself like, I know what a difference it is to have an absolutely horrible boss and leader and or no leader right.
3:30
And then to have one that is, you know, truly investing in people, praising people, encouraging people.
Because I experienced it first hand.
Like the three words that I I remember feeling is like confused, unhappy and anxious, like constantly in a state of anxiety.
And it's crazy to me to think that just the person that leads an organization or even leads a department can create that for everybody else on the team.
3:51
Does anyone want to take a guess at what the difference was between Mike and not Mike?
Mike Praise, not Mike.
Yes.
So Mike used positive reinforcement to get people to do stuff, to put it simply, right, not Mike used punishment to get people to do stuff.
4:08
Taking those concepts, What can we do here to help build that culture of positive reinforcement?
That's really what I wanted everyone to be able to walk away with.
And the reason I wanted to relay this information is because it's not something one person can do alone.
I wanted to discuss the topic of praise over punishment at the team meet up because it's something that I personally study a lot.
4:29
I implement a lot.
Like given where we're at as a company, you know, we're only like 2 years in.
It's not like I have leisurely time to invest in teaching these things to the team.
And so I wanted to make the time by putting together this team meet up where we can focus on a lot more of the internal infrastructure.
4:48
And because on the subject of positive reinforcement, this guy is positive reinforcement like being around him is like makes you just feel so good and just excited to be, I think, alive in a world that is very judgmental.
5:04
You are not that and you're amazing.
I.
Think one of my biggest takeaways was that there's a punishment style of management and a a positive reinforcement style of management and both of those can work, but you just have to think about where your priorities are and I think it was powerful to hear that.
5:22
I want to introduce Neil.
Neil took a big step this year and moved in with his girlfriend.
Frank and I originally didn't understand this side.
We were talking about our greatest accomplishments in our life.
So.
Learn more about that.
5:37
I can tell you later we're passing each other's notes on what our actual accomplishments were this year.
I was like, Frank, how many people did you hire this year?
So I had a number that I thought was that what had me guess it?
Was like. 12O.
He.
Had four coach 12/25.
5:55
Hell yeah.
When I joined the team was Alex, Layla, Suzanne and Yasmine.
But quickly the team has grown.
I mean, our first in person meeting was the whole company because it was just five of us.
6:11
So I'm introducing the title and his big win.
This year is.
He got home, Alex.
Had a book on 500,000.
I would say that one of the core skill sets that every business that I've ever built has been recruiting.
6:28
I don't really see another resource that's more valuable to pour into than having the right people on the team.
How are you?
Today.
Yeah.
Who's she?
I'm.
Happy to introduce myself.
Look around.
This is my publish position.
How we go about finding perfect people is that in other hiring processes, people don't share those.
6:51
There's a lot that's left unsaid.
And then that's where maybe the expectations aren't even always clear.
What I've tried to do very differently is say it and put it all out on the table.
Everything for me connects back to the requirements of what we're looking for.
7:09
And so some of the stuff that we'll ask the hiring managers, think about the prevalent skills on the team.
We don't want to hire another Trevor, we want to hire someone who compliments Trevor so perfectly.
Some hiring managers are a lot better at it than others, and that's where Caleb's superpower he comes in having really thought through all of that.
7:29
I'm going to cry.
Probably just a side note, but Alex, I love you, man.
The way that you have created an ability to rethink through emotion and situations, it's been really impactful for me the the way that I analyze situations when I'm struggling or feeling like I'm succeeding.
7:58
Either way, I look at it completely differently.
And then Layla, I don't mean this in the cringy cliche term.
I mean, like I feel seen by you for some weird reason when I'm having a little bit of a day, you somehow seem to like up here.
8:14
And.
Just the way that you have again given me permission to be like it's OK to have a shitty day and you can still do shit.
No, but nobody knows is that every media team that I've ever seen, there's no organization or it's like complete bureaucracy and there's no creativity.
8:31
And you have found the way to bridge both together, having never done before just the fact that you you care about everybody on the team and you care about the brand and achieving the goals.
And I think that your ability to hold all of those 3 priorities equally is what makes you so great at what you do.
8:47
And it's why everyone just fucking loves working.
I think that the way that Alex and Layla interact with everybody on the team is incredible.
The fact that Layla takes the time to reach out to every single editor you know, every writer, a designer, whatever, that that is incredible and pretty unique compared to a lot of work scenarios.
9:08
And as the brand has grown, as acquisition.com has grown, Alex and Layla really prioritize the media team rather than just like the weird animal in the corner that makes the videos kind of thing.
The request that was made of me was to talk about branding.
Everyone who comes in contact with our content doesn't know who we are, and So what we're doing is the thing that hopefully they should know something about.
9:30
So if you didn't know what the Nike Swoosh was and I were to continue to a pair and associate it, then eventually I could eliminate all these and just have the logo and you would feel the same way about it.
All we are doing with everything that we do from a branding perspective is we take us and we associate with something.
9:50
I can say it's kind of like this which we both know and then I can make the comparison.
And if you're like wow, that sounds all like teaching, that's a lot of what branding is.
Well, brands are so powerful, then how do we grow brands if you?
Want to label some of the associations?
For us.
10:06
Their brand and the information that they give out, whether it's the books or that content, is what creates the demand for partnership with us.
But the businesses we take on, we have an extreme amount of influence.
10:21
In fact, the reason they want to partner with us is the influence that we have on their business.
When I think of the brand of acquisition.com, I want it to be known for two things.
I think one is operationalizing excellence and on the other side, I think platform to elevate others when you work with acquisition.com like you will always be better than when you came in.
10:45
If you're going to put the three words on the wall for you and you're standing up here, well, with the three words, yeah, it's our.
Personal OK, OK, so after Alex's presentation, we went into this activity around personal brand, which was we're all asked to write down three things that we would use to describe ourselves.
And then, as we picked the different things that described one another, we have to guess who wrote that about themselves.
11:05
Plays pickleball.
Sam.
Polos.
Shirts I am obsessed with the number 30 my.
God.
That was so fast, Dad.
Dad.
Being cracked.
11:23
If you know you.
Know.
Yeah.
Hiring.
Frank.
Frank.
You can't have five of the same person on a team.
I always see skills as like this pointy star, you know?
And it could in some stars have more points than others, but there's always a valley in between 2 points.
11:41
And so the ideal person on the team's points fits in those valleys.
And so then they just all start sort of like connecting together across the board.
It's like, I'm like, wow, we're really good.
It's cool.
One of the biggest things is for me is culture.
11:57
Simple things like transparency, collaboration, honesty, and just like having fun at work.
That was what what drove me to come here.
How do you take?
This philosophy down to the advantaging of the portfolio.
I think there's a lot of parts of our portfolio that are still working on the leadership aspect.
12:17
Success is is not about the mechanics, it's about what you're doing.
What about like the way you're leading people and the the people that you surround yourself.
If you have a great group of people, you can be really successful.
I think a lot of people look at their business as, let me just get whoever agrees to the role.
12:34
Whereas I've always looked at it like an NFL draft, which is like who do I need to draft?
What kind of skills do they have?
What are their values?
That's always been a core focus of mine because who is the one that is making the vision come to life At the end of day?
It's not you, it's your team.
13:07
So one of my favorite parts of the meet up was actually we took a party bus and then went to go act Sterling.
13:21
Dad, help me.
It was cool to see how incredibly awful some people were like myself, and how incredibly talented others were like my dad's.
Feels great.
13:41
And everyone also like, wants to be here, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Especially people are enjoying it.
They want to be here then?
I know.
Yeah.
I.
Don't.
Get the.
Interaction Tyler.
Every.
Day.
Yeah.
I haven't talked naughty since you joined.
Yeah.
13:57
So like some of the most, I think the most meaningful interactions like.
Getting to know them, yeah.
It's cool.
They're like, so interested.
I'm also so interesting what they do, yeah.
But it's really cool because like, I feel like both teams do what they do so well.
14:20
Really.
Yeah.
Even though I was like.
I'm meeting.
I was.
Nervous.
I'm so fucking nervous.
I remember thinking to myself, that was a terrible and I was like, and she fucking cares.
And the fact that you cared that much.
14:36
I was like, she is the kind of person I want to work with.
And it was so interesting because it's like, I think all that shit about like how well people interviewed such because I was like, I can just talk.
Yeah, I didn't realize.
That.
A lot of these people had each other.
14:52
Yeah, we have another day.
Tomorrow.
Do you have to talk?
Neil, Caleb, Sheila, Ben.
So they all have presentations.
I'm actually really excited.
If people trust each other, they'll communicate better.
15:09
If people like each other, they'll work Better Together.
You know, so many people might look at this and be like, that's so soft.
What a waste of money.
I think that's bullshit because if you look at, like, what correlates with the highest performing teams, it's not intelligence and it's not skill of an individual member of the team.
15:24
It's actually communication of the sum of the parts.
We got the watermelon, we got the potatoes and we got the eggs.
Layla asked me to build out the team meet up.
I was really nervous.
She was like, OK, don't worry, it's going to be fine no matter what.
15:41
What it was pitched to me was like, we're basically going to acknowledge people who were voted to stand out in terms of like one of these core values that we have.
I want to ask Justin, Paul, Frank and Tyler to stand up for a second and let us recognize.
15:56
You gentlemen have all demonstrated various values of ours.
But before I get into the ones that I remember, who here believes they know why one of these guys are all, What do you think they were recognized for?
16:14
What do you think they were nominated?
For Tyler, has like continued to completely and very quickly evolve his skill set.
I.
Mean hiring, I think 25 people this year.
The amount of volume that goes into that behind the scenes, and I know we've had quite a few conversations where Frank is just so hungry to learn I.
16:33
Think we throw a lot at Justin.
But like, if you look at his calendar, it's arguably the most full calendar of the entire company and you would never hear him say he's tired, never complain.
He's always super excited.
And I'll go ahead and and speak for Paul because I nominated Paul for unimpeachable character.
16:51
It is important to me that all of the people we hire, whether they're sitting in this room or they're sitting in a portfolio, they have a phenomenal experience.
Paul came back to me and I was like, that's why your home is here.
These next few people I'm going to call and ask that you stand up.
17:10
Nadia Trevor, conflict of interest for a moment.
But you're already your standing.
Davina and Hunter.
You're you're being recognized because several people in this room actually nominated you.
Tyler.
Come on, man, let's hear.
17:25
I for Trevor.
Working with him, he has demonstrated not only unimpeachable character.
But.
Competitive greatness as well, not just being able to, like, adapt to the situation.
Hunter, you are an incredible leader.
You do an amazing job of showing people around you everything that is ancillary to an edit, right?
17:44
Like timelines, keeping everyone updated, throwing in ideas on thumbnails when nobody's asked you to.
Like there is just like such a level of leadership that you display that I'm also very grateful for.
Operationalizing creativity.
That was what I thought when you sent me the document and I was like so awesome.
18:01
Because I think to be creative, you know, you put it in the SOP and when you shared it with me, it helps me too, because we're obviously doing it together.
And so it's so helpful.
I'll say something about Davina.
You know I couldn't do what I do without you.
You have no, I I'm seriously though.
18:18
I have worked with many other executive assistants like you're so professional.
You bring ideas to the table.
You bring solutions and like I'm just happy to have you as my partner and like an acquisition.
So thank you.
18:34
This is the team.
I couldn't think of a better group to do it with.
I think just the coolest part was just like nobody wanted to stop.
The last.
Group of people here blow us all away that is sincere.
18:51
It's a real, I'm sorry to mean I'm trying so hard, right?
I'm good.
But it means a lot to me to to see how the people that we pull into the organization, how they impact us all on and and each other on a day-to-day basis.
19:09
And so this group of people received more nominations than everybody else.
Jason, you were one of these people, Bishop.
You are one of these.
19:27
People.
Also one of these people.
Yasmine Tobias.
I think that recognition is always something that we can do more of and I think that the way that we did it as well was one in which everyone was recognized for something.
19:43
It's so nice to hear because I think what we forget and what I forget is that a lot of people don't have that in their normal day-to-day life.
And I think that if you want to create a really great work environment like do in the workplace what people don't get outside of that.
I have the advantage of being able to provide a place like that at work where we do take time to do that.
20:02
A.
Lot of people in here are really impressed with how hard you come every single day to this job.
I.
Mean.
Come on, guys.
Like the fact that she doesn't even need, like, she's just AG.
And with everything she does and she, what I admire about her is her ability to be transparent and have those hard conversations when it needs to be had for the better of the company and how we run.
20:27
And she's just amazing.
Yasmeen is just, you know, we're coming up on six years together and I could really not do any of this shit without her.
And she has done so far beyond things that an executive assistant should even do.
Just like I remember one time something spilled in my house.
He like, brought a fucking vacuum when I had my surgery.
20:45
You like, put pants on me.
I mean like we've been pretty close and it's just, I think one thing that you do so well is you're just so non judgmental and work so hard time over time you're constantly improving, constantly trying to get better.
And so I just appreciate the shit out of you.
21:02
But I know you guys have also went so far above and beyond on the back end of the book launch.
Just the sheer volume of hours that you guys are putting in after after doing all the other stuff and having families and kids and husbands and trips on the weekend.
Like we we mean it when we're like how did like we don't deserve you?
21:19
Like we mean that.
Like you guys are unbelievable.
Like you guys do such a good job of setting the tone wherever we go because you guys are the first impression anyone gets of Layla and I, and so you guys are so like fucking on it and like dialed and everyone knows that and it just then becomes the reflection of the entire rest of the company.
21:43
I personally nominate Jason.
If this guy is just incredible, which everyone here knows, that like talking to him after a conversation, you can't help but smile.
Like Sam said he's just he like drives you to want to be better by how good he did which is like very rare because sometimes you can maybe see that as a competition but it's like it's like a different kind of it's like let's just all be good together and he had brings that energy.
22:10
So I like I just I I have to nominate this guy because he's 10 out of 1012 out of 10/1 of 0.
Great guy.
You are incredibly industrious.
Like you work so fucking hard, but you're also incredibly enthusiastic.
One moment for Mr. Jason.
Jason moved to Vegas before he even started.
22:30
That says it all right there.
Like Jason is down as fuck for whatever needs to happen.
Any extra request anybody on the team makes, anything.
He's always like, yeah, cool, like like smile.
Like everything everyone has said is so true.
And I feel better talking to you every time I see the hunger that you have to like excel at this craft.
22:52
It's contagious, man.
Like, it's really cool and it's really inspiring for everybody on the team and.
Then what can I say about these three?
I I love you guys.
Like honestly, right?
You guys make it really easy to work with you every day as a as a unit the way you all click.
23:12
Like I've been in a lot of high performing teams and seen high performing teams before and nothing really ranks.
You know, we're close to this and I think it's because.
So you have that aptitude component, but you have the attitude component too.
Like you want to help everyone, Jacob, for example, I think you're obviously a master in sales and our pork coal companies say that all the time.
23:30
You've driven like just incredible improvements across a wide variety of different situations.
I remember we had a one-on-one once and you were like, yeah, my whole attitude is just if I can keep learning, this is going to be fun for me.
And that's like you in a nutshell.
23:45
And then Lindsay, I think like obviously your experience and customer success value that they want, they want Lindsay to be involved.
I don't think you have like an incredible muscle, which is the ability to coach and to bring people together.
I've seen that with our portfolio companies, but also I've seen it with the way you brought Jacob and Tobias and myself all together.
24:02
And I think that like that's created that chemistry for us all to work well together.
I wanted to say thank you to Lindsay for the book launch.
Ben passed the baton over to me to run the support team and and boy, was that a damn challenge.
I don't think I could have done it if you hadn't come in and helped.
24:21
I've learned a lot and I've learned a lot from you.
So thank you so much.
Thank you.
This is just a lot of that's between.
Tobias, I'll just tell the story like, Tobias basically ran with the entire affiliate program for the book launch.
24:37
We had 27,000 affiliates sign up.
And I found this out not having prompted Tobias from like the number 38 affiliate who's like, hey, I got this e-mail from your affiliate manager and it was a personalized e-mail from Tobias that I had not asked him to send, urging them to e-mail the list again with ideas of what they could do.
25:00
And I was like #38 and so he just took the entire list and was like, I'm going to, I'm going to push them And and when we had like, I don't know, 20,000 opt insurance from affiliates, I was like, this is awesome.
He's like.
I think we can do.
More, my goal in doing the nominations was the primer, right?
25:18
It's like you get people to start thinking about the day-to-day things that people do.
It's like, OK, so we've done this, you know, like on text.
Now we're going to share this one-on-one.
Then like you sort of elevate the trust and the vulnerability and then the goal was by the end of the day people would be really feeling that cohesiveness of being together all day, but if also kind of having learned more about ourselves.
25:41
Because everybody here, because of the standards that we have and we hope to continue to aspire towards, we all want to keep pushing the envelope.
We all want to get better.
And I feel like that's a common theme of like doing whatever you do exceptionally well.
And it's cool for everyone here because we all have outside perspectives of what it was like, not here.
25:59
But I feel like that is the standard and and it's this is almost like an acknowledgement of that.
How do you increase communication?
Typically by increasing the opportunities in which people can form relationships with each other, with where we're growing as a company and how fast we've added people to the team, It just provides a better environment to form those relationships that you wouldn't otherwise on Zoom.
26:22
Jimmy Michael.
Caleb Neal.
Like your teams?
Freaking.
Love you guys.
Like we're all, I feel like we're really close here and if any of you guys want to speak up and speak to one of your managers or something that you've acknowledged about them and you would like to say that here please.
Do Neil really help our portfolio partners and brainstorm and just you're never not supported?
26:42
I think your character is the thing that I am most impressed by, the way that you think about everyone on the YouTube team and then everyone regardless on the team.
And the way that you handle that I think is remarkable.
This phrase that I heard a long time ago and I've never been able to practice until now, Like pick your boss on your job and like, this is an incredible job, but like, I think you really are such an amazing boss and because you're a great person, I'm.
27:05
Going to speak to Mr. Jimmy here because you have come in and taken so much.
I think a lot of people don't realize like you're doing that with everybody on the team.
You care about everybody.
Like you've seen where there's been a lot of changes that happen on the team and you have constantly and taking things off my plate that are not within your job description.
27:23
Like you're so far along in your career and yet you still are that hungry and still striving to be better.
It's just such a great example for everybody else on the team.
Ben's perspective and just the way he hears things and then kicks it back to someone else, you talk a lot.
27:39
I love listening though.
I really do because I always learn something from you.
Leila, you know, thank you for always hearing me and listening.
I think that's it's just one of your special skills.
Of course you have many, but wait, you check in with me on these in like the moments that I feel like, you know, right.
27:56
And she just has this like special talent to check in right at that moment.
But you mean it.
You want to know how we're doing.
And I would just say that it's very unique.
That is not something that a leader of a company.
Both of y'all also do this very well.
But I would just say in general, Leila.
The best part of my day today?
28:13
Tomorrow's going to be even better.
I think the biggest thing that makes acquisition.com a unique place to work is it's the culture.
And it's not this fake thing where people are like, oh, great job, you did great there.
It's like really, truly, we all look at each other and we all want to push ourselves to the next level.
28:30
And especially with the leadership team, they all really care about our development, the culture they're bringing in.
They're going to bring something really, really big.
And I think, I really do think it's going to change the way people view leadership.
I think I just feel grateful that everyone like wants to work here and likes working here.
28:48
I feel like I would hate my life if I walked into this room and felt like there were some people that didn't want to be here.
I feel grateful that I have more skill now that I can actually communicate what we're trying to do and put words to what kind of culture we want to build tomorrow.
29:08
I think we have 4 presentations.
Each person presenting is presenting on what I would consider is like their unfair advantage, like what makes them so good at what they do.
And so I'm really, I'm really excited to to listen and I'm excited for everyone else to do.
So I think two things in my mind, which is like transfer knowledge from the leadership team to the entire team that would be beneficial for everybody.
29:30
And then the second is reinforce our culture and values.
Like the nature of acquisition.com is that a lot of what we do with our portfolio companies is explain things, teach things.
And so I can't think of better people to teach the rest of the team than the leaders on our team that are doing that on a daily basis.
29:45
When you have leaders that can speak to the rest of the team, they have context and they can contextualize the lessons, which makes it easier for people to remember and apply.
So the presentations, you know, especially bends on biases.
And then it ends with a thunderous round of applause.
That's you.
30:02
That's giving office.
That's the intro.
Talk to somebody that you don't normally get to.
Talk portfolio team.
Talk to media, media, Talk portfolio.
Getting to kind of like hear and see different departments that don't work directly together and aren't as familiar with what each other are working on and the efforts we are putting in.
30:31
Like everybody is putting it on the line and like striving for something better.
Ultimately to to help accomplish the mission of acquisition.com.
The goal here is to talk about building a personal brand as an employee.
I felt like this was the best topic for Caleb to discuss because I think it's what he's best at.
30:51
He has built his career off of his reputation.
So I wanted to start with a quote from Mr. Alex here, basically just recapping what he spoke about yesterday.
Brand is simply an association between 2:00 or more things.
For the brand to be successful, the audience has to understand one of them.
31:10
Here is a simple example.
I'm going to use my face here.
If you don't know me, you might make some assumptions about me because I'm wearing like a plain Black Hat or whatever, but there's not a whole lot to go off of.
If you add in a Harley-Davidson logo on my hat, that all of a sudden changes how you perceive me.
31:26
But it might also make you think that I'm just a hipster who thinks that Harley-Davidson is a great brand.
Either way, it changes how you view.
Me.
Possibly the biggest part though is that your brand is not one thing.
It's a collection of things that people associate you with because you are building your personal brand whether you want to or not.
31:44
We all in this room have personal brands because yesterday we went around the room and we read things about each other and guessed and a lot of us guessed right.
Your personal brand effects how your Co workers interact with you.
It affects the opportunities that come your way.
It's basically just reputation and so a quick story.
32:02
Time for how I have used this.
When I was like 15, I read a book, it was called Crush It by Gary Vaynerchuk and it basically predicted that people would be able to make videos and content and talk about things they're interested in for a full time living.
32:18
And I quickly was like, cool.
This is what I'm going to do.
I was in a small town in Washington, and I had the opportunity to work for a company that he owned in New York City.
I went into it with a very specific goal in mind, and that goal was to have my brand be.
32:34
Caleb can do it.
I wanted them to come to the conclusion that like, Caleb can do that, Caleb can do that video, Caleb can handle that.
And so in order to do that, I said yes to almost everything, any project that came my way.
I think a lot of people view personal branding as talking about things rather than doing things that form the opinions that others have of your brand.
32:57
And so it led to the outcome that I was hoping for, right?
And so why did those big projects I was hoping for come to me?
Well, because the CEO associated me with those things that I listed on the previous slide.
Does anybody have any questions about this?
I have a question.
33:13
Yes, please.
Alex was talking about how brands can shift over time.
So do you think we can do that with personal brands too, like and then how if somebody maybe had some negative associations that as they've grown and matured that now they're wanting to disassociate in favor of a more positive, how would you suggest they go about?
33:31
That great question.
If we show up late to meeting, we can start showing up to meetings on time and it changes our personal brand.
It's literally just making little shifts like that.
It's just like it clicked for me.
It's like if you want career growth, you almost need reputational growth through your brand growth in the company.
33:46
And I think there's a lot of people in this room that like they know that they want some eventually to have a different opportunity in the company or like within the portfolio companies or like as the company grows.
And it's like, if you know what that is, then just like a brand progresses over time, your personal brand must, if you want to be a leader, start acting like a leader and you get that brand and then you will get a position. 100% It's like applying the influencer model that everyone does externally on social within the company You work with it in order to accomplish what you are actually wanting to accomplish I.
34:15
Remember when I was a young, younger, younger man when I went into a catering company, I was really, I was the youngest guy there and everybody there was an adult.
And so I was like, what am I like?
And I came in really deliberately.
Like I want just everybody there to think I'm the hardest working guy here.
And so then the owner ended up putting me on more jobs, paying me more than the adults and all the stuff.
34:33
Cuz like I had no ego about it.
But it's just like when I went to a different job, I didn't have that like what was my tagline?
And I kind of like had to.
I faltered for a little bit until I figured out, yeah, that worked really well before coming in with an intention I.
Mean.
I think it's interesting because the only reason we even met was because I put the posting up for the position and then Ed Turney texted me and was like, I know this guy.
34:57
He's got a crazy reputation.
He's from Gary Vee and he just moved to Vegas.
Like, he'd be perfect.
And I was like, how do you even know?
And he was like, I just know, like, that's what everybody says.
And then we got on the call and then I was like, oh shit, it is what everybody says, Like, you're fucking awesome.
And then and now here we are.
35:12
Building and making content becomes really important in building a brand because it is the way to amplify the brand that currently exists.
The real real is the documentation side of things is to show the expertise and show the demonstration of it.
35:29
I think it's far more powerful to see Layla in a bad day and how she handles that and how she communicates with Alex, how she communicates with the team, how she makes decisions when she is really stressed.
And in my opinion, it is.
The closest thing that we can get to mentorship at scale is being able to see them practically handle that rather than just talk.
35:50
About it, I think for people watching, if you have a business or you're aspiring to have a business, if you're wondering what does a good leadership team look like, like, I can confidently say there's one on display here.
Now Ben, our Managing Director of Business Development is going to give his presentation on five cognitive biases.
36:07
So welcome.
We're going to talk today about behavioral biases are mental shortcuts or behavioral biases can lead to poor decision making and bad outcomes that negatively impact your career.
And learning strategies to mitigate behavioral biases can help you and your team kick ass and take names, the heuristics, impulses, gut feelings to quickly decide.
36:28
It works fast, but it is prone to error.
However, thinking slow is a very deliberate approach, one that is aware of process, considers all the ways in which you might screw something up.
Five biases #1 Status quo bias.
36:43
So this is the preference for the maintenance of a current state.
And this is an emotional bias because it is an emotional need for things to remain as they are now.
And let's talk about some mitigating strategies for status quo bias.
When you're making a decision as a group especially, always ask the question what decision represents the status quo.
37:03
Ensure you have options that are not the status quo #2 groupthink.
Groupthink is a behavioral bias that occurs within a group of people whereby the desire for harmony in the group suppresses dissenting viewpoints and critical thinking.
So let's talk mitigating strategy.
37:19
Reward rich discussion and debate.
If you've made a decision, seek external opinions.
Someone who is not in the group.
It's like media team like ask me.
I might have no idea, but at least I come at it from a different point of view.
Confirmation bias.
37:35
Individuals tend to interpret information in a way that confirms their pre-existing beliefs and preferences.
This is cognitive because it is all about how we process, seek out and store and then even recall information.
So force yourself to gather opinions that make you feel uncomfortable #4 and I picked this for the media team.
37:56
This is called peak and bias.
People largely judge an experience based on how they felt at its emotional peak and then how they felt at the very end of the experience.
So this is again a cognitive bias because it is about how information is stored in your brain and then how you pull it out.
38:14
Hindsight bias.
After an event has occurred, people often believe they would have, or even did predict it.
Overcoming this bias is critical to becoming a successful career learner.
So let's talk about mitigating document decisions.
Write a hypothesis.
38:31
If we do, XY will occur and Z will happen.
And there are some strategies that work for all behavioral biases #1 Seeking diverse and outsider perspectives on big decisions.
Challenge your own decisions.
And what did it push us to believe?
38:47
And what are the risks therein?
And now Thunder is rounded.
In a group environment, I think it's like a subset of like groupthink is that people have competing priorities.
At the same time, that's something that I've been trying to think through lately is like, how do we as a group get everyone's opinion on ideas unaffected by the opinions of others about their opinions?
39:12
It's something I struggle with.
I remember Layla saying on the Monday meeting before we got here.
I think I've met all of you in person and I remember thinking, I think I've met like 4 of you in person.
I am on a team that is Justin and I, so I've craved that time with the team.
39:31
But then getting such a broader experience of everybody else has been really fantastic.
We are a remote company and so I think like a lot of people lack the connection that I get interaction with the team a lot.
Most people don't have that though.
And so I look at it as that is probably where I feel like people will get benefit.
39:50
And so I think it's realizing all the dynamics that exist in organization and being able to educate everybody on how they affect the environment.
So Neil, our portfolio operating partner is going to give his presentation on the importance of psychological safety in the workplace.
40:08
So I'm going to be talking today about the secret to high performance teams.
You guys might have heard of Aristotle.
He was a a philosopher and he said the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
Now what he was referring to was, was us as humans.
The team should also act like a human right?
It should be more than the sum of each individual component.
40:25
And actually I want to start by playing a game.
It's called psychologically safe or not psychologically safe.
So there's a senior engineer who just talk and talk.
Everyone was scared.
The hardest part was that everyone liked this guy outside the group setting.
40:41
But whenever they got together as a team, something happening that made the culture go wrong.
So how many say high performing?
No one.
Absolutely.
Well, you guys are 100% right.
This seemed for a not high performing team.
This one's a little tricky.
So but let's see what you guys say.
At a recent off site, a teammate stood and described some health issues of her own.
41:00
Then another discussed a difficult breakup.
Our team leaders told us he had stage 4 cancer.
It was really hard, but a really special moment.
All right.
High performing.
OK, you guys are great.
41:16
I actually was a little confused by this because I was like how much is too much information?
But this is actually comes from a very high performing team.
So I think what we're recognizing here by the way, is that I was going to define psychological safety when I was starting this presentation.
I was like, let me come up with like some dictionary definition of what psychological safety is.
41:33
But actually what we just went through here are all examples of good psychologically safe teams and not good not psychologically safe teams that everyone got it almost unanimously right.
So in teams with high psychological safety you are comfortable with the other teammates you can take risks.
And the last thing which is really important is that this is like it's like mental health for the individual, psychological safety like mental health for the team.
41:56
A few elements that I want to highlight of what it means to be psychologically safe.
So the cool thing was Project Aristotle, Google, they noticed this about high performing teams and they're they came up, come up with like 7 characteristics of high performing, psychologically safe teams.
The 1st is a learning mindset, openness to difficult decisions.
42:14
There's acceptance of others, there's safety from risk, there's collaboration support.
No one on this team would literally act in a way that undermines my efforts.
And So what I would like everyone to do if possible is let's commit for the next quarter to picking one action, just one of these eight actions that you think you can improve on and committing to it that work.
42:34
How we respond to people's bids in the companies is that's something that I I was telling Justin like I need to work on because I think lately I've had a lot of meetings and I come back and there's like a 200 slacks.
And then I'm just like normally I go through everything and I respond and I've just felt busier.
And so I just don't.
And then I'm like wow, I'm missing out on so many areas where I could respond to those bids.
42:53
And I feel like I need to work on that.
People say things because they want a reaction and so if they've reactions not given, eventually they won't say anything.
That's why I think people have a hard time accepting compliments.
It's dangerous because you eventually will get none, because if your reaction is poor or you reject them, people won't give them to you anymore and then you think you're not good.
43:13
But it's simply that, your reaction.
It's so easy, I think when you're a remote world to just focus on just work.
But I think when you're in person like this and you, you intersperse a remote working environment, with situations like this, we get to connect with others.
There's there's such a, there's like a powerful, more interpersonal connection that you get to foster that's missing.
43:33
Last one, last presentation.
How are we feeling?
And lastly, Sheila, our Managing Director of People is going to give her presentation on how to have hard conversations.
This was something that she felt was my unfair advantage and that is having hard conversations. 70% of hard conversations are really self-awareness.
43:55
And so we focus though on the 30% that is the delivery types of conversations that are hard.
The first one is called what happened, the second one is called identity.
What does a what happened conversation sound like?
Literally, you're trying to figure out what the hell just happened.
44:10
And everybody's like showing up with their own sets of facts and they're ready to like hash it out and tell you why you are not right.
So maybe think about impact and make the conversation about impact.
Because if you focus on intention, it's just going to take you down this path of building distrust or breaking existing trust.
44:30
The last of the three is called identity.
When you run into an identity problem because it's really easy to fall into this notion that I'm either good or bad, I'm competent or incompetent, and this person has now said this thing about me, and that means that they think that I'm an idiot.
44:50
The way to go about that is to start by acknowledging, hey, this is a big project.
There's a lot at stake here, but this doesn't identify or define either one of us as people.
And remember, 70% of this is between your ears.
45:09
And that's good because that means it is a skill that you can develop and practice and work on.
So you have like the two curves that are inverted with latency and specificity.
So the later it is, the more specific has to be, The sooner it is, the more general can be.
45:24
Like with the example that Lei was talking about with the the book launch vendor who her communications like, when we always ask like what's the goal of this?
Like what problem am I solving?
Her goal in that communication was for him to accept some level of responsibility, not to really change his behavior.
45:41
It's like saying, hey Johnny, you've been kind of slacking.
Lately.
That doesn't change their behavior.
That's why I think the listing of the facts is so important in the discussion planning.
It's like because that's irrefutable.
And I think it's like in going through all this, like the one message I think is underlying too is like when we're having these conversations, like what I think you do really well is like seek not to punish the person, but find a solution if you want to make sure, hey, this was a bad, like this did not have a good outcome for either of us, that it's address the facts and then what can we do to move forward.
46:14
I just think back to like 8 years ago when we started our first company and we had our first meet up and it was just me talking the whole time and there wasn't a lot of connection and probably a decent of like punishing events that occurred.
Like I've never wanted that, but I have lacked the skill to create what we have now and to see the team just work so well together and love being together, it felt kind of like I did it.
46:40
Thank you all for participating.
And like, it's just been so cool because, you know, I feel like, I feel like you guys all genuinely want to be here, which is a great.
There's just been times in my past where maybe I didn't have the skill to build a team, where people did all genuinely want to be there.
46:56
And so it feels really cool to feel that in this room.
And just like how down you guys are for all the presentations, for all the activities we're doing.
And it was such a shiny example of I think I would be proud to show portfolio company like this was our acquisition.com team meet up.
47:12
I wouldn't want to show up to my office every day and feel like I have to be a different version of Layla.
And I don't want people to feel like they have to show up to work every day and be a different version of themselves.
I create an environment where people feel safe to be themselves as well.






0:00
If you want to be a great dead lifter, then deadlift.
If we want to be a great squatter, then squat.
If you want big legs, then you need to take your legs to absolute failure.
And so you basically want moves that isolate everything else except for the thing that you have that you can just absolutely take it to near death.
0:19
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe our our whole media team says like Max Stoke, really like.
0:34
As a result of us or just.
Pure.
Result of you guys.
Oh, we got to talk about.
Let's get it on the pod.
Oh, we're rolling.
Cool.
Sorry.
I really want people to know that.
Oh yeah, No, for sure.
No, I saw that 'cause that's sick.
Yeah, I saw that clip where you were like Town hall.
I know you guys do a bunch of clips at town.
Is it Town Hall?
Yeah, that's correct.
City.
City Council, yeah, And we were just talking about how, like the Stoke was dying down in the community and like there needed to be opportunities for Max Stoke.
0:57
And I told Caleb, my director of Brand, I was like, dude, we need more stoke.
Do you think there's something?
Because I think the stoke is always dying down.
In a way, it's like our human condition to believe that it used to be higher or could be higher in the future, but I think that's almost valuable, right?
To like believe that it will go higher at all times.
1:14
It's hope.
It's hope.
Yeah, we're chasing peak stoke, but like you know, froth can only stay frothy, so like the moment you stop frothing it like the bubbles.
Froth's a little more ephemeral, while Stoke is always there.
We just got to reach.
It's an ideal that we always strive for but never achieve.
1:30
It's like we kind of took it from Harvey Milk, because in the movie Milk at least, he says you got to give him hope.
It's like the last thing that comes out-of-the-box, Pandora.
And that's what we think with Stoke is like, you got to give him Stoke but it's not like ever going to be top, top you're you're trying to get there.
Yeah, it's the.
1:45
It is.
I mean, it's the ideal.
It's the top of the mountain.
What gets you stoked?
Hard things worth doing.
Whoa, dude, you are such a lucid speaker.
It's crazy.
Is that something you practice?
Or is is the brain just a clear highway?
2:02
No traffic?
Yeah.
How do you keep it?
Free of traffic, dude.
I actually think it's it's super well lubricated.
Oh, oh, nice.
Yeah, More than there's good infrastructure.
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
Good.
Good, Good guardrails.
No, I took, I I spent.
I spent like, I had like a rocky cutscene of life.
2:18
That was like 5 years of me taking 20 + 1 on one consults a day selling gym memberships.
And so like, I had to talk to everyone like all the time, every day.
It's like, I think you just learn how to say stuff better.
2:35
So people would just come into your gym and it was just you convincing them to get a membership and you just got so good at giving them the pitch that it just carried over into all your thinking.
Yeah.
And then just like, I mean, I'm sure like, I've gotten better because like the topics have gotten wider than just like.
So what brings you in today?
2:51
Would you would you have so far, like, how'd you try that?
Like, how'd that work for you?
Would you like about it?
You know, like you go through the same scripting over and over again, but like the 1st 5 minutes, it goes from like, you know, Mike the cop to Lupita the house cleaner to, you know, like it's all different people.
It's.
It is.
Absolutely.
3:07
The masses, You know what I mean?
Like I got to talk to every walk of earth and a lot of us are in these bubbles like friend groups or whatever communities.
We talked about Vanderbilt for a second.
Going from like the white collar world of Vanderbilt and then like a management consulting career to haggling over a $99.00 a month boot camp membership was like it was both humbling but also just like eye opening in terms of like how little I know about like the world and other people and etcetera.
3:33
And was your gym.
It wasn't like a bougie one, right?
Like it was like like price point wise it had a wide demo.
Yeah, total because it was a service facility.
So like even though it was 99 and then eventually like 150 a month, it was, it was service based.
3:48
So it wasn't like you're like you wouldn't compare it to like an LA Fitness because they would have 100 times more equipment and showers and all this stuff.
I didn't have any of that stuff.
I just had like me and I was going to train people together.
Oh, OK, I see group training.
It was like, oh, nice.
And how'd you come up with, like, the workout methodology that you used?
4:05
I did the stuff that they wanted to do like I didn't.
I didn't train them the way I trained because they didn't want to look like me.
So I trained.
They didn't want to be jacked.
I know, actually, I'll tell you a funny story.
I had a guy come in.
Yeah, it sounds cool, but what's up?
I dude, come in once and and he just started off the conversation.
4:22
He's like, hey, to be clear, he's like, I never want to look like you.
I was like and so like naturally as, you know, like I feel like ego, you know what I mean?
And then I felt like close the sale and just like take it.
And so I went with ego.
How did you?
Resist the urge to like, grapple him.
Now, oh, what I did, I went with the ego response and I was like, don't worry, you never will.
4:44
And then I I took a step back and I was like, no, because like you don't overnight like, sneeze and become jacked.
I was like, there's like 100,000 days between where you are and where I am and you can just like.
Stop and I'm measuring you right now and you don't have the determination to get.
There, I've weighed and measured you, and there's no way that you're sufficient.
5:01
Were were you naturally a people person before you got into entrepreneurship?
Or do you need to?
Develop that skill.
I think so, yeah.
I was.
I was fraternity president when I was.
Going to ask if you're a fraternity president?
I swear to God, yeah, I was Which.
Was it a tough election Pike?
You're a dude.
I'm a Pike.
5:17
No one.
Yeah, Santa Clara.
All right.
No, it was a it was, it was a runaway election.
It was a landslide.
Did you feel bad for the other guy?
No one guy, only one guy ran against me.
And like when we did the voting, he went to the other room and he just like, shook my hand and was like, you're going to get it.
I just promised myself that I would run no matter what.
5:34
Oh, respect.
And yeah, I was like dope.
He ended up becoming VP.
So I was like, all good.
Good VP too.
He wasn't like, you know.
Yeah, trying up stage, trying to organize a coup.
A coup, right?
No, he was a he.
Was a trip from Pismo to Cabo.
No, I because some of the older classmen, because like the older guys also want to make sure the house is in good hands with and so they start like thinking like, hey, like have you thought about, you know, right.
5:57
And like, I hadn't thought about it until one of the older guys like you should.
Totally.
Run.
I was like, dude, that's the best they they asked you to do it, to leave.
That's nice, it worked out.
But it it's funny because a lot of the, especially in like the Internet world, anybody who is not in that world, which is most people assume that it's like chief Partier.
And it's like, not that because it's you like the guy that has to be able to be respected enough when he says, like, I'm pulling away the punch bowl, like the cops are here or the guy who has to talk to the cops Or like, when a girl goes to the hospital because she, like, drank too much.
6:26
Like, you want that guy who's going to have the conversation, who's going to like, you know, negotiate on your behalf with Vanderbilt with like how much trouble you're going to be in because you brought liquor on campus and you're not supposed to just like the hard conversations and that you you want somebody who's going to do that.
6:41
So in some ways it's like it's you get the prestige because of the title, but the actual day-to-day is like, do we have enough cops?
Do we have ice?
Do we have speakers like Where's the Where's the musician?
Like?
Outside people underestimate that in like bro hierarchy that they think the top bro is the one who parties the most or gets laid the most, but it's actually the person who can do those things but you still respect them.
6:59
Ethically, you know that they'll do the right thing when it comes down to.
A party enabler long term.
So it's like long term.
Partying is all I was maximizing for.
I even had this thing I did.
I gave this, like, presentation on fraternomics to our, our fraternity as an argument because it was really, it was actually a huge, I got so much, like, life experience from this because I had to get 100 dudes in college to do stuff they didn't want to do with no hard authority.
7:23
Like, I couldn't like there's no, like, punishment, you know what I mean?
And so and they're also like friends of mine.
So it's like, how do I, you know, how do I get them to do community service?
Because we have to do a certain amount of hours and they have to show up to the events.
And like, like, one of the things was we were notorious.
Like, our house is notorious for showing up really late and partying really late.
7:39
And I was trying to explain to them, I was like, guys, if we if we all show up earlier to the parties, I was like our parties aren't going to be like twice as big.
That's like they'll be like five times as big.
And that's when I explained fraternomics.
I was like, so if people are, you know, like girls are walking on the the, you know, the frat row or whatever and they see all these parties.
7:56
Well, if it's like 10:30 or 11:00, that's like when people start walking to parties and you're going to look and you're going to see where the line is, be like where the line is, is where it's probably happening.
If it's there's no line, there's no real party.
And so we're all getting there really late.
But the guys who get a little bit earlier get the snowball effect.
8:12
So then, like, they're all there.
A line starts earlier, then more people go to the fraternity, and then it just starts compounding, right?
And so I was like, we're not going to have twice as, but we'll have five times.
People love spectacle.
Oh yeah, white noise.
I negotiated A merger between our fraternity and another fraternity.
Oh wow.
8:28
Hostile.
Takeover leveraged by.
A kind of.
It was a hostile takeover.
That's good.
So we got.
So we got kicked off campus for whatever.
And so we lost our house.
What was whatever we got?
Oh, actually, it was hazing, bro.
It was a legitimate.
It wasn't actually.
8:44
So we had apparently like 20 generations earlier, taking a loan from the institution to to totally frat out the house.
But then we had never repaid the loan because whoever took out the loan was 20 alumni ago and had graduated and it didn't care.
9:00
And so then the the university, we had no interest payments and then just called the loan due.
And so we would have had to pay all of us out of pocket for a house we didn't own but the but the but the university did.
So like, we took a loan to improve the real estate that the university owned, but then they called us 20 generations later for the IT was basically like all the houses had loans they chose to call ours because they wanted us off campus.
9:26
Yeah, that was like, what?
They had other reasons, but that wasn't then they caught.
That was what they caught.
Yeah, we we we got caught for for it's like Al Pacino with like mail fraud or something like that was the mail fraud for us.
So we got kicked off campus.
And so that obviously is like a death, you know, like because everybody's on campus is going to have best access to talent.
9:44
It's everything.
And so there was this other fraternity that was like dying that they had a really sick house but like no Bros.
And I was like dude, we have Bros but no house.
And I was like, I feel like we could figure something out.
And so their big concern and they were actually pretty OK with it because we had a ton of girl and we had like a lot of good Rep for.
10:05
That kind of cachet.
Yeah, we had some cachet and but they were like, hey, and they were a Southern fraternity and we were like a Northern fraternity.
So they were like, what about the Clash that, like, like, literally something like the negotiations were like, how much country is going to be played versus like how much house music.
And we had to go, like, we had to, like, go like term by term, right.
10:23
And so I was explaining to them because some of their older guys were like, I don't want to change anything.
I was like, listen, we pull from different girl pools Like, you pull Southern girls.
I was like, we pull Northern girls.
I was like, so there's no overlap.
We're just going to have bigger, better parties and a more diverse crowd.
You're going to see chicks you've never seen before.
We're going to see chicks we've never seen before.
And so the final term of the negotiation was, how do voting rights work?
10:41
Because everything is voted on.
And they're like, because you guys have like a hundred 120 guys and they were like 30 guys.
So we basically came up with a 3/5 compromise.
Just, yeah, just like just like, you know, back in the day, like the Forefathers.
And so that's actually what we worked on.
10:58
And so, like every Pike vote was worth 1/4 of every one of their votes.
That makes sense too.
Yeah and so.
But the problem was that influence doesn't work that way.
If 3/4 the guys want to do one thing and 1/4 of the guys don't like, the peer pressure is just insurmountable, right?
11:15
And so we ended up being able to.
That's where, like the hostile.
You got most of your like agenda across.
So that as soon as as soon as we did get, as soon as we infiltrated and merged, we became one.
When you're playing chess like that, do you know it's going to work out that way?
Or are you just playing one move at a time and hoping that if you do your best on that move, it'll work out the way you want?
11:35
I take all the all the all the plays from the last thing that I want to have happen and try and work backwards.
Wait, explain that.
So like this, this crosses like even like business stuff or whatever.
But if I'm if we're if like decisions become more complex when you're trying to serve more than one master.
11:51
And so if we're trying to get something to happen, then it's like I don't want to also say, well, I also want the, I also want a house that has great checks.
I also want a house that it's like I needed to keep our house on campus.
That was the goal.
And so everything back down to OK, of all the different places that I could do a deal, which one's most likely that that would accept the deal.
12:09
OK.
Where do we have the most leverage?
OK.
Well, you know and then it's like and it's like, OK, this is the highest likelihood target that we that I could go after and then it just step by step from there, yeah, because at the end of the day they had the most leverage.
Because they had the place.
They had the they had the house, but I had Bros.
12:25
Yeah, you had Bros.
Yeah, I had Bros, but.
You guys were Ronans.
Yeah, yeah, we were.
You were nomads at the moment.
We were bromance.
Is there a legendary lore about your parties?
Yeah.
Vandy Yeah, we had, we had a Catalina wine mixer and I got a ice helicopter on the front yard.
12:41
Yeah, everyone would like some of the seniors, like you spent $1000 on this.
I was like, I know I only spent $1000 on this.
Can you imagine?
But the fraternomics just took over because they quickly saw the line up there, because as soon as you see a, you know, 1/2 to scale ice sculptor of a helicopter like you know, they mean business.
12:56
Is there the Alex Hormozi book?
The Fraternomics Vanderbilt.
There are some moves that have been that have been patented and trademarked.
I came back to campus five years later and I was in the cafeteria and two freshmen I didn't know were in front of me and like I couldn't make this up.
13:14
And they check out.
And as I check out after them, I go to like the ketchup and whatever station and one guy turns to the other and says, dude, I just pulled a hormozi really because he stole a chicken breast.
And so the way that way back in the day, you'd put a chicken breast underneath your salad and then you could also have a chicken breast on the side.
13:33
So you could get 2 chicken breasts, but you'd have one meal credit.
So like you couldn't have more than one, You have to pay extra.
So I put one under my salad and that way I could get it through.
But that's.
Good on 2 levels because it's also a healthy meal.
Like you're focused on just trying to get more jacked involved, but clean, were you?
Were you as jacked in college as you are now?
13:50
As shredded, not as jacked smart.
Yeah, that's awesome.
I was lighter.
I hadn't come into my man body yet.
But but so they but the but the administration start catching on with us.
So they started like asking people to push their salad aside to make to show that there was nothing underneath.
14:05
But we stayed, we the royal, we stayed, you know a step ahead.
And so I started getting newspapers, because they had newspapers in the cafeteria.
And so I'd have my plate and I would have a newspaper like this.
But then I threw chicken breasts.
And then I could put like two or three chicken breasts lining the inside of the newspaper.
But now you're getting pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.
14:23
I mean, at what point are you like, I'm I'm, I'm taking too much chicken.
I felt like it was kind of like how Lindsay Lohan approached that issue in Mean Girls.
Like The limit does not exist.
Oh yeah.
I felt like you have said that.
No.
14:38
That's the first time Natty Bro, you pulled it.
That's sick.
Is there such a thing as too much protein?
That's.
A good question.
Spiritually or.
No, like metabolically.
So for what outcome?
Like you get as much protein as you want.
14:54
It's just like how much of it is going to be like used to gain muscle like you Max out.
From that perspective that's pretty well studied.
Like if you eat like more protein gets you more muscle until it doesn't anymore.
And so then after that point it's just calories the same as a carb would be.
There's like an asymptom, right?
15:11
And everyone's different, right?
Like, I always, I've always and I don't know anything, but I've always felt like diet.
Like, me neither.
Every person's different, right?
Like there might be a more, there might not be one diet that fits everyone.
There's an ideal diet for every person, but it might not be an ideal diet for all people.
So how do you find out what's the ideal diet for you?
15:27
The thing you can stick to.
Right.
So it's just about.
It's like a real.
Function, yeah.
Like if I I mean, mind you, I had a lot of weight loss and fitness conversations in my life.
But, like, I would have this talk a lot.
And I had to have this talk with my trainers, too, because they would want to, You know, a powerlifter wants to train every, like a powerlifter.
15:42
Bounty builders want to train every, like, bodybuilders, kettlebell girls want to train every, like, kettlebell girls, whatever.
I was like, if we get these people in shape for six months of their entire life and then they go back, I was like, what did we accomplish?
Nothing.
I was like, if we get everyone to walk 10 minutes of a day for the rest of their lives, I was like, we've won because, like, you can add 10 years of someone's life by just getting them to walk for 10 minutes a day.
16:02
Like, that's how little it takes.
And so it's way more about, at least my perspective of like if you can't do it forever, don't do it for a day kind of thing because you're just going to stop eventually.
Like if you're going to stop eventually, why start?
So I want to think like how little do I need to do that I will actually be able to persist.
16:19
To do that I will get the most from for the least amount of work.
That's I I found that with diets because I I've dabbled in.
I did keto, I did Carnivore for like 2 weeks.
But I made the mistake of eating In-n-out patties, so we were like shooting the video and I was like, sick.
He was a little tired that day.
He has Max energy most days and that day I was like you might need some broccoli dog because.
16:39
You have a Flintstone, buddy.
Well, I was like because I watch this guy, he's like, doesn't matter where it comes from, just as long as it's meat, which.
But then I found that just high quality food is the best because you felt better maintain that.
Yeah.
16:55
And you know what?
Actually that was like the best shape I had been in.
It's just high quality food consistently and then not even working out too hard.
Like I I would just, you know, go Max effort and then just not even working out too hard.
Just like, kind of listen to your body, I think, yeah.
17:10
Whatever, you stick with what that's like.
Are you doing like hypertrophy?
What's your like?
Yeah, that's your main thing.
Yeah, I just.
I just strength train because that's what I like.
What's your Rep target?
It's more, it's more of AI mean.
It's a range, you know what I mean?
Depends on the exercise.
Depends on the exercise.
17:25
I'm talking the main ones, the compound lifts.
Even then, depends so.
You'll do 20 reps on squat.
I don't squat, but for like leg lifts for sure.
Is it 'cause you just don't want disc degeneration?
For so Barbo lifts like for the whole concept of like doing it for everything, like you don't see many 8 year olds barbell squatting.
17:42
And so I just see that it's like most people can't mechanically do it for a long enough period.
It's a shame I'm about to give it up right now, but I'm sad to move over to like, the leg press, but I'm doing Pilates, which is great for the lower half.
I haven't done Barbo lifts in years.
Are are you?
How are your trunks?
You big?
They're solid.
Yeah, those calves are nice.
17:58
Oh yeah.
So how do you throw quads later?
How do you keep the How do you keep the legs?
How do you keep the legs big when you're not hitting the squats and the you?
Can get them bigger without doing that.
No way, bro, 100% dude.
Come on.
How?
100% Well tell it well, think about.
Think about the the limiting factor.
Unless it's like proprietary, no.
No, no, I mean it is, but.
18:13
But you'll give it away.
Yeah.
All right, we'll put this one behind a paywall.
Yeah, good call.
So just make sure now we're switching to only fans only gains anyways.
So real quick guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
18:32
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you'll mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
18:53
So if you think about the limiting, so you want, you want the, the muscle that you're trying to train to be the mechanical limiter of the lift, right?
So that that's the one that actually goes to true failure in order to be free to stop doing the reps.
If you're squatting, most times when you fail squatting, you fall forward right at the park.
Like if you actually go to failure, you fall forward and it's because your core gives out before your legs.
19:09
Though, like if you can like press 1000 lbs, if your body were perfectly rigid, you'd be able to squat 1000 lbs.
And so the best squatters have cores, core strength, that are like, out of this world.
They have turtle shell abs out to here, and it actually doesn't even look that good because they have so much hypertrophy in the literal sense of their abs that it almost looks like it's called power gut.
19:26
It's like you have this really strong gut.
Which I think a lot of people maybe then misinterpreted as being a result of HGH or some kind of supplementation.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Some, but often times that's just from what you're.
Just being strong.
Just training, but I'm sorry I knocked you off.
Keep going.
No, you're good.
And so like, you know, same thing with like deadlifts.
19:42
It's like, well, if you want to, if you want to be a great dead lifter, then deadlift.
If we're going to be a great squatter, then squat.
If you want big legs, then you need to take your legs to absolute failure.
And so you basically want moves that isolate everything else except for the thing that you have that you can just absolutely take it to near death.
20:00
And so that's like hack squats come into place where you have full range of motion on the joint that you're trying to work like you can hit like with a hack squat.
You can go all the way ass to grass or you know, hamstrings to calves and go full stretch, full squeeze.
And you think that's best ass to grass?
Or in a hack squat, because of the way that a well designed hack squat will allow you to do that with limited mobility, like most people don't even have the mobility to deadlift properly without rounding their backs.
20:24
How do you feel about the hex bar?
So more people have the mobility to do a trap bar deadlift than a straight bar deadlift.
And So what ends up happening with that?
Is that like a trap bar that is a great overall body lift because like it works your grip, it works your back, it works your traps, it works your glutes, it works everything and there's nothing.
20:40
Again, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.
I'm saying if you're going to train, if your if your goal is like, I want to train this muscle, then I want to have the exercise that is going to get me the fullest range of motion on the joint that I can do the most volume on, that I can load in a way that's incremental, that is safe for everything else that I do.
20:59
And so if I if I check all those boxes and that's pretty much how I look at the exercises that I select, they're ones that I know that I can do a ton of volume on without hurting my joints.
Because I got a certain, like I'm almost 20 years into training, like competitively or at like a real training level.
And so it's not even like, I can squat right now, but I can't hit the same volume on squats as I can on banded leg press or hack squats or, you know, you know, a Smith press.
21:26
You know, whatever.
Lunges.
Lunges are brutal, but yes.
You throw those in.
I would.
I would so with lunges.
I would probably do like a Bulgarian split squat if I wanted to like isolate glutes.
So you'll throw a foot up on the bench and come forward like.
Yeah, because then you're glued.
Is the, is the.
Mechanical focus.
So you're really trying to maximize the focus on it.
And so with compound lifts, do you almost avoid those because you want to?
21:44
Like a hack squat.
Still compound lift right?
Like it's still a multi joint movement.
It's just.
Offering a bit more focus and a bit more.
Sustainability on the things that are not core to the lift so that they don't become limiters.
Right, because my hip flexors will get in the way of my squat.
Totally.
That sucks.
Yeah.
21:59
So you have mobility limiters and then you just have like strength limiters.
So like your core might be a strength limiter for squat.
You might also have hip, hip flexibility limitations like on the movement.
So you actually can't even do it properly to feel the muscle that you want to because you're because your mobility won't allow you to get the muscle in the position that it would be the limiter.
22:18
When you were When you were starting out in entrepreneurship, like Deep This.
Is the most I've talked about fitness in probably like 7 years Like legit?
No like Caleb's like I have not been asked about fitness in like 7 years.
Good.
I'm glad.
All right.
Yeah.
I think I am glad.
Yeah.
When when you were like starting an entrepreneurship, like deep into, were you lifting as much as you are now?
22:36
Were you able to maintain that lifting?
Yeah, I've lifted pretty much the whole time, yeah.
Do you lift with Bros?
I go bro low for the most time but.
And sorry, is that a single bro or no bro?
That's I'm the solo bro.
Oh, I thought you said Bro Low.
I am bro low.
22:53
I lived bro low.
I think you're thinking like bro, like low bro.
He's solo, bro.
Yeah, like solo bro.
Low is me.
Copy.
Yeah, I should have known that.
No, it's all good.
It's all good and.
Jake cut that.
Don't keep it because people might be confused.
23:11
Yeah, they might not know.
They might not know.
Yeah, it's good if I'm vulnerable.
Yeah, it's good there.
It's authentic.
Yeah, though it's it's so I prefer to train with training partners.
I just happen to train bro for the most part.
Same, but it's hard to hit those.
Same You're going to push yourself hard if you have some friends with you, especially if they're stronger than you.
23:29
Totally.
And I I have trouble.
I work out by myself.
Typically.
At the end of the day, I'm very tired.
I don't go to failure on every set because I don't have LIKE, the horsepower internally to get there.
But I know if my dogs were there, I'd probably hit it.
Oh yeah, but then I might get hurt too.
I mean, there's a downside to it as well.
And that's where, that's where I think the exercise selection is so, like, key with that stuff.
23:46
Like it's really tough to get.
I mean you can get hurt on a hack squat, but it's like a lot less likely.
Like you can't take squats to failure.
There's fundamentally you can't do it because you just like it's massively risky to take squats like barbell squats to failure, but taking a hot squat to failure?
Fine, you know what I mean.
24:01
Yeah, when you watch football players hitting their Max in college, they've got 20 guys around them.
There's like three guys.
Washing bottles.
Everything's shaking.
It's a big event.
You can't just do that in your garage.
No and and.
That's how my friend Teddy, stop being Teddy.
Yes.
But but like, even then, like from a hypertrophy perspective, everything comes down to just volume, times, intensity.
24:22
And so those kinds of lifts, if you like, get super jacked up and do that thing like you end up having more central nervous fatigue.
So that actually impacts your future volume and intensity for the rest of the week.
And so there's a trade off that happens where like it makes sense to do those lifts if you're getting close to a competition or you need to have a peak event of some sort.
24:37
Yeah, you need Max performance.
Right.
But for the most part, you're really just trying to accumulate volume and fatigue on the muscle so that you adapt to it.
So, so do you think guys who get super hyped up before a set are actually doing themselves kind of a physical disservice because that's just more like pomp, but it's not really helping their body?
24:55
It's about how much you not to give you like really Willy nilly answers here, but like if you do it every once in a while then it's like then it can serve you.
It's just like intensity techniques.
Like if you do drop sets or you do 1 1/2 reps or you do slow eccentrics or anything like that to like make a set more intense.
You can do that.
25:11
If you do it on every set, then you'll end up fatiguing in the wrong way, right?
What's your favorite thing to talk about?
I I almost exclusively talk about making money in business which is great.
I I do I'm loving this so like this is this is like a breath of fresh air.
So I'm I'm I'm wrong.
Yeah.
I.
Was wondering, I was like, I was like well, was he tired of talking about weightlifting or this is more of like a detour for?
25:29
You This is fun.
This is a side quest, but like a worthwhile side quest.
Do you believe in cheat days?
I believe in cheat life.
Cheat life?
What does that mean?
So I just want to so like I eat pretty much fruit, meat and dessert.
Nice animal based.
It that works for me based.
25:44
So I just get all my protein in really easily before I go to dinner.
And then when I go to dinner I eat whatever, you know what I mean?
And that way.
So basically I just back in from.
So all the people that I know have been incredibly fit for a very long time have a much more simplified version of how they stay fit because anybody's like adhering to any kind of strict anything.
26:03
They're not going to do it until they're 80.
So like don't care are.
You friends with any fat people?
Well, they're friends with me.
Right.
You don't say anything, but there's a you harbor.
Just do you present some detachment?
No, not at all, because.
26:18
You know you can't count on them if a fire starts.
No, I'm being ridiculous.
Oh, no, of course I'm sorry.
No, of course I do.
What people choose to do with their bodies is, is their choice.
But but as far as I'm concerned, from the from the food perspective, I know what my calorie intake needs to be.
26:34
And I've been, you know, I I counted calories for years of my life to the point now like, I know what's in everything.
Ballpark enough.
And since I also don't have a tremendous amount of food variety, I know what all my meals are.
And so, like the easiest hack in the world for anyone who's trying to, like, get back in shape is like most humans, 90% of their meals are the same 10 meals.
26:51
Like if you think back over the last week, you probably have the same like two or three things you rotate for dinner, two or three things you rotate for lunch, and maybe two or three things you rotate for breakfast if that.
And so if you want to change your entire life, all you have to do is just change what those 10 meals are.
And it makes it way easier for people to like.
You don't have to change everything.
27:06
It's like you just need to find like two or three breakfasts that you like that actually help you rather than hurt you or whatever.
And so and so for me, I have the same breakfast and the same lunch every day.
And then that knocks out almost all my protein macros for the day.
And then when I go to dinner, because that's when I usually have social things, business dinners, whatever, I can be way more flexed.
27:25
And I just know what my rough calorie intake is.
So I can have dessert, I can have drinks, I can do whatever.
And so like I've drank for almost the entirety of being shredded and jacked.
I've I I basically stopped drinking for like 3 years just because the business was like blowing up.
And I I was like, I'm not going to be the reason something gets fucked up.
27:42
But since then I, you know, I've been drinking the last four years and I drank for my whole life before that, from the time I was a toddler and I was shredded the whole time.
Meaning, if you just get the if, you just know at the end of the day it's just.
Again, this is apparently controversial, which is ridiculous.
But like you burn a certain amount of calories, you take in a certain amount of calories.
28:00
The difference is what you gain or you lose, right?
So was the choice to keep your dinner option to keep your dinner open diet wise?
Also to optimize business because the social aspect would be better I.
Think it's just optimized life.
Right.
You need to have some fun.
Yeah, and just like not be the guy who's going to bring Tupperware or be a pain in the.
28:17
Ass 'cause that can kill the vibe.
Yeah, the stoke would definitely be diminished.
And then when you're drinking, like, are you able to, do you ever, like, just let loose?
Yeah, like, like.
Loose, loose on special occasions.
Yeah, How many times per year?
Once.
Once a year?
Maybe twice.
28:33
How do you know the day is coming?
Or is it surprising?
You feel it?
Yeah, you're just halfway through the day and you're like, I think I'm getting fucked up.
Today, I know.
I think it's before I even start drinking.
I'm like, Oh my God.
You can feel that burning.
The demon needs.
To come out.
So you don't put that in your schedule?
The demon coming out.
You're like, yeah, yeah, like this demon day.
28:49
So my birthday, my birthday corresponded with the book launch that I just did.
And so like after the book launch was over, the team came and I was like, there's a time for work and there's a time for play.
I was like, it is now a time for play.
And like Leila came to pick me up from the pool cabana like 6 hours later and she was like I knew you just.
29:10
Finished a book, bro?
You get to rage.
Yeah, that's been true.
Throughout all the history.
Yeah, I mean even BC like 2000 BC like Seneca was, was shotgunning all the.
Grease dude.
When they finished one of them plays, they were like bring on the wine.
Suckling from the epictetus.
Yeah, so far, please.
29:27
You got after it, dude.
Are are you a big?
Do you like literature a lot?
Do you read a lot?
Not a ton.
What do you read?
Not a ton.
Oh, that's interesting.
So how do you get information?
Mostly from communication.
Like, how'd you learn about business just through doing?
Doing for the most part, honestly.
29:43
So you don't read like Barbarians at the Gates or Shoe Dog or any of that?
Not a ton.
Layla does more reading than than I do, and then she just, like, tells me what she read.
I'm like, that's good.
Well.
It's through osmosis.
She picked osmosis around you.
That's smart.
I do so my learning, so everyone learns differently.
But for me, when I want to like go into a new category or learn about something, I'll I'll usually read a ton of books on a very narrow topic.
30:03
So I would like it's, it's really unlikely for me to read a big mass market book.
But like when we started getting into like doing deals with acquisition.com, read like 8 books on deal making in a week.
And then I called everybody I knew who does deals for a living in as an investor.
And I just asked every question I could possibly think of and then compiled all their answers with all the notes I have in the book.
30:20
And then had some sort of working thesis of like OK, I think that's what I.
Want to do was the book helpful or was it more just the that you put in the effort to read the book that you think kind of fortified you in the deal making?
You know, the books were helpful.
Like, they do work.
Yeah, OK, I think books definitely work.
I I've, I've heard you talk about before that that you view, 'cause I feel like a lot of people though that they have, they're like these motivational things where it's like you got to read a book a week or whatever and you're like, that's just an excuse that's just like a waste of time.
30:45
Well, like if you if you if you boil everything down to like brass tacks, it's like you need to do the things that will make you successful.
And the book is not one of those things.
Be the person that someone writes the book about.
Sure.
I mean, that's like Benjamin Franklin said to to to be remembered.
You either have to do something that people write books about or write books worth reading like this, the only thing that can like, live on.
31:05
But for for for my perspective, I totally lost my train of.
Thought I was going to ask, have you ever wrestled a book because I lost my train of thought?
OK, perfect.
Have I wrestled 1I?
Don't know, dude.
My brain went scrambling.
Dude, I'm right there with you.
I think we hit a natural kind of time is set up again.
31:21
Yeah, just.
Chill.
Relax.
Figure it out.
Dude, we had a refraction.
Period.
That happened.
Yeah.
I feel like all three of our brains were just on a collision course and it just hit, you know, fusion boom.
New energy?
Yeah, what do we?
I mean where?
Do we go from?
Here, That's crazy.
I don't know.
31:37
And I know like we got our hands on the wheel, but I feel like it's just.
Willy nilly we have Jesus like over.
How do we how do we turn Stoke into a business?
Stoke.
Well, the brand.
Oh, Stoke is a brand, is for fucking sure, like a brand.
31:56
And so I think can.
We call it something else.
Or does it have to be a brand?
And I love Stoke as a brand.
OK, but but if.
But if Stoke.
But if Stoke feels like it can't be a brand, right?
Why wouldn't it be?
I know, because then I I guess I'm wary of commodifying it.
But we have to because I want to have a good life.
So, so, so, I think so.
32:12
The Stoke is an ideal, right?
And so, like Nike, is victory, It's an ideal that everyone strives towards.
And so Stoke is also an ideal different and to build stoke you associate Stoke with as many stoke like things that you guys determine it is.
32:27
And so the more associations you say like you see like this epic wave and you're like that stoke for sure and then everyone's like.
I'll cosign a wave.
They're like, yeah, of course, right, Hancock all over it and you're like, OK, that is Stoke and people are like, oh so epic wave stoke.
So charge 5 bucks to ride the wave.
32:44
No, what you do is you basically show pictures and have discussions about stoke next to and about things that you agree on, that you cosign are also Stoke, that you just be like if stoke were a bucket of ideas, you'd be like, that's like, you know what's the shoot?
33:01
It was like the the wilderberries.
Traveling wilderberries.
No, there was a there's the OK, so there was this band and they had like an in crew and they called them Tom.
Petty.
You're talking about the Super group?
No, there's it's basically just call it cool kids, right?
And so it's it's like, if you were to say, like, what about Sarah?
33:20
Is she a cool kid?
You're like, Nah, she's not a cool kid, right.
And you're like, what about John is like, definitely a cool kid, whatever that is.
It's like you basically do that yes or no, hot or not, but for a brand.
So there's way more things that would be not Stoke than Stoke.
Yeah, you have to be selective of.
Course otherwise than it's everything.
Because I got to hurt people's feelings.
33:36
But hey, there's we got to protect it.
It's up here.
It's an ideal, right?
And so basically, once you make enough associations of stoke with other stoke like things, then eventually stocking it of itself, everyone will have a shared context of what stoke means and what it means to them.
And then you say this T-shirt is stoke because now you've associated the wave and other epic things with this icon, this brand, this logo that's ideal.
33:58
And then you put it on a white T-shirt and it goes from being a $5 T-shirt to a $500 T-shirt because like, if you think it like Louis Vuitton T-shirt versus Old Navy T-shirt, same T-shirt, different logo.
The meaning, The perception of the meaning.
So if you think about what brand is, I'm going to get a little on this, but so if you go back to what brand originally was, brand was like what you seared onto a cattle, right?
34:20
It was a brand.
And so if you have two cows and one of them has a brand and the other one does it, why do we do that?
They did that because it would change the person who's looking at its behavior.
And so if I look at a cow that doesn't have a brand, I'm like, I might have that cow, that might be my cow.
I'm going to take that cow for myself.
But if you see a brand that's got, you know, Tom's, Tom's thing on it, you.
34:36
Might a certain thing, it lived a certain place.
Or you might return it be like, oh, this is Tom's cow.
I'm not going to mess with it because it's Tom's cow.
It has his brand on it.
And so the point of brand is to change behavior at scale.
And so if I have no brand on AT shirt, the likely that someone buys it is low.
If I put a Nike swoosh on it, the likely that someone buys it is high.
34:53
And so that brand, over lots of time of branding, has changed the behavior of zillions of people.
And so when you are branding, you're just associating an idea that people don't know about Stoke.
Now some people know about it, but not enough people know about it.
And then we have to teach the masses what stoke really is.
35:10
And so you have to teach them.
So like, branding is really just a teaching process of associating things they don't know, things they do know.
So who's an artist that you've seen well integrate their ideal into a brand?
An artist, You're talking like an individual.
Yeah, or like a content creator.
35:27
I mean, I think what, like Rihanna did with Venti is like a a really elegant example of that, like she can't and that that's just a single person with a brand.
Most times it's the opposite is that brands are going after artists and creatives that all embody similar values that they want to associate with.
So our work is basically to be Stoke Sultans to to Yeah, I.
35:48
Feel like you need a stoke belt?
I've been hanging on to that word for like 3 minutes.
You're like I've been waiting just to just.
Repeating my head.
That's good.
So and then so we need to teach because I feel like we're kind of we've kind of been doing that like.
You need to be stoked ambassadors.
36:03
Stoked bastards, yeah.
Right.
And spread the message.
Spread the good news.
This is what it is.
Because Stoke baters Debaters of Stoke.
Oh dude, I thought you said another word.
So we need to really sort of like because we say the word but we don't really say what it is right enough.
36:23
But I think there's power in not saying what it is too.
Like.
You don't want it clear.
You don't want it to clearly define the ideal, do you?
Because contextualize the meaning.
Well, you're giving contextual.
Right, you point in a direct you just say not yes, not yes.
But you don't ever give the Webster's.
You don't want it to be too prescriptive.
So the way that I think about Brandon from a visual perspective is like, imagine a bouquet of flowers, right?
36:42
So you have all these different flowers inside of it.
If we were to break the vase and scatter all the flowers, it's all the same components.
But now it's not a bouquet anymore.
So did the bouquet ever exist to begin with?
Oh, this is kind of like the the pirate ship wood plank thing.
Not sure, but I think I do the.
36:59
Philosophical ideal.
If you replace all the same wood, is it the same boat?
Is it the same boat?
Yes and no.
And so and so.
So if you have all the flowers there, right.
So when you put all of them together, the bouquet has an identity, right?
Because it's association between all the.
Flowers is.
37:15
Basically amalgamizes into one concept.
Now if you take out one flower and put it in a different flower, it does shift it a little bit.
Now if I break one of the flowers or make it rotten, it really shifts it.
Which is why if you get a DUI or you rape a girl as a really good guy, all of a sudden it completely shifts the bouquet despite all the other flowers that you've done and associated with.
37:32
Those flowers are bad now.
Right.
Exactly.
You can't hand your girlfriend just one flower that's rotten.
They should be like, why did you give me a rotten bouquet?
Even though the rest of the flowers are totally fine.
And so brand works a lot the same way, which is like you're assembling a bouquet of like, show you like a wave is one of the flowers, but it's not all waves.
37:48
That's just an example of something that is stoke, right?
And then you put another one in, another one, and then eventually people get a a conglomerized idea of what Stoke really is.
And it has to be a very careful, like, thought out arrangement 100% like each one has to fit perfect with one another.
38:05
Or because people can suss that out if they see any kind of like they're like, oh, those petals are.
Brand, yeah.
It doesn't look like it goes with the rest of it.
Oh, sorry.
No, yeah, you're good.
I was like, if we made videos where we're like, at the beach.
Yeah, Corona.
We're like, this is Stoke.
Yeah.
And then you go to like a crime scene.
38:21
You're like, that's not Stoke.
Yeah.
They.
Do things that would totally work.
Yeah, just keep doing.
That that would totally work.
You need to, you need to know what it is and you need to know what it's not 'cause people would throw things and be like this is Stoke too.
It's not Stoke.
Yeah, like we did a sports We were drafting the best sports movies last night and people were thrown in like Air Bud and like, Snatch and I was.
38:38
Like and Jerry McGuire.
Yeah, but that was.
I think that was better than what these people were thrown in.
It's awesome.
Yeah.
You're a romancer.
That's part of your stoke is the romance of sports.
But literally romance.
Yeah, I'll.
Say it.
So.
And Tom Cruise is Timeless, which is also still dude.
38:55
So, so what's your primary business now?
Stoke.
Oh fuck.
Well, I'm getting from my lawyers, dude.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
So acquisition.com is the, is the.
Primary and and what do y'all do?
We'd buy companies.
39:11
So do you help other people buy companies, or you buy companies?
And so how do you?
What makes a company like viable appealing?
Yeah, a lot of things.
But the big, the biggest, the 1st and biggest one is, is it a company that we feel like we can add a lot of value to.
And so a lot of it just comes from like what's our expertise, what's our experience in.
39:29
And so for us our our biggest success is in what we continually double down on is just brick and mortar chains.
So small businesses, you know like a like a photography studio chain or a teeth whitening chain or a a nail salon chain like those are you know gym chain.
These are all like brick and mortar service businesses that are simple operating units.
39:46
And tactile experiences you got to be in there to do.
I like services personally.
Like I don't do retail.
I like services because it gives lots of people jobs.
We're pretty good at training and teaching and so that's what is a lot.
That's what allows you to scale service based business.
We're we're really big on culture.
40:02
And being able to scale culture which is really just a set of rules of how we behave And so being able to explain that to the masses allows everyone to act in the same way on brand and that's what allows you to scale like a service based business which can be really profitable.
And so we like those types of businesses.
40:18
So number one is, can we add value to it.
The 2nd is you know how big is.
Is it big enough for us to get into.
You know if someone has this one location, it's really it's it's hard to say that they have a good model or they just a good operator and they're like well, I have a lot of Razzle Dazzle, which is totally fine.
You.
Don't know if you can reproduce that else.
Exactly.
It's not, It's not a system.
40:34
It's really just a really charismatic founder, which is fine, but it is not what we would probably invest in.
We want to see, We want to see at least three arguably, you know, ideally 5 or more locations with good, with good unit economics, meaning each individual box makes money and it makes sense in terms of how it makes money.
And then and then for us, like how big is the overall market that we're going after?
40:53
Like if someone has a tiny little weird grocery store thing that I might not be super interested in that.
Again, that's not service, but I'll just give you the last one, which is just the founder itself.
And I would say that most of the time we DQ founders more than businesses.
41:09
It's like, man, I love that business, didn't like the founder, no stoke.
Interesting.
What DQ is the person?
They just don't have the charisma or their ethics.
Or it could be a multi.
Thing honestly.
Biggest one is ego.
That's the most, that's the majority of time.
Interesting, yeah.








0:00
What's interesting is that a lot of people root for you until you do better than them and they stop rooting for you.
And it was just because they didn't actually want to see me win.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:15
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
A lot of people have heard the term.
Your network is your net worth, and to a degree that's true.
0:32
To the other degree, that's the average of the five people you spend the most time with.
Well, it's not true for Bill Gates and for Jeff Bezos because the people that they spend time with are less than their net worth, which would mean that their net worth would be less than that.
And so, you know, there are statements that are thrown around frequently that don't have necessarily a lot of evidence, but, you know, are, I would say, spiritually correct.
0:51
In the last year, I would say that I fell out of touch with the last two friends that I had from high school and or college.
And this has been a process that's happened, you know, gradually over time.
And I was having a conversation with Dean Graciosi, who has become a very, very close friend of mine, He and his wife Lisa and and and Leila and I have become, you know, close couple friends.
1:13
And I brought the topic up with him and I thought the discussion would be worth sharing.
And so one of the things that he told me early on in our relationship, which really, really gave me a lot of pause, was the cost of his dreams.
And so I asked him earlier on, and it was about 18 months ago before Leila and I decided to build kind of our personal brands, etcetera, about, you know, the cost of fame.
1:34
Right.
And he said, yeah, you know, I've got people who show up at my house and people who leave weird, mean comments.
And he's like, all the time, you know?
And The thing is, is that that is a price I'm willing to pay to make the impact that I want to make with my life.
When he said that, it just, it really struck me because to me it was in a lot of ways, you know, selfish to kind of not spread the message out of fear of what it would cost me.
1:57
That being said, there's obviously pros that, you know, you know, we've made whatever decision that they outweigh the cons.
But it was just an interesting perspective in terms of just it is a price that he was willing to pay.
And so I want to lead this discussion towards the friend conversation that I had with him.
And he had said that he recently had lost one of his last friends, the last friend that he had had from kind of his childhood.
2:18
And I think that there's a lot of people who are like, you know, never forget where you come from and the people who supported you, etcetera.
And I think that's true.
But I think for the mass majority of us, a lot of people don't support us on our way up.
At least it felt that way for me.
And what's interesting is that a lot of people root for you until you do better than them and they stop rooting for you.
2:37
And I'm not saying that the people that I'm talking about were like that, but it's just that was like the first wave of friends that I lost.
Right.
And it was just because they didn't actually want to see me win.
And I had a quote that went pretty viral on Twitter, which was real.
Friends talk shit to your face and praise you behind your back, and freak friends do the opposite.
2:55
And when I say talk shit, I mean like bullshitting.
You know what I mean?
Like give each other, you know, give each other Flack, right.
If I'm giving someone Flack, they know that we're homies.
Like, you know, Doctor Kashi, I was thinking about patenting the Hermosi advertising cycles.
I spent so long developing the cycle, which is going to be in one of the books that comes up, you know, in in the future.
3:12
And his comment was get over yourself.
And that's exactly what I want from a friend, right?
I want somebody who's going to say that rather than be like, oh, that's cool.
And then be like, I can't believe this guy, right.
And so we have these people that we collect, you know, throughout our lives.
And sometimes they come in, you know, you probably heard the saying they're here for a season, a reason or a lifetime.
3:31
And I think, you know, for me, a lot of people have been seasonal.
And so I wanted to share that because I know that I'm sure some of you have had a similar path to me and that I didn't have a tremendous amount of support from my parents.
I think they now retroactively think they supported me because it's much easier that way.
3:49
But I did not.
I did not have any support from my parents for the decisions that I took until it was already beyond obvious that I was going to be successful.
And that took years and that was very hard for me at the time.
And I think friends fell in that same category.
And so when I was having this discussion with Dean, we dove into this a little bit more.
4:08
But as we you know ascend towards our goals.
And I don't say ascend in a literal sense in terms of like socioeconomic status or whatever.
But just like we move closer towards we want to where we want to go and our vision and our mission in our lives become clear.
It also becomes clear when you have contrast with people from your past.
4:26
And I have a several rules of thumb that are begin to develop around these relationships.
One of them is, if I could only talk about the past with someone, they usually aren't good friends of mine, because I don't really live in the past.
I live in the future.
4:41
I live in where I want to go, what I want to do, the things that I find interesting or the present of the things that I find interesting today or right now, top of mind.
And if I can't talk about those things with somebody, then our friendship, kind of by its very nature, will decline over time.
Because there's no growth, right, Because it's only in the past.
4:58
And I have felt a tremendous amount of guilt around the loss of those relationships.
But I also felt a guilt of carrying them on.
As in, I felt like I needed to water these plants out of necessity rather than out of, you know, some sort of exchange.
Now, some people might decry that or speak against the idea of having an exchange, but I don't think that's realistic.
5:18
I think that people stay in relationships because there is an exchange of value that occurs now.
I think the difference is the strength or depth of the relationship is how long you are willing to wait for the exchange to occur.
So a parent, for example, is willing to wait a very long time for a positive exchange from a child coming back to them right now.
5:37
And some people can make the argument that, you know, children are a gift throughout the entire period of time.
And that's awesome and that's a perspective, whatever.
But just to use the time frame as a, as a nice thinking process, if you just met someone, if you don't feel like there's, you know, a huge benefit to to to knowing them, you know, within the immediate future, you probably don't really pursue them out, right?
5:55
And the longer you have had positive exchanges, the longer you are willing to wait for the next one, right?
It's it's intermittent reinforcement from a behavior standpoint, right?
Like we are literally reinforced in this relationship And the way the addiction works is the same thing, right?
Like you immediately get positive hits and then you can start extending how long before you get another positive hit, which is also how abusive relationships work, right?
6:17
Like abuse, abuse, positive, abuse, positive, positive, positive.
And then like abuse and then positive is a little bit later and then a little bit later until the point where there's almost no positive whatsoever.
I'm not saying that's how you should run relationships, but more so how we work as humans.
Hey, MOS edition, quick break.
6:34
Just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, So send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with.
Tag them in one of my or Layla's posts and I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
6:53
And so the point of me breaking this down is that I have lost a lot of the friends or almost all of the friends that I had when I started my journey.
And the upside is people will come into your life to fill the vacuum that the other people left.
7:09
But sometimes it doesn't happen immediately.
And I think getting comfortable with having space is a good thing.
And a lot of people have the impulse or urge to always have people around them.
And I think it's to their own detriment.
Because I think if you can spend time alone with your thoughts and be OK with just being you without other people, then you are more selective.
7:28
And it's the same way with dating.
Some people can't be alone.
Some people can't be without a significant other.
And so they just end up shaking up with the first person they see after they become single again, right.
And it's because they have a fear of being alone more than they have an aligned mission with someone that they think that this person is really the best pick, right?
7:45
And so a lot of ways are similar to dating with friends in that we can hold out and really just pick the best people.
And I think that you know, if we, at least for me, if I have two or three good friends, I'm more than satisfied.
My cup is very full.
But I think where I feel drained is where I feel like I have lots and lots and lots of acquaintances that are transactional in nature but purely transactional or at least they have a much shorter time horizon for the transactions to occur.
8:11
And so if you have lost friends during the process of the climb, I don't think it is something that you should lament or be upset about.
I think that it is a sign of growth because a lot of people say, hey, you've changed and the only natural response that I can have for that is you have it.
8:30
And I think that that's kind of sums up that the entirety of this which is if you grow, you change.
Some people, most people don't like change, especially if they themselves have not grown or changed and or if they have grown in a different direction from you.
8:46
And it is natural for us to not want to continue relationships with people that have grown or have values that are too far in contrast to our own.
And those values can change over time.
And that's OK.
And so I think that for me, it took me a really long time to navigate through this and it was kind of an emotionally explorative experience to just say that's OK and is this price something that I'm willing to pay?
9:13
And for me, it's a resounding yes.
I would be far more sad that I had not realized my potential or what I hope to accomplish in my life in exchange for relationships that I sacrificed my dreams in order to maintain.
9:29
Now that being said, it almost appears as though I'm sacrificing all relationships in order to have the dream.
And that's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying that you will sacrifice old relationships and you will create room for new ones.
And so I think that there is this, I don't know, old wives tale or a societal expectation that if someone sheds friends for lack of better term, or loses friends or friends, you know, dissipate into the distance over time that they are a non constant person.
9:55
And I think that the answer to that question is yes, we grow.
And unless the friends you have are growing with you and are pushing you to grow, then they are probably not friends who will stay with you for the long haul.
And so for me, I'll I'll leave with this kind of last thing that I think about for the people that I want to be friends with.
10:11
I want friends who root for me behind my back, and that is rare.
Most people do not root for you behind your back.
It is sad that there are more strangers on the Internet who root for me, right, than people who knew me from back home.
And it's because we had a shared context at home and the discrepancy between where you are and where they are.
10:32
Over time, they personalized the fact that they are not with you because they had the same resources at the same beginning.
And so you're in a different place as a result of your own decisions.
And so as a result, they feel bad and they don't like that.
And you're a reminder of that.
And So what I seek from the friends that I have are one that they genuinely are rooting for me, and that is evidenced by them rooting for me behind my back.
10:54
I also hope that they talk shit to my face, because that is what makes life worth living for me.
But I hope to admire them.
I want to strive to be more like my friends in certain ways, and I hope that they raise the bar for me to be better and be better in the ways that I want to be better.
11:13
And so in that way, picking friends who are people who are further ahead of you in doesn't have to be financially It can be, it can be in marriage, it can be physically, it can be whatever.
And then the hope is that you are better in some ways than they are, and then they can grow from you in that way.
11:29
And in that way you both get better.
And then you have a an extended exchange that continues directionally towards both of your goals.
And so my definitions and my view on friendship has changed over time.
It probably will continue to develop and refined, but I mean this because I have a lot of people who message me and they're like, hey, I feel really alone right now.
11:49
I don't feel like a lot of people are supporting me.
And I make this for say that's OK And I think that there are seasons.
And at the end of a season, when you have a vacuum, someone does step in to fill it.
And I can promise you that if you have a higher standard and you wait and you don't just give of yourself for no reason just because you are afraid to be alone or be without friends, you will end up with better friends who actually root for you and are not.
12:11
Just place fillers or false friends who, you know, smile to your face but stab you behind your back or actually talk down on you.
And so I think if you can have that bar and you can have that tolerance, you can give yourself that space and that permission to say I've lost a friend and that's OK and I still love them as a human, even if I can't give the time that I once did because it doesn't make sense for me anymore because we've grown apart and that's OK.
12:33
And so I've given myself that permission to say these are the prices that I'm willing to pay to grow into the person that I want to be, and that's OK.
And so, Mosey Nation, I love you all.
The road can be can be arduous.
But I I think the road itself is the reason we do it, because of the person that we hope to become in the process of becoming, which is the successes I've defined.
12:52
It is the process of becoming and the process of striving is the success.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Hey what's going on everybody?
Happy cheers day I'm getting on a little early today.
Day.
And it's mostly because I was eating breakfast and I thought of this topic that I wanted to make for you and maybe a shower and then make it, but it's all fresh on my mind.
0:43
So I ran in my closet to get this article clothing, which I'll talk about in a second and basically, explain what I believe to be one of the most solid and fundamentally sound price objections that I'm aware of.
So I don't know if the lighting is cool, but if you can see this, I'm Bring an ostrich skin jacket and I'm wearing this because this is actually my favorite article of clothing.
1:07
It's also the most expensive thing that I own including all of like, well, all of I have like two suits but it's the most expensive thing that I own bar none, and it's also like my most prized possession.
And I just think it's like really cool and I like it and I thought about it for a really long time.
1:23
So I went to the store.
I tried it on and that's too expensive.
I'm not gonna buy this, you know what I mean?
And I went back and then and the next day I came back.
Again because I was actually a biggest one, I bought it when I tried it on again and I was like, I don't know, maybe get like it's still so much and then finally Layla's, like I hear you talk about this thing again, like I'm gonna go buy it.
1:39
And I was like, all right fine, so I went and got it and I don't know if you were like me but the things that we spend the most money on our lot of times, the things that we care the most about and of the things that we get like excited about even thinking about, because you have this huge dopamine, this huge serotonin release.
1:55
That's that's associated with purchasing, like people become buying addicts because people like The buying things.
And the more expensive, it is, the more they enjoy buying and that's brain, chemistry, right?
Like you can't fight that.
And so my my the topic today is around why you should spell sell expensive stuff.
2:13
And this is hopefully something that you might want to tag some your trainers in or some of your sales managers in about some things that they might believe about all.
This is too expensive.
It's like think about the last thing.
So here's my question for you is think about the last thing that you bought those extremely expensive or think of the thing that was the most expensive thing that you've bought in the last five years, right?
2:31
And then think about your association with that thing maybe it's an article of clothing.
Maybe it's rims.
You saved up for your car.
Maybe it's a stereo system.
Like we all have our own flavor of thing but there's a thing that you did a lot of research on and they're like, I'm not really sure.
I'm not really sure they are.
I'm gonna do it.
2:46
I'm gonna do it and you do it and you like and then you get in your inbox it and you look at it and you're like, oh my God, this thing.
So for me, this and then my home gym or like the two things and I'll be you guys are walk through later this week at home.
It took out finished but those are the things that I have such positive.
Associations with and also a lot of time and emotion and money that's invested in it.
3:05
And so you have to think about if a prospect what I walk in the door, right?
And and you have this High ticket thing.
A lot of people like to spend that money.
Like this is something that's a party for them.
Now here's the phrasing that I would use in light of this ostrich, skin jacket example that I gave you.
3:21
And so if mrs.
Johnson were to walk in the door and you know, you present the price and she's like, I don't know, you know, twenty five hundred dollars, that's a lot of money in your life.
Absolutely.
It totally is, let me ask you a question.
What's the most expensive thing that you of clothing wise or accessories?
Purse works?
That's fine.
3:37
What's the most expensive thing that Joe And they'll tell you and then you can say like besides your wedding dress if you want, right?
Because wedding dress is all this emotion behind.
But like so she might say I have a purse that I spent you know, 12:00, right?
And that's the most expensive thing.
Our I have a pair of red, bottom heels.
3:53
Just guys have why those are like expensive heels.
They're like a great right?
And so you're like okay so you have those heels there are thousand dollars right there like yeah okay how many times you warm?
And she might say well I wear them, I don't know.
Special occasions.
Probably like two or three times a year like ok cool.
4:10
How long you own just like three years right here?
Like okay so you've worn them 10 times so you pay $100 every time you put those shoes on because that's that's actually how many times you've worn it so like your price per we're on.
That is $100 right?
Right.
4:25
Okay.
So if you spend twenty five hundred dollars on this right on this program, how many times you going to walk outside in your body?
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
4:42
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com, forward slash leads it, so free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight.
5:04
Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
So this year let's just say this year right now, let just just give me one year.
Like I gave you three years for the shoes but in this one year 365.
5:23
Right?
You're talking about eight dollars, right?
$100 aware verses 8 and this one.
Here's the beautiful thing is that this thing that you're going to wear your body will make all of the rest of your wardrobe, look better.
Now, how worth it is that?
5:41
And you get to live longer and you're a better example, be your kids and your husband looks at you different like all those other things but like let's just be real.
You have your red bottoms and you pay $100 every time you wear them but these are less than a meal.
And you get to look like are not bombshell every day.
Is that worth it.
5:57
Of course, it is right.
And so I wanted to just juxtapose this two things.
The first one is just that, like, people like to buy expensive stuff and the more expensive is the more excited they get about it and you don't, you should not Rob someone of that experience because you have your own insecurities by And self-worth, right?
6:12
Like you should not Rob your prospect of the of the ability to spend money on something that they should and want to Value, which is why they walked in the door.
And so just because you're insecure about your pricing and about your value, does not mean you should to take that from them, right?
So give them that opportunity and then here's the best part.
6:30
Back it up with amazing service because you now have the money to do amazing fulfillment.
Because and so it's this virtuous cycle and I'm not going to get into that.
But that's the first piece in the second piece is just ask someone candidly.
What was the last thing you spend a bunch?
Your money on.
How many times do you use that once a day?
Cool.
Even if it's once a day, right?
6:46
Think about this, like, you can bring it down, like I told you the heels thing, right?
If you want to break it down, even more, she wore those thing and you can bring it in two hours, right?
So, okay, so you've worn that three times.
How long were those events?
Two hours.
Three hours.
Okay, cool.
So you were about nine hours, a year already been at it for three years.
7:03
So we got 27 hours of wearing in these shoes.
Cool.
In one day, In one day, we will match how long you wear this body.
You'll wear.
When you go to work, you'll wear when you drop your kids off, you wear it.
When you go to the gym, you'll wear it.
When you come home at night.
Your wear it when you're eating dinner with your husband, you wear.
7:19
When you go out right, you wear it all the time so you can break it down, even more so it's not eat dollars a day, right?
Because she paid a thousand dollars for 27 hours, right?
So I don't know what that is per hour.
I don't know, someone do the math for bucks an hour.
No 40 bucks an hour.
There it is fish, right?
7:35
So you're paying $40 an hour to be in those heels, right?
Whereas with this shit I can do 40, divided by 365 and that's what the the number is going to be in terms of what he's paying per hour by having the body that you want, right?
And you don't have to cover it up with clothing.
7:52
That's expensive.
Because you can wear Gap t-shirt, and you're going to look like a bombshell.
Wouldn't that?
Be nice.
Awesome.
So, anyways, that's a price objection that you can use.
If you see someone who's like, who has trouble with priorities, compare it to something that they understand like heels or purse or Or jacket or address, you know what I mean?
8:10
Dresses are the easiest to the only where there's like three times a year because they don't want to have the same picture that they see on Facebook twice with the same dress on, right?
You can even make that joke in the sale.
But anyways, guys, I hope you guys have an amazing Tuesday, Tech a sales manager in that.
8:26
I think it's a great comparison that you should use.
Where's the white shirt?
I don't know somewhere but I think it's a it's a it's a great comparison that you can use to overcome price and make it make it real for someone anyways.
Have An amazing week have amazing Tuesday.
And if you are a large person, you should take that my birthday offer.
8:44
So grab your time, sot sound of her Legacy, become a gym.
Lord, make lots of money.
Save lots of lives of lots of people.
All right boy.









0:00
If you're spending all this time working on the person and the character that you're trying to build, and then you just dilute it with crap around you, it's very tough to get back to that.
Which is why you feel like you have to take one or two weeks to shed the bad behaviors and the bad habits that you picked right back up when you went back home.
0:18
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
The hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share.
And enjoy.
I don't go home for the holidays.
0:39
And that surprises a lot of people.
And I don't do it because I don't like what going back home does for me.
And that's not just family, That's friends, environments, places I go to, people I speak with.
Anything for me.
I left home because I wanted to be a different person.
0:57
I wanted to change my environment and I want to start clean and move in the direction of the person that I wanted to be.
I think the main reason that I want to make this is because there's probably a younger version of me out there that is terrified of the idea of not listening to their parents and going home for the holidays.
1:13
Listen, if you love your family and it's like the highlight of the year, then fucking go.
If I'm talking to Young Mosey, the biggest fear that I had was what people would think about me if I didn't go out with them when I was back home.
Because it's like, well, I'm back home for a week.
They're like, yo, you're back home, let's whatever.
1:30
And I would feel obligated because I'm back home and I'm only back home a couple times a year.
But the reason that I haven't been in touch with that person when I'm not back home, it's because they try and meet me in my past and treat me in a way that I used to accept them treating me as I've grown in.
1:48
Their word changed.
I no longer accept the type of behavior.
And it's not just the things they say, it's how they say it.
And a lot of times, like, it's not super direct.
A lot of times it's indirect, especially if it's people who like you.
This is why it's so tough when you have a cousin or an uncle who says, oh, you know how you are.
And they say like that because they want you to be like, Oh yeah, I know how I am.
2:05
But The thing is, is that when you do that, you basically agree.
You accept their label of who you are, which is often the person that used to be that you literally left there to try and change.
This was super tough for me because, you know, I have lots of traditions and hey, come on, like Aunt whatever is going to make pumpkin pie again.
2:22
Oh, you know, so so is bringing her meatloaf or whatever it is.
And so you can't miss it.
But The thing is, is you absolutely fucking can.
You can absolutely miss it.
I made a video about this four or five years ago, and it was one of my top videos that I made and I thought it was worth a refresh.
And one of the things I said was I have become increasingly intolerant of people treating me in a way that I don't accept.
2:42
And I said, you know, maybe in the future, five years from now, I'll look back on this and think, hey, maybe I was a little too harsh, maybe I was a little too extreme.
And the reality is the exact opposite.
I'm even less tolerant now than I was then.
So if you're sitting on the couch, right, and someone says, hey, get over here.
If they said something like that to me in that tone, I would say don't talk to me that way.
3:03
I'm not your dog.
Like, what do you need?
They're like, just get over here and I'd be like, no, you're just repeating the same thing.
And that gets this really awkward point.
In those awkward moments is when you reframe and you reteach someone to treat you.
If you think it's uncomfortable for you, it's even more uncomfortable for them.
One because they're not used to it and no one does this.
3:20
It's also why most people are mediocre and never get out of the doom loops they have from back home, and they fall right back into the old behaviors that they were trying to get away from.
When you're teaching that person of how you how you want to be treated, you're saying you can do whatever you want.
I have no control over how you choose to speak to me, but I do have control over what I will choose to do in response.
3:37
And so if you would like me to get up and help you with with this thing, simply ask me, Hey, Alex, are you busy right now?
And I might say yes or no.
If I'm not, you might say, would you mind helping me with these things?
And I might say, of course happy to help.
But if you say get over here, I'm never going to respond to that.
And you repeating it louder in no way makes it makes it more likely that I'll respond.
3:56
A lot of times it's these little things like this, It's these micro exchanges because it's rare that someone's like you are not happy, Alex, they don't really do that, not often.
Sometimes they do.
Like, I mean, I'll give you a couple of examples.
It's like you've such a short temper, right.
I'll get that one when I go back home.
Anybody who knows me now probably would not describe me that way.
4:12
And here's a key point, What most people want to say, even if they have the balls to, to step up and this is an kudos for even stepping up.
If you say, hey, you know, please don't say that I'm really working on it, that's a great half step in the direction.
But believe it or not, it actually makes no progress.
Here's why.
If you say I'm working on it, you're still accepting their frame that you are that way.
4:31
If you want to be a different person, then you need to behave a different way.
Which means that if you want to step into that identity of the person who doesn't struggle with drinking or doesn't struggle with their temper, then imagine what that person would say in response.
So if you don't struggle with drinking and you have no temper and someone says, hey, Alex, you know how you have a temper.
4:48
I would say no, I don't.
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.
I mean, you've always had a temper like I might have in the past.
I don't now.
Please don't speak to me that way.
It doesn't help me.
Unless you prefer that I'd be angry.
Whoa, you're getting angry.
No, I'm stating facts.
I'm asking you a question.
Would you prefer that I'd be angry?
No.
Well, then don't tell me that I am.
5:04
Are you here to help me, or are you here to get me to behave the way you want me to?
It's very tough for people to see people change because often times when we change in our world grow, we remind them of the changes they've been incapable of making.
We remind them of their own deficiencies, of their own failures, of the comfort zones that they had been unwilling to step out of, that we were willing to take the risk for to figure out whether your family and the people that you're going home to are conducive to your goals.
5:29
What behaviors do I need to do to achieve the goals I want?
And do these people support those behaviors or do they detract from those behaviors?
That's it.
If when you get in that environment, you are less likely to do the behaviors that you say you're committing to so that you can be the person you want to be and achieve the things you want to achieve, then that would be a detractor.
5:45
If they are helping you and they are supporting you and they're they're clearing the way and giving you attention back and that's an amazing family and they are supporting you and your goals.
And this is the double edged sword.
This is the paradox.
Is that the loving, caring family that would say, hey, I respect that you're trying to make this change, go do what's right for you so that you can become that person.
6:01
That's probably the family you'd want to go home to.
And that's the paradox of this.
If the family and the people around you, the people that you went back home in high school and to have your, your, your high school parties with or whatever actually behave that way, they wouldn't be there.
They'd be somewhere else, right.
They would have moved on.
They would have grown themselves.
6:17
And so that's the tough part about it.
If you are young, Mosey and you don't have a lot waiting for you back home in terms of what you're looking forward to, I just want to give you one outside person's permission.
If you need that to not go home, you can miss a holiday and if you need language around that, you just say, I'm not saying this is forever, I'm just saying this is for now.
6:39
That's it.
Easy language.
And if they throw a tantrum that is on them, they may miss you.
And The thing is, is that there are elements that you may miss too.
The question is just whether it's worth the trade off.
Here's an easy way to think about this.
When you go home, there are positives.
There are some things that are positive.
6:56
There are also things that are negative.
They exist separately.
It's the reason that people get into abusive relationships.
They have lots of positive and they also have lots of negative.
And so when they break up with the quote abusive person or the person that they have some chemically, you know, crazy dynamic with, they feel like they miss the person because reward does not decrease over time, but your reminder of punishment does.
7:19
So let me give you a tactical example on this.
Have you ever finished a night of drinking and the next one you say I'm never going to drink again?
Probably.
But then what do you do the next weekend?
You drink.
Why?
Because punishment decreases in its effectiveness over time.
You quickly forget, and then you do it again.
7:34
Reward is actually different than that.
Which is why when you think about a relationship 10 years in the past, you think about all the sweet memories because all of the punishment associated with the relationship disappears.
But then you get back in the relationship and you're like, holy cow, I forgot all this crap.
And So what happens is we spend a long time away from our families and we remember all the good.
7:50
We forget all the bad.
Then we get back home.
We're reminded of all the negative things and why we left to begin with.
I try to actively cue myself and remind myself of the many reasons that I chose to leave center.
Point of that is because I didn't think it would help me become the person I wanted to become.
Especially this is for young Mosey.
8:07
If you are, if you're in a season right now of trying to become a new man or a new woman, and you're trying to flex your muscles of being on time, of being consistent, of of maybe not drinking too much, of of staying in the rhythm that you're in, right, you've got, you've got this little work grind that's going, you've had, you've had a good streak.
8:25
You're like being productive.
You're making progress.
Don't break it.
It's not worth the trade off.
How does you drinking Aunt So and So's eggnog and having a couple of pictures and having some weird comments from your uncle that you don't talk to that much and get us some political argument, it doesn't matter anyways.
8:41
How does that make you better?
The only reason you go back is because you're afraid of what people will say.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
9:01
You can check on my YouTube channel, It's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
And if not, keep enjoying the show.
Imagine we'll play it out.
You've got the whole family there and not you.
Version A they just forget that you're not there and they keep living their lives, in which case, kudos, It's fine.
9:18
On the other hand, the entirety of the room should talk to you the whole time you're there.
Are you really sad you're missing it?
You choosing not to go has no downside in terms of if they have a negative experience or you have negative experiences being there and if they treat you negatively.
And so we have all these positive memories because it's impossible to live an entire life without positive memories, right?
9:36
You just also have negative ones.
And the question is, is the upside worth the downside?
And so for me, especially as I was coming up through this, I noticed that I would get tons of anxiety going into the holidays.
I would dread certain occasions, I would dread certain traditions that would happen.
And I hated all of it.
And one day I was like, why am I putting up with this shit?
9:55
Like, there's no rule that says I have to go back.
And then I gave myself permission to not go back.
You know what happened?
I kept living and so did they.
The people from high school, they just moved on.
They found other people to find drinking buddies with.
And if they're like, ah, Hermosi thinks he's better than us, OK, different for sure.
10:12
If you want to be exceptional, and I will say this again, then it means you will be an exception.
The majority of people will not behave the way you are.
They will say, why are you acting so weird?
Why are you behaving this way?
This isn't normal.
What's going on?
They're going to ask you these questions because they want you to get back in line.
But back in line leads down the road and you know where that road ends and you know that's not where you want to be.
10:32
That's for anybody who doesn't want to go home.
Now if you do have elements of people who you do love there and you have elements of people you don't like there, then I would say just avoid the people that you don't want to be with.
And that means that you can just simply not respond to their text when they ask you to hang out.
I know, crazy.
You can also just not put yourself in.
10:48
Like if someone said, hey, sit next to me and you're like, I don't want to crazy, you just tell them the truth.
I don't want to.
This is the absolute, absolute litmus test for navigating these controversial conversations elegantly is that you simply tell the truth.
11:06
And it's because there's so many perceived social obligations around holidays.
What's expected of you, what you're supposed to do, what you're supposed to pay for, what you're supposed to help set up.
What about the tree?
What about the presents?
What are you going to do, right?
If you still feel obligated, you can send money for presents and say, here's money for everyone.
11:22
The truth is what you would say to your real friends or to the few people that you care about, about the situation.
So I don't want to go to my aunt's house.
It's like so and so drinks too much and so and so is always inappropriate.
And I always get in political arguments.
I just don't want to deal with it.
11:38
You say that to them.
You always get in political arguments.
You always get too drunk.
You're always inappropriate.
I just don't want to deal with it.
You just say that rather than making up some BS answer because they're going to overcome your BS because it's BS.
And so they will have the upper hand because they are telling the truth and you are not.
11:54
You state the facts.
I don't want to come.
I'm doing really well.
Or hey, I will come on the condition that I'm not going to talk to so and so.
And I want to make sure that you as the host are OK with that.
And I will have a conversation with them up front letting them know that I'm not interested in talking to them.
12:11
You say, hey Uncle John, there's 38 people here at our holiday get together, talk to any of the other 37 but me.
That's it.
And if you need to make grandma, you're welcome to just don't include me in, please.
Also, one of the things that I think is underrated is, is leisure time.
Just because you are home and you don't have something scheduled doesn't mean everyone has free access to your time.
12:30
If you want to stay in and watch a movie because you're on holiday break and it's one of the few times that you just do that, even if it's just you and not even with your family, then if someone says, hey, let's go out and you say no, I'm good.
And they say, what?
Like what?
Are you busy tonight or what?
Do you have plans or they start with, hey, do you have plans and you say no and they say you want to go out.
12:46
You can also, right after they say that, say no, because rest is productive if it Nets you a gain in how much you can do.
If you rest well during the holidays and you're more productive after the holidays, that's a good thing.
If you feel like you have to recover from your holidays, then you don't even get the main benefit of holidays.
13:02
If we think about how we curate our environment, the wealthier the people that I meet, the more contained and pristine their environments are.
They don't allow people who are detracting from the people they want to be in the behaviors they want to do to in.
And so think about Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos or Steve Jobs.
13:18
Think about the teams of people that they have around them.
Do you think you can be an idiot and be an Elon Musk's presence?
Do you think you can be a drunkard and be in Bezos's presence?
Do you think you can be like an idiot and passive aggressive and make snide remarks in in in Steve Jobs presence?
No.
Why?
Because they're intolerant of that.
13:34
They have a higher standard.
And so if you remember the first girlfriend or first boyfriend you ever had versus what your standards are today, your standards rise as you grow, as you become better, so too do your expeditions.
Or rather, should your expeditions become of others that you surround yourself with.
13:52
And so if you're spending all this time working on the person and the character that you're trying to build, and then you just dilute it with crap around you, it's very tough to get back to that.
Which is why you feel like you have to take one or two weeks to shed the bad behaviors and the bad habits that you picked right back up when you went back home.
14:10
And so for me, it's like I would rather not have, you know, a week or two of of bad, bad, lack of rest where everyone feels that they're entitled to my time, entitled to my energy.
Going into another week or two afterwards where I have to recover from this vacation.
It's like I just, I ate up three or four weeks of my year.
14:27
It's 8% of my year, my whole year, because of a social expectation.
To me.
That's ridiculous.
And so I don't subscribe.
I opt out.
We create our reality.
We create the rules of engagement for other people to interact with us.
We teach and reinforce others for the way that they treat us.
14:43
If we don't like the way someone treats us, we don't like the way someone talks to us.
It's our responsibility to set it straight.
And if they do not adhere to the agreements that you have set, then you don't need to play anymore and their loss is your company.
And then you keep living your life.
I think this is Epictetus.
14:58
But he says, like, how do you get angry at a rock?
You can call a rock names, you can shout at it, you can snap your feet, but the rock just stays a rock.
And so if they get all upset, just be the rock.
Like, I understand, got it.
Not going to change my behavior.
But I understand having these hard conversations gives us the space to be the people that we want to be on the terms that we set, rather than the ones that are thrust upon us by social expectations and cultural norms that were created for people who are not trying to achieve the goals that we are.
15:25
I'm only sharing this because some of you who are listening to this are actually going to achieve big shit, and it's going to feel really lonely for a lot of that time.
And it's because you're going to feel like the odd man out, and you're going to feel like what you're doing is contrary to what everyone else is doing.
The people who are back there are going to, you know, call you names behind your back.
They're going to say you think you're better than them.
15:41
They're going to say that you forgot where you came from and you just develop a thicker skin because you realize that they say those things and yet you still continue and yet you keep living and you keep getting closer to your goals.
And then The thing is, is goal after goal starts falling down and you get more and more evidence that this path is the path you should be on.
15:58
And you'll feel more and more confident to the point where in the future you just have no issue with that.
You'll have 0 tolerance.
Someone texted, you just block them.
I don't care.
I don't need it.
I just don't need it.
And so I am significantly less tolerant than I was in my first video four or five years ago.
And I was pretty intolerant then.
Maybe five years from now I'll I'll recant all of this stuff, but maybe five years from now I'll say the same thing that I do now and maybe I'll be even less tolerant.
16:20
I'm making this for young Mosey who needs to hear that.
And if you have an amazing family, that's awesome.
Go back, enjoy the holidays, keep living you.
But this is just for the people who aren't stoked about going back for the holidays and are not sure what to do.








0:00
You guys may hear something completely insane, Yes.
OK, you're going to have to hear it anyways.
I was able to take home more in a year than the CEOs of McDonald's, IKEA, Ford, Motorola and Yahoo combined as echidnas 20s for over half a decade.
0:17
There you go, Which which resulted in $200 million in portfolio revenue as of today.
We crossed $100 million by age 33.
And to be honest, no one's more surprised than I am about this outcome.
0:35
And so me expressing this will create envy in some people.
It will create anger in others, skepticism in most, confusion in old people and inspire select few.
And so the select few you are who I'm making this for, everyone else you can show.
0:53
But you are the people that I'm making this for.
Let's go back.
There we go.
So who wants to hear about some stuff that can shortcut their path to material success so they can ponder the purpose of achieving it to begin with?
All right, so we're going to cover three things today.
This is fresh from this morning, right off the press, #1 How making money Really Works, #2 Why new Stuff is Making You poor #3 Why better is the way you're like That doesn't make sense, yet it will, said simply.
1:25
Who wants to make lots of money?
The funny thing, what you're watching right now is not my original presentation.
I actually changed at the very last minute.
The night before I went out to get dessert.
A bunch of people from the event were in town going to the place that I was by accident.
As soon as I left the frozen Uberland, which is where I was, I was like, the presentation I have for tomorrow isn't what these people need.
1:44
And so I spent that night and all morning making an entirely new presentation, which is what you are watching.
Who believes that you have to work hard to make money?
Who believes that no one can outwork them?
You're going to see where I'm going to go with this.
2:00
Well, I'm going to attempt to prove you wrong.
The reason this is so important is that all of us claim or I have heard who here has seen a guru on the Internet say no one can outwork me.
Who's heard people say that on podcast, make Instagram posts about it, Whatever.
It actually drives me fucking bananas.
2:17
It drives me bananas because it teaches the wrong lesson.
So how can we claim that we work every day and yet we can't even define the word?
So how do you define work?
The science definition is work equals four times distance.
2:33
Problem with that is it's not very useful for knowledge workers.
Most of us are not actually doing manual labor.
Not useful.
The 2nd way is that you can think about it in terms of inputs of time, right?
Like is that how hard you work?
No, one cannot work Me, I work longer hours.
2:50
Do you think you're the only person who works 1618 hours every day, like go to China?
I'm like, I don't even know if anyone in America can say it.
I'm being dead, like, dead serious.
So that's why when I see these things, just drive me fucking nuts.
3:08
So the problem with that is that many people work all the hours they're awake.
And if you suggest working more hours than you're sleeping less than, I don't think that's a good idea for knowledge workers.
So why can no one not work?
You again, Right.
So everyone's working those hours.
So then the next one is like effort.
3:27
That's how no one can outwork me.
No one's going to try harder than me.
So you want participation trophies?
Is this how you want your employees to think that they're working hard?
I mean, not me.
I wouldn't want that.
So if it's not force times distance to define what work is, and if it's not the amount of time we're putting into the work that we do and it's not the effort that we are expending or how hard we try.
3:53
And then what's work we have to get clear on it.
Because if that's what we have to do to make money, then we got to know what we're actually trying to fucking do.
So here's Alex's definition.
Work equals outputs, fancy image outputs equal volume times leverage.
4:15
In plain speak, number of times you do something times how much you get out of each time you do it.
How do we work faster?
Work rate equals that same thing divided by time.
Plain speak output per minute of time.
4:33
That is how you work faster.
Which means that the hardest working man in the world can be objectively measured.
That guy is the hardest guy working in the world.
In 2022, he added $140 billion to net worth.
For context, that's more than Bill Gates did his entire career in one year.
4:53
Think about that for a second.
And then next year he did the exact same amount again.
FYI, that's 2 billion a week.
So output divided by time.
There's the time, one year, there's the output.
5:12
He's the hard work, hardest working guy.
So who's going to be the 2027 champ?
One of me doing this is that I hope it's somebody here who who would like to be the 2027 champ.
All right, let's rock.
So if you want to be it, then please pay attention.
This will help you.
5:28
So how can we get more output, which in the game of business is enterprise value.
It's how much shit is worth outputs, right?
We have this one, and now I've got a nice flexi arm.
Volume is the number of times we move the leather.
I literally made all these images this morning, all right?
I'm very, very proud of them.
5:44
All right?
Volume is the number of times you move the lever.
The leverage is the length of the lever itself that you're using, the opposites, how much you can lift on the other side.
So let's look at a couple of examples.
You guys can just shout it when I say just say high or low, so high or low, low, low, high or low, high, high or low, very high.
6:12
The reason I put this one in here is that at a certain point it's not about how strong the person is.
It all depends on how much leverage you have.
That's the point of the slide now, high or low volume times 1000, the thing's just as long as the other one highest, yes.
6:29
So now that we understand what work is, you can either do more activity or you can do it with more leverage to get more output.
Doing more is capped by time and physical ability.
How much you get, AKA leverage is uncapped.
No cap.
6:46
I learned that.
Gen.
Z.
There we go now.
Fun fact, Warren Buffett took home 500 million in dividends last year from Coca-Cola.
As an owner, the CEO took home 50.
He spent less time working on Coca-Cola than the CEO did.
7:05
So is he working harder by the definition that we did?
Yes.
More output.
We've been playing the game wrong.
If you want to outwork your competition, what you really should be doing is out leveraging them.
So who gets more done?
7:22
We got one person who does 100 calls a day, another person who does 100 calls a day.
The guy who has more skill.
One guy makes 100 calls, another guy makes 100 calls.
The guy who's better on the phone gets more output.
OK, let's say they're equal skill.
They're working 8 hours a day making calls.
7:39
Oh, I forgot to ask the question, who gets more work done?
There's the answer.
The guy that has the automated dialer that keeps his talk time the highest.
OK, same skill, same number of hours and same automated dialer to maximize talk time.
Now who gets more work done?
7:57
The guy who has the best list.
OK, they've got the same list, the same skill, same dialer, 8 hours a day.
The guy who's calling to the right season, The right time of day.
Who wants to be calling, selling shit during December.
8:13
If you're selling physical products, who wants to sell on Black Friday?
Of course.
More leverage, same work, more output.
OK, let's say all this stuff's equal.
Now who's now?
Who's even?
All right, we got.
I mean, what else do we have?
Nice.
8:30
He actually called it.
The guy calling it the better offer.
Now we've got the same time, same time of year, same list, same offer, same dialer, equal skill, 8 hours a day.
Now who's going to do it?
It's got to be equal now, right?
The guy who recorded his pitch and set it to 10 million people.
8:51
Now, to push this even further, what if the guy made zero calls and didn't do anything?
Who makes more against the best caller on earth?
The guy who's got a team?
He's got 15 dudes on the phone.
OK, how good you are.
And if you're like, well, I think I could be 15, You can't be 1500.
9:10
OK, here you are, leverage.
And that guy made zero calls.
I have more people calling for me today while I'm on stage leverage.
The game is rigged and you've been playing by rules that do not exist.
If you want to make more money, you need to get more for your time.
9:31
You need more leverage.
And this should make sense because we all trade time for money.
And I can prove this to you.
You spend time every second of your life.
You receive money over the time that you are alive.
9:47
So money divided by time equals rate of output.
We are all paid dollars per hour.
The reason I'm specifically saying this to this audience is that y'all get fooled all the fucking time by passive income.
It's not passive.
10:04
It's less active, but it is not binary.
It is not active or passive.
It's how active is it.
So if you make one trade in the stock market all the time it took you to analyze the deal and every other deal you decided not to do, and then execute the trade and then raise the money and do all the other stuff, That is all the time that it took you to do that.
10:26
Now after that point, you have increasing returns per unit of time.
Is this making sense?
The point I'm making here is that time is the thing.
We all have the same $24.00 in our wallet.
It's about how we allocate them and what we get back for them, how well we trade.
10:47
Just said that, there you go, degrees, all that.
So leverage is the difference between what you put in and what you get out.
There are fancy definitions for it.
This is the best one that I have.
And so I said I would cover three things.
The first one is how making money really works.
11:04
The answer to that question is leverage.
You make more money by trading your time for more shit, more output.
The 2nd is why new stuff is making you poor, and this is especially relevant for everyone here.
Part of this again was inspired by the conversations I was having last night at Yogurtland, so thank you for everybody who shout out for that.
11:24
This is also how not to get leverage.
And I felt compelled to make this because I hope that some of you identify with this because I would bet that the majority of you are doing this.
How not to get leverage.
There are five pieces to this that I want to break down today #1 Uninformed Optimism. #2 is a story I'll tell you about a construction buddy of mine. #3 is something I call the magic wand story. #4 is Hatfield Bridges. #5 is the woman with red dress.
11:50
You're like I have no fucking clue.
And that means you will.
So let's start with uninformed optimism.
Who here has seen this?
This is stages of change, stages of transition.
Anyone seen this, this chart before?
OK, cool.
Not a lot of you.
Perfect.
So there are five steps.
And I remember the first time I saw this, it like it changed my life.
12:09
Whenever you're analyzing something new, who here has had a buddy tell you about something that they're doing, and they're making a lot of money doing it?
And then you immediately feel shitty about what you're doing and then think I should get out of my opportunity vehicle, go over here and do what they're doing.
Who's felt that?
Thank you.
12:24
Everyone has.
The reason is because we're at step one, which is uninformed optimism.
You don't know enough about what they're saying.
They're just giving you the highlights.
They're giving you the Instagram reel.
They're not giving you the reel.
Yeah, once you decide to get out of your little vehicle and then going over there, then you tell your buddy, you're like, hey, why am I not making money?
12:47
He's like, Oh well, there's like 100 other fucking steps that I didn't talk to you about in the beginning, But like, and it's actually nearly impossible.
And I got really lucky that one time and and now all of a sudden it looks like all the people at your old job are making more money than you.
But yeah, let's keep doing it.
So you moved to stage 2, which has informed pessimism.
13:05
You are now aware of the shit that is involved to make the money that you want in this new thing.
Now you think, OK, this is probably the worst part, but then time elapses and it's still shitty and you still haven't made money yet.
13:22
It blows more now because you have invested more time and still have 0.
So your actual output to time is lowering, which is why it's so painful.
Which is where people get into the crisis of meaning.
Why the fuck am I doing this?
What does money even matter anyways?
13:37
You know what?
I'd be happier if I just spent more time with my kids.
You change your goal because you encounter difficulty.
And So what happens most times is that people then crash and burn.
I'm going to skip one forward, and then I'm going to come back because I want the visual to work the way I want.
13:55
Ah, fuck it.
OK, so if you're at the crisis of meaning, this is where most people offshoot.
What happens here, where that that fourth dot there on the bottom.
If I were to cross it out and write uninformed optimism again, that's what most of you do.
You find about something cool.
14:13
Informed pessimism.
It kind of sucks.
Oh shit.
It's way harder than I thought.
Uninformed optimism.
I'll try something else.
And then you do it again.
And again.
And again, and the difference between video games in real life, where you face the boss and you can't pass the level until you beat the boss, is that when you die in the video game, you restart a few seconds later.
14:36
In the game of entrepreneurship, you start years later.
This is why people don't progress.
They keep fighting the same boss that can't learn the same fucking lesson.
They keep losing.
And I'm saying this because some of you I heard at Yoga Land, and I know that that's representative of other people here.
14:52
You keep fighting the same boss, and the boss is being able to stick with it is getting through in different charts on this.
The crisis of meaning is also called the Valley of Despair is getting through.
From there you get into informed optimism.
15:10
You figure out that little thing you're like, I had to do this one thing and then this started working.
And then you know what I found out?
I could clean the list through this tool I found on the Internet because I joined this forum and they started doing that.
And then all of a sudden, my pickup rates tripled, right, Or my response rates tripled or my throughput on my website went up, whatever it is, right.
15:26
And so you have to get through that piece.
Then you get to informed optimism and the number six you achieve.
And then all your friends are like, yo, what are you doing?
You're like, oh, I got this thing.
And then all of them come, right?
That is where most people start something new over and over and over again.
15:43
And they don't learn the lesson.
And so this is what their life looks like over and over and over and over again.
Who here has more than one business in the last 24 months?
Be honest.
Thank you for being honest.
16:00
I appreciate it.
First thing, it's normal.
I had nine businesses and I was broke.
So I say this with the pain of experience.
I'm not saying this to to be on a pulpit.
I'm saying it because the faster you can get through it, the faster you will start making money.
You have to beat the boss.
16:18
Everyone thinks the grass is greener, but the other side still lined with shit.
So, like, that's why the grass is so green.
There's shit everywhere.
I have ACFO, who's been with us for a long time.
She went through all of our exits last year.
She's probably almost 60 and she has to say she's like, it's all shit.
16:33
Doesn't matter what business it is, they all got shit.
She's Southern and Suzanne's awesome, but it just always reminds me of this, is that there's always shit.
And whenever we're starting something new, we encounter something that we didn't know before and we're like, oh, this makes this shittier.
And then we think, well, are we going to jump out?
16:50
No.
Well, this is new information.
Great.
We're more informed.
Fantastic.
So that is the thing, number one, that is keeping you poor, uninformed.
Optimism #2 is a little story I want to tell you.
So I was called up probably 2-3 years ago by a guy I knew in high school.
17:07
We hadn't talked in a while and he said, hey, I've got this roofing business, you know, I want to scale it.
I want to go big.
I was like, that's awesome, man.
And so he's telling me about the roofing business, Tell me about the roofing business.
And all of a sudden he says, oh, yeah, I mean, we we also do some general contracting work.
I was like, OK, why don't you grow the roofing business?
17:26
He's like, why, you know, don't leave money on the table.
OK Oh, And then this one's going to sink in for some of you guys.
And then and he was like, I was like, so you've got the roofing.
You got the, the GC stuff.
And he's like, yeah, that's what I'm doing.
He's like, he paused for a second.
17:42
It's like, well, we also kind of flip houses, too.
So we like, fix them and flip them.
We also do the contracting work, but we fixed the roof, so we just get huge cost.
We're vertically integrated.
I was like, dude, you're making less than 3,000,000 bucks a year.
You're not fucking vertically integrated.
You're distracted.
Right.
And he was like, how do I scale?
18:01
And I was like, just pick one.
He's like, what do you mean?
I was like, pick one.
He's like, why do you think you can't build a billion dollar roofing business just doing roofing and just get better at doing roofing?
He said, well, I don't leave money on the table.
Who here said they don't leave money on the table?
The money you were leaving on the table is the focus that you are not giving to the one thing that matters.
18:26
And so by the way, this is the self-made woman list for Forbes.
This is Diane Hendricks.
She's the number one wealthiest self-made woman by the way.
And she owns, if you can see it there, ABC Supply, which is roofing, not householding, not general contracting work.
18:45
Roofing.
Why didn't he build that?
He's smarter than Diane Hendricks, that's why.
So this is the list and this is what I want you to notice about this.
This is the Forbes, the top six for women. self-made notice the age of the people on their age is the left column 757884908963 on the right.
19:09
Notice the source.
Roofing, healthcare, software, retail and gas stations.
Trucking.
Little Caesars pizza.
IT so sexy.
The point of this slide is that if you want to build something epic, you have to be able to do the same thing for an extended period of time without convincing yourself you're smarter than you are.
19:36
Which means if you wanted to not make money, this is what you should do, #1 do lots of different things, #2 do them for short periods of time.
Don't stick with it too long because you might see success, #3 do not get help, OK #4 make all the mistakes in your own.
19:55
It's the best way to do it because otherwise if you Start learning from other people's mistakes, you can move faster.
So don't want to do that.
When you make a mistake, do it again.
Just repeat it.
Especially if you're like I've been here before, do the same thing.
Who here knows the definition of learning?
I'll tell you.
Same condition, different behaviour.
20:16
So if you want to teach someone something and you present them the same condition and they have not changed their behaviour, they have not learned.
If you came to this workshop this weekend with the intention of learning something, can I get everybody to raise their hand if they had the intention of learning something while they were here?
20:33
If you go back home and your behaviour does not change, you learned nothing.
Nothing truly took the money and burned it along with losing the output that you lost in the time of here plus travel.
20:49
So if that definition has been singed into my mind because I want to learn something and I have the same condition that's been presented, I have to ask myself if I do the same thing again, It means I have not learned and I don't want to play this boss again.
So if you do want to make money, you can flip it.
21:07
You do one thing for a very long period of time.
You get help from other people.
You observe what other people have been doing.
You only make the mistake one time if you are going to make them.
And you always grow and challenge the beliefs that you had and try and answer the question, what do I believe to be true?
That it's not because ordinary businesses done for extraordinary time create extraordinary results?
21:29
Compounding is the thing like it has to compound.
If the vehicle you are in right now does not compound with time, then change the vehicle.
You get into something that if you stick with it for an extended period of time, it would be unreasonable that you will be poor.
That was my construction buddy story.
21:48
So I had a conversation with a different friend and he had a zillion businesses.
Like a zillion.
I get a spreadsheet for how many businesses yet?
And they were all bullshit businesses.
They didn't actually make any money.
But he had like a logo on a website and like some VA you know what I mean?
Like, oh, it's a business.
And he was believing the fallacy of I'm just going to wait to see the thing that takes off and then go all in on that.
22:10
Who here has thought this thought?
I get it.
I'm going to focus.
I'm just going to wait.
I'm going to be patient, see which one works out.
And then because I'm a good, you know, statistics guy, I'm going to go with the winning horse.
Right.
But the reality is that any of them can take off.
22:27
You could have a billion dollar roofing business.
You could have a billion dollar GC business.
You could have a billion dollar household business, but you can't have them all.
So you got to focus.
You got to pick one.
And the nice thing is it doesn't really matter which one you pick, but you do need to pick one.
22:44
The picking is the thing that grows it.
The ability to say no is the thing that grows.
It not the thing you pick.
It's who you are as a consequence of the decision that changes the outcome, not the vehicle.
Does that make sense?
So how arrogant is it to think that we can do multiple things at once and compete with someone who's spending all their time on that one thing?
23:06
It's ridiculous.
And yet we still do it.
And so this is, I love this little cartoon.
This guy, you know, he's got all the spinning plates, and this is, this is me with the red hair going to this guy who's hopefully my competitor and handing him more plates, be like, oh, do you see all that shiny optic over there?
23:22
Here, more plates go, I'm just going to do this one thing.
It's my favorite thing in the world, compete against somebody who's doing lots of things.
It's very easy to win.
You don't have to do much because you only have to do a 10th of what they do.
So this is what focus really looks like.
23:40
One thing all in.
You can write that down and you can circle it.
One thing all in.
So I asked my friend of mine that had the Excel sheet with all these zillions of questions, right.
I said, if I had a magic wand and I ended all your side projects except for one, just one.
23:57
The one that you think has the most opportunity, the one that's probably making the most money right now that you're not paying attention to because it's boring because it's all could be doing it a while.
It's like, yeah, he's like, do you know what business it is?
He's like, yeah, like, OK, if you ended everything else.
Because I I have a magic wand.
So I get to make the rules.
Magic wand.
24:13
They all disappear.
I said, how easy would it be to grow that thing?
He just looked at me.
He was like really fucking easy.
I was like, interesting.
And so he's like, but that would be so hard because of insert real reason that no one gives a fuck about.
24:31
No one cares.
But I have to fire that.
Uh huh.
But I would have to shut down.
But I would have to lay off the all the riches you want are on the other side of a few hard conversations, and most people spend the rest of their lives not having them and being poor and wondering why it's going to suck.
24:51
It's going to be OK.
That was my number three story.
The Magic Wand #4, my favorite story.
Who here has seen The Matrix?
Awesome.
You need to become the person who can say no to the woman in the red dress.
25:08
The woman in the red dress is the representation of everything that is shiny, object and beautiful and wonderful in the world.
Whatever your flavor of woman in the red dress is.
And The thing is, and this is something that I have now learned painstakingly, is that being able to say no to the woman in the red dress changes at levels.
25:26
You can say no to the one in the red dress who's a crackhead on the corner, right?
1000 bucks a month, you're like, I mean, I can say no to her, no worries.
Well, I got something better, right?
But then the $10,000 a month girl, you're like, huh?
OK, interesting.
And if you're making $10,000 a month, it's hard to say no to that girl.
25:46
But let's say that you're a hard working discipline motherfucker.
You get to $100,000 a month, there's $100,000 a month, girl, that's an opportunity that is much bigger than the one that you said no to before.
And you have to learn to flex the muscle at every level.
This this is a lesson that I learned the hard way.
26:04
I started a supplement company when Jim Launch was doing 26,000,000 a year and rather than say oh why don't I just take Jim Launch to 40 next year, I'll start another thing.
Jim Launch stayed the same and then I added another source of revenue that got us to 37.
But it was a mistake strategically I can tell the story.
26:22
It sounds great on paper.
We sold the company lots of money, whatever, but like, it was not the right move.
And so I had learned how to say no to $1,000,000 opportunity, a 5 million.
A 10 million.
But I hadn't learned how to say no to a $20 million opportunity when I was making 20 million.
26:39
And so, like, the woman in the red dress becomes more seductive, more attractive, the better you get.
The more status you get, the hotter the girl you attract, Right.
And I'm saying this figuratively for entrepreneurs.
Does that make sense for everybody who's not into women with red dresses?
OK, because this is what the woman in the red dress really looks like.
27:03
Just ready to smash your shit and distract you and spread you thin so that you can't keep your eye on the ball.
And then eventually she spreads you so thin that you don't know how to get out and it feels like quicksand.
Because as soon as you put out fires here, there's fires here.
27:19
There's fires here, fires here.
I need more talent.
You take the best person from over here to fix that problem.
Then this thing goes to shit.
How do you get out?
Got to cut shit, Got to eat your ego.
You got to watch your revenue go down so that you can refocus, reconsolidate, bring the troops in.
I'm saying this because someone here needs to do this, and I wish I'd fucking heard this from somebody else.
27:40
I would avoid a lot of pain.
So how do you become that person who can say no to the woman in the red dress?
You do the activities someone with those character traits would do, despite not feeling good about it.
So I'll tell you a story that'll drive us home.
So Leila and I were on this walk not that long ago.
27:57
And I said, you know, I was like, I'm so impatient.
I'm so impatient.
I need to be more patient.
Right.
And she was like, I don't think you're impatient.
I was like, yeah, I am.
I fucking hate this.
Let's.
I want this to be faster.
I want everything to be bigger, faster, stronger.
She's like, yeah, but you're not changing your behavior like you feel that way.
28:17
But you haven't done anything that's not aligned with the long term strategic vision.
I was like, yeah, I feel fucking terrible.
I want to be like, Zen about it.
She's like, yeah, but that's not how it works.
She's like patience is about the behaviors we do, not how we feel about behaviors.
So who here has heard the quote?
28:33
Courage is not the absence of fear, but it's action to spite fear, right?
Patience is not not feeling impatient and feeling terrible about waiting, about not jumping on these opportunities.
It's about not jumping on the opportunities despite feeling like shit about it.
And wanting to right?
28:49
Loyalty is not necessarily about the fact that your eye doesn't get caught every once in a while, right?
Or maybe even feel a desire that you wish you didn't feel.
It's about whether you act on it.
Because who here would rather have somebody like, I think you already know where I'm going with this, right?
In terms of loyalty, how would you rather right.
29:05
You'd rather the person not act on the behave, on the thought.
That is how you gain the trait.
And then over time, this is my belief.
If you do that enough times, those feelings go away through exposure therapy.
Like you get exposed to this condition over and over again and eventually you know that you don't die because that's what it feels like.
29:25
And so whether it's a loyalty issue, an integrity issue, a courage issue, a focus issue, which is the point of this message today, to become that person, you just start acting like the person who has those beliefs and you behave in that way.
And then it will stink in Woman in the Red Dress.
29:44
So new distractions kill leverage and keep you poor.
Focus multiplies it.
I said three things, #1 how making money really works.
It all comes down to leverage. #2 why making new stuff is making you poor, which means you have to focus.
And #3 is why better is leverage.
30:03
This is the make money part.
Here's the simple approach to growth that we use with our portfolio companies.
Better is better than new.
Better is leverage.
Because remember, leverage is how we get more from what we put in.
If you do it better, you get more for what you put in.
30:21
That is, leverage examples.
If you have call scripts, if you make content, if you have websites that you are building, if you have follow up sequences, if you have offers, if you do the current thing, you get what you currently have.
If you make it better, you will get more from the activities.
30:40
You can create leverage in your business by being better and better comes from boring.
Most of us solved an emotional need by quitting whatever we were doing to start to become an entrepreneur.
And then we had a positive reinforcement from that, from that behavior.
30:56
And so then we learned that as a way of life.
But the problem is that the thing that forced you or gave you that emotional, that decreased your action threshold, thus that you would jump into the next thing, is the very thing that will make you jump out of the opportunity that could become your billion dollar thing.
31:13
Does that make sense?
You felt uncomfortable in your job, You quit your job, you got rewarded.
And so you think, oh, when I quit things, I'll get rewarded, But that's the wrong lesson.
It only works once, and then you have to unlearn it.
And with each level of entrepreneurship, there are lessons like that that you have to unlearn.
The thing that got you there better comes from boring.
31:31
It is not exciting to run your 38th split test on a landing page.
It does make you more money.
It comes from doing all the shit that you know you should be doing but aren't.
And so right now this is an activity.
So this is an active part.
Imagine a list of all the stuff you know you should be doing but aren't doing right now within your existing business.
31:54
Like right now, like top of your head, you know there's some shit that you should be doing in your business.
I'm going to give you 15 seconds.
The reason that stuff is so important is because you already know what you need to do.
32:12
And we come here to get raw, Rod, etcetera, but the shit is on your desk at home.
That is the work that must be done.
It needs doing.
And most of us know what to do and we don't want to confront it because we want to do something more stimulating and exciting that makes us feel alive and your business doesn't give a fuck.
32:34
Better is boring and better gets you more for what you put in.
Better is leverage.
Now imagine who here has a few businesses be really fucking hard to make that list, wouldn't it?
There's too much shit.
It's too much, too much stuff to make the business.
32:51
Which means becomes impossible.
Which means that's why you have to pick one.
Because there is so much stuff that has to be done to do one business right.
Just do it right.
If you do it right, you grow by default.
There's a promise.
33:09
Who here is like, I know I should be doing more e-mail follow up.
I know I should be calling my leads within 5 minutes.
Who here thinks that right now?
OK, let me ask a different question.
And many of you did raise your hand.
Who here calls all the leads within 5 minutes?
OK, like two hands.
You will triple your sales.
33:27
Triple.
Triple.
Who wants to triple the fucking business?
Triple.
But that sounds boring.
Sure is.
Got to implement CRM, Got to get round Robin, set up leads, got to come in.
You got to figure out how call prioritization works between the team.
33:43
That's boring.
Makes you a shit load of money.
That's how it works.
Who's going to win two different businesses?
The guys who got the shit dialed better gets you more for what you put in and when you do get home, order it from the amount you have to put in to get the thing done.
34:04
That will result in the most output and start ticking them off and you continue to ignore the new things that sound really exciting.
And you become the person who's able to do that by pretending to be the person who's able to do that because you already know what to do.
34:20
So this is a mental model I really like a lot.
Who here has ever had a coach or a mentor?
Has anyone ever coach or mentored other people?
Does anyone feel like they're a better mentor than they are a person who does?
Shit, I do that all the time.
34:36
And so The thing is, is I ask myself this question.
It's actually been one of the, like most profound, most helpful questions I've had.
Which is if I were coaching me.
And the beautiful thing about this is that when you coach you, you have no other agenda.
You're just trying to help you.
And you also have more information than anyone else has.
You've had, you've been on every conversation, you've been, you've read every e-mail, you've seen every report.
34:57
So if you were coaching you right now, what would you tell you to do?
And what's crazy about this is that half the fucking time it's not what I'm doing.
Coach me much smarter than me.
Me, right, moo moo.
35:13
OK, take your own advice.
If you do that, I promise you'll make more money.
Be like, ah, but I'm a special snowflake.
You're just convincing yourself that you're smarter than you are and giving yourself reasons that reality does not apply to you.
It does.
35:29
And this is just a boss level.
You might need to keep going against the snowflake until eventually you figure out that you just got to melt it by being there and hanging in.
And so in my entrepreneurial career, there's two periods.
Very clear definitions of periods of time in my life.
The first period was when I was distracted.
35:45
This is when I did not make money.
I had six gyms.
I had a launch business where we turn.
We do gym turnarounds in person.
That's where I actually physically was, not at my gyms.
I had a dentist dental agency.
I had a chiropractor agency.
I think I had something else more lots of fingers, right?
36:06
And I was 26 ish.
And I would love to tell people, oh, I own nine companies, right?
I'm poor.
But but it felt really good.
36:22
Struck my ego, not my bank account.
So it was only one Layla, the Angel of my life.
It was like, hey, you know, this one makes us the most money and you spend the least amount of time on it.
That Geminis thing actually works, but I have to like, I would have to like sell all those gyms.
36:39
I'd have to end partnerships.
I'd have to let go of people in the agency.
And she was like, yeah, or you could just, you know, keep doing what you're doing, just clearly working point taken, you know.
And so over the next 90 days, I sold 5 gyms, shut one down, shut down both agencies and got rid of everything.
37:01
And 12 months later, from that moment, you're doing one and a half million a month from zero and so.
And 12 months after that, we were at four and a half million a month, one thing.
And so this was the second period, Just focus.
37:18
It's so much easier to stack the deck in your favor if you just do one thing, because when you focus on one thing, you make it unreasonable to fail.
If you do one thing for an extended period of time, it becomes unreasonable to suck if you do it more than anyone else has done it.
You'll be better than that.
This is what it is.
People I spend all the time, they're like, hey, how'd you get so good at sales?
37:33
I took 4000 fucking sales calls.
That's how I did it.
That's how I did it.
I'd even, I didn't even go through a sales training.
I had 4000 fucking conversations.
That's how I did it.
And so if you, if you wanted to be the best salesman in the world, then have more sales conversations than anyone else has, If you want to be the best real estate investor, then do more deals than anyone else has and the like.
37:50
The subsequent before that is send out more mailers than anyone else has, have more cold callers than anyone else has, send more cold DMS than anyone else has and you'll become the best.
And if you put that as the output, the thing that you're looking at, it becomes unreasonable that you would be not the best, right?
Like you're at least going to be top ten.
38:07
And if who here would be top ten in real estate in the US?
Would you be OK with that?
Right.
It wouldn't be bad.
And The thing is that everyone fails because they want to move fast.
Like this is the number one issue.
So they don't have a solid foundation.
They draw the dotted line and they think I'm going to try and shortcut it.
38:23
I'm not going to fix my product.
I'm not going to make it really good because I want to go fast because I want to show to my friends that I'm growing every month.
I want to show how good I am.
The thing is, it's a short game.
Like how many times?
It's like, it's the The restaurant example is so simple.
So many people start a restaurant, slap two pieces of Wonder Bread together, put a slice of Bologna in there, and then market it like fucking crazy.
38:44
And they're like, dude, I don't get why my business isn't growing.
I'm like, because everyone who has your food literally tells everyone that it fucking sucks and never come back.
So there's this invisible hand that works against people, which is, who knows about the power of word of mouth, right?
39:00
In invisible hand, who here runs ads?
Let me ask that question.
Who here runs advertisement?
OK.
If you run ads and it has become more expensive for you, disproportionate to the increase in CPMS, just cost per impression or eyeballs in that period of time that you've been in business, then it means that you have negative word of mouth.
39:17
So if you're like, why don't get that many referrals?
Oh, well, you sure do get a whole bunch of people who you get negative referrals, you get negative sales.
You have to spend twice as much to acquire a customer because every other customer that you would have acquired was told by someone else not to buy from you using invisible hand.
When you shortcut it promote, promote, promote, promote, and then flatline and then dissolve and then you come up with new shit.
39:38
And you, who here has seen the people on the Internet doing this game over and over and over again?
They don't get the product right.
They put two pieces of baloney, you know, of sandwiches together with a baloney slice in the middle and they call it a product.
And then we have ham with one slice in the middle and it's still shit because they don't want to take the 12 months to actually get the fucking product right on the long game 10 years from now.
40:01
The guy who takes the first year, takes a break even on that year just to get the product right.
Makes everything easy.
But no one can wait 12 months because they can't see the big picture.
They keep trying to string three of these little shortcuts together.
Rather than building the foundation.
Better is leverage.
40:17
Better gets you more for what you put in.
This is what small businesses look like.
This is what big businesses look like.
The amount of activity is actually not that different.
It's just aligned.
It's just all in the same direction.
That's all it is.
It's really not like I promise you bid in both.
40:33
That's all it is.
There's nothing.
There's no magic.
It's just alignment.
Same input, more output.
Well, boring, but better.
Looks like it means split testing landing pages not once, but weekly, not just one time.
When you come here, you put the process in place to do it every fucking week.
40:50
Split testing emails not once, but weekly.
Making ads in creative.
Not when you have to, but before you need them. role-playing with the sales team?
Not once, but daily. role-playing with customer success?
Hey, I want a refund.
41:06
Hey, I hated this.
Hey, it wasn't fast enough.
What did they say?
Role play.
If you have amazing customer success, they role played every day, they'll get fucking good, I promise.
How exciting is that?
Not at all.
Not at all.
But you know what it does.
It makes you more money.
41:23
Taking 10 more interviews for the same role sucks.
It sucks to talk to 10 more people for no reason.
But there is a reason because you're trying to find the one person that's going to give you 10 times the leverage on that time you got back.
Think about this.
But if you didn't take those interviews, you hire someone, wait six months, and you have to do the whole thing again, and you lost the six months.
41:41
That's what Layla was talking about.
Taking more time to make your lead magnet better, make your offer better and better.
All these things are boring, but make you more money.
And so this is my promise is that doing all the UN60 shit that you aren't doing but no you should, is the secret to the success.
41:59
My promise is if you do nothing new, but only what you already know, you should be doing that yourself.
Coach tells you to you will make more money in the next 12 months than you can imagine.
You just got to do it right.
So this is actually a text I got yesterday, or yeah, it was yesterday.
42:16
This guy had lost everything and he had set a goal down for himself.
And he said, hey, last day of 2021 set a business goal that I thought was quite honestly, unrealistic, impossible to hit.
Well, I'm going to surpass it in Q3.
42:33
And so the only thing that I told him to do was to commit to the activities.
I was like, just do the same thing every day, rain or shine.
It was prospect.
I was like prospect.
Every day he's like, and the first few months he actually had a couple good months and then he slowed down.
He's like, how do I stay, how do I stay committed?
42:48
I was like because you felt successful for fucking getting an outcome.
It's irrelevant for who you are.
Some of you guys have heard this quote, but your work works on you more than you work on it.
I was like, you need to become the person who isn't satisfied with whatever that outcome was, but only by the commitment that you made to yourself about the activity that you were going to do.
43:05
And so whether it was up or it was down, it divorces the actions from the outcome.
Not to say that the outcome is not the work it is, but in terms of who you are, who you are is is forged in the repetitive act.
Final point, who here knows the difference between a 7 out of 10 book and a nine and a half out of 10 book?
43:28
About 20 times the work?
Realistically, who here knows the difference in sales between a 7 1/2 book and a nine and a half book?
About 1000 times the sales.
And so if you do 20 times the work, you can get 1000 times the effort.
43:45
That's a 50X increase per unit of input.
It's a lot.
It's worth it, but you do have to do 20 times more work that is leverage and opportunity is missed by most because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
44:00
And so I said I was going to cover three things and I have a little thing at the end here.
It'll take me less than five.
You guys cool with that?
All right.
Sweet.
So I said I was going to cover three things.
I want to make sure I filled my promise. #1 is how making money really works.
Leverage.
Everybody feel good with that.
Does that make sense?
44:16
All right, #2 why making new shit is making you poor and why you have to focus. #3 is why better is leverage Awesome.
And so I want to wrap up my presentation with a quick demonstration of leverage in the real world, getting more out of the same thing.
44:34
OK, so we're going to do an exercise to wrap this up, and I think that it will do more than anything I can say with these slides.
This will probably be what you remember, unfortunately with all my picture pretty pictures.
So I'm going to take a single action and increase the leverage in real time in front of you.
44:50
Is that cool?
So you'll see a before and after in front of your eyes.
It's like a real world money magic trick.
OK, so I gave you a lot of examples of things you can improve in a business.
Better calls, better content, better sales scripts, better website, better follow up, better offers, right.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to highlight just one of these things, all right for you right now and show you how many riches lie unlocked within your Business Today that you already know about.
45:12
So I'm going to focus on offers because it's an easy one I can do in front of everyone.
All right.
So I'm going to show you the leverage of a better offer.
So I'm going to sell you a book for $100,000, just kidding, $1000.
So the point of leverage is a better offer.
45:29
Sorry.
The point is leverage of a better offer.
One action selling one product, a book, Leverage is how much money it fetches for the same activity.
Does that make sense, our equation?
Does it make sense?
OK, here are the directions for this activity.
The moment you feel that $1000 of value has been created, please stand up and stay standing.
45:47
OK, does this make sense?
This is simple.
Directions.
If you feel $1000, then stand and stay standing.
All right, I'm repeating it. 100,000.
Just kidding.
Typo.
So let the leveraged building begin.
I have 10 books with me today.
46:05
Who wants one for $1000?
Raise your or stand up.
Wow.
Thank you.
Stay standing.
Three people already have $3000.
Isn't this exciting?
All right, I didn't even tell you what it was yet.
It's a really good book.
Probably giving it away.
Who now wants it?
46:22
I said it was a really good book.
No more people, OK?
It's a best seller.
Still three people up four.
There we go.
Four people.
Ha ha.
It's my book right now.
46:39
I got one more, Two more, three more.
All right, four more.
So we got 891011.
I've already accounted for my books, but just wait, there's more.
So I said, who wants one of the 10 for 1000, right?
We got all these cool.
There's all the reviews.
46:56
People say it's good, very good.
Rating.
Please stay standing.
It's also #1, #4 and #7 for the last 13 straight months.
Pretty cool, right?
In marketing and sales, I think it's pretty dope.
Please stand up.
47:13
This guy read the book and quadrupled his monthly revenue just from reading the book.
If you quadrupled your revenue, would that be worth it?
Ah, we got 678-910-1112.
A lot more.
OK, this is it.
Wow.
Probably have 40 or 50 up.
OK, well, wait, there's more.
47:32
Going to autograph the book.
There's only one that I have autographed.
Actually, that's not true.
I think there's probably 5.
Oops.
I had to get a really fat marker so you could see it.
47:49
That's actually my my.
It's embarrassing.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
You got to stand.
You got to keep standing.
Got to keep standing.
One out of 10.
I'll put my personal cell phone inside. 1000 bucks.
48:16
I'm not going to show it to you.
All right, we got about 2/3.
OK.
I'm going to review for your sales calls, rewrite your script with you and drill your sales team on how we set everything up.
48:33
Does that work for 1000 bucks stand?
If that's worth it for you with the book, please stand.
I'll have my traffic guy who right now we get about 20,000 leads a day across our portfolio.
He'll do an entire funnel breakdown into you about 11 pages.
He'll breakdown everything that you could do differently within the funnel.
48:51
Different headline split tests, different paragraphs, different copy things, different images, different layouts.
Right now we have between more than two X, but I feel confident saying we could double your traffic.
All right, we're close.
We're like 90%.
I'll also use my network to recruit the one missing star player that you have in your company.
49:10
So right now, we will look at your company and we will find out what the biggest missing pieces and leverage and put someone in there for you.
Stand up with that.
If that's worth 1000 bucks.
I'll also spend 2 hours with you on the offer that you're giving right now so you can get more people to click, more people to sign up for the calls, more people to show, more people to buy and at higher prices.
49:33
All right.
I think I got like one person still seated.
I got, I see you.
I see you.
Let's see what I got.
I'll see what I got.
Let's see what I got.
I'm also going to feature you on my channel so that two hours we'll televise it and we'll distribute it across all of our channels.
49:48
So right now that gets about 10 million impressions.
So in real advertising dollars it's about $100,000 in advertising just for in terms of that's what people are willing to pay for three 92nd spots and it's a 30 minute spot.
So it would be significantly higher than that.
So if that's worth 1000 bucks, let me know by standing is how you do that.
50:08
And if you don't make three times what you pay me for this book, I'll give you all the money back and keep all the work that we did.
That work measured over 12 months.
That's the fine print fair.
Please stand.
If that's still worth 1000 bucks, I see you.
And there's not ten books.
50:26
There's only one look around and that's how you increase leverage to sell an offer.
Instead of a $25 book, it's for $100,000.
50:41
So does everyone understand?
Stay standing.
Do you ever understand that you just need to do it better?
Output comes from volume times leverage.
You must do more and get more from what you do.
The way you get more from what you do is you first do everything that you know you should be doing better.
The way you do that is to focus on one thing for a long time without distraction.
51:00
Anything can become big with time.
When you line all actions to a single outcome and you keep working at it, your success will look effortless and obvious from the outside.
But you will know that it came from years of saying no to everything except that which mattered most.
This is how we grow companies at acquisition.com through leverage.
51:19
Most entrepreneurs lack The Who, the what, and the how to scale.
At acquisition.com, we recruit The Who, We give them the what and we show them the how.
And once an entrepreneur has all three, the business scales by default.
Leila already showed you these.
We've got more free courses at acquisition.com.
If you guys like this stuff, you want to learn more from us and that's it.
51:36
Thank you guys so much.
I appreciate you.








0:00
If I'm Timmy and future me is Dad looking back like I want to make that man proud and that man's the only man who knows how hard I could have tried.
Only you can compare your effort to what you know you could have tried.
And I think that's like that gap is what I'm trying to close in myself.
0:17
And that's the like, that's the journey I'm on right now.
And the business is just a outward manifestation of that.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:34
Have you seen egoless successful people?
Totally.
Interesting.
Yeah, I I I.
Mean, I don't think any human has no ego, but I think that you absolutely can have, I mean one of the most successful.
Actually the two largest companies in our portfolio are headed by couples, husband, wife, duos where they both are aware of their deficiencies.
0:53
They both cover for one another and I would say that they are the most anxiety ridden of them of like are am I doing good enough?
Is this right?
Like I feel like we should be doing more like paranoia around improving the product, the service, the the culture of the business overall.
Whereas the more ego driven ones want to reflect more of the the greatness of the business onto themselves.
1:12
They want to take more of the credit they they tend to like hog more of the work.
They don't delegate.
Well, they can't attract talent at scale because only assholes don't work for assholes.
And so it's like it's just, it's just I think I was kind of conflating ego with confidence too, because you're talking about self-awareness, right?
1:28
Yeah.
Well, confidence, I would just, I would define as the percentage likely that what you say will happen, will happen.
So like if he's a confident guy like and you can be confident at public speaking and not confident at doing math because the percentage likely that the speech goes the way you want it to is high versus the percentage likelihood that you do the excel sheet right is low.
1:44
You can be confident in different arenas versus just confident overall.
And so I think that that's like just a a segue on that for confidence.
I think it's it's nuanced in terms of like where are we applying it.
Seems like people who run purely on ego, they they can get to a high place, but it's kind of like a House of Cards.
2:01
Like they they don't have a stable foundation.
It can be.
It's just it's it's usually because.
So in general this is massive generalizations here.
Now are there super successful people who are super ego driven?
Absolutely.
But I would say that they, I would make the argument that they succeed despite their ego.
2:19
Meaning if they did all of the things that they did that are right and they didn't have an ego, they would be more successful.
So it's not that like ego prevents success, it's just doesn't.
I don't think it causes success.
I think that some people who have egos become successful, some people who don't have egos become successful.
But the things that need to be done are the things that drive the performance.
2:38
Like either you advertised or you didn't.
Either you built the sales team or you didn't.
Either you had a good product or you didn't.
Whether you're an ego driven asshole or a really kind person, irrelevant.
But in terms of how we want to live life and who we want to hang out with on a daily basis, because at the end of the day, like I'm going to die and no one's going to Remember Me anyways.
2:54
I'd rather hang out with people with more stuff.
Does that fuck you up that people won't remember us anyways?
No, I think it's really freeing because you just feel like what's your own life?
Make it what it is.
Yeah, do for you.
When you So when?
When did you start making content?
26 seven months ago somewhere.
3:12
In there and then.
So what's your output per week these days?
I think right now we're about 300 a week, more 3, three, 53150 pieces, no pieces of content a week.
And so, so with your, with your.
Videos shares.
With your videos, because I found you through YouTube videos and so do you do you basically go, if you're like speaking to someone, an idea pops in your head like, that'd be a good video.
3:38
Or do you have like a brainstorm sesh where you're like, I'm going to do a video on this topic?
Yeah.
So my brainstorming is Twitter or X.
Now that's where I do all my brainstorming.
So I'll probably tweet like five times a day.
And it's just like, as things come to me and if there's a lot of traction on it, then I'll make a short about it.
3:56
And if there's a lot of traction on that, we'll make longs about it, right?
And are you conscious of your brand while you're tweeting?
Like do you ever have thoughts?
And you're like, oh, that's a good thought.
But it doesn't really fit into like the kind of culture I'm building around this thing.
I think it would be less that because if it's from me, it's going to be on brand for me.
So you believe it's.
4:12
It's a wide scope.
What works because it's all it's narrow because it's I'm, I'm, I'm me.
So I have lots of different aspects.
Like was once a frat bro, also management consultant also a gym bro, also an investor.
Like I have a lot of things that are just like part of weird.
Yeah.
Exactly.
And so like if it's if it relates to things that are part of me, then it is on brand for me.
4:31
If if I'm going to say it, then it's on brand where.
But it might not be contextual to the platform, right?
It's not form fit for where where you're talking.
It just might not be a good X piece of content X as in x.com.
So if you're like trees should be blue, you're like maybe not on X, maybe that belongs.
In.
4:47
Painting.
Yeah, if if that's if that were recorded.
My brand, which I don't talk about trees much, or the color blue.
Is there a reason?
No, no.
I hear you.
I hear you because that's what stuck out to me there.
Yeah.
Well none of my.
I'm trying to think.
5:02
I don't think any of our brands are blow.
We can, we can, we can circle.
Well, leads is blue.
That's right.
The the book is blow.
The book is blow.
But so you, you'll put out a tweet and what you get back tells you if that's a good idea or not.
From the market.
Yeah.
They tell me if they think it's interesting.
5:18
Like I say, I think this is interesting.
If they like and share it, they tell me they think it's interesting too.
I I, I'm with you.
I, I worked at a super liberal place and they would complain about like Iggy Azalea doing like appropriating culture and I'd be like well kind of let the market decide and then it would turn them off.
They were like, don't talk like that.
And I was like, well, if people like it, there must be some kind of utility to it.
5:35
And I don't think she's the best.
But I think time will settle these things.
But I, I, I How do you.
How do you reconcile that When people feel like taste and even sometimes morality can be not adjudicated through the market adjudicated.
5:54
Is that the right word?
No.
I just don't know what it means.
Like when think when people think that stuff should be worked out by the market.
Oh, I don't touch morality stuff often because I'm like, you can put super, Yeah, right.
Like there there are if, if, if I can't, if I can't say this is true, this isn't true, then I usually don't touch it.
6:14
So like all of the content that I make, I have two boxes for it.
I just want it to be true and I want it to be useful.
And so like if I say something's working, some things don't, then that is true.
Is it useful?
Not really.
If I say, hey XYZ, when someone walks in the door, you know, give them a checklist and they'll be more likely to buy.
6:34
It works, but it's not always true.
And So what I try and do is find the sweet spots where it says in this context, in a weight loss sale, if you ask, if you put this checklist in front of people and you don't do anything different in the process, a higher percentage of people buy, that's both true and useful.
And so that's kind of where the, the sweet spot of where I try to make content and that's what the books are about, is like if I put something out, I don't want anyone to be able to say, like, that's wrong.
6:57
I mean, they can say that's wrong, but that's their problem.
But in terms of, like, you know, it works.
This is like if more people find out about your stuff, more people will buy it, period.
Who fight me.
And so that's really like when I, when I create the arguments that are inside of like the books that I have and the content I put out, it's always based on those types of arguments.
7:15
It's like if you do more of this thing, you will make more money, period.
What What do you think is the biggest mistake content creators make today?
Not being them.
Yeah. 100% will try like basically getting taken over by the algorithm and then like talking about blue trees when they don't actually fuck with blue trees, right?
7:34
But they did it because they did one blue tree post and people, right?
So had to.
And so they got a lot of likes.
And they're like, maybe I'll start making more stuff on Blue Trees.
But like, then they go down that alleyway for six months or a year.
And then they're like, I'm like the Blue Tree channel.
But like, I don't even care about trees.
Like, that's not even the stuff I like talking about.
And so they can't actually sustain it because the biggest brands are built over decades, not days or weeks or months.
7:54
And so you have to optimize again, Like, remember, starting at the end, at least for me, starting at the end and then working your way backwards.
It's like the only thing that will persist over my entire life is me.
And so for my life, you can always fall back on that being there, because it's I'm going to be, well, as long as I'm alive, I'll be here, right?
8:12
And so if everything that I talk about is related to stuff that I fuck with, then it will always be on brand for me.
Now what's cool is that my interests will slowly morph and shift over time, but it usually doesn't happen overnight.
And so there's something called successive approximation.
8:28
But basically, it's like you can, it's like slow boiling frog, like you like the the Bud Light Dylan Mulvaney thing was going from like cold water to hot water.
Now if they'd done that over 30 years, it probably would have been fine and seamless, right?
But it was too big of a shock too soon.
And so it's about having like 100 tiny iterations that that's how you can like steer oil tankers.
8:48
We're moving them slow.
Yeah, we're titanicking minus the iceberg.
They hit an iceberg.
Yeah, they hit an iceberg.
They did.
So so are you saying follow, follow your inspiration?
All the things that you're interested in, I just use inspiration always like scares me as it works like I feel like it means so many things to different people, like if you're interested in it then I think talk about it.
9:08
Yeah, I guess, I guess it's like follow what you're sort of create is creative spark the right word.
Sure.
I'll say there's there's two also two categories of creators that I think is probably worth delineating.
So everything I just talked about would say is, is, is, is more for entertainers.
9:25
So on the other hand, you've got educators and I think there's way more mistakes in the education side than there is the entertainment side.
The entertainment loop is the algorithm loop where they start like making content about stuff they don't actually care about because they think it's going to be the algorithm.
The the educators start trying to teach on stuff that they haven't done.
9:42
And so they try and pretend they have more authority so that they can get more views, but they don't have that.
And so at some point they feel like a fraud because they are like, that's the, like people were like how do you deal with imposter syndrome?
I was like, you don't have it if you did what you're talking about.
Yeah, like, I don't have imposter syndrome about talking about investing.
10:00
It's what I do every day.
So, like, are you suspicious of, like, academics?
A little bit.
In that respect, not suspicious, but are you a little bit like, I guess I had that too.
It's like when you're in film school and you have a teacher, but then you check his IMDb and he hasn't made movies.
You're like, well, you're telling me this shit, but you haven't sold anything more than I have at this point.
I think that, I mean, I would say that that is the most legitimate complaint.
10:19
Like, I think that all content is consumed within the context of the creator's background.
So like, for example, if I tweet on the Ivory Throne, it might get likes, it might not.
If Elon Musk does it, it'll get a zillion shares and likes and whatever, because it's consumed within his context.
10:37
We should be fair that context for many times is the brand itself.
But part of the brand, the things that we've associated with it, right, are the background evidence that the person is who they say they are.
And so, like I had, you know, just under a $50 million exit, you know, we have a portfolio right now that does plenty of money.
And so people have that evidence.
10:55
So when I say, hey, when I'm buying companies, like if I.
So if you'd asked me, what do you look for in companies that you're trying to buy And I'm a a a school teacher that doesn't have an investment portfolio.
And I give you my answer, they could say the exact same words as me, but everyone would be like, you're full of shit.
No.
It's like when I talk about how to win a basketball.
11:10
It doesn't have the same credences when MJ does it.
Yeah.
Which disappoints me because I know what I'm talking about and I think it's valid.
Thank you.
Yeah.
But like I think that's like specialist that's the that's like the number one.
That's like the the biggest was like the entertainers go down the algorithm trap of of talking about stuff that they're not actually interested in.
11:26
Educators go down to the ego and status faking, Track the fake it till you make it, which I'm so aggressively against.
Like just be real about the stuff that you actually have done.
And if you want like in in my world it's the opposite.
It's do crazy shit and then you can talk about it.
11:43
And then was there a point in your?
Did you want to get into content creation prior to before you started doing it, or was there a point where you're like, I think I've earned enough at this point to where I can legitimately talk about what I want to talk.
About so two things.
I've made content, but the content was different over whatever season I was in.
12:02
Like so when I owned my gyms, I was talking about like intermittent fasting and like programming.
Is that good by the way?
If you stick with it, sure.
OK.
Yeah, good to know.
But from a from a creation perspective, I just saw the content as just like lead nurture.
12:18
Like people might click an ad, see some content and then decide to buy.
It wasn't to get customers, it was just to let people know that I wasn't a total idiot Like that was it?
Once.
Once.
We probably.
It was too unchanged years ago.
I saw.
12:33
I mean, this is ridiculous, but I'll share it anyways.
So Kylie Jenner became a billionaire or like she was on the cover of Forbes and she was like 20 and I was 27 and I felt so poor and bad.
A little inadequate compared to her, of course.
Yeah.
And so whenever.
12:49
So I have this rule with business, which is like, if someone's making more money than you, then they're better the game of business in some way than you are and you have something to learn from them.
Doesn't mean you have to.
Like, just because you learn from someone doesn't mean you need to become them.
And I think that's a huge one.
It's like, I can learn.
Like I'm going to take a really extreme example of somebody who has zero stoke.
But like, you can look at Hitler and think there are things we can learn from this.
13:08
Now obviously there are things that we should learn from it in the other way, which like, we'll learn what not to do.
But in terms of like creating a movement, in terms of oration rhetoric, like there's a lot of things that he had that that were good, just used for the wrong means, right?
And so bringing it back, bringing it back home to content.
13:27
Kylie Jenner hit the front page.
I felt inadequate.
And then Conor McGregor, like months later, had proper 12, sold for 600 million and then Clooney had just had his, the first ever of you know what was it?
Cos Amigos sold for a billion and then the rock had Terramana and then Huda Beauty was a big influencer and she sold a portion for 600 million as well.
13:48
And so it was like within this, this like corridor of like 12 months, like all these massive exits happened from all these people at big personal brands.
And I had this belief I was like I feel like I'm good at business.
And so, like, at the time, I think I, I'd taken on that year like some like 17 million in income like that year.
And I was like, I felt like I was hot shit.
14:05
But when I saw that, I was like, I don't know anything.
And so that was when I started getting into the idea of like, maybe I should build a personal brand, maybe I should start making content.
I still didn't like the idea of like, being famous because I kind of like being more like just doing my own thing.
But I had a friend of mine who's really big, kind of like celebrity.
14:24
And I was at, I was at his house talking over the kitchen table.
I said, don't you get tired of, like, the death threats and the letters to your kids and like all the stuff.
And he was like, if that's the price I have to pay for the impact I want to have, I would pay it every day of the week and twice on Sunday.
Right.
And he said that to me, I just felt like such a Pansy for, like, not taking, for being afraid of that.
14:42
Yeah.
And so I was like, and literally the week after that, I made my first YouTube video and that was that was it.
And so do you think this is like a specific moment in time where to be a successful entrepreneur, you do have to be like front of the house and kind of publicly facing?
Or do you see people who are doing it in discreet ways?
14:58
I don't think you need to.
I do think that increasingly so if just from a statistic perspective, cost to acquire a customer on paid media has gone up like 100% in a very short period of time.
So it's doubled, like the cost to get a customer has doubled.
And So what that means is at least how I translate that is brands will need to have trusted ambassadors to associate with so that consumers trust whatever they're buying because trust has never been lower.
15:21
And so you have to create a brand that people trust associated with the product and then do it.
Now you can partner with creators.
It doesn't have to be you, but it has to be somebody.
I think, I think more brands would benefit from it.
Now you know you have the the mega dudes like Elon has basically hacked that system and gone public, made one of the biggest personal brands of all time.
15:37
And people were like I like Elon, I will vote for that by buying his shares and buying his cars.
And so like he has a way to monetize every single person on planet earth in the most efficient monetization vehicle which is a public company of shares.
Like the most efficient vehicle to make money if you have a public brand is to go public.
15:54
Wait, So what do you mean?
I'm sorry.
You can make the most money if you have a public brand because and by public brand you mean him, he is the brand, yes, our personal brand.
Oh, and then people can invest in the brand because it's just called your stock broker and put shares in it.
And if you think about like the size of a business in terms of potential, it's number of potential units sold times potential gross profit per unit.
16:16
So like if you're, you know, if I wanted to get into banking for example, like everybody banks and so like the Tam is huge, right.
So that might be a good opportunity.
But like, does my brand resonate with banking?
Maybe.
But if I wanted to sell something else, then it might have a much smaller target audience and smaller price tag, right?
16:33
If I want to sell golf clubs, one, it's not really my brand.
But if I did, there's a very small percentage of people who do it, but maybe the lifetime values is is higher, you know, per person.
So that's like the that's the the really hard exercise that a lot of creators have to go through when they're going through.
Because you you, you don't want to start like 100 companies.
16:49
You want to be like what's the one thing that I can slice that hits the most of my audience that has the most long term value per customer.
And that's pretty much like the the X mark that you try and find when you're trying to build a brand.
But when you're a public company the the most expensive thing that someone will buy is all their money to invest in something like investment opportunities which is why they're so heavily regulated because everyone will give their life savings to something because that's an investment is anyone can invest in anything which is why you get the most money from the most amount of people.
17:21
And so that's why a public company if you have a front facing founder that is public and like very big and vocal, can be a hack to generating the most money.
On the flip side if Elon does something that's egregious the business he could destroy the entire business.
17:37
It's like the Uber guy Travis calendar or whatever.
But he but he didn't even have a really he he wasn't like he didn't ever published out like Elon.
I guess that was even more internal to like the Silicon Valley world.
But everyone's like oh this guy's hard charging a run through walls and everyone's like dude this guy's reckless.
He's doing through too many walls.
Yeah, he's doing espionage like his competitors and.
17:52
Shit, he got too stoked.
Yeah.
He had a cool well ego too.
He was burning on ego.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't to be fair.
I don't know.
No.
I read one book but I think we're.
But I feel confident.
He seems like he he he's yeah, I don't know the dude, but for sure.
For sure.
Joseph Gordon Levitt Pilot He's like, you're not super pumped.
18:10
I'm like, wrong kind of stoke.
Wrong Stoke.
Yeah, yeah, he's pushing the the Stoke with the.
I want to just circle back one thing on the authenticity thing with content creators and chasing like the the algo.
Do you think part of it is like, 'cause they're chasing the trappings of what come with that success, bro.
18:28
Stoke Boulders for shoulders.
That's what's up, dawg.
Thanks, man.
It's getting warm in here.
So.
So like, I feel like sometimes the way people go, the mistake.
I mean, sometimes I think they're chasing profit, but sometimes I think they're chasing other things too, like attention or or status, stuff like that.
So I guess I was curious what is like your goal and what you're chasing?
18:48
So the mission of the business is to make real business successful for everyone.
And so that's why we put out the books and the courses and the content and everything's free.
So like, my courses are free on my site without any opt in.
Like you don't have to give me any.
So you just want to democratize entrepreneurship, dude, That is yes.
And do you think all people are capable of it, of being an entrepreneur?
19:05
I I think of it as like a singular skill that just is blessed in certain people.
If if we're defining entrepreneurship as just someone who transacts in a business, I think anyone can do that.
That's really if any kid, if any kid can start a lemonade stint, then anyone can be an entrepreneur.
The question is how good of an entrepreneur can you be Now that definitely has, I think genetic predispositions just like anything else does And also just nature nurture side of it.
19:23
Like if you if you grew up in a family of entrepreneurs, likely that you're an entrepreneur is significantly higher than if you grew up in a family of government workers.
So what are the muscles of entrepreneurship that you would most recommend people work on?
And I know it's probably case by case, but broadly delayed gratification, Yeah baby, like number one, I have to be fair, that's probably for everything.
19:39
But delayed gratification is #1.
Being generous first, which is really tough for a lot of people, like being being being willing to a give more than you get back and give without expectation.
And that kind of pairs with the delayed gratification thing, which is like, I'm going to give him and give him and give, and I also have to accept that some people will burn me, and that shouldn't dissuade me from continuing to give.
20:03
And so I say like, that's probably #1 #2 and then #3 is.
Being romantic about the work and not the outcome.
So like I got, I was I I, I was on this podcast not that long ago and someone asked me they're like, So what motivates you now?
20:19
So we crossed $100 million in net worth when I was 31.
I'm 34 now and you know, I I publicly say I'm like I'm going to, I'm going to document my way to a billion and beyond.
And that's kind of all the stuff I'm sharing you know to to the audience.
But like that that idea doesn't motivate me.
20:34
It's also like way in the future like it would be a one time thing.
We'd cross the line.
I'd be like, well, now what?
Right.
The thing that has unlocked more juice for me than anything else is this is I'm I'm going to try and say in a way that's not trite actually seeing what your best looks like.
20:52
Like I think there's a little Giants in the movie.
The football movie.
I think it's that movie when he's he's like is that your best and he gets on the thing.
It might be that or it's it's one of the football movies and you know he's doing the push thing where the coach is on the on the little machine guy and he pushes him and he says you can stop when you've done your best.
21:07
And he stops at like the 30 yard line and he's like is that your best.
And he like, he pushes again and he's like and and there he's at the 50 and he's like, is that your best?
And he pushes again and he's like, is that your best?
And he's like, is that your best?
21:25
And he.
Pushes it again I was you, you reached that milestone, right?
Was there sort of like you're like that that's that's the end goal.
21:40
Was there a part of you like that's the end goal and then you got there and you had that kind of thing where you're like, is this it, you know what I'm talking about?
I felt nothing with it, but I also expected to feel nothing with it, and so I started acquisition.com the day after.
So I'm not a bit like I.
21:56
So I have now realized just from my own self that the time that I, when I look back on my life, the things that I enjoyed the most have been the pursuit, not the goal.
Like when I actually look backwards.
Now looking forwards, you think it's the goal, but looking backwards, all my happiest times are like when I was even in the struggle sleeping in the gym.
Like when you have a worthy foe that challenges you to the end of your ability and forces you to get better.
22:15
Like that flow, get me fired up right now.
Let's go.
That flow is where is where I feel most alive.
A goal worth pursuing.
That's that makes you stronger because you're fortified in that pursuit.
Like you're if you don't know what you're going after you you can anyone can kick your ass basically.
22:32
And so that that that has been like true.
So I think I saw this interview from Kobe that I just like loved and they said so most athletes are either really afraid of losing or they really want to win.
I don't know if you saw this play.
Yeah.
And he says I don't think I'm either And me paraphrasing what his response was just like he just wanted to do the absolute best he possibly could divorce the outcome.
22:55
And I think that a lot of people will say something like yeah I just I just want to try really hard.
But then there's like, there's the second part of the sentence where they're like, so that I can win, so that I can whatever, which means that that's still not the goal, it's just the vehicle.
But I think like the thing that I've been working the most on myself, that has been yielding me disproportionate returns in terms of my effort and what I'm getting out of myself is cutting the second-half of the sentence off and saying like, how hard can I?
23:18
You just want to know how hard you can try, how I want to see how hard I can try.
Have you felt that limit?
Have you pushed the the tackling dummy as far as it'll go?
Have you seen what your limit is in empty in the tech?
Or do you think it's like not finite, it could keep growing?
That's what it is.
I just think.
I think that the more you do, the more you realize you can Do you feel big, huh, Like, 'cause you're just like, dude, I could just keep you proved yourself.
23:35
You give evidence.
You're like, well, I did that.
So that gives me evidence that I, I can probably go a little further.
And then you do that and you're like, you just you just get this never ending momentum of like, 'cause like the the first book I wrote has done really, really well, $100 million offers has like 17,005 stars on Amazon.
23:52
It's a it's always a top 100 books.
Still, like two years later.
And when I wrote my second book, $100 million leads, I worked on that book five times harder than I did on the first book.
And I think that that book will outsell the first book over the the longevity of its, you know, book career.
24:10
But I had so much enjoyment from seeing how hard it was to really write that.
That book's probably the hardest book I'll ever write because it's it was literally trying to consolidate advertising into a single book, which is mine, So hard to do.
But it unlocked a new level of effort.
And I know that future books that I write, that will be the new baseline.
24:27
That'll be the new minimum standard that I that I know I can do.
And so like the idea because I was thinking about this actually this morning, weirdly, like I was, I was fast forwarding to, like, if I had a kid and they, they were playing Pee Wee soccer or whatever, right?
I don't, I don't want to be the dad who's like you won high five or you lost high five.
24:47
I want to be the dad who's completely divorced from the outcome And like we won 10 to 0.
And I look at little Timmy and I'm like you did not try your hardest.
And on the flip side if we lost 10 to 0 and he left everything on the field, I'd be like you fucking crushed it.
25:02
Like I am proud of you and that's been like and I and I want to keep that same perspective for myself.
If I'm Timmy and future me is dad.
Looking back, like I want to make that man proud and that man's the only man who knows how hard I could have tried but didn't.
25:19
So like everyone else will give you applause for the stuff that you're already really good at and do well at because they're comparing your outcome to what they think they could achieve.
But like, only you can compare your effort to what you know you could have tried.
And I think that's like that gap is what I'm trying to close in myself.
And that's the like, that's the journey I'm on right now.
25:37
And the business is just a outward manifestation of that Mosa Nation real quick, if you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
25:52
And if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
What's the main prohibitor in terms of emptying the tank?
Is it fear that it won't work out if you do?
26:08
Or is it just laziness?
You mean, why don't people?
Yeah, 'cause I feel like everybody can empty the tank, and I feel like most people don't.
Or maybe they just have too much responsibility and they don't have, like the bandwidth to do it the way they'd want to.
I think it's, I think it's, it's well, one, there's a lack of comfort because it's usually new.
Like you push the you push past the comfort zone you're outside of where you're used to.
26:26
I have a hard time in general, just a side note answering why questions, 'cause I don't know why anyone does anything, but and I'm asking you, like, you should know.
Yeah, I have no idea.
But do you know?
No idea.
But when you're in yourself, how do you how do you on the days where you don't empty the tank?
26:41
Because they must come?
Sure.
How do you rationalize that to yourself that you didn't have it that day?
So I so the times when I don't empty my tank now is usually when I don't have clarity on what I should be doing.
If I have a really clear goal of what I need to do, that is my like, that's my shit.
27:00
Like if I have a three day weekend and a blank calendar and a big goal and a lot of coffee like I you will never find a happier version of me just chowing like I I I call it like I need another bone like and right now because I just launched the book and I like literally next week we have our big leadership meeting and my my whole talk to the team is like I need another bone.
27:20
And so, like, let's just figure out what Alex's Bones going to be, and I'm going to gnaw on it for the next 18 months.
I feel like a good marker for finding what you really want to do in life is when you don't notice weekends or holidays where you just sort of like, I remember because when I started doing comedy, it's like I was teaching like surf lessons and there's 4th of July was coming up.
27:39
Yeah, I didn't even know 4th of July is like my favorite holiday.
I didn't even like notice it.
You know, it just doing open mics and like and then you just sort of like, like, oh, 4th of July went by and and like then you're like, OK now.
Now I know I'm really locked into what I want to do.
You don't experience FOMO if you're doing something better.
27:57
If you're in your go, MO dude nailed it, clip it.
What do you have a?
What's your biggest vice?
Vice.
Yeah, I mean, I drink on occasion.
28:14
If you want to consider that a vice, that's a vice.
If you want to consider it a dessert, a vice, you could.
But like, I just eat in my macros.
It doesn't really matter too much.
Do.
You like ice cream?
Yeah.
Yeah, big ice cream fan.
Me too, I'd say.
I'd say if I had to pick up only one type of dessert, it would be ice cream.
28:30
Yeah, same.
Yeah, I like mixed.
I like mixed methodologies though.
I like, like warm cookie ice cream with like, crunch contrast.
Yeah, exactly.
A little texture.
I want temperature contrast.
I want texture contrast.
Yeah, my brother was talking shit one time on Pizzuki's.
He was like, it's just the best.
28:46
It's just a cookie with ice cream.
I was like, yeah, that's all it.
Is just it.
Doesn't need to be other.
He's like, I guess he didn't like the name, but I'm like, well, they got to call it something.
I think pizzuki works, but those two things together, it's kind of undefeated.
Bro they didn't change pizzuki sounds too much like dookie right?
I think they need to change it too cuz.
29:02
Pizzuki.
Yeah.
They could just go like cookie.
Yeah, Pudding, Not, not Pezuki.
This is not Dookie.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But that's people define themselves too much by what they're not but not by what they are which I do think is a modern phenomenon that distracts me and bothers me.
29:23
Yeah.
I think they have more examples to look at to say what they're not.
Do you have people like I I'm sorry that I I frame it in like a it's not that I'm looking for like holes in the game but I'm I'm I'm genuinely curious like do you do you have a mentor It it's going to sound weird as shit.
29:41
So yeah.
But it's wildly narcissistic.
It's yourself sort of.
So yeah.
So basically all right we're going to go into it all right.
We're going to go deep, bro.
We're going to go deep.
We're going to go with you.
All right.
You got the light on your head.
We're behind you in The Cave.
Let's find out Roller coaster.
29:57
Let's let's put the.
JC and.
Alex, we click in so, so there's something called the Solomon paradox.
And so the Solomon paradox, if you remember King Solomon from the Old Testament.
Really.
Wise guy.
Exactly.
And so the Solomon paradox simply states that people give better advice to other people than they follow themselves.
30:12
And so they've actually observed this in psychology exam.
They do double-blind they they actually whitewash someone's own personal stats from something.
And then they have the same person look at themselves from an injective perspective, not knowing it's themselves and they the advice they give that person differs from what they do in reality.
Which to me just indicates that there are, there are emotions at play when it's your own stuff, but you can be more logical and impartial when it's from the outside in.
30:35
And so one of the I've I've struggled to have like therapists and coaches, I've I've never been able to like do it well because I feel like 90% of the time that I'm talking to them.
I'm trying to give them context around a decision so they can help me make a decision which feels like a big waste of time.
30:50
Especially like it's like I need you to have lived my whole life so you can have context on why this, why this decision means something.
On the flip side is that I also feel like they have misaligned incentives.
Meaning like they're only incentives for me to come to the next session.
They want you back.
They need the money to keep coming in.
They don't want you to get too good.
I mean like I should.
31:05
It sounds kind of right and so so taking all that in consideration, people are better giving advice to other people.
I have to give context to somebody in order to get some advice and then there are incentives are aligned.
I was like well what would be the best person to give me advice.
And so for me the best person to give me advice has been my mental envisionment of of 85 year old me who's already achieved every goal that I've wanted and more and is the man that I would like to be.
31:30
And then having basically sessions with that man and saying hey it's Monday, that's what I have on my docket this week.
What do you think?
And then I put my 85 year old soft hat on and I'm like, all right, well, you know, what's the goal?
What are you trying to work on?
31:45
I'm like, well, this and it's like what are your concerns?
I'm like, well this is kind of what I'm already doing is well, you know, that's not going to matter.
And then I'm like, yeah, I get it.
But this, what about this other thing?
So I can skip past the 90% of giving context because future me already has context in the situation.
Future me is also 100% aligned with long term me, which is I think a big thing because short term ME always wants to make, you know, short term decisions.
32:04
But long term me is like, dude, like let's do this for us, right.
Like and the the biggest thing that's gotten me through really hard times has been working to gain the approval of that man.
And in a lot of ways it's scary because it's the hardest man's approval to gain because he always knows how much harder I could have pushed.
32:24
And so it has forced me to pick fewer things to try and excel at.
Because I know for me to get the red, you know, the the stamp of approval from future me, who I call Solomon, even though it's future me to get the approval of Solomon, I need to leave it all on the field.
And so like walking into the book launch made like 500,000 people who register for the launch like a whole city.
32:44
It's like Baltimore.
Like it's like all of them.
Like when I when I walked up, I knew that I had made Solomon proud before I stepped on stage.
And so I didn't have a lot of stage fright because I knew I prepared a ton.
I done every single day for the weeks leading up to it I had done.
33:02
I'd said the said the the presentation out loud and then I'd done a recording of the presentation and then I would watch the presentation with my slides up and edit the slides.
And I did that every single day for the entire month leading up to it's already done the speech like 100 times before I stepped on stage.
And so independent of what happened, Solomon was like you have my approval and that is enough.
33:23
And I think that that's been it for me.
It's like, if I can gain that man's approval, then the noise from the outside world and the approval of others has mattered less and less.
And that's my continuous that's my pursuit is to make that man's opinion the only opinion I listen to.
How Jacked is Solomon?
When you visualize him, the limit does not exist, bro.
33:42
He's a mountain.
Who's who's?
Let's say you look at like a 75 year old bodybuilder.
Yeah, which physique?
Who?
Which bodybuilder?
Who's older now?
Do you look up to the most?
I think Frank Zane has a great physique.
He aged extremely well.
33:58
He stayed in shape.
There are more and more examples now because there's all this anti aging stuff and people take better care.
We have more science.
We know we know things now.
But yeah, that probably that'd be the the single example of of do you think he has the most beautiful body in like Olympia kind of history.
Not my favorite body.
34:14
I think he's aged the best.
I think Lee had a great body, my favorite.
I really love Flex.
Wheeler's body.
Flex was just like, oh, look at that real quick.
Look at the black and there's a black and white image of Flex Wheeler that's just like, unbelievable.
34:30
So he's before Arnold, right?
No, he's after.
He was after.
Yeah, he's after Arnold.
Damn Milo Sarchev at his peak time.
I loved his body.
Mike Menser.
He loved Mike Menser's body.
And I don't even know these dudes.
Rigs and I used to follow this.
I was.
34:46
I had a subscription of Muscle and Fitness.
I don't know what happened.
Yeah.
Menser's like Arnold's days.
Menser's like Arnold's time.
Yeah.
I can only remember the I'm I'm, you know personally I don't know if you can tell by what I'm going for but I'm going for Ronnie.
I'm a Coleman head.
35:02
I almost didn't.
I mean I I know I look in distinguished, but I'm going for Ronnie.
Yeah.
And I and I actually.
And actually, really, really like Flex Wheeler's body.
Sorry, no Phil.
He's body really like Phil.
He's even yoked.
They started to get a little bit less gargantuan right in his era.
35:19
They they toned it down from the Coleman, like 320 weight.
I don't know.
I just think there hadn't been enough.
I mean, Big Ramy.
Big Ramy was like the biggest bodybuilder who won, and he won in the last three years, just a black and white of flex.
Wow.
I mean, yeah, there's not.
You know, he keeps the abdomen a little more tight, too, than he's the exceptional.
35:35
I I have a random one, but Laird Hamilton.
Laird Hamilton.
Surfer guy.
You'd get along with him OK?
Yeah.
I think he'd be right up here.
Yeah.
I could see you guys like slapping hands.
Yeah, you guys do.
You do ice baths.
Not really.
No, no.
He does this workout thing where you lift weights underwater in Malibu.
35:52
He's like a big wave surfer guy.
But I'd check out his documentary on Hulu.
It's very inspiring.
OK, He's just.
Kicking ass the whole time?
Yeah, dude, I did a peptides recently and I had to get off him because I think I did too many out the gates.
Yeah, too fast.
I get it.
He got huge, bro.
But I was taking CJC 1295, BPC 157.
36:11
I don't know what any of these are.
No.
You haven't delved into that world.
Not peptides.
No.
No.
Yeah.
And it also made me a little bit manic, which I'm a little predisposed to.
So I just woke up at 3:00 in the morning and my first thought was, you're amazing.
And I was like, I need to slow down.
I feel like that stuff.
I feel like you should take more of that.
Yeah, maybe I shouldn't.
Yeah.
I don't know why I was so wary of that thought.
36:27
It was probably just the volume to much.
A little intense.
Yeah.
Also, I was like, you know, what if I was thinking about my Solomon?
I was like, I don't know if you've earned that thought right now.
So it doesn't feel ego syntonic to the moment you're in.
And that's why I pushed it out, bro.
But I appreciate you wanting me to feel that.
But are you are you very adventurous with that stuff or do you keep it pretty tight?
36:46
No.
I've been on TRT for four years, five years, since I was 28 or 29 when I start TRT.
I I did it when I was 18 for a summer and I was doing HGH together.
It was the most fun summer in my life, but I fucked up my shoulder.
I was just doing more overhead lifting than I should have been doing and then it ultimately resulted five years later in surgery.
37:04
So the longevity part of it is the thing that people don't look out for.
Well, it's like, I mean I keep it's like if you if you can't do it for a decade, don't do it for a day.
Like I just love that frame and especially, I mean when it comes to anything, but especially fitness stuff.
So everything for me starts with joint pain which is like which of these hurt my joints the least that I can do the most amount of volume on And then those are the ones that I hammer so that I can just accumulate the most fatigue on the muscle and then ultimately Dr. the most growth.
37:31
And for shoulders, which one is that exercises So like overhead press for example doesn't doesn't build shoulders a ton.
Now you build strength for sure.
I mean you'll get a ton of core strength.
You'll get a lot of there's a lot of tricep in overhead press especially like from here up it's all tricep.
37:48
So often times the limiter isn't your isn't your shoulders So like if you overhead press often times like you could do this and then like at the end you could do these.
So it's like your delts are not the limiter your triceps are so you can't finish the lift because you still have juice in your in your delts but you don't have juice in your triceps right.
So if you actually use perfect form as your as your as your compass for when you stop reps, then you always stop shorter when your when your shoulders are done.
38:12
And so I do a lot more like lateral raises and things like that to build shoulders because they are the sole focus.
I can take them beyond death.
So that's giving you more width.
Yeah.
And are you strict with the technique?
Are you swinging them?
So I, I, I train a so I'm strict with the technique for all of my first reps and I will continue to do the same technique but with less and less range of motion.
38:36
So like if I'm doing lateral raises, like I'll hit perfect for the 1st, 10 or 12, and then I'll hit 3/4 and then I'll hit whatever.
Now I don't do that on every set, but if I want to like finish the last two sets off really strong, I'll do something like that.
Like I want to, I want to squeeze everything out of it.
To be fair, delts are also muscles that can recover faster.
38:52
They're smaller, they can take more workload than like your back can.
Like if you're doing deadlifts like training that way is a terrible idea.
I think I messed up my shoulder doing that.
Really over the press?
Yeah, because, you know, you know, I had like a thing where my brother, he's at like a similar build to you.
39:09
And I saw him over 4th of July and he just looked like a tank.
So I was like, I need to lift more because I've always been more of like a cardio guy.
Yeah.
And now my shoulder kind of hurts.
So I'm back on yoga.
Well, like that's that's where I I, I I I like the bodybuilding perspective.
Like in my opinion bodybuilding is the most functional training.
39:27
Hear me out because being jacked is functional, right?
Like every time I'm on video, I'm using it.
Every time I'm in a picture, I'm using it.
Whereas people were like, well, when are you going to.
Yeah.
When are you going to let.
Yeah.
And you can't either.
You know what?
I don't need to.
39:43
Oh, not you.
Not like.
No, I didn't want.
Yeah.
But yeah, you're right.
The utility of it is to appear like you could kill a lion.
That's how it's like, no one looks at Peacock with their plumage.
And they're like, yeah, but that can't stab a rhinoceros.
It's like, I don't need to.
I got to impress the girl over here.
He's crushing it.
39:59
Yeah.
Sexy, sexy dog.
Yeah.
No one's going to say like, Peacock's literally invented peacocking, right?
I know.
And then mystery totally stole it from the originators.
So with that, with gals, did you always have pretty good rhythm or was that something you worked on similar to your body, similar to your entrepreneurial spirit?
40:15
I always did.
OK there.
Yeah.
Good.
You know what?
I like where you're landing it.
Just leave it there.
It's not a good thing to modernize on people.
Talk about it.
I'm like, what are you doing?
How do you feel about that?
Like all these.
I guess I'll speak for myself.
40:32
All these podcasts where like 40 year old dudes are talking about like how to get laid and stuff like that.
I'm like, what are you doing?
I'm like shouldn't you have like a family?
And like something like he's like, look, man, if I see a girl and she's like, you know looks at another guy, I'm like later, I'm like, dude, you're 42, like, what are you doing bro?
Go home and like pet your dog and cook a burger, Put some Bengay on, you know, I'm sure those joints are hurting.
40:56
I it just speaks to me of like a culture that has like misaligned values.
I guess.
I think it's the polarization of gender roles.
So it's just like right now Gender's not topic.
I don't talk about it because I don't want to get into it, but because there's so much around definition of terms.
41:13
People are just oscillating on opposite sides.
It's a pendulum.
Yeah.
It's it's it's really like a a posturing move.
And I'm hey, like I'm a big do whatever you want, guy.
But yeah, I haven't.
I haven't.
I probably steered clear of that movement because that's not my that's not my message like mine is about entrepreneurship and believing that the only like there are a lot of problems in the world and I believe that entrepreneurship in business is the most efficient way to solve problems and so I will not be able to solve all the problems in the world.
41:44
I think anyone can.
But I can at least help equip the future entrepreneurs who will.
And if everyone has a house, we'll be fighting about that stuff less.
I do think like there's a lot of efficacy in if people are you know, have food security and and shelter security, maybe some of these other fights that we're having that are more on the margins won't feel as significant.
42:03
I, you know, I would actually argue the opposite.
Oh, you think that?
Oh, you think because we have security, we have, we have to find something else to.
Argue so much time.
Yeah, because the bottom part of the pyramid's taken care of.
We're like, let's fight about more nebulous stuff.
Yeah, because if you if you go to Africa, they're not arguing about it because they want food.
People say that, But I went to Africa.
42:19
They're fighting.
No, I'm really OK.
I was like, I was like really the best counterpart.
JT got tried about.
This shit, dude.
JT got tried nagging.
Yeah.
No, that was great.
No, but I think, I think it's it's it's we have, we have so much abundance in everything that we have we're trying to find.
42:37
So Leila, my wife found this really interesting study on this.
But basically the number of problems that the brain finds is always the same.
And so all you do is switch the things that you see are problems.
And I just thought that, so then then it for me, it helped me think about problems as not problems because they're just a thing that will always be there.
43:00
And so the easiest way to solve a problem is to decide it's not a problem to begin with.
It's just the mind's function.
Yeah, it's supposed to do that.
It's trying to keep you alive.
Trying to determine that threats like the really happy monkey probably didn't do as well as the paranoid monkey that was watching out for lions because the happy monkeys like, dude, life is awesome and they're done.
43:18
You know what I mean?
Right.
But the other one that was like, I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know, like this place.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
Like stressed out his mind like he's he's up in the tree And the other is like, it's fine you it's always the rain relax and then done.
Yeah, you're always going to be the same level of stressed out.
Just have those good problems to focus on.
Yeah.
Champagne problems.
43:33
Like, that's the.
That's the goal.
Would you argue that the monkey that was happy but died early had a better life?
Yes, and which what?
What really like bends.
My noodle is.
And we even use the word early.
So I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go dark and then we're gonna go light.
43:51
All right.
Perfect.
So I had a cat named Bill nicknamed Chill Bill.
Nice awesome dude.
Max dug and Bill was always chill.
Best cat I've ever had.
And he like, he was like a dog.
He would just like, chill.
44:07
Like he would come up and just like he would just always be around you.
He's like, hey, I'm here.
If you need something, I'm here.
And I was like, I appreciate that.
And so one day, and Bill was a young cat when I had him.
He was a young lad.
And then like, I think like 20 months later he died.
Like he died of like some freak heart thing.
44:22
His heart was too big.
Classic, right.
Evidenced by his chill nature and it actually, I think we actually found out it was like, it was because of that because like his his heart beat differently.
So he literally was like extra chill.
Yeah, like 2-2 chill, yeah.
But so I was really sad.
44:39
And I was like, why am I sad?
Like, why am I sad about Bill?
And so I thought about it and I was like, I'm I'm sad because I think he should have lived longer.
Like it felt unfair that he died at like just under two years old as a cat.
So then I thought, what if all cats only lived six months and Bill actually made it like 4 lifetimes?
44:57
And then I was like, that's deep.
I was like, I'd probably be really stoked that he lived such a long, amazing life.
And so it was only based on my expectation that he should live 10 years or 12 years or something rather than saying, well, on the scale of 5000 years, we're all living that short period of time.
45:14
And so if I die at 30 or I die at 70 on a 5000 year timeline, who cares?
And so that helped me get over like, like did the monkey die too early?
It's like the monkey died and he had a good life, right?
Yeah.
It's like someone dies, like of natural causes.
They die because you know they have a a painless aneurysm in their sleep, which sounds like a bummer.
45:34
Next day whole city floods.
Everyone else dies by drowning.
Who had it better?
Aneurysm bro with 24 hours less.
And I think, I think thinking about death too is such a great can be a motivator and helps you to give less fucks.
You know, 'cause we we we had like a show come out and like, oh.
45:50
Yeah, we're going deep.
Yeah, no, I mean, I'm going to die.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm going to die.
I'm almost certain.
But like, it's it's like we had a show come out and it's like you get so and you're like ego, you know, because you're like thinking about how's it going to perform?
46:06
Yeah.
How's it going to perform?
Are people going to think if it doesn't do well, are they going to think I'm a loser, All that kind of stuff, Then you think, well, I'm going to die one day, what does it matter?
So I think I just think it's thinking about, I think the Stokes do that, they think about death and it's like all the time.
It's very freeing.
46:22
Yeah, you just want to empty stoke and do some.
Put the clip in that machine gun and just pin that trigger and just set amount into the air.
Just think about dying violent bullets.
Think about dying, thinking about dying.
Kisses, yeah.
Bullets of love.
Yeah, thinking about dying makes me more stoked.
Yeah.
To live, yeah.
46:38
Yeah.
To live, yeah.
There we go.
Maybe we should end with we do of the weeks, but we're trying to mix them up right now.
Do you have a song of the week that's really banging for you?
Yeah.
46:57
Can you hear him?
Can you get him his guitar?
I would have.
I would have said that.
That Oliver song that went super viral, I would have said that.
But now it's too like, I don't want to get.
Yeah, I don't want to get.
I don't want to get all.
I just.
I did.
I listen to that song like four times.
It's a great song.
Yeah.
But I'll play you a different song that I've been jamming on this week.
47:14
Hell yeah.
Do you have one, doggy?
I think on.
Here it is.
I'm ready.
47:29
Oh.
It's like classical texture.
Oh.
Dude and the screens from everywhere.
I'm.
Addicted to the Jay-Z, Rihanna and ES posthumous post hummus.
47:47
And that's the dude who threw it together.
Yeah, that's the man.
I'll go.
Do you have yours?
I can go.
I mean, I I'm just really psyched on this artist.
Peggy Goo.
OK, Peggy Goo.
No, I love Peggy Goo.
Peggy Goo.
Peggy Goo.
All right.
She's a Korean DJ and she's she's big in Europe right now.
48:03
I think she's breaking into fusion.
Germany like?
Hasselhoff dude.
Yeah, dude, Yeah.
That's the dream.
He's a guy.
But I so I already I already talked about our one song Na na Na, on another podcast.
But I'll do Starry Night just 'cause I'm psyched.
48:19
I'm Peggy Goo.
Yeah, I'm gonna do.
No, no, no.
Yeah, do what you feel.
Yeah, maybe.
What's gonna?
Get us feeling you do one of these as you're walking in people the sunglasses are responding their like you got it.
Yeah, he knows.
You rip your shirt this.
48:35
Is my day.
Yeah, this is gonna be my day.
It's very gentle.
That's what I like about it.
Four children come up to your your heels and start and lift you up like toddlers.
Yeah, strong.
They carry it.
Yeah, 4/4 and toddlers know the truth.
48:51
Yeah, dude, the strength of body rate ratio for toddlers to the road.
They're like hamper has like, clothes and he doesn't need them.
Dude, this guy looks good.
Yeah.
All right.
I'm going to go with good.
Charlotte the River.
Oh yeah.
Epic kind of LA song, dude.
Here's the thing about Good Charlotte.
49:08
They actually kind of go hard.
But people don't know, 'cause they went soft.
And then once you go soft, people forget you can go hard.
They brand you with.
They associate one thing, yeah.
Is this new?
No, this is like 16 years old.
So yeah, it's new.
Feels new though, dude.
The Valley of the Shadow of.
49:25
I was listening to this at the gym and I was like, dude, I'm just a guy in LA going for it.
Did the people at the gym could see my energy.
I was like, yeah, I'm in it, dude.
I'm in it, bro.
I'm feeling things.
And you got so at the gym, you're just getting off nods.
Like, I'm going to let it up.
49:40
And dude, up nod is way.
Dude, that's such a good call that it's an up nod, not a down nod.
Oh, no.
Down nod's a little bit like slow down.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Up nod's like, that's what's up.
Yeah, yeah.
You're getting the chorus.
That's you went all the way.
49:55
Dude, I loved it.
And that's the thing about the gym, too.
I was going to say this.
You must have noticed this.
The gym.
Demographically, it's all races, all ages, all people.
That's when I go to 24 hour in North Hollywood.
The spread is insane.
You know what's cool?
The iron that doesn't care.
We're all brothers under the iron.
50:11
Like 500 lbs and 500 lbs.
This is what it is.
That's the title of this podcast.
Sweet man.
Well, thank you for coming.
On dude.
Thank you guys.
It's such a pleasure, man.
Appreciate you guys.
Thank you.
I.
Felt like we really cooked with gasoline.
That was nice.
Oh, nice.
OK, I that's the Preheat.
50:28
And then we switched right to the charcoal.
Maybe a wood?
Wood plank.
OK, tell me about a little cedar going some some aromatics.
Let it simmer.
A freaking Traeger dude.
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, man.
50:43
Thank you.
It's mutual.
Thank you for having me.
Sweet.








0:00
And so for us as entrepreneurs, like a lot of times we have to think like, how can I improve my character?
What are the traits of mine that are deficient so that I can hopefully inspire people, that I can bring people in at this higher level and then actually be able to execute?
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses.
0:19
Worth owning I'm.
Trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk, and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
Business owners, I think we can all agree that one of the most important things that happens as we grow is that we learn frameworks.
0:37
And that's why when you look back at what you used to accomplish, you know, years ago, it seems like you could fix this problem so easily because you have frameworks with which you've learned to think, right?
And so it took me 6 years to build my first eight figure company, 6 1/2 to build my first 8 1/2 figure, sorry, multiple 8 figure company because that was the same company.
0:55
The next company that I did that was multiply figures was it took me a year to build and the one after that took me 6 months.
And so we've gotten faster and faster and faster at doing this.
And now I've done over 120 million in sales across different industries.
And one of the key frameworks that I've developed or helps me think through things is someone going to share with you today?
1:15
All right.
So there's kind of three levels of employees or talent, right?
And this really applies to you or your team itself, because at the beginning, it's you, right?
And so depending on where you're at, you may be at one of these levels, or you may have to recognize it in others.
1:33
And I'm going to say in three different ways, the simplest way to think about this is in the beginning, you have to learn what to do, All right?
These are the skills, right?
And that's because what you are in the beginning is an individual contributor.
That means you actually have to get things done in order for them to, you know, happen, right.
1:51
And So what you're doing at this point is you're doing right.
All of your time is spent doing the things right, learning what to do, etcetera.
Now the reason it's really important to be able to recognize where you're at is because then you'll be able to look through this framework and immediately see what you need to do next to the same degree you may have gone through this but not have recognized the shifts.
2:11
And you can look at an employee and say, I think they are in this bucket, I think they're in this bucket, I think they have the potential to get to this bucket, etcetera.
Many times, people will stick at one level because of their own beliefs that they have about themselves, which is why we, you know, Leila and I believe that identity is very fluid if you want to be successful because you have to be able to change what you think about yourself in order to become the thing that's going to to debottleneck the business.
2:35
Because ultimately, it's costing every single human on earth a billion dollars a year, not knowing how to create a billion dollars a year in revenue.
Right.
And that's how I always think about this.
It's like it is costing me so much money.
My ignorance is costing me so much money.
And so hopefully with this, I'll break down some of the other things that you won't be ignorant to so you can recognize them to other people.
2:53
So level one is understanding what to do, right, which means you're an individual contributor and what your time is spent is doing.
All right.
The second level here is understanding how, all right, so you started to do it right?
The what you figured this out, but then you have to figure out how you're actually doing it, right?
3:09
And the reason for that is because at the next level, you become a manager, all right?
And that's making sure that other people can do that thing and they're consistently executing at a level that works, right.
And so here what you're doing is you're teaching, right?
You're teaching other people to do the thing, right.
3:27
And so at the beginning, you're doing right as an individual contributor, you have to focus on what it is, right?
The next level.
You're doing all the doing.
And you're like, you know what?
I feel like I understand this better, right?
I feel like I understand the sequence of how this works, right?
And then you can teach other people how to replicate that skill.
3:44
And at the very end, I'll show you how to apply this to departments in a second.
All right.
So stay tuned for that.
But this is level one, right?
As you're looking at yourself or an employee, right.
Level 2 is, oh, I think this person could teach other people.
I think they could manage them.
And as a quick caveat here, like, not every, like managers don't necessarily need to know how to do something better than an individual contributor.
4:04
There's always going to be niche expertise, etcetera.
But they should understand how it works, right.
And so this is just an important like just nuance to to note there, right.
The third level is what I look at is The Who, right.
And I know this may sound odd, it's like what and then how then who, but that is kind of what it evolves to over time.
4:23
All right.
The title is a leader, all right.
And these are very different than managers, which is something that I had to realize as I was scaling the business.
And you know usually at this level this is where you're at your, you know 3 ish $1,000,000 a year level and this is what allows you to crack open to the million plus per month level.
4:40
So 1010 million pluses, you have to have leaders that are engaged, right?
And the thing that you're doing is you're systematizing.
All right.
And So what I'm going to, I'll say this a different way too, because I think it's worth noting, is building the machine that builds the machine, all right.
4:58
And the reason that's important is because first you're doing it, then you're teaching it, and then you need something that can teach it for you.
That's kind of how this works, right?
So it's always, it's not delegating it, it's systematizing.
So it's really, I was trying to be thoughtful about what word I was going to use there because it's like, is it delegating it?
5:16
Is it handing off, It's systematizing it and it.
And there's a lot of different ways you can system, you know, build a machine that builds the machine.
But if you think through this in terms of your own frameworks, the reason that I like this is that you can actually grade yourself in terms of where you're at.
You can grade yourself in terms of where a team member is AT, and you can even grade departments right within your business, which depending on what your size is, your departments might just be, might be things that you were doing right.
5:41
If there's if you're a solopreneur for example, then like you wear all the hats, your finance, your HR, your legal, your IT, your marketing, your sales, your product, your fulfillment, your all of those things, right?
But as you grow, you know, in the beginning you'll have your first core team of probably 5 people and they'll fulfill each one of those functions.
You have somebody who helps you with, you know, delivery, you'll have somebody who helps you with, you know, finance, who does the bookkeeping, maybe somebody helps you with marketing, maybe that's you, somebody helps you with sales, etcetera, right.
6:05
And So what you can do is you can look at an apartment and say, what level am I involved here, right?
Real quick guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the words we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
6:27
And the only way we do that is if you.
Can rate and review.
And share this podcast.
So the single thing that has to do is you.
Can just leave.
Review by taking 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may.
Change the world.
For someone else.
And eventually the goal is that you can move right, move above right me equals, you know, CEO.
6:48
And so you have a team of leaders who are building the machine that builds the machine for you so that the actual whole thing works without your without you being there, besides providing the vision and strategic insight for making decisions, right.
And so for me, I define this within a business where I'm no longer on the Slack channel.
7:07
So in our portfolio companies, if I am no longer on the slack for that company, meaning no one can reach me besides the one person who's in charge for that company, That is what I believe is a truly delegated business that acts as a portfolio where you are actually an owner.
Right.
I can't tell you the amount of times I talk, like, I talk to entrepreneurs and they're like, Oh yeah, yeah, I could totally take this new project on.
7:26
Like, I've my, my business is totally systematized.
And I'm like, dude, like, no, it's not like your phone's blowing up twice since we've been on, like since we've been sitting here talking And like, yeah, I mean just because you don't have to respond to something in the moment, doesn't mean that you don't have to eventually respond to it or make a decision or etcetera, right.
7:43
Like those are things that are still levels of involvement that require your existence and presence.
And so for me it's if I'm not in the Slack channel, I have one meeting a week with one of our portfolio companies, the the manager, operator, etcetera, of a portfolio company.
And between that time and the next time, the company can continue to grow without my direct involvement.
8:04
That is what I would say is checking all the boxes for me.
And if something's not checking all the boxes, you can check all the boxes at a business level.
But you can also just look at this as a department level.
And the reason I think this is so important is that it can give you a grade that you can look at to improve.
So you might have marketing and you might have sales and then you might have product and then you might have shared services, which would be like IT, legal, HR, all that kind of stuff, right.
8:28
And you can look at yourself and and think, OK, do I have in sales, for example, do I have people who can?
Like, am I the one doing the sales?
OK, well, maybe I'm not doing the sales.
Well, I'm the one who's teaching people how to sell.
OK.
Well, have I built a machine that teaches people how to sell so that I don't have to do the teaching of selling, so I can actually just bring people in on a consistent basis and get them up to speed, right.
8:49
That's where you start looking at, like hiring 123 sales people a month, right.
And then you, you put them through the machine that builds salespeople, right.
And so you can look at these levels within each of the departments.
So maybe that's where your sales is at, right?
You've got a machine that builds the machine.
Awesome.
But is your marketing there, right?
9:05
Do you have a machine that builds the machine there or are you still doing or are you still teaching people?
Right.
Here's one of the the things that I think for me it took a long time to realize is that it's actually your strengths often times, which become almost always the bottleneck in the business because the things that you don't know, you're far more comfortable giving away to people so that they can build these things, right, because they have better expertise, because they know how to do teach, etcetera.
9:30
And that's where you as ACEO as an entrepreneur is you actually have to walk them through these things.
So it's like, OK, great.
You know how to do some whatever it is, the delivery of your product, you tell someone to do that, it's like, great.
Now I need you to teach someone else how to do that so we can build a team of people who are doing that so we can scale, right.
9:46
And then finally, at a certain point, it's like, man, I'm spending all my time teaching.
It's like, OK, well, we need to build the machine that does the teaching for you.
And so I think if you can think through this framework for each of the departments that you have in your company, you'll figure out where your bottlenecks are and it'll at least give you a grade.
And so every quarter you can look at your business on a little sheet like and think, OK, so do do do people know what to do?
10:05
Do we have the base skill?
OK, Do we have this sequence, the how to do it right, teaching people step by step how to do this process right and hold them accountable.
And then finally, can I find somebody who can help systematize and build the machine that builds the machine that recreates the skill over and over and over again in other people?
10:21
Right.
And so that's kind of the process.
And what's interesting, if you listen to Reed Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, he talks about the difficulty for most employees, most people, to jump these levels.
It's very difficult for most people, which is why, especially in like rapid growth companies, they'll often have to, you know, change out.
10:39
I'll say leadership with quotes here, just anyone who's in charge.
Because in the beginning, there's probably more managers and over time, there need to be leaders.
And a lot of times the managers, despite their tenure, aren't actually leaders, right.
And so when I'm looking at talent within our own business, I'm thinking, OK, who's a good individual contributor?
10:55
And sometimes good, amazing leaders are terrible individual contributors, and sometimes a lot, often times good individual contributors are terrible leaders, right.
And so it takes a very unique person, which is why being off first so hard is that you have to really master all of these levels so that you can recognize it and teach it to other people.
Because ultimately what we're doing is we have to walk the path that every person who's behind us must walk, which is why entrepreneurship is such a growth oriented occupation.
11:18
Like, you have to grow yourself in order to attract people who are at a certain level, right?
Like, imagine if you were to start working for somebody and you feel like way more than them, and that they're just have no idea what they're doing, right, then it's unlikely that you're going to be very influenced by that person.
They're not.
That person's not going to inspire you to do anything.
11:36
On the flip side, if you were to start working for somebody and you aspire to be like them, you like their character traits, you love the way they operate in their personal life and how they do business, etcetera, then that is somebody that you were being led by, right?
And so for us as entrepreneurs, like, a lot of times we have to think like, how can I improve my character?
What are the traits of mine that are deficient So that I can hopefully inspire people, that I can bring people in at this higher level and then actually be able to execute?
11:59
Because I can't tell you the amount of times I can't even like most entrepreneurs I talked, I'd say 95% of them are like, oh, my team's amazing.
I love my team, They're awesome.
And at the same time, they have all these horror stories about team mates.
And I can say like amount of times that I've talked to somebody, they said their team was awesome and I talked to them nine months later like, Oh no, no, that team wasn't awesome.
This team's awesome, right?
12:15
And I'm like, dude, you're you're the perspective, which you you make judgments is flawed.
And I don't believe anything you say because every time you've said this, it has been wrong.
So why would I believe differently now?
And so these are the levels that I think of for myself, my employees, departments and then ultimately the business.
This is just a different way of thinking through it.
12:31
Hopefully it's valuable for you.
If you have these frameworks, you can look at your own businesses, apply things faster and breakthrough the bottlenecks that you have so you can get to where you want to go.





0:00
99% of stuff I learned, I learned from doing.
A lot of times the masterminds will give you the context to learn where you are deficient more than they will solve the deficiency.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:20
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I get asked all the time and I want to address this because this is a misconception.
0:36
A lot of people think that I read books all day and I don't.
I bought a lot of books, I don't read many books.
And I was actually a kind of insecure about it because I get asked a lot because they're like you must read lots of books.
And honestly, I don't really.
And I people were like, you know a lot about stuff, which is thank you, don't feel that way, but appreciate it.
0:54
It's because I will read in targeted manners around problems that I need to solve.
And so if I need to learn about copywriting, I'll read four books on copywriting in a week.
But then I won't read anything for a very long time.
And then I'll be like, oh, I just encountered a problem that I really need to know more about.
And then I'll go really deep on the next topic, which is that little missing brick on my bridge to get me to where I want to go.
1:14
And So what I don't actually like, and this is going to probably be controversial, is that I don't like the whole, like, I read a book a week.
That's what I commit to.
Because what happens is you create a really good vehicle for mental masturbation.
There's really no difference between that and watching Ted Talks every day and watching YouTube videos.
Like, it's just another form of media that you're consuming.
1:31
And so, like, I can appreciate the intention behind it, but I don't think it serves most people.
The number of people that are like I'm on book 36 for this year and they're in the exact same position they were four years ago.
Mind Bogggles me because I would so much rather the person say I read four books and they were the only four books that I needed to read this year and I don't need to do anything else.
1:48
I just have to execute the stuff in this book.
And so when we're thinking about education in general, the one thing that you will need is the discernment to determine what thing you need to learn next.
That is the one lever on this whole equation of education that makes some people move really slowly and some people really quickly.
2:07
And so you have to know what thing to learn next.
And so I, like I said earlier, think about it like a pipeline of sequence of like, I got to have something to sell.
I got to get people to find out about it.
I got to learn how to sell.
Like, if you can do those three steps, you will be able to make money.
And if you don't know how to do one of those three things, then that's probably why you're not making money, besides the obvious of you're just not doing anything.
2:25
And so people ask me all the time, like, what things did you read to learn what you know.
Right.
Can you just give me a list of all the courses that you ever did?
All right.
So for me, I can tell you in sequence every expensive thing that I bought coaching wise, and I'm be really real with you.
2:43
It's not a lot.
And here's the real, here's the real.
And I and I love all the people I'm about to share.
All right, homies love them all 99% of the stuff I learned, I learned from doing all right.
And so a lot of times the masterminds will give you the context to learn where you are deficient more than they will solve the deficiency.
3:02
And So what we are paying for and what we are buying is perspective.
It's context.
And that's what most people lack, real talk.
So they might promise whatever, and that's fine.
I'm sure they'll have stuff and there's networking and things like that.
But the real thing that it gives you is the ability to identify where your problems are.
3:18
And then it's up to you to solve them because basically no one's going to do the work for you.
It's just it's just not going to happen.
And so you just have to get over that desire that someone's going to just like you.
You could pay money.
They're just going to give you money back.
It's not going to happen.
All right, stop.
You're going to have to do stuff, but you want to just make sure that you're doing the stuff that's driving towards where you're going and is not.
3:35
You just reinforcing a brick that doesn't need more enforcing on that bridge, right?
If you already have copywriting brick, you don't need to put six more bricks underneath of it.
You got that down.
You have this big hole here.
Fill that hole and you'll be able to get the dollar across the bridge.
And I see people who will spend years reinforcing one pillar on their bridge and never make the first dollar across because they don't have the perspective from which to choose where they are deficient.
3:58
OK.
So in order expensive stuff.
Besides that, I read targeted books and read articles and I watch YouTube videos, which I would say is still the vast majority of what I learned is the vast majority.
What got me started, I learn from doing real quick.
Guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram or something like that.
4:18
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do, that will mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there.
4:35
For another entrepreneur I had, I was in a mastermind for fitness from Sam Baxiar.
Rest in peace.
I learned what this digital marketing space was.
I don't even know it existed.
And so I learned what the term sales meant.
I didn't even know what this like.
I I didn't know what sales was just for context.
Like just if no matter where you're starting.
4:51
I didn't know what it was.
I didn't know what copywriting was.
I didn't know what, like, an e-mail list was.
And so I went to a mastermind.
YouTube, like, barely existed.
Then anyways, I went to that mastermind and I learned some of that stuff.
And then I bought a $3000 workshop on how to run Facebook ads for a weekend, and that was a lot of money for me at the time.
5:06
It was a lot of money for me at the time.
I didn't make any money over the weekend.
And that's the thing, is that I, you know, you can't expect the person to be a savior.
But I figured out enough to, like, understand how it worked conceptually.
And then I started running ads.
I started doing right.
And then I learned how that worked.
And then Click Funnels came out years ago, and I didn't know how to make landing pages.
5:23
So I was paying a guy to make my pages.
I was like, I got to learn how to do this.
And I remember what I did was I sat down on a Sunday.
I cleared my whole day, and I had a page that I wanted to copy.
I was like, I'm not even try again replicate before you iterate.
I was like, I'm just going to clone this page on this builder and I was like, it's probably going to take me the whole day or more.
5:41
I finished the whole thing in four hours.
And so I'd been, I'd been delaying, confronting how to learn how to build a webpage for at this point, almost three years.
I didn't want to learn how to build a webpage.
I was like, I'm not a tech guy, but I was like, I have to learn this and I sat down and I thought it was going to take the whole week, the whole day for sure.
5:59
And I was done by noon.
And I was like, Oh my God.
And The thing is, is there's so many skills like that, that there's all this sphere around it.
But if you just start pulling the thread, you start pulling the corner, all of a sudden your next step gets a lot clearer to you after you make the first step.
And so most people try and think that they have to figure out the 1st 1000 steps before they take the first one.
6:17
When in reality, think about yourself in the dark with a flashlight that's pointing a foot in front of you, and you take one step and then the next step gets clear.
And it's much easier to just pull the thread and get started and take the first step.
Then it's to try and figure out every step because you're afraid of failing, right?
So I did the I did the mastermind also with that one, I worked for the guy for free for three months, and you're like, Alex, I'll work for you for three months.
6:41
The difference was the skills that I had applied there.
I already was really in shape.
I already knew a lot about nutrition, and I knew a lot about training.
And I worked for him at his gym, All right?
And so for me, for him, I had value to provide, right?
I get asked all the time.
Like, dude, I'll, I'll get your coffee.
6:56
I'll do whatever.
I'm like, I'll pay someone who's not going to ask me questions to go get me coffee.
I'm going to be real with you because you want to just suck up two hours of my day every day and do it for free.
You're free is too expensive.
It's overpriced.
And so that's, by the way, exactly what Ben Graham said to Warren Buffett.
7:12
When Warren Buffett asked to work for Ben Graham for free, Ben Graham said you're overpriced.
Context.
So I I did the mastermind.
I did the workshop.
I worked for him and I showed up.
When he showed up, I showed up at the gym at 4:00 AM because that's when he showed up and he worked till four.
So he worked 12 hours a day and I worked with him.
7:28
And then after four, I still kept working at the gym and I did that.
And then from there I learned how to start a gym and that's how I started my first gym.
I'm trying to think I went to Traffic and Conversion Summit.
That's when I learned about Click Funnels and that's when I learned about the web page thing.
I was like 2 something years later.
And then from there that was kind of what got me into the direct marketing world.
7:49
And then I started.
I read almost all of those, you know, this free books people give away.
I read all of them, like all of the guys books, which is why I'm so passionate about books for me, because books like as much as I said, I don't read on a regular basis.
I read targeted during seasons of my life.
8:06
If I'm trying to get context on an industry, I'm only reading in a very specific segment.
I'm not reading like a book on how the one thing and then like how to make friends and influence people, which if you're 18, you should totally read that because you need to figure out how to talk to people.
But like I need to learn about direct response.
And so I learned, I I swallowed all that.
8:24
And then I think the next thing I I did was I paid a guy one-on-one $750 an hour to teach me how to run Facebook ads.
And so I learned that in more depth because I learned like a basic understanding.
But he learned, I taught, he taught me how to do, like, pixels and retargeting and audiences and all that.
And I didn't know how to do any of that stuff.
And then from there, I I joined Russell's Mastermind, and I didn't even have an online business.
8:43
And that's when I learned about, like, the online world.
So I learned about, like, the direct response world.
And then I learned about, like, the online marketing world and like digital products and and information and education stuff.
Like learned.
I learned about that world there.
And just for context, like, I never logged into any of the stuff that I was given access to.
8:59
I got exposed to people who broadened my thinking and got me to think in bigger increments.
And that was the biggest gift.
And that's hopefully the biggest gift I can hopefully give anybody on the channels.
Just thinking in larger increments, if you can do that, you can change your life because you stop paying attention to stuff that's small potatoes.
9:15
And like, the biggest difference between rich dads and poor dads is that rich dads teach their kids to think in bigger increments.
They're like, hey man, I got this thing on the weekend that's going to make me like 100 bucks.
It's like rich dad kids don't do it because they're going to.
Like I'm going to wait till I find the thing that makes me 10 grand.
9:31
It's a choice.
It's the decision making.
Like that's the biggest gift of of being raised around rich people is that they just don't waste their time on things that aren't worth it.
That's the gift, right?
It's not, It's not like some good old boys club.
It's the perspective which they see opportunity and leverage.
9:48
They're like, oh dude, I'm not going to open a dry cleaning store.
Nothing wrong with that.
So like I'm not going to do that.
I'm going to get into, I'm going to get into real estate, I'm going to, I'm going to get into into sales, I'm going to get into finance because those are bigger leverage opportunities.
So that was a misconception I wanted to clear up is that I have not bought a tremendous amount of information, things that were high ticket, but the ones that I did buy and that was I think the last thing I really bought that was expensive, I mean and then I bought and then I'll buy hours from people.
10:13
I do that all the time.
If I can buy time from somebody, I'll pay whatever.
I probably paid 10 different people 10,000 an hour or more.
Every single one of them was worth it.
So recommend.








0:00
Big shit takes time, and I had to learn that.
Like, I want you to feel that because it took me a long time to learn what I see happen all the time with entrepreneurs, especially when they applied acquisition.com.
You know they've got $1,000,000 in profit.
Maybe it's the bare minimum for for us to consider for investment and they're like, here's my idea for how I would expand and how I want your help.
0:16
I want to start all these new product lines because I've already saturated my market because I'm spending $50,000 in Facebook ad and I can't spend any more than I currently am.
Otherwise I lose the profitability of the ads.
So I'm going to start selling more and different offers and add massive complexity to my business that only makes $3,000,000 top line per year.
0:32
That is a mistake.
And in this video I'm going to walk through why.
And the reason this is so important is because many people hit this first plateau and then think, oh, I should start a new business.
Oh, I should start a new product line when really they need to confront the problem ahead, which is they don't know how to get more customers within their current niche or space.
0:49
Your market isn't capped.
Your mindset is capped.
What I'm going to do is break down the three different frameworks I used to think through this so that you are never capped in whatever market you go after.
Number one, from the marketing perspective, you have your method, which is the biggest thing you do.
It's running paid ads, it's making content, it's doing outreach, it's getting referrals, it's getting affiliates.
1:09
Those are the methods that you do to get customers.
Underneath of that, you've got the platforms that you do that method on.
You've got Facebook, you've got phones, e-mail, Hulu, YouTube, you've got Google app underneath the vet, you've got the media on the platform.
So if I'm on Instagram, I can go Instagram DMS, I can go Instagram Stories, I can go Instagram posts, I can go Instagram reels.
1:27
I have all these different media within the platform.
One level below that is how much volume am I doing within that media?
Am I posting one story a day, one story a week, multiple stories a day, multiple posts a day?
So like that chiropractor agency, if there are 100 other agencies that market to chiropractors and they're all marketing on Facebook, then you could probably add up all of the ad spend of every one of those agencies together.
1:50
And that just gives you an idea of how much there is available in terms of numbered new clients per month that all of them together are selling just on Facebook ads.
Rewind real quick if you're trying to pick what market you're going to go in.
I talk about this in my book, $100 Offers.
There's four things I want to look at #1 are they in pain?
2:06
Am I actually solving a problem for someone, #2 are they easy to find?
Because I can't find them, I can't sell them right?
#3 Do they have the money to spend in order to buy my thing?
Because if I'm trying to sell to broke people is probably not going to be a good idea #4.
Are they growing?
I don't want to be selling to newspapers.
I want to be selling to something like old people that are.
2:22
There's more of them every single day that are retiring.
If I have a market that checks all four of those boxes, then I know I'm at least in a good opportunity.
Now once I have that in place and I looked at the four variables that I talked about earlier, can I do a new method?
Can I do it on a new platform?
Can I expand to multiple types of media within the platform I'm currently on?
2:38
Can I increase the volume that I'm currently doing in the mediums that I have?
These are the things you could do immediately to get more customers, get more leads.
Today let's say you've capped all of those things which is probably not true, but let's say you did because we're going into fantasyland here.
I'm going to introduce you to what I call the pyramid of markets.
2:58
There are five directions that you can go in any marketplace to expand.
I'll tell you a story of when I learned this, I went to this meet up of eight entrepreneurs together we were doing $500 million a year in revenue.
This is like a multi billion dollar room which is kind of cool and I was one of the smallest guys there.
3:13
I think I was doing 30 ish million a year at the times and they were talking about their businesses.
I was like, these guys aren't smarter than me and I didn't feel like they worked any harder than me.
I was like why are they making so much more money than two main factors #1 almost all of them have been in business longer than me.
Big shit takes time and I had to learn that.
Like, I want you to feel that because it took me a long time to learn, right?
3:31
There's not many billionaires under 30 that made it themselves like 10 in the whole fucking world.
There's not a lot of them.
And fact checkers, maybe it's 20, it's not a lot.
The second lesson that I learned is that all of them were going after bigger markets than I was because at a certain point you do saturate A niche and I'm going to give you context to what that means.
3:48
So Jim Launch was a licensing company.
We specifically at the time only focused on micro gyms.
Now we do health clubs and micro gyms because they expanded the market within that pie.
There was only 50,000 micro gyms, United States.
We'd already spoken with 20,000 of them.
We had absolutely have really maximized every media, every channel.
4:05
We cold call, we cold e-mail Quinto, yet we run at some Google, we runs on YouTube, we runs on Facebook, we runs on Instagram.
We make content like we do all the stuff and we have really done a good job of building a market leading business there.
But again, it wasn't as big as theirs and that's why we decided to open up another Ave.
Now let me tell you about why we decided to do health clubs.
4:21
So when we looked at our adjacent markets, we could have gone down market to personal trainers, we could have gone up market to health clubs, we could have gone to physical therapists or chiropractors, actually very similar or we could have gone more narrow.
Those are the directions we could have gone in.
I asked our team one question.
4:37
I said of these different potential avenues or avatars that we could pursue, who do we provide the most value to buy dollars made?
It was no contest.
Health club owners, we are able to immediately make them like 10s of thousands of dollars within the first like month by restructuring some of the things that we could do within their business and then doubling or tripling their bottom line by reorganizing their onboarding process, reorganizing their sales process, how they handle retention and how they handle upsell.
5:01
So if you deal with hair salons, maybe you sell consulting service, you sell to salon owners, that's your current market.
You can go in five directions, #1 is you can go up market.
That means on the pyramid there are fewer people on the higher part of the market and they cost more but they spend more typically higher quality customers.
5:18
That's where you go into enterprise sales.
We're talking franchisors as in people who have hundreds of locations under one umbrella or multi location or chain owner that's up market for salon owners down market.
The second direction you can go is you go to hair stylist.
You talk about people who are renting chairs and doing hair with their hands full time not running the business.
5:38
There's 10 times more of them.
The third direction you can go is you can go adjacent.
So what's something that's similar in nature but not exactly the same.
That would be like a lash and nails place if I were a chiropractor.
It might be physical therapy, like they're similar but different.
You want similar business characteristics, similar avatar in terms of the owner, similar types of customer within the same larger industry.
5:59
When you do that, you just open up another vertical and you attack it the same way you did your first one.
The fourth direction you can go is you actually go broader.
Now imagine a pyramid that's all the way like this and it includes all the adjacent pyramids within it, which would then just be beauty.
So that includes Med spa owners, lash owners, massage studio, like all of that kind of falls the same psychographic, they serve the same customer.
6:22
So that would be going broader if we wanted to really open up the net.
The last direction you can go is the only one that makes your market smaller, but it doesn't necessarily mean you make less money.
You could become narrower.
Instead of just being all salon owners, it might be salon owners who specialize in extensions or a blow hair place.
6:39
You know, they just do the Brazilian blowouts like they're just doing that specific thing.
Often times when you do niche down, sometimes you can still make more money.
Because if you're not even close to tapping the methods, the platform, the media, or the total amount of volume you need to do to reach all of those people within that niche.
6:54
And so then when you niche down, become more specific with your messaging, your offer and the value deliver.
Because if you can make this one specific avatar 10 times more money than the broad avatar, you should absolutely niche down on that.
And we've done this with companies and doubled or tripled or sometimes 5X the revenue of the business despite cutting down who they market to by like 85% by getting really specific about who we serve best.
7:16
Big picture, zooming all the way back out.
If right now you're not getting as many leads as you want and you think that your market is saturated because of what you do, you should be looking the way an investor looks at the marketplace and says this is a $60 billion industry.
I have not even 1% of this industry.
7:32
My whole point here is you have your four initial levers that you can immediately pull to grow how many leads you're getting.
And you probably haven't even done one of them, Do one of them, do another one of them, and then eventually try and do them all.
Usually there's this big checklist that you probably already know as an entrepreneur of what I call the should do.
7:47
I know I should be calling Elise faster.
I know I should be following up better.
I know I should be making more content.
I know I should start a cold call thing.
I know I should be running ads on more platforms.
But you're not.
And if you're like, man, that's gonna take a long time.
Welcome to the main point I had originally, which is it takes time to build big shit.


0:00
I am a big believer in sales being an actual empowerment conversation because if you're talking to an empowered decision maker who's informed, that's the only person you want to talk to.
And I believe a well structured sales conversation can increase the number of people who are that person.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:24
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Welcome back, everybody.
This person sitting across from me, he's been on the show before.
You guys all went nuts when he was on, but I got to tell you, he's probably the person whose content I share the most on the planet because I think it's that good.
0:45
I really, really like a lot of people in the business space.
I admire and listen to very few.
And he is risen up the list for me of the people that I admire and I listen to the most because his content is so good.
1:04
His message is so good because it's based in actual results and actual experience.
My guest today is Alex Hermozi.
Welcome back brother.
Thank you for having me and such a gracious introduction.
I just to apologize ahead of time to the audience.
1:21
There's no way I will live up to that.
But I'll do my absolute heart.
I'll try my heart.
He will. 15 minutes in, he will have exceeded it.
By the way, he's got a new book out called $100 Million Leads, How to Get Strangers to Want to Buy Your Stuff and I think it's the book launch.
1:36
I told you this off camera.
I've heard the most about ever.
He had a few people participate in it.
How many do you have?
Tell him.
Yeah, we had 500,000 people who signed up for the event.
We had just under 200,000 who clicked to join live the moment we we launched.
It was it was wild.
It was a whole city.
1:52
And I said to him, I said, well, how'd you do it?
He go?
Actually, I did the stuff in the book.
Yeah, give us a couple specifics of what that means.
I'm.
Going to give a little bit more context and I'll give the the better answer.
So $100 million offers, which is my first book was an offer about making a proposition to somebody that they would say yes to.
So how to make offer so good people feel stupid saying no.
2:07
And the first question that you need to answer when you're entrepreneur is what do I sell right and sell you make an offer and that's why that was the first book And so the offer book itself was I would consider a meta book as in it both.
The goal was that I demonstrate the concept while also with the book while also teaching about it in the book.
2:23
And so the book itself I I permitted for $1.99 and it came with a course that most people charge $5000 for and I gave that away for free and did no paid advertising whatsoever.
And it continues to sell 25,030 thousand copies a month this month.
2:39
Obviously way more than that because the launch and what not.
But but it does more every month than it did the month before.
And it's still top 102 years later.
Now the next book answers the next question.
So once you have something to sell, then you're like, well, who do I sell it to as you need leads?
And so that was why the second book is $100 million leads.
2:55
And so leads mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but most people agree that they're the first thing that you need to have to get new customers.
And so the thing that creates a lead.
And when I was trying to go through this book, I was like, what is a lead?
And so I had a buddy of mine ask me that question and I I stumbled for I was like, you know, a lead.
3:13
And he was like, no, what's a lead?
And so I was like, you know, it's a, it's someone that you, you know, you get name, phone number, e-mail address.
And he's like, OK, if someone follows you on Instagram and you can message them, are they a lead?
I was like, well, yeah, I guess they would be a lead.
And he's like, OK, well, if I subscribe to YouTube am IA lead, then I was like, no, I I guess I guess not.
3:34
It wouldn't because I can't, I can't contact you in any way.
And so we started going through all these things.
If someone, if I knock on someone's door, are they elite?
Right.
And so we start going through it.
And so we come up with a lead is a person you can contact.
Now from there you're like, well, there's a lot of people I can contact, which then gave me the conclusion that it what people say they want is leads, but what they really want are engaged leads, which is a person you can contact comma who's shown interest in the stuff you sell.
3:56
Would you call it qualified lead?
That would be the next level.
So yeah, if you're looking on the lead continue, you've got an unengaged lead, engaged lead, a qualified lead and then, yeah, and then you go to customer and whatnot and so.
So then the question is how do you go from an unengaged lead to an engaged lead?
And that one, that one flip just from there to there is the entire book after that point where someone raises their hand and says I'm interested in your stuff, That is where the book ends.
4:18
And so I wanted to show people how to get strangers to want to buy their stuff, not to buy it because that would be sales, but how to want to buy their stuff.
And so in going through this, we made two, four boxes and this took.
It's awesome A. 100 iterations to get it here.
Last night.
It's awesome.
It was really hard.
4:34
It like as crazy as it sounds because of it, I came into it with a lot of the preconceived.
It was like what about earned media?
What about owned media?
Like I had all these and I had to deconstruct everything into simply you can talk to people one-on-one and you can talk to people one to many.
And there are people who know who you are before you talk to them and there are people who don't and those are the those are the four variables.
4:52
So if you're 1 to 1 to friendlies, that's a warm reach out.
If you're 1 to 1 to strangers, it's a cold reach out.
If you're 1 to many to friends, it's when you post content.
It's your audience who knows you, and if you're going to 1 to many to people who don't know you, it's paid ads.
Gosh, that's good.
5:07
OK.
And so those are the only four ways that a person can let other people know about stuff, anything at all.
Like if a girl's like, I just slept with six guys, she's advertising what she did.
She let people know about it.
Right.
And so advertising is the process of making known.
That's how we define it.
And so then you're like, well, if those are the only four things that I can do to let other people know my stuff, are those the only four ways to advertise?
5:27
And so the answer is kind of like yes and no, because the other four are what I call lead getters.
And so lead getters are people who let other people know on your behalf.
And so they are where you get the greatest amount of leverage in advertising.
Because for example, if I were to say, OK, I'm going to hire a recruiter who brings me affiliates every month, and so I hire one person.
5:51
So I do whatever amount of work it takes me to hire one person and then I go and I sip my ties on the beach, which we know that's not true.
But just for the example, now that person works every hour, every day, bringing affiliates in, and then those affiliates, then either they do one of the core four, they reach out to their friends, they reach out to strangers, they post content, or they make ads to their audience to tell them about my stuff for money free stuff or both.
6:13
That's the incentive.
And so that is an example of a lead getter and how one day's work might create zillions of dollars on the back end by just having leverage, getting more for what I put in.
And so there are four, the 1st is customers, so you do the core. 4 going to ask you.
Yeah.
You do the Core 4 to get a customer.
6:30
Now that customer can then do the Core 4 again to get you other customers.
Do you feel that there is a priority among others?
In other words, when you were saying it, I'm like customer might be the.
Best one for sure.
The reason I would say customer is more important isn't as much about the customer, but about what would make a customer want to refer is typically an exceptional product.
6:47
And so if you have a better product like you can incentivize any affiliate if you put a product or better experience, right, exactly.
So I'll, I'll quickly go through the four lead getters and then and then I'll explain the whole cycle in in total.
So you have customers, you have affiliates which I talked about just a second ago, which looks like a customer referral, but it's a little different because it's a, it's another business who refers their customers to you.
7:07
You've got agencies who can do the core for on your behalf, they can run as, they can post content, they can do outreach all for you because there are agencies who do all those things and then you have employees.
So like, I didn't, I don't make my content.
I have a team of people who make content for me.
And so you can see how the first four things are the only things a human can do to let other people know about stuff to advertise.
7:27
The other four are the people you get from advertising who can then do the advertising on your behalf.
And so the long winded answer for like, how did I get 500,000 people there is that I purposefully took the 24 months leading up to that because once offers launched, everything was about lead.
7:43
So I knew that the audience didn't know that, but everything that I was doing was knowing that in 20-4 months I was going to have my next book come out.
And so I wanted to use every tactic or method in the book to advertise, to advertise the book.
So that's the whole meta concept.
The first was I had to make a meta offer.
8:00
Like the book itself was an amazing offer, so good people were so stupid and saying no.
And then $100 million leads.
I wanted to get as many strangers to want to buy my stuff using warm outreach, cold outreach, posting content, running paid ads, getting customer referrals, affiliates, agencies and employees.
8:17
And so you launch.
Itself as validation of the book itself, yes.
Keep going.
And so the thing that always grinds my gears and I think what I've I've strived really hard to do with the content that I make, etcetera, is that I always want the proof to be undeniable.
8:33
And so, like I I started the presentation for the book launch with this little picture of a book that says how to market a book.
And it has 14 reviews on Amazon and whoever wrote this book.
I hope I'm not just like, just destroying you.
That's not my goal.
I blacked out the name.
I don't know who it is, but I don't need to read the book because I already have evidence that the person doesn't know how to market a book because if they knew how to market a book, they wouldn't have 14 reviews.
8:53
So like, I have real world evidence that the contents of the book are irrelevant.
And so I wanted to do the exact opposite of that, which is if you're going to have a book about advertising, it should be advertised better than anything.
And so that was exactly what I wanted to do, was just lean really hard on that and purposefully use only the things that I have in the book.
9:11
And so which was actually kind of fun for me.
So like when we, when we scripted out the ads, I have an ad ad creation framework that I just, I just used the framework that I introduced in the book only and with the affiliates I had the, the structure that I set up in the book I used only like I called talk, whisper, tee shot, which is kind of like the method that you do to launch anything or at least that I used to launch anything.
9:32
You know, like we used agencies when we didn't have to because I wanted to have an agency run it.
So I could talk about that.
And then obviously, the team did all the content and so we used all 8 methods to promote the book.
And then that is what resulted in, we had 137,000 people came from pay dads, we had 104,000 people who came from affiliates.
9:47
We had 27,000 affiliates sign up to promote the book launch.
We had, we had just under with.
So just sorry, just over 200,000 people came from content and then we had, what am I missing?
And then referrals.
The rest were referrals.
Do you, by the way, everyone hearing this right now, it's amazing to me.
10:07
Obviously the detail of the book and all of that is one thing.
The other thing is that how many people, all the concepts you just described to them, even if they were at the book launch, is still foreign of them, meaning they still look at business almost like a linear transaction.
In other words, they're this is a simple analogy.
10:24
Look, here's how I got wealthy.
I don't play checkers in business.
I'm playing chess.
I've got multiple moves that I'm already making in front of the other one that set up something else.
Most people are like, I just got to get this client and then once I get that, I'll breathe out loud and then I'm going to go through this arduous, grinding, debilitating, horrific, self loathing process to get one more right, the power of one more.
10:49
That's what Ed Mylett says.
And do you agree with that though?
Does it still blow your mind how many people still don't get progressive marketing that stacks on top of one another?
Funnel is a terrible word, but there's multiple funnels happening here, meaning you've got the affiliate funnel, you've got the paid ad funnel.
11:06
If you choose to do it that way, you've got your content or client referral funnel.
But most people in their businesses, there's still what you just did is so brilliant, it's like washing over them Still, even of the half a million people that were there, you and I know this, it's they, they, they're picturing how business works fundamentally incorrectly.
11:26
Would you agree with that?
I think so.
And I think part of it is, so I would say it's more like a like at least from my perspective like an incomplete picture.
So they they they can usually you can only see as far as like what's in front of you.
And so if you are barely making rent, you know what I mean and you're barely making payroll, it's really difficult to think about brand, you know what I mean?
11:47
And so it doesn't make it less important though, but it's just really hard.
And so you know for at least the the prescription that I have in the book for advertising is pick one method.
You can pick warm reach outs, you can pick cold reach outs, you can pick, you can pick making content, you can pick running paid ads and those are all the things that you can do.
12:05
And I start there because most people reading anything in business are usually the ones doing it for the most part.
And so we start with the core four that a person can do, but of course all four work Better Together.
Now you can just do cold calls and you can, you can build a business.
You can, just from paid ads, you can build a business.
12:22
But if you do cold calls, run ads and have content that people consume, when they click your ad, they consume some content and then they complete the transaction.
Or you do a cold call.
They take the set call and between the set and the close, they go to your profile, They read some stuff, they watch a video and they're like this guy's legit.
12:37
Now if you didn't have that, the likely that you close them would be way lower, but you would attribute the failed close to bad cold calling.
But you could have given the assist with brand, with content let.
Me ask you a hard question I bet.
I bet no one's asked this and if they have, cool.
But I was thinking at your work and it like I was going through all of it last night again and I was thinking, OK, I want to ask them the tough stuff, like the stuff no one's going to ask them in an interview.
13:01
I want 2 entrepreneurs pushing one another to figure this out, even together.
OK, So what if the sale cycle of your product is different?
Does that dictate which way you should go?
So let me give you an example.
I'm marketing a book that's a tangible product that can be acquired instantaneously.
Let's switch it.
Let's make it a hard one.
13:17
I'm a realtor.
I'm in the mortgage business.
I'm in the insurance business.
This sale cycle is a little bit different.
It's not necessarily A to B, bam, we've got a client.
Does that change your methodology?
And let's walk through a real world one.
I'm a realtor, let's use the what I think is maybe the hardest one to make the application fit on some cycles.
13:36
Do you pick a lane, all of the lanes?
And does that matter that the product isn't a consumable can of Coca-Cola or a bottle of water, but it's a transaction experience that you're going to have to go through in the sales cycle?
I.
Don't think it would matter at all.
OK so if we were to just let's fill in the fill in the boxes if we if we also like if you're a realtor, warm outreach is going to be you reaching out to your friends and family saying do you know anybody who's interested in buying a house.
14:01
Now ideally you probably not start with that because that's what every realtor says.
So it might be something like hey what's your dream home or something like that and then you can start talking about something more interesting.
Believe me I'm not in the real estate space so hopefully there'll be a better hook but that would be the idea.
Cold reach out says you're you're just dialing numbers that are close to your cold emailing or you know that is that is cold reach out.
14:20
If you're making content, you're talking about the houses that you're selling and many Realtors do that and then you have paid ads, which also plenty of Realtors either generate buyer or seller leads that they call and then they can help them sell their house.
So either they list houses and they show these you know, six or seven carousels of cool houses and they get buyers or they talk about recent sales and then and use them as case studies for like here's the 17 steps in the process.
14:42
We took this house from the owner, thought they could sell for 500, I sold it for 575 and this was the 60 day process we ran through.
If that sounds interesting, I can walk you through what I would do for your house, whatever.
So that would be the core 4.
But a good realtor should also have friends who are ancillator to the industry.
So it might be, you know, lawn care people.
14:59
It might be.
I know there's regulations around loans and kickbacks and things like that, but like still cleaners, anybody who's does home services, you can still get referrals from them, which would be an affiliate.
Right now customer referrals is you sell the house and you ask them for friends or before you sell the house, you ask them for friends.
15:15
Or sometimes they just do it on their own because they actually like you and you did a good job, right.
From an agency perspective, you could hire agencies to do any of those things.
And then if you have, if you're a bigger realtor, you have a team of people, then you can use your employees to do any of those things on your behalf.
And so the core for and the four lead getters work independent of whatever business you have, because they are simply the only ways that one human can tell other human about stuff.
15:37
It's a fact.
So let me give you an example.
I have several homes listed right now, just different things I'm doing.
I'm just thinking through what you just said.
One of the homes I have listed, they literally knocked on my door as a cold call.
And the fact that they did that, they make a lot of money too.
I was like, this is my lady.
So that's one of them.
The other one I have, an interior designer referred me, the realtor that is now listing my house isn't that interesting?
15:58
And the third one just literally had a digital footprint that I saw their digital footprint went to their brand was validated by other significant properties they had sold and they're listing that property.
So what he just said, I just gave you in my own life validation of all three of those methods right there off the top that I'm currently using currently in the MLS with three people in that industry exactly the way that he just described.
16:20
But I wanted to push you to describe it first, because that's the theory.
Here's why I think you're this way too.
There's validation, and then I want to push the theory to the extreme.
Most difficult measure to see whether it's passes though taken on water test and that's what it does for me.
16:37
Real quick guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the words.
We can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
16:57
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take 10 seconds or one type of the top.
It would mean the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
Number one thing I want to ask you, someone's an entrepreneur, they're listening to this and they're not getting enough leads in general.
17:15
And they're they're literally thinking that what I'm going to do is I'm going to continue to do just posting stuff on my Instagram over and over again, and people are going to magically appear.
If there's one step now I should take to change my tactic, first thing I should do aside from get the book.
17:31
Get the book would be what?
So if I needed to make money tomorrow and I was that guy, it's the first of the Core 4 in the book, which is warm outreach.
And So what that means is I go through my e-mail and I look at every single contact that I already have already in my e-mail list.
I open up my iPhone or my Android, and I go down my contact list and I download that and I export it.
17:52
And then I look at every one of my social media profiles.
I've got 700 followers on Instagram.
I've got, you know, 400 friends on Facebook.
And I list out all the people into one Mondo Excel sheet that is my first leads list.
And I reach out to them and I open with something that has nothing to do with my profession, which usually has something to do with their life.
18:12
And so I take the 30 seconds before I message everyone because you only have a fixed amount of people.
And I would say what's new in Sarah's life?
Sarah just had a kid.
Sarah just moved.
Sarah just had a baby.
Sarah just competed in a Tough Mudder, whatever.
And then that would be my opener.
And then then it's house things, right.
18:29
And then once you have house things, then you transition, you can, you can move the conversation into whatever direction you want.
If I'm selling fitness, I would say, Oh, well, how do you have time to, you know, cook, cook food and and get in shape If, if it was, you know, I was career coaching, I'd be like, how are you making time for work and your career goals?
18:45
If I was talking about if I was selling therapy, I would say, like, how's your mental state with like, crushing all these goals?
But like, are you taking time for yourself?
Like, I could, you know what I mean?
Like, I could sell anything from once.
I just know once I have their attention and we use something I call the ACA framework, which we learn from the gym world.
But it works with anything.
19:00
It's really just how to talk to a human being.
But just acknowledge whatever they said, compliment them on a legitimate compliment and then ask the next question.
There's a lot of people just don't know how to have a conversation.
And so whenever someone says, you know, I, you know, I did the Tough Mudder.
I would say it's so cool that you did the Tough Mudder compliment, which would then say something like that's like that's so tough of you.
19:24
You know, it's so cool that you take that time to to push yourself.
You must be that type of person.
I would label them with something that I want to use later in the sale.
And then so and then the ask is let me move the conversation forward, right.
And so that is I then have my big list of every single contact that I have and I start with the open hook that's personalized to them and then I move them through ACA and then I set them up for a 10 minute qualification call of some sort just to make sure that they like whatever it is and then I'll set up for a real conversation.
19:53
So and if you're curious, what does that 10 minute call look like?
Yes, it's so I use something called the closer framework.
It's not that this is the perfect way to sell, it's just it's a it's a simple acronym that I used to organize sales scripts and so.
C is clarify why they're there, right?
Because they got on the phone for a reason or they decided to respond back to you for a reason.
20:11
And so it's the first obstacle that comes up in any sale.
Someone says I just wanted more information.
Well, no, they didn't.
They got there because they have a problem.
Like you're not just hopping on phone calls for information all day.
Of course you're not, right?
Like you can make that joke if you want to.
Really good.
Right.
And it's like, well, what?
Because then you just clarify like what problem do you want to solve like 6 months from now, what do you want to have happen?
20:29
And then then the person's like, well, I, you know, I can't fit in my genes anymore.
You're like, right.
Boom.
They have clarified whether they're there, Then you restate it with L, label them with a problem.
So to be clear, you're not the way you want to be.
You're currently how much?
200.
What would you like to be?
My high school weight?
What's that 130?
20:45
Got it.
Gap.
OK, cool.
So then we go CL.
Now we go to O.
So this is the closer framework.
O is overview their past experiences.
This is what I call the pain cycle.
So you say, what have you tried so far?
How did that work for you?
What did you like?
What did you not like?
Whenever they say the things that they like, you mental note of that, so that when you present your solution, you're going to talk about and tie the things that they liked about.
21:05
It part of their buying map.
Uh huh.
And then the pain part is where they're like, this was terrible, it's too hard to follow, they didn't pay attention to me, no one followed up, blah blah blah.
And so then it's like, what else have you tried?
And so we just keep doing until we've exhausted all the pain.
And whenever you bring up past experiences, it always aggravates and increases importance.
21:23
Like in in the political world.
Whatever the new cycle is on, people will say is the most important issue of the election.
And it's really just whatever the media chooses to, whatever piano key they want to play on everyone's emotions that month.
But it works the same way on a micro level, on a sale.
So whatever you're talking about, the pain cycle is going to be the thing that they now think is more important.
21:39
Even my health is more important.
Maybe my the cleanliness in my house is more, maybe I do need insurance, like whatever it is, right.
And so in a set call, we stop there.
So you basically go clarify label over read the past experiences, they're in the middle of pain.
And you're like, I think I can totally help you.
I don't have time right now.
21:55
Let's put a much, 'cause this is like a cold, like basically it's a set call.
Now if someone has, if, if you're, if you're selling a smaller ticket thing, then you can go cradle to grave, right?
You can go to clay to close if you want to.
But if you're selling an insurance product you're trying to buy, you know, get them to do a house or do it a longer sale, then cool, then let me put some stuff together for you so I can give you a much more informed answer.
22:14
But I think we can really.
Help you?
Can I ask you a question before you do that?
Do you get any commitment from them?
Like if I can end up helping you or you open to me solving the solution for you?
Or do you not get any hook closed at that point?
Yeah, we called the integrity tie down.
Yeah.
So yeah, yes, we have we have this big checklist that we call the lead nurture checklist, but it's like 17 things that we that we do whatever like we take on a portfolio company, we always look at their show rates on appointments and we can usually take all show rates even in the coldest prospects to 85%.
22:39
But it's it's like everyone's like what's the There isn't one thing you have to do like 17 things that each bump you by 5:00 to 7:00.
Percent, but I like it.
So you're going to end the conversation there with some probably minor commitment calls that if you can solve the problem, they're going to move forward when you get back.
Together, 100%.
And so then when you go to the second call, we still go through CLO again and you'll be like again, you're like sure will and you just dive a little bit deeper into all of them and then you go SER.
23:02
So S is sell the vacation and I use this acronym, this moniker because I say you want to sell the vacation on the plane flight.
And so a lot of people, when they, when they want to sell stuff, they talk about the widgets, right?
They talk about TSA, They talk about checking their bag and taking their shoes off and who they're going to sit next to on the plane and the seat and how long the flight's going to be and the modules and the services and whatever.
23:22
But people just want Maui.
Yes.
And so you should be describing the beach and the ocean and that what they're going to experience the moment they get into the hotel room, right?
And they can open up the the curtains and they look out the window like that's what we should be describing, not how they're going to get there.
So you sell the vacation and then ER is explaining what their concerns.
23:38
So once you sell their vacation that's when you make the ask.
And then E&R is OK if they don't say yes immediately.
Totally reasonable.
Most people don't expect no yeah train for no because that's where you make the money And then we explain what their concerns.
And so, you know, for for us, I, I train on three major obstacles, which is they they correspond to the distortions of reality from Doctor Albert Ellis.
24:05
And so you've got people who are upset at the universe, so circumstances you that's on the outer outermost layer and then the next level underneath.
And this is like an onion.
So if someone says no and they say time, money, this isn't the perfect fit for me.
All of those are circumstantial.
And that's the easiest thing to say.
24:21
And that's the first thing people say when they say no.
The second level underneath of that is other people.
So first people are upset and distorted about the universe.
Everything's unfair.
Nothing goes my way.
The next level is because of insert person.
The blame finger goes out, My kids, my husband, my Co workers, my mom, whatever it is, won't let me do this thing.
24:41
And so they put all the power in the other person.
And so we have to break that apart and get somebody who's in power who can actually make a decision.
And usually I am a big believer in sales being an actual empowerment conversation because if you're talking to an empowered decision maker who's informed, that's the only person you want to talk to.
24:58
And I believe a well structured sales conversation can increase the number of people who are that person agreed And so the final layer, the deepest one is, is themselves, right.
And so they they have their own fears that they have to overcome and doubts about what's going to happen.
25:16
And so we work through those those layers until we eventually have a person who has now made a decision.
And so when we can do that, I'm a big believer in like try and get yes and no not not to be, not to be like hard closing, but just so that if someone doesn't give a decision then we want to walk them through how they make decisions so that they can make a decision about your product.
25:37
And so as we're going through, so that's that was basically just like the explain away concerns.
And then finally R is that the person says yes and you reinforce the decision.
And so a certain percentage of sales especially in high, high volume transactional sales organizations, people back out, they get cold feet etcetera.
25:53
And So what we try and do is the moment someone closes, we want the next 24 hours to be unbelievably choreographed.
And so, like, when we're talking immediate, so the moment they sign or the moment the credit card goes through, they get a text from the onboarding person or we do a warm hand off like, hey, this is Shirley Shirley's going to be taken from here, like I said earlier.
26:09
And So what we want to always do is set expectations, meet expectations, set expectations, meet expectations.
And I have changed my tune about this.
I used to always say over deliver, but I've I've come to the point now where I genuinely believe that if you just keep your word.
You nailed it.
They will trust you more And ideally and this is a little hack for everyone, OK.
26:29
If you're any any type of services business, let's say you're an agency that does SEO whatever and it takes you 14 days to on ramp somebody rather than saying we're going to touch in every week, right.
Which would be fine and that's what most people do in that week.
You probably do like 25 things, right?
26:44
But you're going to have one meeting.
If you want to be really clever every day, send an e-mail that says hey, no need for a reply.
Just want to let you know we did these three things.
We'll recap at the end of the week, but I just want to let you know where we're at.
If you send progress reports every day, what happens is you create multiple reinforcement cycles and so you're setting and completing, setting and completing.
27:03
And so at day seven, when normally your competitors has only talked to them, this is the first time they talked to them since the sale, you had a warm hand off and they've received communication from you every single day.
So this is like the eighth touch point for them and now they're trusting you is so much higher which then translates to way lower back outs, way higher ascensions into whatever your next revenue thing is or the next product or expansion revenue and more referrals and testimonials.
27:29
And so we try and core graph that process and that's the R and so close your framework, clarify whether they're label them with a problem that you can solve, overview their past experiences, the pain cycle, sell the vacation, not the plane flight explaining where their concerns and then reinforce the decision.
OK, a lot to unpack there.
27:45
OK, so hang on.
First off, this is one of those notes, a segment on the show.
Rewind it and go listen to it again.
Go rewind 7 minutes back or whatever that was and listen to it again because there's genius in there.
I just want to unpack a couple of the things.
Most of you make the mistake in.
Whatever it is that you're doing, you can do it with your kids.
You're you are selling the plane flight, you're selling the process, you're selling the steps as opposed to the beach.
28:06
That's a biggie. #2 this, this notion of the 24 hours post.
I cannot get over how many people think the sale just got closed.
I'm done.
I cannot get over it. #1 you're probably going to lose the sale. #2 You're definitely diminishing the amount of leads you're going to generate from it.
I just did a very significant transaction with somebody.
28:22
I had a very laid out process in my company.
It's a very major exit type decision for somebody.
OK, I told my team the 2nd we hang up this phone, he is going to begin to doubt this decision.
If he's an airplane, he's freaking losing altitude.
28:40
We need to be doing XY and Z which way it's already a predetermined process.
I was just taking them back through, reminding them why some of the businesses you have, it is just a 24 hour process, some of you to your other point, it's a week or 8 or 10 days, and whatever it might be, sure enough, what was supposed to happen the next morning didn't.
29:00
By midday we were behind.
Then he messages us with a question, which we replied to.
Then he messaged with another one.
When the second question came in, I messaged the entire team.
This deal's over.
We're losing this deal.
29:15
No, no, no.
We can get it back.
We've lost the deal.
He has switched.
He's got downward momentum and it's our fault.
Sure enough.
Massive like close to 9 figure mistake.
That was a process that was involved.
Some of you are making a $800 mistake when this happens.
29:31
Let me ask you a hard question because this is something I've done in my career.
It's not process driven, but it's important.
You went through this process sometimes.
I think that somewhere in that flow, tell me if intuition works or you just stick to the process somewhere in that flow before you get to close.
29:47
I've had the intuition of this person's ready right now.
I can go to this step.
That's not necessarily something that's able to teach on scale, you know what I'm saying?
But I've also watched a lot of people go, you have them here and now you're beginning to layer objections in it and it's taking longer than their tolerance level is.
30:05
I see a lot of people, especially the longer they're unseld them, they unseld them, they give them more.
Let me tell you one more thing.
You one other thing, you should know one other thing.
By the way, my checklist says Step 4 is I then do this do you?
Because scaling this isn't as easy as.
But I also know the real world Should someone still have sensory acuity when they're in the process?
30:24
And go, we're ready now.
So the way that we train sales is that one we start, you might love this.
So we try and think back to front which is if someone, a lot of people train rapport building first, they train the script top to bottom.
But if someone knows how to do the first half of the script, and they don't know the second-half of the script, the likely that they can close is 0.
30:41
Yes, if you train people from the back of the script to the front of the script.
If someone doesn't have rapport and they don't know the opening questions, but they know how to close, the likely they could close is greater than 0. 100% and so 100%.
And so for us, my belief from a selling perspective is that if if you follow the closer right clarify whether they're all we're doing asking questions, labeling them is just asking for agreement on one statement that they have the problem overviewing past experience is just questions.
31:04
We haven't said anything else.
We're just asking questions.
And then the only time you actually make a statement is when you sell the vacation.
And then after that you ask.
And so for us, we the E only comes out after they've said no.
And so we got it.
We explain it through obstacles and objections.
31:21
And so objections, as I see them come up after the ask, obstacles come up before the ask.
And so if someone says I'm just here For more information, that's an obstacle.
So we handle that up front.
If you know like an upfront, again it's like is there any other decision makers that need to be on the call and we asked for that in the nurture process before we're on the call and we'll reaffirm that at the beginning because if they say no or yes I do need someone then like cool, let's just reschedule.
31:42
There's no point in going through this.
Objections happen which is universe like time, money, fit.
I need the other decision maker or I don't know how to make a decision which is the personal thing, the doubt part.
And so then we walk them through making the decision making process.
But each one of those we always loop back.
31:59
So they give us the thing, we overcome it and we say great, so now you're ready or makes sense, fair enough, let's ready to move forward.
You have your ID on you whatever the closing question is.
And so that way as soon as someone says yes, that is when we stop selling.
32:16
So that's the big to your point of stun selling is because people then get like really excited.
It's like, dude, take like as soon as they say yes, great.
What card do you want to use?
Yeah, by the way, I know my audience is like, dude, this is hardcore today, which is exactly, no, no, no, This is exactly what you bring to the table.
And it's actually the stuff like, you know, look, it'd be great.
32:33
We could do another episode today if you want.
Like, hey guys, you be positive, positive manifestations.
Like we could do that, or we can actually give you teeth.






0:00
The biggest mistake that I see, entrepreneurs who are at, you know, 2,000,003 million, 5 million, is that they are trying to solve their business growth problem by just coming out with thing after thing after thing after thing for that audience.
Rather than thinking maybe I should expand my audience, Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:22
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it.
For the rest of us, please share and enjoy.
Mark Bell just flew out awesome guy, to do a podcast here with me in Vegas.
0:37
We worked out, shot the shit, was a great time and there was this really important point where he said, you know, I wish more people would just peel weight off the bar, he said.
I always respect a guy who's lifting with stronger guys and says, you know what guys, I'm going to peel some weight off so that I can do this weight the right way.
And I thought it was such a beautiful parallel in business and one of the most common mistakes in business that I see entrepreneurs at all levels make. soacquisition.com probably talks to 25 new companies a week that are coming out, you know, approaching us about us potentially, you know, investing in their companies.
1:09
And one of my biggest pet peeves comma entrepreneurial mistakes that I see across the board, especially in that like sub 5 million range is something that will destroy your business for the long haul.
1:25
And the reason is not because the strategy is wrong, but because it's too advanced.
And I will explain what I mean in a second.
So the easiest analogy for what I'm going to try to explain is something that you that hopefully people can resonate with at the gym.
So if you're working out with someone and one person is stronger than the other person, and the strong guy goes 1st and has three plates on the bar, doesn't really matter.
1:48
The weaker guy might go up and if he has an ego, give it a shot.
Even though it's above his pay grade, it's above his strength level and even if he could pull it off, it'd be poor and it probably be risky because he isn't strong enough, right?
And business is a lot like that in ways, because often times entrepreneurs will have the right strategy.
2:08
Lifting the weight and lifting heavier weight is not wrong and it's the right way to get strong, but it's just too advanced for where you're at right now.
And it takes humility.
Like the guy who says, you know what, I'm going to peel a plate off because it's like I can do that way better so that I can someday level up and get strong enough to do that more advanced thing in weight and lifting, it's linear because you just add plates to the bar.
2:30
But in business it's about complexity.
And so the adding the weight to the bar is complexity in the business, whereas simplicity often times is what scales.
So you might imagine, imagine somebody comes up to you and says, hey, I want to start a digital bank because I think that all of this stuff should be central and we could have payments and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2:51
That's a hard business to build.
Elon Musk can build it because he's 1000 LB squatter.
It's not to say that if you tried to build it, you're wrong, for the idea is that you just might not be there yet.
And so back to what I was saying with the entrepreneurs that we talked to on a regular basis, the biggest mistake that I see is that they put on shoes that are too big for them.
3:14
And the way that they do that is that they have something that starts working and then they let this insipid phrase melts into their mind and take over their actions, which is I'm leaving money on the table.
And so they have this thing that's working and then they think of themselves well, well, I don't want to refer that business out because like they should get that from me and then they try and glob that and they're like, oh, yeah.
3:36
And then I I need to do this too.
And I need to glob that so that they so I can get get more money on every customer.
Is that a great strategy?
Yes.
Is the execution of that strategy very advanced from an operational perspective?
Yes.
And so here's the thing.
3:53
I had a buddy from high school approached me and he was like, hey, this is what I'm doing with my contracting business.
So he's a general contractor.
And he was, he was, he was roofing primarily.
And I was like, OK, sweet.
So you're just going to see how your roofing business.
He's like, yeah, but I also do some, like, flips in real estate because we like, you know, fix some stuff there.
4:11
I was like, OK, so you do roofs and you do real estate flipping.
He's like, yeah, but I mean, we also do some general contracting work, just kind of like, fix stuff inside of houses.
I was like, OK, so you do roofing.
You do general contracting work and you flip houses.
4:26
And he was like, yeah, I was like, OK, why?
He's like, well, you know, we have these resources.
I'm trying to, like, make the most of all that.
And I, you know, some of these clients, we fixed the roof and like, hey, can you fix some of my house?
I'm like, I can do it.
So then I do it because I don't want to leave money on the table.
4:42
And the question is, what problem are we solving?
If the goal is to grow the business, do we think that we could have $100 million roofing business?
The answer is yes.
Do we think we could have $100 million general contracting business?
The answer is yes.
Do you think we have $100 million flipping houses business?
5:01
The answer is yes.
Can you have all three?
Very unlikely, unless you're an Elon, unless you're a freak, but most people aren't and that's OK.
It's normal Mosa nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
5:23
And if you like that or would like to hear more about it go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
The biggest mistake that I see, entrepreneurs who are at, you know, 2,000,003 million, 5 million ish, is that they are trying to solve their business growth problem by just trying to glob as many different things as they possibly can.
5:45
You know, the people I'm talking about, they have an audience and so then they just start coming out with thing after thing after thing after thing for that audience.
Rather than thinking maybe I should expand my audience and keep selling the thing that I'm really good at, the thing that I'm best at, the thing that's the best leverage for my opportunity, my skill sets.
6:02
And so it's hard for people to say or even peel back.
So this is you and you've got five different products you sell to different avatars.
You sell very clearly different services.
You might want to say, OK, which one of these am I best at and which one of these do I think I could serve the most people with?
6:18
And find the one that Chris, you know, Chris crosses those two things and say I'm going to forget about the rest of the stuff and go all in on this one thing.
Because the problem that we're trying to solve is that we're trying to make more money.
And so us doing all these other things, it distracts from the core business opportunity.
And so that's where we need to peel weight off the bar.
6:35
We need to peel things down and focus on the weight that we can do and get more repetitions in it that this weight so that we then can earn the right later to maybe add one thing in at scale.
Maybe when we have someone who can run that and drive that rather than you right.
6:52
And so it's probably the number one red flag that I look out for.
It also tends to stem from a little bit of greed and people like they're looking at other people's paychecks.
I'm sending this guy so much business.
I'm sending that guy so much business.
Good.
Great.
7:08
Get an affiliate Commission, call it a day, move on, right.
And they try and bring these things in house.
And a lot of times they're not core to you.
It's just, it's just it's globbing.
And then you have this amalgamation, this Frankenstein looking business that no one wants to touch.
Because the first thing that we do with a business like that is we would simplify.
7:25
We'd peel weight off the bar and we'd say we need to do more reps and more volume with the weight that we've got.
And that parallel applies so beautifully in entrepreneurship that I felt the need to make this because so many of the entrepreneurs we talked to are making this mistake.
7:41
And I say this because I, before I started making money, had a chiropractor agency.
I had a dental agency, I had a Jim turn around business and I also had five locations, 6 locations, whatever that was six locations.
So I had this many businesses at the same time.
7:58
I wasn't making no money.
And so I do.
I think that I could own all of these businesses now.
Sure, I'm strong enough to own those businesses now, but then I wasn't.
And So what did I have to do?
I had to peel weight off the bar until I was left with one, and then I did more reps with that one with the one plate on the bar.
8:16
I did as many reps as I could.
And then I was able to level up my entrepreneurial skill set on a clear opportunity of all of the opportunities that I was best at.
And you have to just say no.
And this is just like the woman in the red dress saying no to increase in attractiveness as you get better.
8:32
When I was starting out, I might consider $1000 a month thing, but when you're making 100 grand a month, you probably aren't as interested in $1000 a month thing.
You just ignore it.
But you have a harder time ignoring another $100,000 a month thing, right?
But you have to say no to that to get to 1,000,000 a month, Because what happens is you get to 100 and then you do another thing and then your attention split and then you can't get past here.
8:54
And so you have to peel the weight off the bar and then you do more reps And The thing is, is that even at that next level, and you're at a million a month, you look at this other thing, you're like, there's this other opportunity.
It's a million a month.
But usually peel the weight off the bar and you do more reps And so the only reason you shouldn't be doing more reps and adding to the bar, adding to the stuff that you sell, is that you literally have no more people to sell to.
9:15
And until you have that problem, you should focus on the one thing.
And the secret is that most people really never get into that problem because they're not even close to the size of their market.
So, Lozi Nation, you're an entrepreneur.
Focus on the one thing.
Peel weight off the bar, do more reps at the weight that's appropriate for you, and then wash your gains, both financial and physical stack.








Company0:00
And so right now I have $2 billion paths.
Well, what's?
The worst case scenario if you do.
It anything that damages your reputation is irreversible because you only get one reputation and you literally can't bankrupt yourself out.
Fuck it.
One of the hardest decisions in entrepreneurship is deciding which path to follow, especially when you have two or multiple good paths.
0:20
I'm at a point in my career where I do have a very large decision that I need to commit to for multiple years, and I've been spending basically every waking hour trying to gather more data to make the right decision.
One of my favorite things to do when I do have big decisions is to change my environment, and I think it happens multiple times.
0:35
My favorite place to think is actually on planes.
I often have very few distractions when I'm on planes and I quite literally get perspective, like I'm flying up and I'm looking down at the earth.
I feel like I always make really good decisions when I'm in the air and it's actually something that I like, really look forward to, you know, I've been waiting for since I've been married, going to Chili's.
0:53
We've gone to Chili's.
I had like a seizure.
Honestly, I would go because I don't mind.
I don't care about the style of the restaurant, but I do not like their food.
I think they have amazing chips, great salsa and the fajitas are strong.
I hate that you go hard on us in front of people because I'm behind the closed doors.
Yeah, it's not that good if there's.
Any time, like in the finest albums that I go to, that we go to now like five times like we'll go, It should be like, it sucks, right?
1:15
It sucks.
Say it.
Say it.
It's not as good as the finest dining in the world.
Just say it.
I'm like, yes, it's not as good.
She's like, see, see.
And then that's it for the rest of my life.
It's your.
Chili shit and you get like a stomach ache from it and then you're like.
Who are you talking about here?
Who are we talking about?
1:31
I think you're telling me your story here.
So we just landed in San Diego, and we are going to Real's event, which is a big publicly traded brokerage for real estate agent.
Our really close friend, Sharon Srovaza, is the president of the company invited us out.
We're probably going to have dinner with him.
1:47
We're going to speak there tomorrow.
I will be making a presentation to help real estate agents sell more houses.
But it will not be about real estate.
It'll either suck or be great Before someone who's like, I'm just how do I, how do I stop doing all these routines?
I'm like, I can't even start.
I like, tried to smoke cigarettes to get addicted to them.
2:04
And I was like, I just, it was too hard.
It was just too hard to stick with it.
It's like every morning it's like whatever I got.
The hardest part about growth is that the better you get, the bigger you get, the bigger the opportunities are and the better they are.
2:21
I think the easiest litmus test is to determine how big of the opportunity it's worth your attention.
So right now, 10X is kind of my My Litmus text.
It's like we're at 100.
It's got to be a billion or more for it to be something that I want to dedicate time to.
And so right now I have what I would consider be $2 billion paths.
2:37
They're very different, relatively irreversible.
One has potentially more upside but more risk.
The other one is more certain but has lower upside.
There's lots of things that can make a decision irreversible.
There's if it's a certain percentage of your net worth or capital.
I don't like making those kinds of bets.
This is a quote from Sean Srovata, buddy of mine.
2:53
He said, never want to bet the empire for a pot of gold.
You bet.
You have a need for something you don't have and don't need.
It's never a good, bad anything that damages your reputation is irreversible.
You only get one reputation and you literally can't bankrupt yourself out of a bad reputation.
You can't make take reputational risk where there's only downside.
Now if I were to say, like I want to support this 'cause I might piss off some people, but it'll move me towards a different group of people so that in that case that's that's a trade off more than it's a risk.
3:18
And so that's different than what I'm talking about here.
And then you just have time, you know, time that you can't get back.
Yeah, every, every like moment you spend always has the opportunity cost of what you could have done with that time to get a higher return.
I think the number one presentation I have on YouTube is about that concept is the only base thing we have is time and we make trades for stuff.
3:38
And so the people who are better at trading it for more stuff get more stuff.
There is this story that Tony Robbins told that.
I really like that.
Just kind of illustrated this image is that like rich people make bets where they can't lose on either way.
Like so there's this guy who knows that nickels nowaday are made with nickel or whatever the the material they make nickel with is more valuable than the cost of a nickel.
3:56
His billionaire nose has taken the nickel.
He's putting it in storage as an investment because the day that they change or remove that nickel from currency because it makes no sense, he'll melt it and get 40% on his money.
But there are investments that are high return, low risk.
You want to find those bets?
How's it going?
4:13
You're good, man.
What's up?
I I'm a treasury founder.
We just find banks in the US that literally pay the highest rates on cash.
Well, give me your card.
I don't have a card here.
Take a picture of me and message me.
And then the guy who managed my LinkedIn.
We got it.
There you go.
Oh, we got to get a good lighting.
There it is.
Do it right now so I can tell him we'll do it right now.
4:29
Yeah, we can get more cat more return on our cash.
We're in a hot zone.
A hot zone of recognition.
It's all like entrepreneurial people.
Looks like.
Let's let this gentleman no half measures.
That's right.
He knows.
I'll tell you that story, man.
We're running Gym watch, making a lot of money.
I got asked to speak at this like, personal trainer conference and I was like, yeah, sure, I'll, I'll talk.
4:48
Like I wasn't being asked to speak.
I wasn't making content like this.
So, like, it wasn't like a normal.
I was like, sure, I'll, I'll come talk.
And I was like, So what do you want to do?
He's like, well, I figured you'd just, like give a lot of value and then you could, you know, present your thing or whatever.
And I was like, OK, cool.
I made this really long presentation that was just like, very, very good.
5:03
And then at the end, I had the full presentation webinar.
I've had a got to sell it like that.
I used to sell it before and I was like, you guys probably don't need to see all this stuff, right?
Like, OK, you get it like personal training.
You know, it's important.
You got to know how to sell.
You got to understand the systems.
At the end, I was like, yeah, and here's the price And I dropped it and I was like, you know, I just, I just went as fast as I could through it.
5:22
And I didn't even I said it like I'm saying it right now, I didn't like actually say it.
And so then I revealed the price and so I did what would have been a 90 minute presentation pitch in like 15 minutes after giving 3 hours plus the value.
So I was like, this should make sense.
I give a shit load of value and then I'll just soft toss it right and I got so much resistance from the crowd.
5:41
It was the biggest flop of a presentation I ever gave my entire life.
I don't even think.
I think I made two sales like it was nothing right now.
I had done 1/2 measure and so it's either sell or don't sell.
Don't be in between.
You either give value or you sell shit.
Don't try and mix them.
If we want to make commitments in anything or you're trying to go all in on a decision, one of the best ways to do that is to eliminate the possibility of going back on it.
6:01
A lot of people spend most of their lives being half in, half out, which to me is just not in at all.
It just gives them an excuse to feel like they're making progress when they really aren't.
There's a lot of books that talk about going pro, going all in, burning the boats, and I think they all kind of go along the same point, which is that sometimes you have to make a bet and be willing to be wrong, knowing that if you make no bet, you're guaranteed to be wrong.
6:21
But yeah, for tomorrow, everybody there knows more about selling houses than I do.
And my proof point of that is that they have all sold more houses than I have.
So what am I going to teach them about selling houses, right.
I think it would be silly for me to try and compete on that because there's other speakers who've both done it and been there more than me.
So I feel like that'd be a terrible position to take.
6:36
What I am going to do is say, if I were to start, here's how I would win.
But if selling houses means winning, it'll apply.
Share it with my girlfriend, Riley.
How's it going?
Michael.
Michael, nice to meet you.
Sorry, my hands are cold.
I appreciate it.
It's dude, you're killing the game, man.
I appreciate it, man.
6:52
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Riley.
Right.
See you guys.
When I was in high school, I read this book called How to Make Friends and Influence People.
And I think the second chapter or something, is called people by their name.
It's their favorite word in the whole language.
And I was like, oh, that's interesting.
Your favorite word in the entire language is your own name.
So you love hearing that word more than any other word.
7:08
Well, I should say that a lot of times if somebody likes that word, think about this from a leverage perspective, you haven't seen somebody in a year and then you show up at a conference and you're like Steve and he doesn't remember your name.
He loses all leverage.
You're the good guy.
And so you have so much more leverage in the conversation for a memory.
7:25
Thank you for calling reservation center.
Got to see if I can get in there with a tank top and water sandals.
Thank you for calling steakhouse.
Amy speaking.
How can we help you?
Amy, How are you today?
Hello, Amy.
I'm doing OK.
How are you?
I'm good.
7:40
Quick question for you.
I have reservation at 7:30.
What's the dress code?
We don't turn anyone away unless you're wearing the following board shorts, swimsuits and tank tops for.
Well, if you've never turned anyone away before, then I might just have to risk it because I can't go back to my H1 time.
7:57
I'll.
Bill, OK.
I'm gonna say Amy said it was OK.
Yeah.
No problem.
I'll get that sent over though, and let them know they.
Should be OK.
Thank you so much, Amy.
You're a lifesaver if you're like.
That with the ice cream.
So we're on our way to an ice cream shop and it's, it's closing.
8:13
Like at the time we're about to get there.
Layla, she was like, we should call to make sure that, like, we can get in.
And I was like, hey, how's it going?
My wife needs ice cream or I'm gonna be in the dog house.
I was like, what are the chances, one in a million that you guys can stay open 5 minutes later so I can get some ice cream.
8:30
I was like, I'll be in and out.
I'll be the fastest ice cream man you've ever seen.
And they're like, OK, but you just can't tell anyone.
I was like I will take you to the grave except for this content that I'm making right now and she let us in and we got the Sundays.
I've done a lot of phone sales and I've done a lot of in person sales and there's a lot of mini skills that you learn in sales that are useful in every other environment where you need to get people to do something that you want them to do.
8:54
The ideal way of doing is getting them to want to do the thing that you want them to do rather than having them feel like they are doing you a favor.
The way that you ask, the tone that you ask, the last that you make, the jokes that you make, all of those micro things.
I do those things so that the the person on the other end feels like if they see me in person, it will be a positive experience and they want to have that reward.
9:17
And so they are willing to push or bend the rules a little bit so that I can do whatever it is that I'm trying to do or get in a restaurant or dessert or whatever it is.
People do nice things when they're in nice moods.
So it's like get them in a good mood first, then ask for the nice thing then.
9:39
You made half the presentation last night.
Yeah.
I kind of had this like process that sort of works.
I'll, like, outline what I'm going to say, like far in advance.
And then the day before, I'll change half of it.
Oh, we get the, we get the VIP entrance.
OK.
And then we noticed that your presentation 300 plus slide.
10:03
Yeah, I finished it like 20 minutes ago.
Yeah, it looks good.
It looks good.
Yeah.
And if it doesn't, I'll survive.
OK.
Usually I get more of my adrenaline now, and by the time I get on stage, it's like I'm done with that kind of thing.
It's always directly proportional to the prep.
Yeah, this will be the first time I've talked about any of the stuff that I'm talking about in a keynote.
10:22
So I love this tall boy.
This is great.
Get a little bit of sugar, a little bit of caffeine, a little bit of delicious and a little bit of fuck it.
How many people?
350.
10:38
I had 100 slides.
He has 220.
I have 300.
Oh my God. 300 slides.
I'm looking forward to it.
Oh, thank you.
Ever done a real estate audience?
No, I don't think so.
I'm not.
I don't talk to real estate agents.
It's going to be useless for them.
They'll be like, what a waste of an hour.
He's fucking talking, man.
10:57
Thanks, man.
From my friend Alex Hormozo, A lot of you guys already know how to win because you know how to lose.
So flip it.
You guys know how to win better than I could ever tell you.
11:14
You measure your success by whether you completed the actions that would make it unreasonable that you will not fail, and then you succeed by default.
And everyone here has things that they've written down from many of the talks of things that you want to do or want to think about or whatever.
I would encourage you to make that a list of things that you will do and then when you go back to the same condition, your same home, your same house, your same market, your same whatever, you change your behaviour.
11:37
And then that will show that you learned and you took one step to becoming the person that you ultimately want to be.
This stuff is all top of mind in terms of making actions that would make it unreasonable.
That I fail with a billion dollar decision is because that's actually decision I'm making right now.
11:53
I'm at a point in my career where I have enough what I would consider singles, double s, triples, that I have decided to take a bigger swing.
I'll either win or I'll learn same as you.
So from the bottom of our heart, Alex, you impacted our life.
Thank you, man.
We appreciate you.
12:09
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you all.
I want to do little farce it .0001 of you.
That's all my.
You can be a.
You can be 100 X.
You stop it.
Thank you.
Alex.
You're good.
Chris.
12:24
Very nice to meet you.
Appreciate you, Katie.
Appreciate you photo with you and Katie.
Yeah, sure.
Still trapped, bro.
And subscribers back here to see you.
I'm going to earn that.
I love seeing Mosey Nation in the wild.
12:43
I love the hustle.
I love everyone coming up and and and sharing their, their, their stories like that always makes my day.
I would say though, do it in a place where you won't, you know, get put in handcuffs for sneaking in.
Come up when you see me in public if you can.
I'm happy to say hi.
Take pictures, whatever.
Don't go into areas where you're not supposed to go in order to drive.
13:01
Yeah, because it usually just doesn't end well.
Very nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
So that was, that was great.
I did my keynote earlier in the day.
I think people liked it.
They may not have.
I think they sat through it regardless.
And I think we're probably going to have the afternoon, probably a couple of hours, probably walk around and then we'll head back to Las Vegas.
13:29
See, I see most content.
Yep.
Back in the day when I had one on ones, there was a one guy who I was like, so like, what have you done for personal improvement?
13:46
Like what do you, you know, have you done?
He's like, yeah, you know, it was so crazy.
Like I realized if I, if I don't watch Netflix as much while I'm working, I get like so much more done.
I was like, there's so many things wrong with that statement.
You were telling me probably just like just level one of idiocy.
14:02
Level 2 of Idiocy is that, like you mentioned that you're doing, that you were watching Nofix in general while you were working .3 is that you didn't actually say you were going to stop.
You just said that you cut back on how much Netflix you were watching while you were working.
14:18
And it's just like, there's so many stupidities interwoven into so few words.
I was flabbergasted.
So you're more productive when you don't watch Netflix movies.
Not as much.
Yeah.
Yeah, as much as many shows in a row while you're being paid at your job.
14:35
Yeah, it's been great.
That's pretty.
That is pretty.
Oh, damn.
So if you're at the crossroads between one decision that you're trying to choose between two different paths, if it's the first go round, I would encourage you to take the lower risk path that has a higher chance of success.
15:02
If it's a business, there are stories of just unbelievable entrepreneurs, but what you don't hear is the 10s of thousands of entrepreneurs who make that massive bet and then lose everything and lose 5-8 years of their lives.
If you are going to make the big swing and kudos to you, it's an absolutely personal decision.
15:18
Burn the boats, Go all in.
Fully commit.
Eliminate alternatives.
No half measures.
Because what I can guarantee you is that if you are going after the big swing, the way to guarantee that it does not work is to go half in.
So if you're going to win, make it unreasonable that anything that was in your control was not controlled for, and then only lose for things that were not under your control.
15:40
What do you think, Top five?
For me, I go matrix all time.
I'd be willing to put Dark Knight as #2.
It's just like he's such a good villain.
It's just like it was just the perfect.
The intro scene is just like one of the all time best scenes ever.
I really like it's an oldie.
But I do like gladiator Russell Crowe.
15:57
You got one that's not like actually heavy.
Probably my favorite comedy.
Fuck no it's too Hard. 40 Year old Virgin Wedding Crashers Super Bad and Surprise Bridesmaids.
I can ride during Bridesmaids.
Just like I couldn't breathe.
I was dying.
Yeah.
16:12
I mean I went because a buddy of mine at the job that I was at was like let's go see it.
And I was like bye.
So I, like, I had a couple drinks and like, went to the movie theater and I, like, was hyperventilating.
I couldn't fucking stop laughing.








0:00
And I say that because if you were the entrepreneur, then in the beginning your responsibility is to let other people know about your stuff.
If more people know about your stuff, more people will buy it.
That is a promise.
You can take that to the bank.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:22
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
OK, here's something you do very well.
This is where I think the offer and the lead thing sort of marry one another.
I'm watching you, I listen to you and you either do this unconsciously, which I doubt the best people that I know that are entrepreneurs of any type.
0:45
OK, You can even go to jobs and I can argue he was great at it.
You can go to Musk, I can argue he was great at.
Then you can go to a hardcore selling person like Ellison or whatever, OK, They know how to frame.
OK, Alex, you're an incredible framer, OK?
1:03
You know how to preframe something before you do it.
You know how to create the frame when you're doing it and then you know how to post frame.
I'm amazed.
Blown away.
Like a great speaker walks out on a stage, they preframe what's going to happen there today.
Then they sit in the frame with you, then they tell you what just happened.
1:21
OK, This is just something most people are oblivious to, and if you're not good at it, you may get a close and not get leads.
If you're not good at this framing stuff, your ad's going to suck.
If you're not good at this framing stuff, your affiliates aren't going to offer it correctly.
So all of this fits in there.
I'm good at very few things.
1:38
I'm a really good framer.
No, no, I'm a really good framer of messaging of I framed you in the beginning of the message.
I just framed the complicated thing you just called it.
So I reframed what it means.
Are you conscious of that?
Do you teach it?
1:53
Do you think it's something that most entrepreneurs and salespeople, entrepreneurs and or salespeople are not aware of enough?
Yes.
In terms of teaching it, I don't I think that good for I think framing to your point using a different word just contextualizing.
I think it's.
2:09
I think it's a teaching skill and So what we're what we're saying is like I said this this is what this means.
It's like I'm translating this because you might speak in technojargon for whatever the thing that you're selling is and they're like you just said a lot of words and you're like it means your house is gonna be protected, right.
2:24
That's what this means.
Can I give you sleep well at night?
Can I give you another example of a frame?
Your launch?
Yeah.
You framed it as here's everything that's gonna be here.
Everything that's gonna be, here's gonna be, and then.
And it's free.
Yeah.
So you created a particular frame and then you stepped out of it and shocked them.
2:40
Yeah.
But what you did is, First off, you have a generous heart.
And that's why you really did it.
So let's also be honest, you created this massive value frame.
This would cost you this.
This is how we did it.
This would do this.
This would do this.
And then emotionally at the end, because you were emotional about what you were giving them and believed in it so deeply.
2:56
But then you kind of stepped out of the frame and went all that bam.
And now you're back in a new frame, which was a value gift, generosity.
Now everybody leaves the launch.
It's a super important, I don't even know if you know you did this.
I mean, I know you know what you were doing, but I don't know if you know what that led.
3:12
You have built a reputation of being someone who brings tremendous value.
OK.
That's one thing.
Tremendous value, well prepared, articulate, you know, cutting edge clearly does.
This isn't talking about theory.
That was the frame that was going on the entire launch.
3:28
And then you stepped out of the frame and became a Jesus figure.
Literally your frame changed.
Kind, generous, giving, philanthropic.
And so you get this great value frame and then you stepped in.
Do you guys all know what I'm saying?
3:44
In other words, you create a great value.
Then he stepped out of the frame and gave it to you and that that's, that's it's an, to your point, an irresistible offer when you do it that way.
Were you conscious of that?
And when I explained it back to you, do you see what I'm describing?
You usually use 2 frames there.
4:00
Yeah, 100% punking.
The game is.
That what you call that?
Well, I just a phrase I like for him.
And it was so good, Alex.
And I'm I'm I'm.
It was so good.
It's going to make it really hard for anybody else to launch a book.
Hopefully no, it's going to.
4:15
Make it really hard.
You changed what that frame looks like now.
And honestly, I wanted to honor the book because of how much time I put into it.
And so I put, I put probably 200 hours into the presentation, but I put, I put 2000 hours into the book.
And so it was only 10% of my work from the book went into the presentation, even though the presentation was a, you know a big a big thing.
4:37
But to your point with the contextualizing like if I said here's this thing, enjoy it, people don't know how to process that.
And so it's breaking it down so that they can understand how how this will actually benefit their lives.
And if I can, my hope was that people would at 12,000 at 5000 at $3000 as I price drop during the during the the pitch that people and I got messages after being like dude, I was there at 5:00.
5:02
I was, I was in.
And so it's different than giving a free gift.
I wanted to give a $12,000 gift to every person that was there, but I had to justify why it was a $12,000 gift and why everybody would have paid that but then instead got it for free.
But Alex, what I'm saying is that it was brilliant and by the way, very generous of you.
5:21
But this is something in the sales process.
I don't think most people that they're giving away their product, they've not created A-frame of its value before it's reduced to the access point that you can get it AT.
And that's something all of you, just the concept of what we're describing, you've all got to start to understand or you're not going to be as great as you could be.
5:38
You're not going to be the goat at what you do.
I want to go to.
I want to go to some of the things you've.
Here's something a guy said recently.
This dude said.
There's a moment when every boy realizes no one's coming to save him, and that's when he becomes a man.
5:54
And some boys never get there and stay children forever.
That guy was you that said that.
And it's important when we step out of this, like this stuff matters, because no one's effing coming to save you.
No one's going to make you better at your business.
6:10
No one is going to get you to be a better persuader of people or framer of people other than you.
And I just feel like that's one of the more profound philosophical comments.
There's a lot of grown men and women that are still boys and girls, 'cause they think someone else is coming to change their life, you say.
6:30
Otherwise, what would you say to someone who's still living in that delusion?
Wake up.
I mean reality probably stares them in stark contrast what they want.
So they're like, it's.
I use the blame finger a lot, which is that power.
6:46
Power follows blame.
And so if you blame the government who you think is supposed to save you, or you blame politicians who you think is supposed to save you, or blame your company that you work for who you think is supposed to save you or you blame the market, it doesn't really matter.
Or your parents, the whoever you blame is the person you ultimately give power to.
7:03
And I find that really interesting because when I was my moment of figuring this out was when I was 19 and I was really resentful of my parents specifically, this instance was my mother and I blamed her for the way I was acting.
I was like, well, she parented me differently.
I wouldn't be this egotistical and arrogant and and I realized that I actually was giving the person that at the time I disliked the most in the world all the power over my behavior.
7:31
And so I was like so that idea sickened me that the person I disliked the most again at the time was the one that I was actually giving my leash to.
And so I was only acting in response to this leash and then and and willingly voluntarily giving her all the power of my life.
7:49
And all I was doing was reacting to what this person did or what the government does or the politicians do.
And so the first, I mean I've said this before, but the, the, the 1st 2 words of getting out of poverty are my fault.
And The thing is, is it doesn't actually matter if it is your fault, but it is your problem.
8:06
And so you have to solve it because no one else will.
And so that that that allows you to actually do something about it.
And so that that's been.
I'm a big believer in operationalizing and only thinking about things through actions rather than feelings, because the feelings come and go and also they are justified or unjustified.
8:26
It also is irrelevant because like if you make 100 cold calls, whether you hate it or you love it or you're meant for it or you you, you never want to do it for the rest of your life.
You make the calls and you practice the script, you'll get business and you can also get business and make money even if you don't deserve it.
8:42
Which for me was actually a really comforting point because there was definitely moments in my life where I had tons of self loathing, didn't think I deserved anything, blah blah blah.
But the idea that I could still have it anyways and not to serve it if I only did the things that got it was like it was kind of like in the in the weightlifting world that the iron is the iron.
8:58
Whether you're black, you're white, you're a woman, 500 pounds, 500 lbs.
And so, like the actions that create success are often are kind of the same way, which is like the 100 phone calls or the 100 lbs on the bar.
The work just needs doing and it doesn't.
And I think it's it's incredibly for me.
It's really inspiring that anyone can do the thing and get the result no matter how they feel about themselves.
9:19
And I think that's really freeing.
And so to the person who is still, you know, plugged in and waiting for someone to save them.
Someone will save you, but it's you, future you, the better you, the person that you've been waiting to become.
Bro, you almost look like a somber look on your face when you say it.
9:36
You say that because like you think so many people just aren't going to get that.
Or do you say it because it's just so obvious to you at this point?
I.
Think it's because I've been there, you know?
And so that's, I think that's, that's why, you know, my tone probably changes when I talk about that stuff.
But like, I mean, the reason I make this, the all the content that I do is because like, I get it.
9:55
Like, I mean, it's tough.
Like, I mean the thing, the Rocky cutscene lasts 2 minutes in the movie, but it can last five years in real life and it's not.
And there is no background music, you know what I mean?
And there's no audience waiting to cheer for you.
10:11
And you don't know that you're going to beat Apollo Creed.
So you're in it for five years.
And I think the hard part of entrepreneurship is the uncertainty that you don't know if it's going to work out.
But taking to the other natural extreme, if you did know and you were guaranteed that it was going to work, it wouldn't be worth it.
10:28
So we want something from a world.
We want a guarantee from a world that doesn't give any.
And the fact that it doesn't give a guarantee is what makes it worth it.
Bro, bro, my nephews got an auto detailing business.
10:43
He just started and he calls me, he goes Uncle Eddie.
I just don't know whether or not my business is going to work, going to happen.
And I said, well, I don't know whether it's going to work or happen as well, but I know that if you did the work, it's likely to happen and I go, but are you willing to do the ugly?
11:01
He said, what do you mean?
I said the ugly, ugly.
He goes, well, you know, I said, so your existing clients, do you have an affiliate program where they can refer you people?
He goes, actually I do for every one of these, they get $25 whatever it was, I go, that's really good.
I said how many are you getting from that?
And he goes, well, they only have like, you know, 18 clients.
So like three of them have sent me somebody, I go, well, if that's all you continue to do, you're probably going to have a difficult time to your point of the past.
11:23
And he goes, well, what would you do?
I said, I can tell you exactly what I would do.
It would be inevitable.
What are you doing Saturdays and Sundays?
Are you doing cars?
He goes, no, I don't have any cars to do.
I said, well, I'd go print out a whole bunch of Flyers and I go knock on doors where people have cars.
And he goes, oh really?
I go, yeah, I'd knock on 100 doors of Saturday.
11:39
I'd give him my flyer, let him know about my business, get him exposure, let him know what a great job we do.
Give him a list of my Instagram and they can see the other cars we've cleaned and the other things that we've done.
And and anyway what happens is the more you have a specific plan like this where you're willing to do the ugly and run the numbers, your fear level diminishes to an extent.
11:56
The notion that's going to go away completely isn't true, but there's something about doing the ugly thing that reduces fear and not only increases your chance of winning, but you're like the possibility mathematically of me losing now is rather small but when you're not doing these things the reason you're living with so much fear is you know the possibility of you not winning is rather great.
12:17
And so you're living with a fear that self-imposed, self induced and your fault because you're not willing to do the ugly.
And I think that's why sometimes when I look back at those days, I have that same look you have.
There's also an internal part of me that goes, man, I actually did those ugly things when I didn't want to, when I didn't have any desire to.
12:38
And I wasn't sure it was going to work, but I was actually almost ensuring it was going to work based on the math part of it.
You know what I'm saying?
100% One of my favorite like math equations to figure out is the input output equation to what I want.
And so like as soon as you can boil down whatever goal you have into like the most simple version of the action which is like I need to dial this many things.
13:00
Or I need to send this many emails or I need to send this many direct messages or I need to post this many posts of content.
Or I need to run this much per day in advertising or PPC or SCO or whatever it is.
As soon as it boils down to that, then it's then, then it's plug and jug, then it's just then it, And then what happens is action alleviates anxiety.
13:19
And so, so I'm, I'm gonna give two polar extremes here.
So this is something I'm, I'm working on.
But so I told, I was saying earlier that I like operationalizing words and like what they mean, right?
And so sadness comes from the perceived lack of options.
13:37
That's why it feels like hopelessness.
You don't know what to do.
That's why you feel sad.
And you can solve that with knowledge, right?
Because it's sadness is actually an ignorance issue.
You just, you just don't know.
So if you did know what to do, then you wouldn't be sad anymore because you know what action to take.
13:54
Anxiety is the opposite of that, which is you have many options in front of you, but you don't know which to take, which is a lack of priorities.
And you solve that with the decision.
And so usually you have lots of decisions that you haven't made, and then that's why you have anxiety.
And so you need to confront decisions you need to make.
14:10
And so there was a point that I was getting to and I totally forgot because I got really excited about this stuff.
But.
No, it was a fact about about action and reducing fear when you don't know you have.
Loose hope and so and so once you have the clear path of like you, you you solved it, which is why you're listening to this podcast.
14:27
You read the books so you can go from ignorance, not knowing to knowing what you need to do.
Then it's literally just saying the first six hours of my day every day and I still do this just so you get like this habit.
Like I I was asked once what was, what's the biggest ROI habit.
14:43
Now, everyone has different things, but for me is that the first six hours of my day, every day is dedicated to the activities that I need to do to move the business forward.
I don't take meetings, I don't take calls.
It's just me after the that six hours is when my day starts.
So that's when I do, I take my meetings, I take my calls and whatever.
15:01
And so in the early days when I had customers, then that meant that I would work from 4:00 to 10:00 and then I would do all my customer stuff after that.
Now where I'm at now, I don't have customers per SE.
And so I wake up a little bit later and I work and I work from six until.
15:17
And the way that this my, my team schedules, my calendars, they actually work from the back of the day forward.
And so if I have like 3 meetings, they're going to start them at that, You know, the last one will be at 4:34 and then 330.
And so I have from the moment I wake up until 3:30 in the afternoon to move my stuff forward.
That's how I work.
But I'm not an operator.
15:33
Leila, my wife, is stacked meetings all day long because she's running the teams and she's keeping Cadence on stuff.
And I say that because if you were the entrepreneur, but then in the beginning your responsibility is to let other people know about your stuff.
If more people know about your stuff, more people will buy it.
15:48
That is a promise.
You can take that to the bank.
And so, like, if you think about it, the absolute natural extreme, if every person on planet earth knew about your business, you would make more money real quick, wise.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
16:03
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review by taking 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
16:23
That means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
And so the question then just becomes, how do I let more people know about my stuff?
And that's why I wrote the book.
But it's like and I I wanted to make it action oriented because either you did the reach outs or you didn't, Either you posted the content or you didn't, either you ran the ads or you didn't and you switch who you're advertising to.
16:44
So we're talking about affiliates.
You can post content to get affiliates, you can do warm reach outs to get affiliates, you can run paid ads to get affiliates.
You can also do all those things to get customers.
And what do you think recruiting is?
You do cold reach outs to get employees.
You run ads to get employees you like.
17:00
The the process of making something known is the same whether you're recruiting employees, recruiting customers, recruiting affiliates, recruiting an agency.
How do you find out about agency?
It's the same process of making known.
And so right now if you're not getting the amount of leads that you want, you're not advertising enough, period.
17:16
And so and again with the leverage thing is that you don't need to be like we got 500,000 leads you know to to come for the event, register for the book launch.
I didn't get 500,000.
I I did.
I'll tell you what I did.
I hired someone who is a director of people, who then hired a director of brand.
17:36
Who organized my media, if we're really talking about this, right, who organized my media team?
Who posted 300 pieces of content a week leading up to the launch of the book?
My director of people hired my internal director of marketing, who reached out to six agencies and picked the one that he thought was best suited to run our ads.
17:55
And they ran our ads for us.
My and mind you, all of this came off of one thing for me, which was just we hired a director of people who then hired people who then got the thing.
And so 500,000, mine was more or less like we're going to follow this playbook.
And then down it went.
18:11
But if you're like, well, must be easy for you to say, yes.
But it still starts with the first action, which is like I hadn't hired that person.
I would have had to move one level down on that level of leverage.
And so if you were that solopreneur or you're a sales person who works in an organization and you need to get your own leads, whatever it is, there are only four things that you can do to get leads that you yourself, you reach out to people you know, you reach out to people you don't know, you post content and you run ads.
18:37
That's it.
That's all there is.
And if you're not doing those four things, whether it's to get affiliates, to get customers, to get employees, to get get agencies, it doesn't matter because those are the only four things that one person can do to let other people know about their stuff.
So if you're not getting enough leads, you're not doing enough of that period.
It's not good.
18:52
It's outstanding.
It's truth.
By the way, Sasha, have we really been going 45 or 50 minutes?
50 minutes?
I literally think we've been doing this for 15 minutes.
I have never.
I mean, dude, I've done 500 podcasts.
I have never looked up at the clock and going it's it was 50 minutes.
19:11
I thought it was like 15.
I'm not exaggerating and I'm not letting your ass go just yet, bro.
I'm not exaggerating.
That is the fastest freaking 50 minutes in the history of my life.
I can't even get over that.
That's nuts to me.
That's how you know something is good.
19:27
You mentioned Layla.
I'm not going to let you out of here this time without talking about her.
First off, 1 cool Thing people Don't know is like almost every single time you've reached out to me, which I love and by the way, I totally want to do.
I've had to say no like three times to him.
It's like this dude whose brain I love picking, and I think he likes picking mine too.
19:45
He just always asks me when I can't do something right.
And it's all sometimes.
Like, what are you doing tonight?
Yeah, that's.
Once in a while.
Right.
But you, it's always includes her.
And I meet, look, you're brilliant, OK?
Let's just be honest, OK?
20:00
You are.
And then I watch her stuff and I'm like, dude, she's freaking unbelievable.
And I know you play different roles, but I actually posted something about today and I just want your take on it.
By the way, one of those other pointing at the other person is their objection for their life.
Some people point at their significant other as their reason, right?
20:17
You're giving somebody advice about that, like, hey, you're going to have a running mate necessarily or not a running mate.
What are some of the things you would recommend from your own experience with her that are most important, or or something that's even happened with you and her?
20:34
So I'll give my first frame, which is we've only been together seven years, you know, married 6.
And so I realized that I'm young in this game, so take this for what it is.
I think Layla and I practice acceptance very well, which is that the reason that I married Layla was that she never wanted to change anything about me.
20:53
And that was that was what I wanted.
I just wanted to be me.
And I felt like a lot of times I had to compromise or you know, I felt like I needed to compromise who I was or what I wanted to do for a middle ground.
And I think there there are plenty of marriages to be fair that that do that and they do it exceptionally well.
21:11
And this isn't me saying that that's good or bad or whatever.
I'm only sharing.
What has worked for us is that Layla is Layla, and if she wants to wear the nicest clothes and drive the nicest cars and be in the nicest penthouses and stuff, then if it doesn't bother me, let's do it.
And at the same time, if I want to wear, I look like an electrician, you know, a lumberjack electric.
21:35
Then she doesn't try and dress me a certain way or make me, you know, like, hey, it'd be really cool if you were just scruffy, you know?
Or I wish you cut your hair like this like she she just doesn't, you know.
And I think the big thing for us is that we were absolutely aligned on the big mission and we're absolutely aligned on the values, which is so where we want to go and how we want to get there.
21:54
And I think the third, the third piece that we look at is lifestyle is like, what do you like to do in the day-to-day or interests?
I remember when I was debating whether I wanted to be with her or not.
I had a coach at the time and he said, well, tell me about your stats.
And I was like, what do you mean?
22:10
And he's like your stats.
He's like, since you came in your life, are you making more money?
Are you in better shape?
Like, how do you like, how do you feel?
Like, do you have more energy?
Like, are you doing more stuff?
Are you getting close to your goals?
And I thought about it.
I was like, well, yeah, I am making way more money.
And I mean, shoot, she makes me money because she was working for me.
22:25
That's like she literally, she's not, she's not a liability.
She's a she's an asset.
You know, she's like she's making me money.
And so I and it's like and she's really fit.
And so she, like, cooks healthy, and she's getting meaty, a little healthier than I, you know, because she's cooking and and I'm there.
Right, right.
Right.
And she goes to the gym more than I do.
So I was like, you know, if I see her go, Oh my God, I should go, you know.
22:42
And so every when I thought about every one of the stats in my life, they all went up.
And so I think that and I've said this before, but like Leila and I didn't have a romantic chemistry fireworks beginning my first date.
I asked her to work for me and I said this might not work out, but like you should totally work for me because you have a skill set that would make a lot of sense.
23:02
And that was my proposition.
And she said no, I just mentioned from the Internet, but you know, 3 weeks later she quit her job and she joined me at gym lunch.
And so I think it's just been absolute alignment of where we're trying to go, how we want to get there and the interest we have and absolute acceptance of not trying to change the other person or their goals.
23:21
Now if there was ever a time in the future where she said, like, my goal differs from yours, then it might not make sense anymore.
But I think our goal is big enough and wide enough and it has.
And because we are exposed to the same stimulant, I think I have a tremendous amount of respect for people who don't work with their spouse because that's what I do.
23:38
And I I can't imagine it another way.
Now, I'm sure people in reverse say the same thing, but we get exposed to the same hardships.
And so in a lot of ways, I feel like we continue to grow together or at least in parallel on the same path.
If you're exposed to a lot of different stimuli and stressor than your spouse is, they're going to respond to the stressors and adapt just like any other Organism would.
23:57
And sometimes that means you grow apart.
And so I'm very grateful that we can work together and transparently that my wife has a skill set that is consistently incredibly valuable.
You know, because real talk.
If if Layla wasn't an exceptional CEO, then we wouldn't like Layla wouldn't be the CEO, you know what I mean?
24:16
But she just is.
People don't know this from the content, but I would argue that Layla is a better CEO than I am, quote, visionary.
I think the ideas are easy.
Doing it is hard.
And she has made me look exceptional by making crazy ideas like a 500,000 person launch actually happened.
24:37
Yeah, like anyone can say, sure, let's let's do an affiliate program, Let's do a referral program, Let's do this, Let's do it.
Let's get some agency like I I say all that stuff.
And then she's like got 168 item Asano, you know, list.
And then she starts dealing, you know what I mean?
Dealing and then shelling these things out.
And then all of a sudden I get all the credit, which is, you know, a burden I have to bear.
24:57
Are you happy right now?
Me, Yeah.
I'm loving it.
I'm in the game.
Yeah, and like is.
Oh, no pun intended.
But so you you are happy right now.
This is the best.
This is the best version of me I've had so far.
But I I realized for me that my when I look back on the my short life, the times that I have, that I look as the good old times were always the times where I was in pursuit, not when I was in achievement.
25:26
And I absolutely now have a massive bone that I'm chewing on.
And there's nothing like if I have three days in a row on a long weekend and I have nothing planned and a big cup of coffee and a big ass goal I'm working on.
Like, there is nothing in this world that makes me happier than just being able to just pull a thread and just keep pulling it on my own and working through something complex like writing the book.
25:49
Like like organizing the launcher, right.
You know, scripting the ads or you know coming up with the affiliate program that aligns every party associated with it.
That's that's there's nothing I'd rather do.
Like I don't have hobbies like that's I get.
I get I get Flack for this all the time.
They're like don't you think you're unbalanced.
26:04
I'm like, why?
Like I like this.
I like what I do every day.
It's.
Interesting.
What?
What we share, by the way, I just did content that I released today that said, if you're trying to change the person you're with, you're wasting your time, right?
I just did that.
The other thing is that I have tried golf and I play a little bit, but the truth is business is my sport.
26:21
Business is my hobby.
Changing people's lives is my passion and like of course I'm happy doing it.
It would be like if you love golf and you played golf all the time wouldn't you be happy?
Like I love doing this all the time.
It makes me happy.
I I cannot get over how quickly this went.
26:36
I almost feel like I would like to spend the night with.
You can I add 1 caveat to the question that you asked about the happiness thing.
So happiness is a really tricky question and I I think I'll give a reframe for the audience that might be helpful which is like wanting to be happy from a some like a word perspective is in some way saying like I want to eat a meal so big I'm never hungry again.
27:01
It's it's a it's a misnomer.
And I I prefer to use the word joy that I experience joy or that I experience meaning in the work that I do because like you can mourn and be joyful, at least in my my two cents.
And so I think that the idea that I think inhibits or prevents a lot of entrepreneurs from continuing down the path is that they are like, I'm not happy, but like happiness.
27:24
A lot of times it's just a circumstantial, circumstantial response to whatever external thing.
But if like joy is a lot more internal and you can be in the thick of it and working on your auto detailing business on the 37th door of that day and you have a little tick mark and you know you got to get to 100 and you had the last 36 slammed in your face.
27:41
But like you can be joyful if you reframe the joy around the person you are becoming by doing the hard work.
And the thing that has I think right now been my biggest area of interest in terms of my own performance has been truly divorcing outcome from winning.
28:01
And like it's it's really easy to say and really hard to do.
But I want to be the father that when Timmy wins 10 zero I can look at him and be like I'm disappointed in you.
Not because of the outcome because I know you could have tried harder.
And on the flip side, if he loses 10 zero, I'm going to be like Timmy, you worked your ass off.
28:21
You left it all on the field.
I'm proud of you and I want to be Timmy to me and and and judge myself by that and I get in the most flow in the work when the my metric for success is how hard I worked for it and that has made joy feel like it's under my control more than anything else.
28:45
And so that is what I've been practicing on a daily basis and I think has for me unlocked a level of productivity and work that when I was more external and outcome focused was more ephemeral.
Because like you know what I could have had the book launch and the Internet could have gone down for the whole city of Vegas.
But if I know that I had done everything in my absolute power to prepare then I can still be proud of me and I would have earned my approval.
29:08
And so it's more like that has been my consistent process of like if I can just respect me for the work I did and that is enough.
That's another level right there.
You just described me to me better than I've ever described to me, bro.
29:24
OK, By the way, everyone on my team, just so you know, that's a social media clip right there.
The last minute and a half.
That's the best description I've ever heard of how I've lived my crazy life.
And it explains me to me.
Let me tell you what you just did in the last minute there, 2 minutes.
29:40
You help.
I'm.
I'm being honest.
I'm older than you, and I'm still richer than you.
Barely.
I say that you know.
What I mean I.
No, I don't know that anymore.
But you just described me to me.
29:55
You just helped me understand myself very well.
There's a depth to you bro, and a dimension.
The my favorite people are really multi dimensional people and you online sometimes make yourself seem like you're just entrepreneurial dimensional.
30:11
But what makes you such a creative skilled, visionary entrepreneur is the dimension that you has is is your depth, is your depth and you just exemplified it right there.
I've just had somebody a lot younger than me just explain me to me better than I've ever understood myself.
What you just said right there and that's why I kind of look at you like a young son or a brother because that's exactly how I am.
30:32
It's exactly Alex how I am and it's made me understand why I I, I actually live pretty joyfully most of the time.
Yet it's not something I'm going to go get and I'm going to slow down and cool down and then it's all going to rain down on me in those times.
30:48
It's been the pursuit.
It's been the growth, bro.
Such a great conversation.
It is the fastest one in and out.
And I guess now like an hour and 10 minutes or whatever it's been that I've ever had.
And I just feel like, I feel this sense of, like, real accomplishment, yet I'm empty because I know we, like, barely scratched the surface.
31:05
What we should just do is like, let's just have you back every six months when you're in town, and we'll just dig deeper into your brain.

0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, what's up, everyone and welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
I am here with my co-host.
Charlie, who's sleeping on my lap, he's going to be added for emotional support.
So, one of the things I wanted to cover, Today is the power of an amazing guarantee and there's a lot of different guarantees that are out there.
0:36
You can, do, you know, satisfactory and guarantees.
You can do results-based guarantees, which can get really tricky, and you can do double your money back, guarantees.
There's a lot of different ones out there and Ultimate what I wanted to do is, you know, if you've seen some of my videos on the on our Facebook group about like the components of an irresistible offers, you want to Stack the benefits and your staff, the bonuses.
1:02
And one of the, one of the most powerful things that you can stack is a guarantee because you can put that at the very end.
So it's like and besides all that if you don't get the goals as like will give your money back or if you don't think our program is worth the money that we that we that were charging you for it.
Not only will give you the money will give you twice as much back, all right?
1:18
Because that's how confident we are now all of this like, Assumes that you are really, really confident in your ability to deliver the service that you're, you know, claiming word or you're confident that you can deliver the results that you're telling this person that you can do.
1:33
So, one of the things that I would highly recommend you, look at the the my favorite guarantees, our satisfaction guarantees, I love those because for the person when you're selling it to them, they feel like it's really, really easy to get out of because it sounds Easy to get out of but the reality is that I've I gave and that was the one that I use for most of my gyms.
1:57
It's just a satisfaction guarantee.
And and I would tell them was like, listen, we will guarantee you that the the quality of our service is what we are charging.
If not more, if you feel like the quality of the service that you've received, by the end of this program isn't what you pay for it.
We will give you your money back, okay?
2:14
And I have, I mean between all the locations we had, I have only had two people take me three.
People take me up on that.
And two of them, I should have known when I signed them up, that they were crazy and I shouldn't have done that.
So that's, that's just for you to take.
2:31
Take note with.
So, satisfaction guarantees are awesome.
And the reason it's hard is because, like, you have to look at someone after five weeks or 10 weeks, or whatever, you know, whatever it is right.
And look at the owner of a business and tell them.
Yeah, I think your stuff sucks.
I want my money back.
2:48
You don't mean it so it's it's not it's not easy to do that.
A lot of people like so like a obviously want to make sure your stuff doesn't suck but it's just, it sounds easy.
So it'll help push the sale but it's really hard for someone actually pull the trigger on that.
3:06
So some people are always afraid of getting here at ease because they're afraid, they're going to give you no money, but it's kind of like the insurance policy that they sell you a Best Buy.
They know that most people aren't going to pull that parachute which is why they sell it to everyone and that's where there.
Highest margins are so highly recommend doing that.
3:21
The second thing second type of guarantee that's really good.
One is a result of a security with with qualifiers and so you can say, hey, like we guarantee you that you will lose lose weight.
You can either say like in general lose weight or lose x amount of weight by the state.
3:38
If you attend all the workouts and you log all your food, you know in the food plan or whatever, right?
And you know, something like that.
That people are like you guaranteed, like, yeah, if you do this in this, we guarantee it.
Now obviously, someone could also eat Snickers bar in addition to that.
3:54
But the thing is, is like at a certain point, you have to, you have to believe that the person's trying to succeed, right?
I mean, they're coming to you to solve a problem.
Now, people are definitely self-sabotaging, don't get me wrong, they are, but it's just a second type of guarantee that works really well.
And I would use this more for like an entry offer.
4:11
Now not low ticket because I fundamentally don't believe in, let's take it.
But for an entry offer that's going to be a 4 6 week offer.
Not like hey we going to do this over a year or 12 you know or 24 week or something like that.
I don't recommend that there but that it's these guarantees work the best in front end programs because these are people who are cold traffic, you don't trust you the most whereas when you're up selling them on the back and into like you know, High ticket You know, 12 months or 24 week contracts, then those people do trust.

You don't need to give those types of guarantees, they're going to assume, they're going to do everything in your power, to help them out.
The third type of guarantee which is one that I like is the double your money back guarantee.
And I think I like it because it's just like it just it's just sounds so crazy.
5:00
You don't I mean it's so like 1990s, like Dan Kennedy, you know, like just like w.
Like not only that or like some people are like 30 day money-back.
We'll give you a 60 day money back guarantee, so that's another type.
There's a lot of different types of guarantees but those three of the ones that I'm mentioning right now are the are the ones that are my favorite.
5:16
So satisfaction guarantee that they're going to be there to get the service that the service that they're going to get.
It is worth the money that they're paying for it.
Okay, this the first one, the second one is the results based guarantee with qualifiers and then the third one that I like is the double your money back guarantee because it sounds so egregious.
5:32
And so ridiculous.
That people are like, wow, these guys have to be confident but the Aditi is like, so few people are going to take you up on it.
It doesn't matter, but it's going to help you close.
So many sales, especially, it's just like, it's that beautiful gust of wind that will push them over the edge, right?
5:50
When they're not sure.
If they quote need to think about her need to talk to their husband before they make major decisions.
So that is the power of a strong guarantee.
Equip your shows people with it, put it on your, thank you page, put it on your opt-in pages, put it everywhere, you possibly can because a guarantee is worth its weight in gold and you should use it.
6:07
So that further ado Hope you guys have an awesome day drive workout.
Bathroom break, whatever and agenda, Jim shooter podcast, if you are a gym owner and you would like to find out more about what we do and how we take Jim's from zero to full capacity, in 30 days, you can go to gym.
6:24
Launch, secrets.com forward slash quiz and we will send you for walkthroughs, so you can get an idea of how we do.
What we do, have an awesome day and I'll talk to you guys on the flip side.0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show we want everybody.
Happy Monday we are back at it again with some Joomla content.
So I wanted to make a video for you guys about something that comes up all the time.
And so I figured Did you know, I had this ongoing list of like content things that come to me in the middle of night or at lunches or in places that they shouldn't come for whatever reason.
0:37
And so one of them was related to where your gym is and what's elephants you practice.
And the reason why I'm making this video is because there are always people who gym owner limit themselves and have fun today.
Because they gave themselves this reasoning.
0:52
The story they tell themselves about why their gym is different or why there are special snowflake is cetera, right?
And so I was looking at Some of the pictures from our event this morning and unfortunately, with Facebook, I can't share my screen, but if you guys look on our Facebook page, you can see all of our million-dollar plus gyms which at this point of things, over 24 25 that we have and we had one or two that happened last week, that passed the million dollar run rate, which is cool because they'll get those sweet.
1:17
So weird.
So if you guys have seen these pictures with the gym ownership swords, that's because they hit a mine all run right which is 83 thousand in a month or more.
So let me go full.
So let me let me reel it back in the reason that I wanted to make this though Is it, as I was looking at this picture, what I saw was kickboxing Studios, Martial Arts Studios studios in the middle of nowhere.
1:39
Oklahoma Studios impact Staten Island gyms in the suburbs of Atlanta Jim's in Denver Jim's.
It like basically in every type of Market that you could imagine Rich, poor black, white, hispanic Asian, whatever wealthy East coast/west Coast north south and practicing.
1:57
The style of Fitness style fit is being whatever your Looks like where you have a trainer and people receiving service, all of them were able to implement these steps and the, the framework that we outline specifically in Jim Lord's, to get their Gen 2 million dollars plus.
2:13
Now, why is that possible, right?
So that's kind of what I wanted to dive into just like, how is that even possible?
The reason that the, that your style of Fitness does not matter.
And the reason that your location does not matter is because humans are the same, right?
Women are going to die five times a year.
2:29
We're regardless.
So the only caveat is as long as you are comfortable offering a fitness solution or having a transformation aspect to your business, then the model that we espouse Works whether you want them to kick a bag or do martial arts or do boot camp or do CrossFit or cross style, whatever, you know what I mean, whatever your whatever your style of training is is irrelevant and the to further reinforce that they're only going to respond to the promotions that are that Right.
3:00
They're only going to respond to the offers that convert and they're only going to pay for the price points that we already know work, right?
Which for large group training is going to be between and, like, where you should be is between 1 15 to 25 a month, right?
150 on the very bear.
3:15
Bear, bear low end.
If you have a very high capacity facility and for most people two, hundred dollars a month is going to be where you should be and if you're not there, you're not profitable and I can tell you that with a very high degree of certainty that Probably not taking much home because the math doesn't work out.
3:33
I've made tons of other videos around that, but the point is, that there are different buying segments that exist within like the elasticity curve on pricing.
When it comes to weight loss for this specific service people and women are willing to pay x amount for that result.
3:48
And so the and you know I'm going to I'm going to, I'm going to bring this all the way back to when this started, so six.
So a lot of people don't know this six or seven years ago.
I don't know the math, I Got to California.
I emailed 40 gym owners because I was putting my management consulting job for we.
4:04
I did strategy in a marketing firm in d.c., that's what I did right out of college.
And anyways, I was like, I hate this is soul-sucking, I don't want to do this.
And so I emailed 40 gym, owners and said I want to learn, right?
And I ended up in Chino California because only one of them got back to me.
4:20
And at the time, the guys name was saying backyard, he actually owns the camp and he was running.
He at one location at the time.
And they just opened a second one.
That was kind of like a mini mini smaller one.
I was like in Rancho Cucamonga anyways and so they were offering a challenge where you lose weight and get your money back, right?
4:43
And he was doing it as semi-private program.
And when I came in I was like Hey, if you want more of these, I found out Facebook marketing works and like there's this cool stuff and he was like, I don't know if Facebook I heard it doesn't work.
And I was like, well you know let me try it out.
So anyways, I try it out and obviously it works and what but the conversation that happened was he said we can't take anymore in our semi-private like we're full, right.
5:10
I said not an issue and I don't think just give them a give them a nutrition plan to put them in the in the boot camp and he was like, you think you're going to pay $500 for that?
And I was like, yeah.
Like they could come here and do puzzles me three days a week, you know.
And if they lost 20 pounds, they'll be stoked, right?
And that's because it kind of underlines the main concept which is like, it does not matter how you get them to Maui, how you get them to the island that they're trying to get to no one cares about the plane fly, they don't care.
5:36
They don't care.
Whether they take a train there or a boat or a plane.
There's obviously some ways that are more comfortable than others but they care about getting them out.
And so, whatever Fitness style, you have is the plane flight.
No one cares.
That's why in the ceiling.
You shouldn't talk about it because all of that is cost, all of that is the stuff that someone has to do to achieve Maui, right?
5:55
No one else to hear the TSA line.
Someone wants to hear that they take off their belt, their shoes, and they have to check their bags, and they think it's cert, then they have to sit next to someone who's coughing no wants to hear about your meal plans, are your Macros or that cutting-edge workouts that you're going to do an upgrade.
The trainer certification is no one cares, they don't care.
Because all that's gonna do is remind them of the cost in the pain that's associated with achieving their goal, right?
6:15
And so to Circle this all the way back is that it does not Out of whether you're doing, puzzles with your clients or you're giving them martial arts lessons or you're doing a boot camp.
The reality is, what is the offer?
And what is the outcome, right?
And if we know that the price points are tested which is why you test upright.
6:33
And if we already know that which we do, which is why we have you know these students making all this money is that they're just running a model that's already tested.
We know this promotion works we know six-week challenges at this moment for the last six and a half years.
I've run basically untested because it's A long enough amount of time that people believe that they can achieve the outcome that that is significant but short enough that they believe in themselves that they can achieve it.
6:55
And that's the balance point. 12 weeks, everyone thinks that they can achieve a lot then, but a lot of people don't think that they can finish, that's why it doesn't work.
It works.
Don't get me wrong.
It works for type of customer, but not for large, general population, right?
Hey Mose.
7:11
An Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
7:27
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And so when you have a promotion that's already tested, and you have a price point that, you know, that on the front end is what the market will bear.
Which FYI is about $600 for a first-time.
Visit off of coal, traffic $600 is right about the breaking point and that's actually if you can look at different franchises that have been in the weight loss space so I like studying other people that energy since industry.
7:50
So you guys hear me talk about the Nicolas because of Chris Paul, he's a good friend of mine.
She ran, they 220 locations their front end offer was $600 right and They ended up selling people on day.
Five to fifteen hundred and six thousand dollar package the remainder of the year.
Yeah, without any income demographics, most people are under estimating how much people will pay for result, right?
8:14
And the beauty of her process is that they don't tell people about the cost of what I mean by that.
Is that like all those people have to do is come in and show up once a week for 15 minutes to show their food log to show that they've that they've lost weight, right?
So there's not a lot of cost are with finish.
We actually have more costs so it would behoove Us even though we know that Fitness is going to be the way that they keep it off in the long term, right?
8:36
It would behoove us to not mention that because the only thing it does, is it increases the cost on the customer, their perceived value of, and I'm going to give you something.
I'm probably going to another video about just this one thing, but Imma give it anyways.
So, I was writing so for someone selling Secrets, which is something that may be coming out soon for our gym owners, which is really cool, and we'll make a lot of money for them.
8:54
Anyways.
There's one value equation that I was coming up with when I was making the the Asians right?
And it is significance of outcome.
X likelihood of achievement.
Okay?
So significant about come X likelihood of achievement how like How likely that you actually going to get that significant outcome / time and effort equals value.
9:21
So here's an example, if you were to give someone a pill like Xanax, that helps some someone go to sleep, Right or relaxed, which is probably a medium at magnitude depends on like how stressed out they are but like medium to high magnitude outcome the time and effort required to do.
9:42
That is 0 and the likelihood that they're going to achieve.
It is basically 100% if they take it in their body responds, right?
And so why so, so when people are like I can't believe big pharma's a bazillion dollar industry.
That's why they've a huge significant outcome.
9:58
A 100 percent likelihood of It happening and then they have zero time and effort.
So what does that mean?
Money.
Lots of value.
Here's the flip side.
If you were to say, hey I could give you that same level of relaxation and or preparation for going to sleep.
10:14
When all you have to do, right?
Is learn how to meditate.
And in 30 minutes, you will be like as pristine as a whatever and you won't have the side effects of having a chemical addiction, right?
What is that?
Same magnitude of Alco likelihood of achievement much lower because you have to actually learn how to meditate, right?
10:36
And do it right?
And then what's the time and effort all the time that it's going to take to do it all the effort of sitting down and being distracted.
And the not actually succeeding in the learning, learning learning, all of that is cost, right?
So why don't meditation lessons, sulfur wire, meditation lessons?
10:52
A bazillion dollar industry?
Instead of saying it's they have the same outcome, why not?
This is not as valuable that's why right in So to go, super, super duper full circle.
That is why the type of Fitness that you have does not matter.
The only thing that matters is the outcome that you are selling.
11:08
And so, as long as you have a fitness slant, that you are in the weight, not, you're in the weight loss industry, you can accept that or not, that's fine.
But if you do accept that, then that's the industry that you are in and the in the rest of it is just the widget, it's just the plain, but your price point is going to need to be between 150 and 225 a month period.
11:24
If you have a larger facility that can service over 16, people per session.
That's what it has to be, right?
And then your upsell and a semi-private is going to have to be between five hundred seven, hundred dollars a month period.
It's Matt, it doesn't work out any other way.
Can you make money the other way?
Yes.
11:40
Will you make a lot?
No.
And at my argument would be that if you find someone who's like, well, hold on, I charge. $400 a month for my semi-private and we make money.
I really cool.
You'd make 50% more money.
If you charge 600, you're just not making as much as you could, and that's really the argument.
11:56
So, anyways, I probably should have covered the where your gym doesn't I'll probably do that in another video because some probably, hopefully, I said enough things in this video, but the style of Fitness that you practice doesn't matter because they do not care about it.
They do not care about the plane.
They care about Maui and don't talk about the plane because it's only going to lose you sales.
12:15
Okay.
Yeah.
So anyways, I hope you guys found this valuable so I hope this was high magnitude, High likelihood of you understand the information in the time of effort for you to understand slow.
But anyways that is the value equation and that is how you can apply to Fitness and that is Ey, what type of Fitness you have does not matter provided, you can have a sufficient amount of people in a space with a single trainer who says do this.
12:36
And then they can follow and doesn't require a ton of skill or effort to onboard people, which is why we are Advocates of not having super complex things for general population, mostly because it doesn't matter for them because most of them are just trying to not drink hope.
And so, we are Fitness purest and we always assume at least I did for a very long time that I need to give people exactly what I needed to give myself, right?
12:57
I wanted people to start lifting weights and Counting them out.
Was immediately.
But the reality is that is not what they need when they start because that overwhelms them, and it stresses them out.
And when I say, hey, you're going to lose a pound and a half of fat every week and then a 50 or 100 pounds.
Overweight girl says, hold on.
13:13
I'm gonna have to do this for two years is what you're telling me you've lost them and if you can't do it that way, you have to give them a big immediate psychological in the short term.
So that psychologically they are bought it and then they will listen to you so that you can say, hey now that you've lost 40.
13:29
Pounds in your first eight weeks, whatever, listen, I want you to start trying this, I want you to start logging stuff on my fitness College to learn how to count the so that we can actually get some of those foods that you like that.
Can you guys know this conversation?
But we have this purest feeling that we have to tell them this in the beginning.
And, and if you're like, if someone doesn't doesn't some of them do it, they don't want it.
13:47
No, that's stupid.
You're not meeting someone where they're at, right?
You have to meet someone where they are.
You don't talk to a five-year-old.
The way you talk to a 15 year old, right?
And some of these people are five year olds in their Fitness understanding I It's a man talking like people that, you know, people in your family right now think that almond butter is a good source of protein.
14:06
People think that sweet potatoes are a good source of protein.
People think that Kino is a good source of protein.
People think that beans are a good source of protein, right?
Like do you have no idea.
So like you have to meet them where they're at and then be okay, with giving them the thing that they need right now which is not perfect from a physiological standpoint, but will be exactly what they need from a psychological standpoint to get them to the next step.
14:29
So anyways, sorry maybe I do know.
Is that a rant or is that like, it's just like a expounding on anything.
But if you guys found this valuable, please throw a like, so that another gym owner can take their trainers in it, who want to just do macros and lifting for everyone on their first trial.
And, and hopefully that explains somewhat for those of you who are like, I'm not sure if Jim won't work for my gym model, it will, as long as you're providing weight loss and fitness to your customers as a net result, it really doesn't matter.
14:55
As long as you can, you can fit that model on top.
The the gym launch model on top of any business that is a fitness based business that is brick and mortar and service.
It works.
And that's why we have, you know, every month from meeting one or two or three or four more million-dollar-plus facilities, which is super exciting for me.
15:13
And it's really cool because with each one more people run the 4-minute mile and then it stops being this unattainable thing that stops being the names of the groups.
It just becomes something that your gym should be doing if you're doing it, right.
So, lots of love, have an amazing Monday.
And I will see you guys on the flip, right?









0:00
I think one of the scariest things is feeling out of control.
That is always, like the most frightening to me because I'd like to know why I'm feeling a certain way.
That's why defining the terms are so important to me so that I could know how to solve it.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
0:15
This podcast, The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
If I struggle with something, it usually means that I don't understand it well enough.
0:36
And so I spent a lot of time trying to define terms in ways that I can actually do something about them.
And so sadness comes from a lack of options, which is why it feels like hopelessness.
Anxiety comes from many options but a lack of priorities, which is why it feels like paralysis, looking everywhere but moving nowhere.
0:54
And so you solve sadness with knowledge and anxiety with a decision.
And so if you don't know what to do, you have to find out what to do.
If you have too many things to do, you have to make a commitment by deciding of all the paths.
This is the one I will choose.
1:10
And so decision, solve anxiety, knowledge, solve sadness.
I don't genuinely, I don't experience sadness a ton.
And so if I feel it, I'm like, this is weird, Why do I feel this?
And so trying to get to the root cause of like, why do I feel sadness Right now?
I feel sadness because I don't know what to do.
1:27
And so if I don't know what to do, it means that, like, I feel like I have no action that I can take.
And as somebody who is predisposed to taking action pretty well, that's not a common feeling for me.
But then it was like, OK, well then I have to figure out what actions I have available to me and then I can move forward.
1:42
But then even the idea that I had to find out what actions I had gave me the first action to take, they got me stopped feeling sad.
I mean the the real real was that I it was not that long ago because I was thinking about what direction to take acquisition.com like from our investment perspective, I was like I I felt like handcuffed in a lot of ways.
2:01
I'm like I just don't know what to do because I have like I have this brand here, I have this investment thesis that I started prior to my brand, but I like to stick with things for a long time.
On the other hand, I like to take a new data that affects the overall equation.
2:16
And so it was kind of conflicting.
Two different values that I have of being consistent but also being malleable.
And and it was basically me trying to walk through that and figure out what to do.
At the time, I didn't feel like I had any because I was like, what am I supposed to do?
And then the first objective was like, figure out what my options are.
2:34
And then because like anxiety is like, you already have all these options because like, you can move from sadness to anxiety.
So you don't have any options.
Then you figure out all your options and then you feel anxious but no longer sad.
So I think that's why people cycle back and forth between those things.
Fundamentally, if you were trying to quote, discover options, then you have to gain knowledge.
2:51
And so you gain knowledge through the way that you are most efficient at it.
Some people read, some people watch videos, some people listen to podcast, some people have conversations.
Me personally, I tend to talk to people.
I'm a verbal processor and so I mean my team knows it.
Like I I have a lot of, I don't want to say like junk conversations, but basically I play things out out loud in front of people and then nine times out of 10, none of that's going to happen.
3:13
But I like having the the sounding board and that's how I process through things with other people and also getting expert opinions of people who've been there or know somebody who has, so that they can give me some insights that I might not be aware of yet.
So I knew a business owner who was getting threatened by his wife to sell his company and it's actually happened a handful of times, unfortunately.
3:39
And so it was very basically like you have to choose me or you have to choose the business.
And the guy usually feels like he doesn't know what to do.
And that's super soul crushing because you're like, man, there's this thing that I really care about, which is my wife and my family.
3:55
And then I had this other thing that I really care about, which is my business.
And then somebody's making an ultimatum, if you have to pick, which is like basically dying to one side of yourself.
And so that's an example of like not knowing what to do, like doesn't know the options or doesn't see a good option in front of him.
4:12
And I think I think that would qualify in my opinion, like you might.
Sure.
But that's usually why when people feel like there's no way out, that's why people get depressed.
They don't, They can't because like, there's always an option.
You can always end it, right?
Like this.
There's always an option, right?
And so it's just there isn't a good option one.
4:29
But people want when they run out of what they perceive as good options is when the sadness just starts spiraling.
In my opinion, I think it was breaking it down into into chunks and saying like, these are not absolutes, these are not, these are not have to's, these are just choices and they have trade-offs.
4:45
And then there's this scene in Suits, which is ATV show.
They said if somebody points a gun to your head, it's not that you have no, like one option.
He's like there's 147 things you can do in that exact moment.
It's like you can duck, you can block, you can punch him, you can try and take the gun, you can do whatever, he said.
5:01
There's a lot of different things that you can do.
And so I love that frame of like, there's 147 things that we can do from what is perceived to be a bad option.
And so usually also to the same degree, the wife or the partner or the spouse or whoever is making this quote threat 'cause it is that it's do this.
5:17
Or else usually it's because they don't have the skills to know that there's another way to accomplish their objective.
Because what does that person really want?
They don't actually want the person to end their business, they want something else, 'cause like they don't actually like the the business owner ending his business doesn't actually do anything.
5:33
They hope that it then creates a a secondary effect which is also a really loose, you know, connection to get what they want.
So simply saying, like, what are you most afraid of and what do you want Most tend to get what way more or what do you want to avoid the most?
I mean that's the fear, right?
5:49
Gets to the heart of the matter.
And it might just be like, I want you to be home more.
OK, well then I can just work from home.
Does that solve it?
And it's like, well, no, I want you to pay more attention to me, it's like, OK, those are different things.
What if I leave, but when I come back I spend 2 hours without my phone with you?
6:04
Would that solve your concern?
Right.
And then she might, you know, where he might say yes.
And so I think it's just getting more dial to and this is the best frame that I can give when it comes to anxiety, sadness or really like any big decision that I have to make is I think, what am I going to change about what I do?
6:23
So a lot of people want to like, they think in theories and concepts, but it gets really hard.
Like, what am I going to do?
So you want me to end my, but like, cool, you want me to end the business.
But what's going to change about my behavior?
What?
What do you want me to do as a result of this happening?
And so then you can get way more time if you just said hi to me and bye to me and remembered my birthday and you know, came to it like just, you know, do I have to come to every kids practice?
6:47
No, just just one a week, OK, Like what do you want me to do?
And then that just gets it way clear and it takes all the emotion out of it because you just get to say what actions do you want me to to act upon.
And then it just gets, the conversation gets so much simpler because it's not you don't have to deal with intentions.
7:02
You you meant to do this.
This was bad.
You're like, it takes out judgment.
It takes out intention.
It's just we want what you want me to do.
I think one of the one of my other favorite frames of thinking through these things is which problem would I rather have?
Because I clearly have a problem right now, and I'm afraid of a different problem, which is why I may be presented with this one.
7:22
But when you actually just start spelling out the downside effects of how it's going to again affect your actions, not your perspectives.
Because if it's only going to affect your mind space, then I'd be like, well, then change your mind, right?
If it's going to affect behavior, then you can outline what behavior is.
And I'll tell you years ago I was in a in a lawsuit around something that I was supposed to have made a material amount of money on, and we ended up winning the, the, the suit.
7:46
But it was when it happened, I thought to myself, OK, what is going to change about what I do in my life?
And I was like, well, in either direction because I was working more at this individual in this business endeavor.
I was like, in either case, I'm going to be doing less work because I'm no longer working with them.
8:03
So I'm going to work less.
And so I either work less and get and don't get paid, or I work less and I get paid.
So either these scenarios are not that bad.
It's all of the judgment and emotions around what I should have gotten, what I deserved, XY and Z that create all the stress around it.
8:19
But if someone said, hey, do you want to just work less and not and just like not get paid for something that you already haven't gotten paid for, I would be like, OK, like it's not that bad of a scenario.
And so just boiling the big amorphous ideas down to what changes about your behavior day-to-day, it's like, is it going to affect how I spend money?
8:35
No, I'm still young.
I'm still married, I'm still healthy and I'm still rich.
It doesn't change anything.
OK, well, then why am I worried about it?
I'm not.
And the flip side is, a lot of people cast judgment on stress itself, and they see stress as a bad thing.
8:51
Stress is just a part of the human condition.
Because you want to know who isn't stressed.
Dead people until the moment you die.
You can always endure it.
And once you die, you won't have to.
Stress means that you are still breathing, which means it's something we can be grateful for.
9:08
So you have to get used to it.
And so, like, the only time you're ever not stressed is if you're dead, because you have no ability to be stressed and it's just a hormonal reaction to get you to do something to change behavior.
And if fundamentally you think about hormones as just triggers for behaviors, then it gets a lot simpler to say, OK, this hormone triggered behavior in the past, which made it conducive to me staying alive.
9:29
Does it necessarily mean that it's helpful for me to live the life that I want to live?
Yes or no?
I don't know.
But at least thinking through that and just boiling it down to what am I going to change about what I what I do makes it a lot easier to manage these things because you just don't have this extra.
The secondary dialogue is where everyone gets in trouble.
9:44
Like I'm stressed, nothing wrong with that.
I'm stressed, therefore I'm a bad person.
I I have problems, I have, you know insert medical label that they want to give me so they can prescribe me drugs Like that in my opinion is the issue, not the stress itself.
10:00
It's funny because like Leila and I sit on opposite sides of the pole.
Like Layla has a penchant for anxiety and action.
I have a penchant for like laziness and not doing anything.
And so we work well together because I I can balance like I'm really just not that stressed that often.
10:17
And that's because my baseline is always death.
I'm like, I'm alive and if I died, I've been dead before so and it wasn't that bad.
So if you're wondering why I say I've been dead before, everyone's been dead before being dead, you weren't alive.
Have you been not been alive before?
10:33
Pretty much all years except for the years of your life.
And so I was dead before I was alive, and I'll be dead after I was alive.
And so in both instances didn't bug me last time.
That's how I see it.
I think a lot of people have negative relationships with stress because they were told that it's bad.
I like someone early on in your it's, it's crazy how much the first exposure to a new thing, the label that someone gives you of good or bad around whatever that behavior or feeling or condition or circumstance is, then determines how you think about it for years and years and years.
11:05
I remember, I'll tell you a funny one, My mom has always tried to like, be in shape and lose weight, and she struggled with that for years.
And I remember when I was super young, like, you know, 10:00-ish, I was just getting into fitness and she was like, you should curl soup cans.
11:21
I was like curling soup cans in the kitchen, 'cause I didn't know.
And she didn't know anybody either.
And she was like, she was taking this thing and said chromium piccolinate on it.
And I was like, what's that?
And she was like, oh, like, helps you build muscle.
And I was like, OK And I remember when I was 24 years later, I'm already a state record holder.
11:38
I own gyms.
I have like, and I remember thinking, oh, Chrome and piccolinate, that's that thing that that makes muscle.
But I know that that's BS.
But I remembered my first instinct deeply being, oh, this is that thing that builds muscle because the 1st and I was like, why do I, why do I think that?
11:56
I know this is BS?
Because the first time it was ever introduced to me, it was from an authority figure who was the only source of information that I had at the time around fitness.
And they said it builds muscle.
And so that was the association I made.
And so I carried that unknowingly until I was made aware of it when I like, when I basically made myself aware of it at 24, having now coached thousands of people on weight loss and and supplements and all these, I just that specific one because it's so niche.
12:22
I hadn't really thought about it and I hadn't revisited my definition on it real quick.
Guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
12:37
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do, that would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
12:55
And so I think a lot of people act the same way with stress is that, like they were told at a young age that this is bad rather than it means you're alive.
Investigating beliefs is super tough because you believe them.
So that's why my favorite quote of all time that'll probably be on my tombstone is from What's this?
13:12
Orson Scott Cart says we question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe in, those we never think to question.
That's my rendition of it, I think, because it's a little bit different, but I like that way better.
So that's my quote.
And I think because that's that's the real, real, it's like we question all of our beliefs except for the ones that we really believe.
13:29
And it, you know, kind of, in a way like the partisanship of society right now with like politics, people like really believe.
And it's like you can trick, like you can really short circuit people by having an article written where they read it about the opposing party of like all the things that that person's done wrong.
13:46
And then you just swap the title and tell them about it's about their candidate.
And then, like, watch their brain try and rationalize because it's so deeply ingrained in their identity, because they believe it.
And so I try to be really careful about things that, like, if I try to rationalize around something, then I know it's pretty deep in my belief system.
14:04
I knew that all these other supplements were BS.
And I also knew from many other years of iterations and learning that it was.
I just hadn't actually hit.
Like I had this big wall of data that hit this one little pocket of knowledge because it's such a niche, weird supplement.
If it had been creatine, you know, I probably heard about creatine 100 times, protein, whatever I'd heard tons of.
14:21
But this one was so niche that I had never poked at this little hole of ignorance.
So the action step that I have is what's my second line of dialogue?
So there's something that happens, and then it's the line of dialogue that happens on top of it.
It's like I am angry.
If you then feel guilty about your anger, or for angry about your anger, or for feel frustrated or Strat, like whatever, it's the secondary judgment on the primary reaction.
14:44
Like that's where people spin out and get in trouble.
They upgrade their problems to much bigger problems.
Like if you get angry and then get angry about your anger, you exponentialize the problem in your life.
Whereas on the flip side, if you had a secondary line of of code or language, that was just like, I am angry, huh, Why is that?
15:02
And just asking why rather than judging what the like, 'cause I think one of the scariest things is feeling out of control.
And so when if I feel an emotion and I don't know why I feel that way, that is always like the most frightening to me, 'cause I like to.
I'd like to know why I'm feeling a certain way.
15:21
And so that's why defining the terms are so important to me, so that I could know how to solve it rather than this is good or bad.
But it's like, I'm horny, I'm tired, I'm angry, I'm hungry, it's sunny, it's rainy.
Like these are just conditions that we can live with until you die and they don't have to live with them anymore.
15:39
Listen, you're going to lose sleep.
You'll doubt whether it'll work, you'll stress to make ends meet.
You won't finish your To Do List.
You'll wonder if you made the right call and have no way to know for years.
This is what hard feels like.
And that's OK.
And so I remember there was this moment, this is, this is like the moment where this is what hard feels like became real for me was I pledged the fraternity way back in the day.
16:02
And every and in my, you know, pledge class at day 14, it's just two weeks in.
There was this big revolt where like this isn't what we signed up for.
Like this is BS like blah blah, blah.
We hate this, etcetera.
Like this needs to end.
And so anyways, the brothers came, they sat us down and we got through it.
Now Fast forward a year or two.
16:18
I was president and I was on the other side.
And the pledge class that we had revolted at two weeks in.
And believe it or not, that happened with every single pledge class without any knowledge that every other pledge class had done this.
And what it was, was a resetting of expectations around reality.
16:35
And so I remember sitting down this class, it was kind of funny because they wanted to meet on home field.
So I went to the freshman campus in one of the dorm rooms where all the guys are there.
So it's like 18 dudes and like me and like my my VP.
And so it's like they have the numbers, you know what I mean?
And and so I was like, OK, guys, I was like when before any of this happened, I was like, who here wanted to be a brother here?
16:54
And they all raised there.
It's like, OK, cool.
I was like, who here thought it was going to be easy And then no one raised their hand.
I was like, right.
I was like, I want you to think right now, like think about this feeling that you have the resentment, the difficulty being tired, feeling, you know, yelled at all that stuff.
17:12
I was like this this feeling you have.
I was like, this is what hard feels like just aren't used to it.
And so they were, it was like all that was was I just relabeled their experience as what they now were expected.
They expected it to be hard.
17:27
They just didn't expect hard to be this.
And so I said no, this is hard.
And they were like, oh, and then everything was fine, just reset reality.
And so I like to think about that with going through business things, going through new endeavors, making content and not working, getting lawsuits like all of these things is like well, did I think becoming a billionaire or a multi billionaire would be easy?
17:51
No.
Well, what I'm going through right now is hard and this is what hard feels like and a lot of hardness in my opinion is actually dealing with uncertainty.
And so a lot of us want a guarantee from a world that will never give us one.
And so we want to know beyond a shout of a doubt that if we do these things, we're going to get this outcome and it just isn't true.
18:09
And so we live in this constant state of turmoil or tension between reality and and our expectations because we want it to be guaranteed and we want it to be worth it and we don't know if it will be.
But that is why it's hard.
And that is why succeeding and persevering despite it being unknown is worth it.
18:26
Because if you play out the alternative scenario where if you know you type in the cheat code, you win all the levels, you lose all the fun.
So if you ever played a video game where you you have the ultimate sword, day one, and you know where every, every monster is and you can't lose because you have an impenetrable shield on it stops being fun.
18:44
And it's the same reason that the Greek gods envied the mortals, because their lives were ephemeral, their lives were, they were mortal, anything could happen, whereas the gods outcomes were guaranteed.
And so we have this perception that we want this thing but if we really were to have that guarantee, it would circumvent the reason it's worth pursuing to begin with.
19:03
And so I try to remind myself of that when I get frustrated where I stand my foot and have a tantrum and say like this isn't fair, I should know this, this didn't work out the way I expected it to rather than like it happened period.
I'm only upset because I had an expectation that I hadn't spoken out loud.
And so a lot of times when I am upset, I think, well what expectation did I have that is unmet and then can I reset the expectation or can I reset reality?
19:24
And most times it's easier to just reset the expectation.
I think people want a challenge that is worth pursuing that matches their Max ability at the time.
And I think that's where it gets difficult because sometimes it's a little too easy and sometimes it's a little bit too hard.
And so you have to know what both of those feel like and be OK with it.
19:44
Because life isn't going to give you a perfect challenge, right?
But what it can do or what it will do is it will give you something that you can endure.
And I think that, and I think that and enduring it itself gives you proof that you can endure more than you originally thought.
And I think that gives you evidence that you can do a lot more.
19:59
And I think that's what gets me motivated even through the hardest times, is that, like, this will be one of the stories I tell not only to others but to myself.
I think that the right levels of challenge are actually where people experience flow.
Like when you're editing a video and you just like, get in the zone.
Or if you're writing ad copy and you get in the zone, you're designing a web page and you get in the zone, or you're writing a book and you get in the zone like painting or you're making music or you're playing video games.
20:21
Like it's.
Now video games do actually adjust reality so that the bosses can get harder or easier for you, but I think we naturally gravitate to the things that match our level of challenge so that time can disappear.
And so I think one of the one of the TLDR is on this is, is just emotions in general.
Like, do you get tired, stressed, sad, hungry, frustrated, unfocused?
20:41
Do you ever feel misunderstood?
Great.
You're human, you don't need medication.
It's just like saying like I it's sunny days and anytime it rains I need to take medication so that it's always sunny.
It has to be sunny.
It must be sunny.
I need it to be sunny.
Why?
20:57
Most of the time it's because we've been told that being unhappy means that there's something wrong with you and I just.
I just wholeheartedly reject that notion.
I think way more unhappiness happens from the judgement on their unhappiness than unhappiness itself ever caused.
One of my best frames around this is is just thinking law of large numbers, which is like, if I have 365 days a year, what are my bottom 10% days going to look like?
21:20
Probably pretty shitty.
Like bottom 10%?
Like, that's a bad, that's that's a bad day.
How many of those a year do I get?
36.
Well shit, there's 12 months in a year.
OK, well, I'm getting three of those a month.
That's actually like fairly, fairly common.
It's every 10 days.
21:36
I have a bottom 10% day, and so I think about that a lot where I'm like, I don't necessarily need to change anything.
I think my plan's fine.
I just need to increase my tolerance for the fact that what bottom 10% days look like, look feel like bottom 10% days and I don't need to change anything at all.
I think the reason that I I like making this content a lot is because I actually do think it relates to business.
21:55
Because what's so interesting is I had a A-Team member shadow some of our quarterlies with some of our portfolio companies and he said something interesting, interesting for him, obvious for me was all these discussions are who problems, not how problems.
22:11
And I was like, yeah, once you get above a million a month, everything's who problems.
And so it's all about the people.
And so I talk about this stuff because like as entrepreneurs you have to be able to keep your head because fundamentally just like it's entrepreneurship comes down to decision making, it comes to allocation of resources.
And so if you can't make consistent decisions in changing environments, then you are not fit to be an entrepreneur or you'll be a less fit entrepreneur.
22:31
And so having these constructs that allow you to reframe reality as not good or bad, but just as things that happened and what am I going to do about it?
It doesn't have to be, you don't have, it doesn't have to be your fault, but it still will be your problem.
And I love that frame.
And so it great got it like it's like the teammates want to figure out whose fault it is on the team.
22:50
It doesn't really matter what are we going to do.
And then that just massively simplifies the conversation into what is actually going to propel the business forward.
And the less time we can spend ideating on fault, intention, blame and just on what actions we're going to take, the faster the organizational move.
And so that usually comes from the top down.
23:06
If you have somebody who's gossipy, who likes to revel in intention, which is one of my least favorite concepts in general.
Because how are you ever going to know someone's intention?
They don't even know their own intentions.
Like there's no point in in wasting all this time to try and figure it out.
Which is also gives lots of questions to the legal system overall.
23:23
But leave that as a as a as an aside, just focusing on action makes everything easier.
I remember when I started my first business, which was a gym, I had no business starting a business.
And the only reason I was able to start the business was because I was ignorant of how deficient I really was.
23:39
Because if I knew what I know now I don't even know if I would have started because it's so hard and I got so lucky so many times to be where I am today.
Just sheer blind luck in a couple instances.
I think working in a small business is a great way to get a much better idea.
I came in knowing not I didn't even know employees were a thing.
23:55
Like I didn't know sales was a term.
Like I really I knew nothing.
Because at one point some of my clients were like, why don't you hire someone?
And it was like a few months in and I just hadn't even thought of the I just did.
I just was like, I'll do everything.
I'll clean, do the books, I'll run the marketing, I'll do the sales, I'll teach all the classes.
24:12
And I was like, I just have to pay rent.
Everything else is mine, right?
Like that was like, I just didn't.
I couldn't.
I also didn't have any more money to pay anyone anyway, so it wasn't even an option that was on the table.
And so that's how ignorant I was going into the entrepreneurial journey.
And so I don't think it's what I think.
It's a contract people sign up for without knowing they sign up for it.
24:29
I think paying off ignorance, that is the single greatest thing that everyone can do in their entire lives until they die.
Like, I think Socrates said, the source of evil is ignorance.
So knowledge would be the ultimate good if you knew everything about everything.
Like, it's kind of like you can't hate someone close up, which I like that terminology.
24:48
Like if you completely understood someone's everything, then you wouldn't be upset with them, you would understand why they are that way.
And so I think that's another, like, there's a lot of frames that I've used over the years and it's because, like, I try to maintain neutrality as much as humanly possible.
I still mess up but if I'm upset with someone it's like I must not understand something.
25:07
It would probably be a source of their sadness or or I guess it could be a source of their anxiety if they if they haven't found a good enough option yet, which I would then relate back to sadness which is they don't know like they don't see a really winner winning option they just see lots of bad ones.
And so yeah, I mean that's why making real business education accessible for everyone has been the mission of the business is like if people have more knowledge they will make better decisions.
25:28
If they make better decisions, they will live better life.








0:00
If you can think a few steps ahead of the person, rather than saying like, oh I'm going to get them, just say like, hey, I don't know if this is going to be equitable in the future, Like give them more and you'll actually start to create a relationship rather than a negotiated contractual agreement.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:21
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I want to give you the keys to having a terrible, terrible partnership.
And the reason that we're going to talk about it in this perspective is because my, my, my big hero Charlie Munger talked about inverted thinking as one of the best ways to solve problems.
0:43
So rather than think, how do I have an amazing partnership, let's think about how would I guarantee a miserable terrible partnership that would definitely ensue in a terrible breakup with lots of lawyers and all the paperwork and just honestly, ideally take forever and result in no benefit.
0:59
Now, as somebody who has a lot of partnerships, it is taking me a very long time to get here.
And I have learned a lot along the way.
And the beauty of having stories is that you can get the lessons without the scars.
And so I will give you, let's see, 1234567891010 different things that you can do to guarantee absolutely atrocious, terrible partnership that you wish you could just not live anymore, right?
1:22
That is.
That's what's going to happen if we can make this partnership as terrible as we're going to shoot for here.
All right.
So #1 is that we're going to make sure that they have the exact exact same knowledge base as you, all right?
So this person that you're going to do business with knows the exact same stuff of you.
There's no stuff that they know that you don't know.
All right?
Because that way, one of you is not unnecessary, all right?
1:40
And so this is a great way to have a terrible start to a partnership, one of you being unnecessary to begin with, which means both of you are giving away half your equity for no incremental benefit.
It's also not very good for the business because why would you do that?
So that being said, #1 have the same knowledge base.
1:55
And maybe even if we're being crazy, which we are, right?
Throw into the same experience experiences, right?
If you both worked at the same place doing the same thing, why not start a business together doing the exact same thing?
Brilliant, I know.
All right, so #2 is time, right?
Make sure that they have the same amount of time as you, all right?
2:13
Or disproportionate.
And what I mean there is the big three on partnerships is knowledge, money, time, right.
Which means they either have to have knowledge you don't have, they got to have money you don't have, or they got to have time you don't have, Right?
And so if you have no time, make sure they don't have time too.
Right now.
If you do have time and they have time, then you're fine.
2:29
But The thing is, is then you'd have to look at one of the other three parts of this equation in order to make sure that's still a terrible partnership.
All right?
So make sure that you're misaligned on time, all right?
The next one is money.
If you're getting into a partnership, if one of you has money and the other doesn't, then that's value.
That's being out of the relationship.
2:45
But if you're going to partner with somebody and they don't have money that you don't have, they don't have knowledge that you don't have, and they don't have time that you don't have, then why would you do the partnership?
I don't know.
But it is a great way to have a terrible partnership.
Now, that being said, let's say that somehow we still figured out a way that we we got in a relationship where one of us didn't have the knowledge they have the time, we didn't have the money that the other person had.
3:04
We got together.
OK, cool.
There's still more ways that we can we can torpedo this thing.
Just wait, Buckle up.
So the next one is that we can make sure that we have different expectations of one another and the business.
All right.
So it's like, hey, what do I expect you to do?
What do you expect me to do?
Right.
And those expectations, we want to make sure, and this is #5 is that there's no agreements.
3:22
We don't record it anywhere.
We don't write it down.
We do it on a handshake because we're old school.
Yeah.
Great way to have a terrible business relationship.
And the reason that people don't want to do that is because usually they don't want to have the hard conversations, all right?
They don't want to say what happens if this goes wrong, right.
And like, what do you expect?
3:37
You really expect me to take the trash out every day?
Like, they want to have this unspoken expectation.
You have unspoken expectations.
You know what's going to be magical?
Where you, you don't actually have to have hard conversation with people.
And if you can't have a hard conversation with a partner before even doing business, before you are even married, before you there is even money or stakes on the table or equity value that's been grown, then dear God, you're not going to have a good conversation at the end.
4:00
So if someone's like, I don't do agreements, just walk away.
I just, I've been doing this like just walk away.
It's only like very, very, very weird people do that.
Like banks.
Banks don't just give you money without expectation.
Like, come on.
Like this is real world.
And I used to.
I remember earlier on I I heard someone tell me that and I was like, oh, I don't want to be the guy.
4:18
It's like I'm the type of person that if you can't shake your hand, then blah, blah, blah.
And I just, I just don't I just don't trust people that much.
So the idea for me is make sure the paper says we needed to say, but then trust the person, right, Which is like I hope that we never have, like I, we write these contracts with the intention of never having to look at them, right.
4:36
But we still use the contract as a vehicle to facilitate dialogue around difficult topics and to have shared expectations in a way that we both understand them and agree, right.
That is the purpose of the contract.
It's not to get lawyers involved.
Purpose of the contract is that we have clear expectation.
4:52
That is why contracts exist.
Clear expectations on agreement.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, drawn out stuff, Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
5:09
You can check on my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into, and if not, keep enjoying the show.
So if we're making sure that we have a terrible partnership, we got to have all the same knowledge, we got to have disproportionate time or money, right?
So all of those things, time, money, knowledge, we're we're all matched on those, which means that one of us isn't necessary.
5:28
On top of that, we have different expectations.
We didn't write it down South.
There's no agreements and there's no expectations of any communicated about what you're going to do, what I'm going to do.
All right, now the next one, this is a big one.
Give away everything, all right.
So make sure that you give away everything in the partnership and do a disproportionate amount of work at the onset because that way you'll just definitely make sure that you can garner resentment towards the other person.
5:47
And the flip side can be true too.
If you know the other person be doing a lot of work, then you think to yourself, huh, well, I'm going to squeeze as much out of them as I possibly can.
Well, what's going to happen?
They're going to resent you and they're going to try and renegotiate later once reality sets in.
So if you can think a few steps ahead of the person, rather than saying like, oh, I'm going to get them, just say like, hey, I don't know if this is going to be equitable in the future.
6:07
Like, give them more and you'll actually start to create a relationship rather than a negotiated contractual agreement, which at the end of the day, that's all contracts are supposed to do, is just outline the expectations between two parties.
That's it.
All right.
Now the next one is that we want to make sure that we have not.
We want to have a misaligned 3 things, mission, values and vision.
6:26
All right.
Which means that we don't actually want to take this business to the same place.
And this may sound hilarious to you, but you would be amazed at the amount of partners that we get on the phone with that.
I'm like, what do you guys want to do this business?
And one person is like, I think we should go this way.
The other person is like, I think we should go that way.
I'm like, I think that you should figure that out, right?
6:42
Or one of you shouldn't be here, right?
Figure it out.
All right.
Which is where do we want to go?
And the next one is the, which is how are we going to get there?
Right.
What are the things that are important to us about how we deal with other humans, right.
What are those values?
And if some people have different values, it becomes very difficult to do business, even if you want to accomplish it the same thing, because you want to do it different ways, right.
7:00
And then it'll create endless strife and conflict throughout.
Now, the last one is what you could consider lifestyle, right, which is what are you similar interests, lifestyle.
It's very difficult to do business with somebody if you're like you're a Dave Ramsey Saver and you, you know you're, you live far below your your means and you're doing business with somebody who lives far above their means and goes into debt all the time.
7:22
Because The thing is, is when you're in a business relationship, you're in a marriage and their extracurricular life is going to get dragged into the business.
I promise you, I promise you, it is going to get dragged in, right?
And so you've got to look just like you.
You marry the girl, you marry the family, that whole thing.
7:39
It's the same thing with business.
If like they've got all this crazy stuff going on in their personal life, it's a great way to guarantee that that stuff is going to trickle into your business.
And The thing is, is if you have an unreliable partner, creates an unreliable relationship which creates an unreliable business.
And so it's a great way to have a terrible partnership.
7:56
All right.
And so when we're thinking about partners, big picture, I give you 2 frameworks and then some in betweens.
So framework one is that they've got to have knowledge, money or time that you don't have.
If both of you have the exact same experience, knowledge, time and money, one of you isn't required.
I know.
Crazy.
8:11
The thing is, is just because you need something, for example, if I need an accountant for business, doesn't mean I have to partner with my accountant, which means I have to pay them for services.
So just because you have a need doesn't mean they have to have equity.
All right, So big aha moment here.
If you're like, well, I don't know how to do that.
And he does.
It's like, well, can you pay someone to do it?
Like, equity is the most expensive thing that you give up in a relationship.
8:28
So you want to make sure, if you especially want to build something big, that you're giving away equity to people who are going to really drive the growth.
And you have to see this thing ten years in the future, which no one thinks. 10 years in the future anyways, which is why everyone's small.
OK, so boom.
So knowledge, money, time.
You got to check those boxes, make sure that you're aligned there.
Next one is expectations, agreements, All right.
8:45
Make sure that they're equitable.
Make that they're well understood and making sure that they're documented right.
If you do those things, then it's very, very it's much less likely that you're going to have a turbo partnership.
You can still have one, but it's much less likely.
All right.
And point of this is to guarantee a turbo partnership.
All right.
Now, the next big framework is that mission, values and similar interests.
9:03
It actually works the same way in marriages as dozen partnerships.
And to be real, it's very similar.
So you got to make sure that you want to do the same thing with the business.
Big picture, you got to make sure you want to do it the same way, right?
And then you got to have similar interests in lifestyles, right, Which is making sure that they don't have a messy life, which is you want to be proud to associate with the other person that you're doing business.
9:20
And I'm saying proud, not OK with, but proud to associate with them.
You want other people to meet them, just like you want to meet, you know, the girl meets the parents.
You want to be proud to present this person now like, ah, crap, right.
Big picture, great ways to guarantee a terrible partnership is if you do all those things, all right?
So on the flip side, make sure that if time, money and knowledge that you don't have right, either they got money you don't have, they got time you don't have, they don't they have knowledge you don't have or experience, right.
9:43
So they can bring something to the table that you don't really have.
So one of you or both of you are required and that the company grows based on the shared skill sets that both of you have.
All right.
You want to make sure that you set expectations, that you document them, and then you make sure that they're equitable, All right?
Because if you do that, then it's very unlikely that you're going to fail, all right?
10:00
And the next one is that you want to make sure that there's aligned mission values and similar interests.
You want to deal with the types of people who see the world the same way as you have the biggest long term goals, and they want to do the process of getting from where you are to where you want to go the same way you do.
And the easiest limit test is if you to present both of you with the same data.
10:19
Would you make the same decision?
If these answers yes, then you'll have far less conflict in your partnership over the long haul.
And so the idea is, can I find people who have complementary skill sets but align mission values and interests?
If you can do that, you can make room for a magical rather than terrible partnership.








0:00
20 year olds stay poor because they start trying to earn rather than trying to learn.
They did a survey of high school seniors. 52% believe that they will be a millionaire by 25.
It's delusion.
You can try and roll the dice and have a one in 1000 shot of being a millionaire in 90 days or I can guarantee that you'll be a millionaire in a decade.
0:21
Which would you prefer?
And so I want to give you a quick example of two guys about the same age that took two very different directions in life.
One of them went to another guy who is a little bit older, tried to learn the basics of editing video, use the buddy to get a job interview and he'd learned enough that he could get a job offer.
0:38
This particular company had a huge suite of other people who significantly more advanced creative director who's done multiple big brands that he had the ability to learn from.
He gets a $60,000 offer which is solid amount of money crediting with basically no experience.
Who then?
0:54
Rather than accept the job, he asked for $3000 more because what he thought he had to do was earn rather than learn.
The business is obviously not going to do that.
What this guy does is he starts trying to negotiate back and forth, wheels and deals, and then eventually gets a job to be the lead head honcho of video editing at some small business that has no other mentors.
1:15
There's no other people ahead of him.
He took the right hook in his career 12 weeks after getting into it, and now they're the ones who are trying to extract as much from him rather than coming into a business where he's the small man on the totem pole and you can learn from everyone else, which would maximize for his long term net worth.
1:31
When you're early on, you learn this much and you think you know everything and it's something called the Dunning Kruger effect.
The more you learn in a specific skill, the more you realize you don't know other guy, same idea, wanted to make money but had zero skills because he's 17 years old.
1:47
Of course you would have no skills, he decided because he talked to a mentor who's all of them and said, hey, I think you have a proclivity for sales.
I think you'd be good at.
He said whatever the minimum quota is that they tell you to do an activity, double it.
This was a sales role and so he was required to do 100 calls a day.
He did 200 calls a day.
2:02
Why?
Because he's not a skilled, so he has to do twice the work in order to get the same output as somebody who's more experienced.
The mentor also said go and spend as much time as you possibly can with the number one guy.
Listen to everything he does and watch what he does.
That's what he did.
And then he proved himself as #1 on that bottom team.
Then he got promoted.
2:17
The youngest guy there worked his way up.
What he realized was that no one was going to give him respect based on his age.
He stacked his way up, stacked his way up, then became one of the top closers in the company where many people were experts at sales.
He was able to learn from them because he was hungry and he did extra hours.
Now, at this point in his career, he could right now probably start $1,000,000 your business, or he could reinvest and so he got another opportunity to work at a much more prestigious company.
2:43
Or he'll get even bigger and better experience.
And guess what?
He's going to get paid less than he was making his current job.
Why would he do it?
Because he's smart, not thinking short.
If you go for the earning early, you stop the learning.
And the moment you stop the learning is when you decide and you tell the universe that I have made enough.
3:00
This is enough for me.
Start at the bottom and learn every skill along the way.
Kobe Bryant was famous for doing this where he would do 2 practices a day.
My name.
Is Kobe Bryant 17 years old?
Fridays and Saturdays.
I would go to my rec room with my basketball and basically dribble myself to sleep.
3:18
I think that that was the best thing that could have ever happened to me because doing those lonely hours in the rec room, I discovered the hunger, the motivation and the desire to be the best possible basketball player that I could be and he.
Thought if everybody else does one practice a day, if I do 2A day, I will get better faster.
3:33
And in the beginning the difference is not that noticeable.
But after five years and then ten years, he becomes unbeatable.
Whether you're trying to get into law or you're trying to get into accounting, or you're trying to get into sales, or you're trying to get into marketing.
Whatever the core activity that you do, making videos, making ads, writing sales pages, actually doing sales calls, whatever it is, if you do 2 times or four times the volume, you will get better faster and pay down your ignorance debt at a faster rate.
3:58
That compounds.
He has compounded the number of hours in the trenches learning the thing.
Respect is always earned and the younger you are, the more you have to earn it.
And you can either resent the world for not giving you respect with that you do not deserve or you can go get it.
Hustle across age.
Gender culture is always respected.
4:16
It's one of the universal currencies respect, but the problem is that people want the respect before they do the hustle.
What the killers look like in their 20s, who become the killers in their 30s Don't look like the kid with the Lambo on the watch.
What they look like is hungry as fuck to learn and work.
4:33
If you can humble yourself and you realize the Dunning Kruger effect exists, that you think you know more than you do when you start because you don't know anything.
That's why Socrates said the more I know, the more I realize I know nothing.
One of the smartest, wisest people in the world says he knew nothing.
I'm going to flip to my employer hat for a second.
If someone comes in, if they're in the earnings season, I will work you because I know that this is the only exchange.
4:55
If you come in and I know you're in a learning season, then we will be so generous with how much we can give and reinvest in you.
The exchange when you're coming in and I have to pay you above to get you to come here, means that I have to extract more value from you than I pay you.
That's the fundamental of business.
But if you come in with a a learning hat on, then that business owner understands that maybe in five years not going to be there, they can be like, cool, how can I assist you in your career?
5:17
What skill sets do you feel like you lack?
I can pair you with people in the company who are further ahead in you and help you get mentorship within our company and you learn for free.
And not only that, I'm going to pay you to learn.
So the most important thing you have to realize when you're in your 20s is what season you are in.
You have to stop comparing yourself to people who are earning more than you because it means that what they're doing is often shortchanging their long term earning.
5:38
For short term earning, there is a time for the earning, but the moment that you decide to make that Red Hook, it's going to be hard to come back because you're going to earn more.
And you decide that from here on out, you can't really learn much from people ahead of you because they're not going to give to you the same way you would if you were in their business.
Your ability to provide value will compound with time, especially as you start pairing skills.
6:01
If you think about the Jay-Z, in the beginning of his career, the first thing he did was he learned how to rap.
Jay-Z the babyson.
You're time.
Master, they're gonna run master.
They're gonna last.
Jay-Z ROM.
So you could say y'all to prove they line.
And then he started learning how to promote another skill, significantly more money.
6:17
And then after that figured out how to do a record label and distribute even more money.
And then after that, he figured out how to recruit other artists and get them sound on his label even more money.
And So what happens is that he still needs these early skill sets, even though he didn't monetize them hard.
There, he monetized them big.
Later, skills will compound.
6:34
If you have 1 + 1 + 1, it doesn't equal 3 when it comes to skills.
If you are good at math, cool.
If you learn bookkeeping a little bit more, if you learn how to become an accountant even more.
If you start understanding taxes and insurance, all of a sudden you're ACFO.
Now, if you start understanding M&A and mergers, entity structures, all of a sudden you're not only ACFO, you are a rainmaker.
6:54
You're somebody who can bring in deals, execute deals, etcetera.
The earning potential difference between somebody who's an accountant and a rainmaker is 10s of millions of dollars per year.
So one of my heroes, Warren Buffett, he finished top of his class at Columbia Business School.
Somebody finished this top of their class at Columbia can get a job paying very well in most places.
7:12
But guess what he did?
He asked Ben Graham to let him work at his investment firm for free.
Ben Graham was one of the goats of investing at the time when Warren Buffett was just a kid coming out of college.
Chance to study under him.
It shaped my professional life.
7:28
And guess what Ben Graham said to him when he asked him to work for him?
He said you're overpriced.
Ben Graham knew, just as Warren Buffett knew, that even though he was working for free, it was going to cost Ben Graham more to deliver all of the skills and all of the things that he would need to be successful than the monetary compensation.
7:45
But because Warren Buffett is smart, he realized that he was in a season of learning and not earning, yet he was willing to invest as one of the greatest investors of all time in the thing that was most important and valuable to him at the time himself.
And he did it for free.
I'm going to flip this real quick and tell you a little bit on my own story if you want this.
8:02
I finished Magna Kablati in three years at Vanderbilt.
I could earn decent amount of money at most places graduating like that.
And then took a consulting job that was paid less than most of my other people were because I could work directly with the CEO.
So I was going to learn more.
I then gave up on the consulting career to do fitness.
8:19
The first move I made was I asked 40 different gym owners if I could work for them for free.
Mind you, I was a Magna cum laude graduate, vice president of the powerlifting team.
I was president of fraternity, came from a consulting background.
Like I had a lot of skills, but I realized that I was going to be getting more out of the exchange than the person who I was working for.
8:37
And so I asked to work afraid.
He started to employ me and he eventually started paying me minimum wage.
I would have to swallow my pride in order to take that job, but it was one of the best investments I ever made.
And rather than compare myself to the people who are earning more than me and I'm going to be real with you, I did, and it hurt.
8:53
But if you learn from one of the best in the industry of anything, you should be paying them.
And the fact that they will accept you at any price is worth it every time.
It would be like me going to Elon Musk and saying I'll be your assistant.
He offers me $100,000 a year.
Alex, I would like to offer you $100,000 per year to be my assistant.
9:12
And me being like I'll come for 200.
Actually, you're stupid.
Never mind.
Think about how stupid that is.
That's the decision 20 year olds make every day.
Or I'm hoping that Mosey Nation, you aren't like that.
You're willing to make the long term trade.
Because when you have this track record, this stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are, you have done what you say you've done.
9:31
You don't need to pretend.
You don't need to front because you have the experience and then people will respect you because of what you have done, not what you say.








0:00
The only way to get good at something is to do a lot of it.
And when you start, you suck.
And so a lot of the time there's this fallacy of finding the right thing or the perfect fit.
But one, almost every entrepreneur that I know has had many, many, many businesses, and mostly many failures before they had their success.
Welcome to the.
0:18
Game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
People have made a lot of money.
People have huge exits, people that have private jets and multiple homes and massive bank account.
0:35
Do you think the people that you know who have a lot of money are typically happier?
Or do you know more people who are wealthy who are unhappy than happy?
I.
Think it depends on how they got their wealth.
So I think if they were given their wealth, absolutely, I would say bar none, they are not as happy and I think it I don't even get into the why.
0:57
I'd say that's just my observation for the people who earn their wealth.
I would say many of them are are probably the same same smorgasbord as the rest of society.
Maybe with like one movement upwards because money cannot buy happiness, but it can help you avoid pain.
1:13
And so I think that is the that's the hard part that is difficult.
It's the same thing as health where like you can, you know, money can help get the hospital, but you know, get you out of the hospital, hypothetically.
But it's not going to get you into super Super fitness status.
1:29
They're they're completely different continuums that people see is one straight line.
And I removing pain versus gaining joy, I think are two completely different journeys.
And so I think money helps absolutely decrease the punishment that we experience in life.
And the pains that we have to deal with are inconveniences, for sure.
1:46
Why do you think?
Some people?
I agree with that.
And there's also some outliers where it seems like people with a lot of money almost have more problems, more pain, more stress, more overwhelmed.
Maybe it's too much to handle, or everyone wanting something from them, or everyone's expecting something now from them.
2:02
How do you learn to manage the approval or people pleasing of others once you have more money, Especially your own family, your own friends who are now saying, oh, you've gone beyond where the rest of us are financially.
And I want some of that or I have an expectation.
2:18
How do we overcome that navigate it?
I wholeheartedly reject all of it.
Project What?
All of it.
Any any expectations of me.
And so my my litmus test for doing deals, for giving jobs, any of those things for people that I know is that you have to.
2:35
It's actually the first conversation I had with Leila when we were it was our first date so our first date.
I pitched Leila on quitting her job and working for me because I was like, this might not work out, but you should totally work for me.
We'll make a bunch of money together.
And I said this compensation has to make sense for you independent of our relationship.
2:54
So like if we're not together, does this still make sense?
If it makes sense, then we're cool.
It's on your first day of dating.
Yeah.
If we're not together in a week or in two months, would this still work for you?
Yeah.
Yes, yeah, it's clear.
It's all talent you know, and and I think and I think that that litmus test has served incredibly well for me is like if you want to hire your mom, would you give somebody with your mom's experience the bookkeeping job now if she's if she's a 20 year bookkeeper?
3:25
Then yeah, maybe.
Maybe, and to be fair, but would you pay the bookkeeper $200,000 a year?
I don't know.
Probably wouldn't.
So I believe in making all deals as though you weren't friends or you have no relationship and if it still makes sense then all of the relational benefit becomes as a bonus rather than I'm going to amend the terms of the deal because of this amorphous value that we have which can change.
3:52
But the if the deal is made logically then conditions can change and you will still both always feel good about the deal because it was made without the relational.
Because sometimes you have good days with your mom sometimes you have bad days with your mom and all of a sudden you're like I can't put and pay your turn around here right.
I wouldn't.
She messed up the books and he'll she embarrassed she took a course online.
4:07
You know whatever.
Right.
And so but like but people make that mistake all the time.
And so I think that it has been significantly easy for me to just say like would I give you the role or would I give you the thing if you were a stranger.
And if the answer's no, the answer's no.
And if that person really wants it, that'd be like to do the same things a stranger would do.
4:25
And then I'll have a reason be up.
Now if I have two candidates and they're identical which would be a possible.
But if they're identical, then yeah, maybe I would give it.
But like they have to still meet all the standards and then that way you give objective quantitative, you know, like do these things and then we can have this outcome, right?
4:42
Seems like a lot of young people want to make a lot of money.
People, people are running alive.
But it seems like you know, at least of them thinking of social media context, you see a lot of young people in their in their 20s, early 30s that are striving for that, and they're striving for it fast.
4:59
They're striving for it.
You know, I just graduated college and I want to get there in the next couple of years.
What do people in their 20s not understand about making money or reaching millionaire status that they really need to know before they hit that?
So I will probably answer this differently than you expect.
5:18
I believe that sex is colorblind, age blind, everything blind, because there are certain activities that you have to do.
If you do the activities, you can get the outcome now.
If you're in your 20s, it's very difficult to do the amount of activities for a long enough period of time in order to get that.
5:36
Now, you know, you've got Ben Francis, who started Gym Shark when he was, whatever, 16 or 17 years old.
And he's when he's 28, it was worth over a billion.
So he was in his 20s and it was, you know, he made a billion dollar company.
Is that the exception?
For the most part, yeah.
That's not as common.
You know, I made my.
I became a millionaire when I was 26, six or 26.
5:55
I can't remember it was between 26 and 27 is when I became when I had my first $1,000,000 in my bank account and so.
But I started business when I was 22 and so I still had had five years in and now that's still fast.
6:11
Don't get me wrong it's still fast but the accumulation of knowledge because I spent almost all of my excess income on education and so I wanted to I wanted to pay down the ignorance tax as fast as possible.
We could it's rather than buy the Bentley or buy the watch so that I could flex on it.
I still lived, split a room in a house with six other people while I was making 20,000 with take home because I wanted to have all that money so I could go on the offense.
6:33
If I wanted to go to a seminar or buy a course or go to a workshop or whatever it was so that I could up level my skills and get there faster.
And so I think the idea that you want to get there fast is fine.
It's just having a realistic expectation of how many skills you need to acquire to get there.
Because if you have all the skills because I think we'll have continuously younger and younger and younger millionaires and billionaires that are going to continue to happen because now a viral ID.
6:54
I mean Taylor Swift was 16 when she started recording music.
That was a long time ago, right?
She's 33 now.
She.
Keeps showing up consistently and building it.
Distribution.
She's 24.
Crazy.
So like it's it's going to continue to to go down as the access to education increasingly gets democratized so more people can access it for free.
7:14
And so a nine year old can watch.
Like there's nothing that stops a nine year old from making and running a Facebook ad.
There's nothing like and usually they're more tech savvy anyways.
Maybe there's got to get a credit card.
Sure.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And so they're but the but if we break it down to like the physics or the action, it's not that hard.
7:30
There's nothing that prevents people.
And so I think that the level of competition will continue to rise.
I think young people are more tech savvy and so will in general have a continuously improving competitive advantage over older people because the rate of technological change hastens goes faster.
And so the the advantage of being young versus old is actually I think going to continue to to expand because tech moves so fast now that I think there will be more.
7:54
What do you think about, I mean, I had a mentor once told me when I was 24 when I was broke on my sister's couch and I was living for free and I was not paying rent.
I was, you know, eating leftovers.
Good life, man.
And I remember saying to a mentor, I was like, man, I could really use some money right now.
8:13
Like I could really figure out how to make some more money.
And he said, money comes to you when you're ready for it.
I feel pretty ready.
He goes, yeah, it could, you know, maybe you get it and you're not ready and you you lose it all because you're not emotionally ready.
So what advice do you have to people in their 20s who want to make a lot of money, but if they're not emotionally ready, what might happen to them?
8:39
Everything is trainable.
And so if like, if we define handling money as a skill, then it can be learned.
And so if you and you can, you can look at anything.
Like if you were somebody who continues to hop from thing to thing to thing to thing to thing and you can't stick with it, it's usually because you don't have the skill of sticking with something.
8:55
You haven't been rewarded enough in the past for staying with something, or you haven't been burned enough from starting over like on your fifth time of starting yet another thing and not getting deep enough on it.
You have to think to yourself, maybe this isn't the right way to do it.
I love giving this kind of like S curve analogy, which hopefully your audience will enjoy, But there's five stages.
9:12
I see it as somebody goes through the entrepreneurial journey.
When they're starting out in the beginning, you've got the midline, right where they start.
Step one is they go above the midline and this they go to uninformed optimism.
They see the grass on the other side.
It looks greener and they're like, my buddy's doing drop shipping and he's making all this money and that's going to be me.
9:28
And then they buy the course, They start watching videos.
They start to connect things.
Things break.
They, you know, buy some info.
They don't have much to buy.
And all of a sudden they go to the .2, which is now below the line, which is informed pessimism.
So it's hard.
Yeah, They find out all the things that they didn't know in the beginning.
They paid down some ignorance debt, but there's still more to pay.
9:44
And they're like, OK, wow.
So they keep going because they're like, I got to figure this out.
And then they go to .3, which is the value of despair, right?
Which is where they're like, this isn't going to work, This is never going to work.
And one of the hardest costs, and this is like what entrepreneurship feels like if I can, if I can give it to anyone who's new to this, is the feeling of uncertainty that you don't know if all of the work that you've been spending all of your nights and weekends and off time investing in will ever pay off.
10:09
And so it's this fear that you're wasting your time, but the reality is that the outcome isn't the thing that you're building.
The person you are is the person that you're building.
And that continues to work.
And so there's a proverb in the Bible, I'm gonna butcher it, but I think it's an all labor.
There is profit.
10:24
And you can rephrase that as I like, as the work works on you more than you work on it.
Say it again.
The work works on you more than you work on it.
And so it's about who we become while doing the work more than the outcome from the work itself.
Because, like, I lost everything five years into my entrepreneurial journey, but I still had all the skills and beliefs that I had from before that.
10:44
And then I was able to reapply those and then have a really, you know, big outcome and what we have today.
And so I remember when I lost everything the first time.
I thought, did I just lose five years of my life?
Like, I just, I just moved back.
I'm at Ground Zero again, but I wasn't because I had all these skills that I had learned, oh, you know, owning and scaling 6 gyms at that point.
11:00
And so .1 Uninformed Optimism, .2 Informed Pessimism, .3 Dive Despair, and then go to .4, which is Informed Optimism.
So now you do have a lay of the land.
Do you understand that there's some skeletons?
You do have to understand how you, you know, manage some inventory.
11:17
You got to get ahead of some of the stuff that you start.
You learn how to forecast.
You can know that weekends you tend to do better, and weekdays you tend to do less.
And so you can dial back support on those days and dial it up on the other days.
You start to recognize patterns.
This you start to start to know what you're doing, right.
You started paying.
You're paying down all the ignorance debt.
And then finally step five as you achieve whatever the original goal was.
11:36
But the problem is that most people go step 123 and then they jump back to step one.
With something new.
Right.
And so they go to the yet yet again, the grass is green or the other side.
But what they don't know is that it's still fertilized with manure.
They're still on the other side too.
And so there's always everywhere.
11:52
Let me get to real estate now.
Let me get into this right.
And we do whole styling and day-to-day, right.
Of course there's all these, you know, quick make money things.
But if you look at the people who are making the most money in it, they spent usually a significant amount of time.
And I'm.
I'm saying this again but I'm bearing for repetition is that the rocky cutscene last two minutes in movies in might last five years for most people or Ted and I remember my So my neighbor I met who was 15 years old, he now works for us at acquisition.com.
12:17
But he this is a this is a cool story.
So he's 15 years old and he's like, I want to be an entrepreneur.
And so I'm, you know, he worked out with me every day for a couple years at my home gym.
And so he.
Sees Jack now.
Never, never more Jack than me.
12:34
And so he then goes to college and after his first semester he's like, I don't know, like this is, you know, I'm studying business and I was like, dude, are you willing in this or not?
Are you really doing this?
And he's like, well, you know, I just, I'm not school's not really blah blah blah.
And I said the world doesn't need another 3-1 business degree.
12:53
Either crush school or don't go.
If your goal is entrepreneurship.
He's like, well, I want to be an entrepreneur.
And so I apparently told him this, that he remembers because he's he brings it up all the time.
But I said you are afraid of going all in on entrepreneurship because staying in college is safe from an approval perspective.
13:11
So you're doing all these side things, but you don't have to bear the brunt of not a failing because you're still in school.
It's like so you need to.
Give exactly.
And so he quit school.
And then he started on the call floor of my of Jim Lodge.
Now that's not glorious.
13:27
And to be fair to the point we're making earlier, I said I can't get to the job.
I won't give you a job so I can get you an interview.
I was like, it's going to be up the sales manager.
And I'm not going to tell them that I know you.
He was like, OK, I was like, you better be prepared.
And so he did get the job.
To be fair, the qualifications for frontline caller is not not surprised.
13:44
And the reason that I started him there was because I actually walked in on him one day when he was waiting for me to go work out.
And I heard him on the phone trying to do one of these wholesaling, you know, real estate deals.
And I said, you know, to close the deal.
And he said, I know.
And he said I'm not sure of real estate.
You know, the wholesaling thing's for me.
14:01
I said, well, have you heard you on the phone?
And I was like, what do you mean?
I was like, you sound horrible and you can't sell anything.
On the skill of.
Course, he said.
Well, how do I get good at sales?
I was like, you work on a sales team with somebody who's been there before and can tell you what to do.
And so I got him the interview.
14:18
He took the job, he became the top salesman on the on the setting team and then he became sorry, the outbound team.
Then he went to the setting team to the second rung of salesman.
They qualify the leads, they became the top one there.
And then he got to the top of the Christmas tree, which is closers, and became the top closer.
14:34
He learned.
Skills 26 guys, Wow, Big team.
And a lot of these are men.
You don't have families, kids.
Wow.
And how much can you make as a top closer?
250. 250 a year?
Yeah, it's pretty good money.
Yeah, it is good money.
For a 21 year old, 22 year old, yeah.
Yeah, 19 at the time. 19 making 250 Yeah, that's life changing.
14:53
Of course.
And you had to learn how to talk to men.
Talking to gym owners, 4 year old gym owners telling them how you can help them with their business.
Wow, right.
Takes balls.
And so I, I, I, I, I bring that up to say is that when you were when you're starting out, you need to focus on learning rather than earning.
15:10
Now he obviously earned, but it was because he quickly fast tracked his learning process.
And so I think one of the biggest hacks in the world is getting paid to learn.
Like right now we have this big societal context of like you pay in order to learn but what if there were a world where you could get paid to learn?
15:28
Well that is what working at a company is if you're mindful of what career path you want to get into.
Now if you're like, I don't know what I want to do then I would recommend starting with a meta skill.
So sales is going to like if you learn how to sell it'll work in any company.
You're if you learn how to market or work in any company.
I mean to be fair if you get into HR, zillion businesses in each of HR stuff if that's what you like.
15:47
If you're like I don't know what I like.
Well, you're also aren't going to like anything unless you start because we usually only like things that we're good at and we usually aren't good at things that we start right.
And so the only way to get good at something is to do a lot of it.
And when you start, you suck.
And so a lot of the time there's this fallacy of finding the right thing or the perfect fit.
16:04
But one, almost every entrepreneur that I know has had many, many, many businesses and mostly many failures before they had their success.
It's because each one of them stair stepped.
And so there's this paralysis where I'm like, I got to pick the right thing and it's really, you got to pick something and then you'll learn all the inadequacies that you have no idea about once you get into it.
16:22
Like, I started a gym when I was 22 years old.
Like brick and mortar.
Signed a lease, Yeah.
You showed 1000.
It was stupid.
I had no idea what I was doing, but I did have.
I did sign.
I was, you know, kudos to younger me.
I had a mentor early on who was in the gym world.
16:38
Right, so you could give advice to learn from.
Yes, I mean, still, it was still incredibly hard.
But I got I was able to just get, you know suck everything like a, you know, fire Firehouse, like a vacuum cleaner to get all the information I needed to just barely keep my head above water until.
16:54
And then things started to work out because I just, I would, every weekend I'd go and drive over to a gym owner and say why do you do this?
Why is your lobby like this?
How many leads do you convert?
How do you call like, whatever?
And so I just kept doing that every single weekend because I was such a young guy.
Everyone would help this guy before.
Exactly.
And I have a lot to I owe a lot to those older entrepreneurs who helped me out.
17:10
And so in some ways, a lot of what I do at acquisition.com is kind of my, my small way of paying it forward.
Hey, MOS Edition, Quick Break.
Just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, so send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
17:26
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with.
Tag them in one of my relayless posts and I will give you all the love of the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show and.
One of the cool things is when you're someone who's getting started and you're going out and humbly asking for advice, but you're taking the actions.
17:44
Hey, I'm launching this thing.
I'm taking the steps.
I'm just trying to figure it out.
But I'm taking the actions and I'm in the process.
People usually want to give it advice and support and say, hey, why don't you come check out and we'll go out for lunch whenever it is.
But if you're just saying I want to do this, but I'm not taking any action, people are less likely to help you.
18:03
Maybe they'll help you a little bit, but they see you struggling and trying and like leaping before you're ready.
It's like, all right, cool, Let's help you get it going.
I love the saying Luck favors the prepared.
So like if you if you want to go ask you know Louis to have you on or to get Louis on your show, right?
18:21
Well what do you do?
You don't just ask Louis.
You show how much you've prepared.
You say, hey, I went through 50 hours of your content.
These are 9 questions that have never been asked you before that I think would be really good.
I've got two guys, two buddies of mine from college who are going to also video it.
I've I've got this church basement that I can get the lighting to look really cool so we can make cinematic because for real, I know I don't have the audience that you have but I can help at least give you clips that will distribute and actually convert for you and hopefully that's another value add.
18:49
Now Louis might not say yes, but if you do that 100 times, counting hundreds, one Louis will say yes.
And everyone loves to help people who help themselves always.
Because the biggest fear that anyone who gives advice has is that someone takes the advice and does nothing.
19:06
Exactly because they won't.
They didn't learn.
They didn't change their behavior.
That's true.
Right.
It's a waste of the time.
So you don't feel like you're teaching.
You only teach if they change their behavior.
If they change their behavior, they learned.
And so everyone, Many people like being a teacher.
I think a teaching role is nice.
I think most people feel good about it, but you only feel like you have a teaching role if you see a change.
19:24
And someone takes action, yeah.
And you can you can hack the whole system if you just show people that you'll take take initiative. 100% if you take.
And that's what happened for me early on.
I was just taking a lot of action and people like, they wanted to add me in the room.
They wanted me at the table because I was willing to take action.
Even though I was young and broke and struggling.
19:40
They were like, hey, this guy's showing up and go to every conference that I could in kind of the social media blogging world early on and somehow get to the late night dinners at 2:00 AM with all the speakers and they'd be like, hey, why don't you come tag along, young guy?
You know you're bringing us a lot of joy at least, right?
19:56
Even though you have no clue what you're doing, you can't offer anything else but joy.
But you're asking me some interesting questions that people don't.
So yeah, I'm happy to talk about myself for another 20 minutes.
Totally.
And you get in the room, you get access and you take action.
People will want to keep supporting you totally because you're applying their teachings and people like that.
20:15
Makes that feel important.
It does.
It validates.
Oh, I know something about my you know what I'm doing.
And that's good.
You want to keep helping this person grow.
What do you think your 85 year old self needs to tell you now to get to where you want to be faster?
Oh, it's funny that that was the question.
20:35
I mean, he would tell.
Me he have the mentors.
Yeah, no, I mean he would tell me why do you want to go faster, be like, why?
Why can't it take 10 times as long?
From 200 to a billion sure.
Why not like?
Why?
Why?
Does it need to be five years or 10 years?
Why can't it be 50 years, right?
20:51
If you if it took 50 years, but then it all happened at once at the end, would you like that?
I don't know.
Right.
It's, you know, it's kind of like the the man who lives an amazing life and the last day everyone finds out he's a fraud.
Or the man who lives his entire life with everyone think he's a fraud and then the last day of his life he's proven right.
21:07
Which would you rather be?
If you're gone, you're not going to get the experience, the fruit of it all like.
Interesting question though.
Yeah, it's like the painters that become famous once they're dead.
Yeah.
And so I think I mean 85 year old me.
I'll tell you the recurring things that he works on with me.
Patience is a big one.
Focus is a big one.
21:24
Sticking with what I committed to focusing on the controllables of like, what are the activities, what are the actions that I have to take, And being OK with potentially varied outcomes.
Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, but being consistently divorced from the outcome.
21:41
But trying my absolute damnedest to make sure that everything that is in my control was done to the utmost.
And I like we started there, but I just like it's hard to understand the context.
Like you hear this, you hear people say this like it's about the journey, not about the destination.
21:58
And you hear people say, like, you know, it's it's it's about, it's about doing the stuff.
It's not about the outcome.
And you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, It's easy for you to say when you have the outcome.
Right when they've already made the money, of course.
Of course I get it.
But if you can, if you can make that flip like it's just the hard part is the action is so much greater.
22:17
If you really measured yourself by the actions you take, then you might be embarrassed.
So you really hope to measure yourself on the outcome because you can get by on sometimes winning when you don't deserve it.
And so 85 year old Lee never lets me win when I don't deserve it.
22:36
Oh man, I would rather lose, but now I gave my all then win and be like, I just kind of just barely showed up today, right?
You wouldn't know I won, but it's because I had an inferior opponent.
It's not because I played my best.
It sucks to lose to know man, I was freaking gave everything.
22:54
Every ounce of my energy and every trick and skill that I had to play this game and win it.
I came short.
It's going to sting.
It's going to hurt.
But at least I know I don't regret the effort that I put in.
And I can be like, here's a great example.
23:10
This still haunts me today. 2002, it was October, so it's 21 years ago, is that right?
October 2012?
Yeah, almost.
Almost 21 years ago.
Is that what it was 2002?
We're playing.
I'm playing football at Principia College small school in Illinois and we as my sophomore year there.
23:34
My freshman year I went to another school, so I transferred into this school.
We're playing and it's a tight, tight game at home, back and forth.
Can't remember the final score, but with this, by a touchdown I score 3 or 4 touchdowns.
23:53
I think I got an an extra point.
I got a two point conversion and I had 17 catches for 418 yards and we lost.
In the last couple plays we didn't score to to go and win and I remember being the last one out of the locker room.
I was in the shower.
24:08
I was so upset that we lost.
And my coach comes in, It's kind of an awkward moment because I'm in the shower, you know, an exposed open shower.
You know, I'm just like kind of pouting and like sad and depressed or whatever.
And just like in there, everyone's gone.
I'm sad we lost the game.
24:24
And he kind of comes around the corner and says, hey Louis, good game.
Just to let you know, you broke a world record today.
And I go, what?
And I go, what do you mean?
And he goes, yeah, you had 17 catches from 418 yards.
24:41
No one's ever done that in the history of a football game, Your new NCAA all record holder and I go, I'm sad and depressed and angry because I didn't do more to help us win and we lost.
And at the same time I hear that I did something that no one in the history of the world had ever done in the football game.
25:02
And it was it was tough because I felt like, man, we lost, but I gave it everything.
But I was like but.
Could I still give it more?
It's like, I don't know, but I feel like, you know, at least we didn't win.
I played to a lower level and didn't create that result.
At least I created something that for me, I can get proud of.
25:19
Even if we lost, it still haunts me that we lost.
Interesting.
But it's but I know because we were behind, I had to give so much more that I.
Was capable of and.
If we were winning, I wouldn't have gotten that effort out of myself, so it's an interesting dynamic.
25:36
It is because I would wonder if you had that same exact experience but you didn't break the world record or no one ever told you whatever, right.
If you would still because you said that you had the sting of the loss.
And I wonder if Lewis today would feel that way.
Because if you because you said like, I don't know if I could have given more.
25:52
But I feel like on some levels like at least for me like sure we can get into the hypotheticals of like you can always give more.
OK.
But there are certain times from, like I know I could Sprint after the guy, even though I'm probably not going to get, you know.
But I could give it the last 20 yards.
26:08
Right, exactly.
And I think that this is where 85 year old me is the one, that he is ruthless and I love this David Goggins saying.
I don't know if it's a saying of his, I heard it in one of his videos.
But he said there's no shortcuts for you.
Goggins and I just really love that.
26:27
Like, he doesn't even look for them because he said you don't get those, you don't get shortcuts.
There are no corners to cut.
And that to me is like the embodiment of that of that 85 year old self.
Because he knows if I could have spread it or not.
And so it's if I can appeal to that man's incredibly high standards.
26:46
Which is why like commit to the journey is not the easier path.
I think it is the harder path because the standard is higher.
And when you really do that, the winning does happen by default.
But even even saying that still makes winning the objective right?
27:04
And you're just saying this is a different pathway of getting to winning, but winning still kind?
Of matters It does matter.
I I think it's a both.
It's a the journey matter and the outcomes matter.
The more, the more.
Because the outcomes also give credibility.
You give more context, they give more experience, they give more wisdom to the teacher.
27:21
Oh yeah, I I.
If you had no outcomes, but you said look at all the efforts I put in though, but I put in 10,000 hours, but I haven't sold a company, I haven't built anything because.
This is really didn't work.
Yeah, you need a both hand.
Yeah.
This is really interesting because on some, so I think from a, this is I'm like really liking this.
27:40
So from a, Yeah.
From a from a fulfillment perspective, yes, I believe that truly giving your all actually not like try your best, that's just like it's such a, it's repeated so many times that it's lost its meaning.
But leaving everything on the field, having the tank on zero or empty when you walk off and truly knowing and looking at yourself and maybe like I could not have done anything more.
28:04
And it's tough to do that because we're naturally built to conserve effort, right.
And so you really have to push and overcome the internal mechanisms that you have that say don't spread the last.
Two hours.
Right.
And that's why I like when when I walked on stage for the for the presentation, I was like, I have done this before.
28:22
I am prepared.
I could not have prepared more for this in any way that would have been reasonable.
And so to to that degree I can still define success that way.
The outcomes will happen and I think it's but it's still that little thing where it's like do this in order to you have to cut off the in order to.
28:41
I really genuinely believe that because I remember when I was in my retirement year, which is I still own the company, but we were in the process of selling.
I had nothing to do and it was an incredibly depressing year for me, which is why I've oriented my whole life around work because I I really enjoy it.
And I remember getting really angry about this and thinking like, it's not you work hard so that you can't.
29:04
It's like the hard work is the point, Like the point is how hard you learn to work.
And that's the whole point where, like what has changed from last year to this year is like my understanding of my capacity to work continues to grow.
And so I am able to work harder and therefore am more proud of the effort that I put into it.
29:23
Because at least for me, I feel like I am.
I know in the mirror did I give it my all.
And if I try to play out, this is a stoic frame.
But like if I had had like a hurricane go through and we had not been able to launch because all the energy would have been gone.
29:39
Let's just say hypothetical and we hear all this prep.
Fear virtual of that, yes.
Would I have been proud of the effort that I put in?
The answer would have been yes.
You should be let down and disappointed they didn't get to do the thing.
Yes, but I think that it would it would have been short lived because I think that is like if you you asked like early on what has been the biggest difference for you specifically and this has been whatever whatever you even call it, super hour, secret, secret, whatever.
30:07
Like this is what has been allowed me to keep my internal temperature separate from the external temperature to the greatest degree possible is knowing that I'm using my internal thermometer to gauge my success, and I'm not perfect by any.
Right, right, right.
But the more I do that, to use your example, if I had worked my absolute hardest for 10,000 hours and I knew that, I give it my all and I had nothing to show for it.
30:35
Now I've actually had that since, because five years ago I lost it.
Right, no external results to show for it.
So I do know what that's like.
I think at the end of your life, you'd still be more proud of the man that did his everything, gave it his all, left it all on the field, even if he didn't win.
30:52
And I think that would be the man that I'd be more proud to be.








0:00
Maintaining the discipline to be very focused about the problem that you're solving and who you're solving it for.
And I think that solves 90% of the problems from a strategic perspective for any small business owner, including an agency.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:19
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
My audience asked me questions for 10 hours and here are the best moments.
Let's.
0:35
Say my only goal was just to get rich AF.
What is rich AF just so we define it?
100 million?
Why not?
It's a good number.
You're willing to work hard, but you have limited skills and experience.
What business would you start like right now, 2023?
And I have no money, right?
0:51
I would probably build a boring business in services and I would probably pick something around the body, you know, if I wouldn't just start a design firm because I think that has a high likelihood of getting disrupted or you know in some way by AI.
If I were you know, it's as silly as it sounds like a nail salon or a lawn care service.
1:08
Things that I mean especially body ones dentist stuff like it's you you still have to go in and get your teeth taken care of and many times people value the human exchange more than something robotics.
So for example in the fitness world like this is my like my data point around this there was a a brand called Coco Fit and they struggled a ton and then eventually went out of business because they tried to automate personal training.
1:33
So they created these all in one machines that would you'd have a key fob and it would count your reps and every time you went to the machine it would say how to do more and what what you did last time.
It's really cool concept.
The problem was their theory was that the reason that people were getting results is that they didn't know what to do when the reality is that no one was showing up at the gym.
People hire personal trainers because they want another human to talk to and to hold them accountable showing up.
1:54
Same reason like if you had a robot cutting hair, there might be a percentage of the population that do it, but a lot of women like the going to the hair salon and having that exchange.
And so I would probably build a business around services in general would be my way and then I would continue to scale that.
And you could do that at a local chain level and you can make a lot of money to do that or you could do it at a national level, which would be like professional services.
2:14
I love the idea behind the core stuff that's going to be here forever.
You know, let's say hypothetically, the great fires of Las Vegas burn everything to the ground, OK?
You lost everything.
You have to start again.
What would you say is the number one thing that you would have done differently to get to where you are now?
2:31
And I have no reputation, right?
No.
No reputation.
Yeah, it burns my reputation on the ground with it.
So I actually have lost everything before.
And so I I know what I did and I probably would have done the same thing.
So the the, the easiest way that I did to like go make 100 grand in a month when I had nothing was that I would go find a business that was local that I understood and that I could sell something expensive for.
2:54
I would front the capital to market.
I would work the leads and I would sit at the front desk and sell and I would negotiate what they would be willing to do a a big bulk of services at scale for.
So for example, if I wanted to find a chiropractor and I'd say, hey, I if I sent you 100 customers this month, what's the lowest rate you would do all 100 customers for this level of service.
3:15
And then I would just negotiate that down and then I would spend as much as I could and sell it for as much as I can so I can make the spread.
And then they would service the customers and for them it's a zero risk offer because they don't have to do anything.
I front everything else and then for me, I don't have to do anything but market and sell and I can take all of that.
3:31
And so like when I lost everything, I immediately was able to make 100 grand the next month by doing that playbook.
In your opinion, what are the three most powerful skills that someone should develop if they want to make a lot of money?
I mean the three core skills, are you going to learn how to build?
You got to learn how to sell and you got to learn how to lead.
3:48
Just like that.
There we go.
Like in in terms of maybe like hard skills that someone should really focus on learning to develop that like sales, copywriting, leadership.
What would you say the most important?
Well, those are the three big buckets, right?
So it's like 1, is that like leadership is just the internal bucket of getting people to do what you want them to do at scale, right?
4:06
And then from a selling perspective, I include that in all things that are marketing, letting people know about your stuff, promotion and actually converting people into customers.
And then the third piece of building product and services is so that at scale, if the product is good enough, then you won't lose customers.
4:24
And if it's exceptional, the product itself will get you more customers.
And so most businesses taking to their natural extreme on a promotional level typically are leaky buckets because the product actually sucks.
And most businesses suck in general because most products aren't good and most people want to cancel very quickly and don't want to continue to use them, which is why very, very good companies are very rare.
4:44
Most of them generally are mediocre or not good.
And so I prefer to solve a business from back to front, which is like, can we find something that people actually like and want to continue to use and continue to pay for?
And then the marketing is almost a commoditized skill, Like it's very easy to let other people know about your stuff and do so louder and louder and louder provided the product is good.
5:06
And then the internal has to get run with a leader that can attract the talent to continue to do this because quickly the the business will bottleneck based on the founder and their expertise are usually they have a niche, they might be product people, they might be tech people, they might be finance people, they might be whatever and then they have to be of the character to attract the talent that will allow them to get to.
5:28
You know, 9 figures or whatever it is that they're the goal is.
You mentioned on a recent podcast with Tom Billy that you don't have rules.
So I, for example, you know, I quite often end up working up until midnight, two AM, 3:00 AM and basically fucking up my sleep schedule because I have too much freedom, right, because I'm self-employed.
5:46
So how do you kind of strike that balance between freedom and discipline?
You know, if you're driven and you want to accomplish big things?
It's it's it's kind of 8020.
Like if you know that when you stay up late, like there are times when I will gas it and go past my red line in terms of work.
And I know that I'm eating into tomorrow.
6:03
But if I'm like in a flow and I'm crushing it and the Meuse shows up and the Meuse wants to work, then I work.
You know what I mean?
But if there's some days on the flip side where I wake up and I just feel foggy as shit and I just like, for whatever reason, I ate too much Mexican last night.
And my, you know, I I just, I don't have it that day.
6:19
Then I I might call it earlier, like the idea of me pushing through and punishing when it comes to the type of work I do.
If I were doing a more brute force work then I would care less.
You know what I mean?
If it was just like if I was just doing reach outs, I was doing cold calls, I was training personal training sessions, I was cutting.
6:34
Hair.
I'm just going to.
I'm just going to brute force my way through it because I don't need to have higher brain function.
And that's not an insult.
I'm just saying like you're not like thinking of creative things.
You know what I mean?
You're just you're working the work.
But when it comes to like writing or or making presentations or communication of some sort, it's more I try and optimize around.
6:52
How can I maximize over a week?
How much flow state I can be in so I can just get the most total quality output?
So it's not about rules, it's more like which of these things has the highest likelihood of getting me the most.
What's up, Kristoff?
In one podcast you said that your most feared decision in life was to quit your job when you are 22 or 23.
7:12
My question is, what advice would you give to your younger son if you could, in that exact situation?
When you have.
Nothing to lose.
It also makes it the best time to make high risk decisions because you have a disproportionate upside.
7:27
Not quitting if you want to do something else, like if you have this desire to do something else, is like not taking a stranger up on a free lottery ticket on the street.
If they give you a free lottery ticket and you lose, you're back to not having anything.
If you win, then your life changes forever.
7:45
And so I think a lot of people place a disproportionate amount of weight on the opinions of other people who are going to judge them in the short term.
Because quitting your job is short term pain for long term fulfillment if that's what, if that's what you want to pursue.
Because the short term pain comes from the judgment of others and likely a back, you know, back step in income.
8:03
But long term you're working on the thing that you want to be working on.
Now, if you like your job, and you know what I mean, then that probably doesn't apply to those people.
But like, if you're in that situation, it's really a long term, short term sacrifice which a lot of people aren't able to make.
The second question, let's think that my audience don't know anything about Lila except that she's your partner.
8:21
But I think she's she has exceptional knowledge and she she's a really good personality.
If you could only tell one story about her that makes a complete picture about her, what would it?
What would it be?
So Leila had quit her job to join me to start gym launch.
This is when we were doing turn around, so we're flying around the country.
8:39
So she quit her job after knowing me for only a month and then started basically living with me in motel rooms.
She had built up a book of business, so she was actually giving up something that she had spent two years building to pursue this thing with me.
And we were new.
Like we had just started dating.
About six months into that I told her that I needed a break and the she actually asked me, she was like it sounds like you don't really want me to be here.
9:01
Do you want me to leave?
And I was like yes, that would be great.
I had just lost all the money from the partner.
I had this location that I had to either shut, shut down and had no cash to do it and I had to service all these contracts.
They didn't have the money to to service.
And I also had like three other businesses that I was trying to run at the same time at a chiropractor agency.
9:19
I had my gyms.
I had Jim launch the turn around business.
I had a dental agency all of those with different partners and I was the one who did marketing sales for all of it.
And so I was just so spread thin and so she I needed to generate money to basically pay the bills of the gym that I couldn't pay that the money had just gone out the door for right after me saying I don't think we should be together.
9:39
She had to leave like the next day to go to Hawaii to launch a gym for this guy that she's no longer dating that she quit everything to leave.
Tough situation that 9 out of 10 not even 999 out of 100 girls would have just said no.
They would have been like, I'm just going to go back home and you know, try and get all my clients back.
9:55
But she didn't do that.
So she flew out to Hawaii.
I didn't have enough money to give her like a nice place.
And so I had her split an Airbnb with five guys, 5 dudes and Layla, not ideal.
And so she worked out of the Airbnb and, well, realistic.
She worked out of the gym most of the time and did the biggest launch that we'd ever done.
10:12
And so, like when my world was coming crumbling around me and I really needed her to come through, she stood tall.
And she did it in a time that I probably didn't deserve that level of loyalty because I hadn't shown her any.
And so she did that.
And then I made enough money from her launching that gym that I could pay off all the bills of the gym that I was going under that I just lost all the money on to basically come out breaking Even so that we could actually go back all in on gym launch and get rid of the other companies.
10:40
Oh.
Man, I think I haven't heard this story before.
What what went through through your mind?
I I can't really believe this and understand it.
Well, when she did that, I wanted to be with her.
She had extended me loyalty that I had not given her that.
10:55
There was probably a few defining moments in our relationship.
That was the first big one.
Thank you very much for sharing this.
The next one is kind of basic question, but I'm really curious about the answer.
What was your biggest take away of writing 100 million offers and also 100 million leads?
The offer is a strategic question that influences all aspects of the business and is also a mental exercise that people can feel like they're making progress on their offer a lot faster.
11:19
Leads is a lot more about activity and implementation, and so people can get ideas from like the lead magnet chapter, but then you have to start reaching out to people posting content or running ads to start getting leads in the door, right?
And so there's a little bit bigger of a hurdle with leads than there is offers.
11:35
But it's also the the main driver of business is letting people know about your stuff.
And so I think that many people will mentally masturbate to the idea of making these amazing offers.
But I think former people make money by actually letting people know about their stuff, which is leads.
What went through went through your mind when when you rewrote it for the 18th or 19th time?
11:55
So unless I can work once and have something provide value on an ongoing basis, which is a high leverage activity, then it makes no sense.
So I think most people shouldn't write books because the amount of work it takes to make a great book that actually lasts the tests of time is extremely difficult.
I think I read A blog post where they said how to write a blockbuster blog post and there was a chart where they said if you put in like 100 hours to write only one blog post there maybe we'll be a million views.
12:23
But if you put like 50 hours that maybe we'll be just 10,000 views.
It's exactly that.
There's diminishing marginal return, but an increase, an exponential increase in absolute returns.
You know the gold, the gold medal sprinter in the Olympics versus the silver medalist.
12:40
Like from a business context, the person who's at the gold medalist might have worked 10 times more, right, to get this much more out.
But what's the difference in absolute of gold versus silver, everything just being this much better.
People are like, well, I don't want to work 50 more hours to be this much better, but being this much better might make you the.
12:58
Best at that.
Whatever the blog post is, or that business, or that solution, and the amount of winner takes all the economy has shifted towards people want the lowest risk solution.
And so if you have the best solution then it is the lowest risk thing to buy.
13:14
And so to be #1 versus #280% of the economics.
Sometimes 90% of the economics go to #1, and so it makes absolute sense to work 10 times harder, even though you might only be this much better.
From a marginal perspective on the chart of rankings, that might make you 10 times higher.
13:31
Some context, we have like a book summary application where we give also exercises and tips to implement the book.
What's your average take on on books, and I mean book summaries?
Is it good?
Did you use them before?
I don't read many book summaries, mostly because you rely on the person who's doing the summarizing to find what they think is the most valuable thing for you, right?
13:52
Because a lot of times what I find if I read a book, the the Nuggets that I find are not the main concepts, it's actually the details.
If you don't know anything about a topic, then the summaries are great to give you a lattice or a framework to understand the rest of the information that you can consume.
But once you have a basic understanding, it's in the edges, which is where you can expand your knowledge, right?
14:09
And so there's there's not a lot of shortcuts to getting really good at something.
Now, a bit of selfish question, but I'm really curious about your thing.
Yeah, yeah.
OK, so you remember you had a video where you scaled an O Street business to 50 million in 6 minutes.
Could you do this with a book summary up?
14:24
Basically do a breakdown of a book summary.
So it's an application.
Yeah, it's an.
It's a subscription based application.
Got it.
What's the price point, $10, OK.
What's What's churn?
I think 15 to 20%.
Monthly or yearly?
Monthly.
Monthly.
Got it.
So you have to fix that first.
14:41
At the end of the day, everything is going to be capped to LTV.
So like if there was one single metric that I'm going to look at a business, it's capped to LTV ratio.
So how much it cost me to get somebody and how much do I make from them over the lifetime until that metric is better than the competition.
So like Blinkist, right.
I think that's a one that's like that I would have to look at their LTV and what are the things that they're doing that like why am I, why are people going to come to me versus them, right.
15:04
So either I have to be more niche in my selection of books so that I'll have a wider selection for a narrower audience like competing against Amazon's very tough.
But if you if you if you niche down into a specific topic then you can actually have a wider selection because Blink is just going to take the the best sellers right for every every category because that's going to be the the most people and they're VC backed and they're funded and they can acquire customers at a loss for a long period of time acquire market share.
15:27
And unless that's the game we're trying to play then you have to play different which is I want to, I want to be really specific about the avatar that I want to go after.
And so that's where you do a little bit of research ahead of time and say OK is there an underserved market that might actually a have a big reading preference.
So like sales people is one of the most common professions on planet earth from a personality perspective how many sales guys read all the time, I don't know.
15:48
I would have to I would have to look into that.
And so you might be like, OK, well sales guys aren't the guy, but maybe HR specialist read a ton.
OK, well, if they read a ton and there's.
Like Blinkist might have one book on HR, but I could put 100 different things that are related to that or 1 separated and then I can create the illusion of a wider selection of topics but around a narrower, A narrower avatar or concept, right?
16:09
I would start there and then over time you can expand if you if you want to and just reach, you know, you go adjacent, you go to finance or you go to whatever.
Like this is me just spitballing again like I did the no strip thing.
From the the economics perspective, you have to get LTV to the point where like your churn should be under 3% in order to make this really work once it's under 3%.
16:28
Monthly.
Yeah, monthly.
I mean, ideally you want to maintain 80% annually, at least if you want this thing to be a big thing.
All of my attention would be only focused on that.
Like until you fix that, there's no point in acquiring customers because there's going to fall out the back end.
Like, there's literally no point because then you're also getting lots of people in that will then say that that thing sucks.
16:47
You don't know.
I'm not saying it sucks.
I'm just saying like they're they're a friend of theirs is going to say, hey, I signed up for this thing.
Be like, oh, I tried, I didn't like it.
And they're like, oh okay, maybe I won't.
I won't stick on it.
I want to be so quiet about what I'm building until all my metrics are right and then I want to blow the the doors off.
But most people want to keep hitting these income goals rather than looking at the the metrics of the business that are actually going to drive the long term goal.
17:07
Because like anyone can market their way to 100,000 or a million a month.
Even with an app like this, if you blow enough money, enough people find out about you can do it, but then you can only maintain it as long as you're spending that much money.
The moment you your your spend drops your income drops.
And that's not a business that I want to be a part.
17:22
Of our USP is that we are doing, we are we are in Hungary and we are doing it in Hungarian and there is no other application in Hungary.
OK.
That's great.
If we scale to maybe Poland, we would do it in Polish and not in English, and that's a USP.
I like that.
And I mean then at that point I would just look at, I would, I tried model as closely as I possibly can, the number one player in the US from AUX perspective from the selection of titles, all that kind of stuff.
17:49
And then I would and I would see if my metrics change if I do that.
If not, then it's like there's some assumption that I'm basing this business off of that's not right.
In the Denny Miranda podcast, I think you talked about skills versus meta skills.
Could you expand this maybe?
A meta skill is a skill that helps you acquire more skills.
Learning how to read is a meta skill.
18:06
Like learning how to learn is a meta skill with the broadest brushstroke all the way chunked up.
Learning to learn well quickly and retain information and be able to implement it is is a skill you give 100 people a course, right?
That's free.
The difference between the people who are going to be successful and not successful are the ones who already have sufficient meta skills to be able to then use the information and implement it.
18:27
Like at at one polar extreme you've got somebody who's completely incompetent, right?
Who like you have to teach them how to turn on a computer.
And on the other extreme I can say go build me a company and the person can do it.
So this person can translate a directive into each of the sub buckets and knows how to do that.
And so it's really like your success percentage basically is predetermined by how low you break down the skill requirements for someone to be successful.
18:51
So like the reason that I write the books at the grade level that I do isn't so that people who are experts don't get value from it.
It's so that it makes it even easier for experts and it makes it attainable for people who don't know.
So I can get 70% of people who read the book to get leads versus 10% of people to get leads.
19:10
If I just cut out some of the steps and made assumptions about their skill level.
The last 10 or 20%, the people we're experts are still going to benefit from.
I'm just also going to include turn on your computer, Here's how you do that.
And from the software perspective with what you're doing, that's also how you get a way larger percentage of your clients to activate.
19:27
Typically we make assumptions because we assume that every customer is just like us and so they've the same meta skills as us and they have the same interpretation or perception of the world and the UX.
And so that that assumption isn't true.
Like all you have to do is, and I'm sure you've done this like you look at people scrolling on your app and you see the heat maps and you're like, why are they clicking that button?
19:44
Because they have different skills and experiences that they're bringing to the table.
And so then we just continue to accommodate it, break it down to the level that you could show it to a three-year old and they would immediately know how to use it.
Like the fact that babies learn how to use iPods is an indication of how how simple they have made it to humans to use.
20:01
And that's why they have such mass adoption.
How will you teach someone how to learn?
We already know how to learn.
It's just that most people don't know how to teach.
Everybody learns stuff all the time, right?
If I if you touch a stove and it's hot and it's and it and it burns you, you learn not to do it again.
Like learning is is natural.
20:18
Like we all learn.
But people who want to teach a specific behavior don't know how to do it.
And so it really just comes down to three things, which is, what do I reward, what do I punish, and what do I extinguish, right.
So reward is you give a carrot right after someone does something, punishes you, you know, you ZAP them, or you smack them after they do something or extinguishes you do nothing, right?
20:36
So if your wife walks in and she got her her nails painted neon orange and you don't like it, you might not want to punish her because that's probably going to have negative ramifications in the rest of your life.
But you might extinguish it.
So you might not say anything about the nails, or you might say something different.
She's like, do you like my nails?
I might save something back, like I'm I'm happy that you got what you want.
20:54
What we're doing is what behavior we training.
And so if you think about learning or teaching as training, I think it's a much more useful word to think through.
Because at the end of the day, you have only taught someone if their behavior changes in the same context.
As in, if I want you to say these words when the phone rings and I say cool, we're going to put you through this training and then the phone rings.
21:14
And then you don't say the words you have not learned and I have not taught you.
And so it's how many times can I simulate this experience, this stimulus, the context, so that I can have them do the behavior I want within the context that's going to trigger it and then reward them immediately.
21:32
And that's how you have a feedback loop that trains people to do something.
So that is why there's tricks in the application and the gamification and those stuff.
How would you restructure the education system if you could?
Yeah, sorry for this.
No, you're good.
You're good.
I would focus almost exclusively on meta skills.
21:49
Teaching people how to learn step one, and then teaching people the things that are the next level underneath, which is learning how to write.
Learning how to read.
Learning how to speak, Learning how to do math like those are the those are the building blocks of everything else that follows.
And in the school of the school of Alex or the school of Formosi, everyone passes.
22:07
Only when you learn there are only 100 percents and you continue to do it until you learn.
Like, the arbitrary division of grades along age is ridiculous to me.
And I think that if there were a lot more clarity around the goal, which is like until you can read 10 pages out loud without making a mistake, you do not move on.
22:25
If you can do that in a day, fantastic.
If you can, If it takes you a year, OK, I don't judge you on that.
It's just how long will it take you to learn the skill.
So a good buddy of mine, Doctor Cashy, taught an autistic kid how to read.
He couldn't stay still, reading for more than one word at a time, and then he would, like, have fits or whatever.
22:42
And so he came to train the child on how to read with a bag of Skittles.
And so when the kid would read a word, he would give them a skittle.
When he would read more words in a row than he ever had, like a a record, you'd give him two Skittles.
So he rewarded the behavior.
And then he had big bonus rewards when he would unlock a new level.
23:01
And so he kept doing that, and within one afternoon he had him reading a full page.
What is the behavior that I want to reward?
How can I reward more of it now?
None of it was punishing.
He didn't smack him when he messed up.
When he read less, he still gave him one to reward him for the activity.
And then when he read more, he gave him extra reward as the kid becomes less full on Skittles and he's like, you know, Sugar, how he like, doesn't want any skills anymore.
23:20
The Skittles become a proxy for approval and they work just the same.
How do you know that?
When to when to punish, when to reward, or when to extinguish?
We try very hard to almost exclusively reward because punishment changes behavior faster.
23:37
Reward changes behavior longer.
It just takes longer to work, right?
Like if if someone you know calls me Alex and I don't like that and I slap them and I say never call me that again, I might change their behavior really quickly.
If I leave the room and someone else says walks in, they might say I was talking to Alex because I'm not there to punish them.
23:55
And so punishment only works as long as the the source of punishment is there and the person doesn't get accustomed to the punishment because punishment itself becomes desensitized over time.
And so to effectively punish someone, if you want to consistently punish, then you have to increase the intensity and variety of punishment over time, because otherwise people get desensitized to it.
24:13
If you're always mean and yell at all of your employees, eventually they stop caring.
So you have to increase the level of your threats, right?
You then have to say, I'm going to fire you, I'm going to kill you, right?
You have to make these threats increase because you create the you increase the intensity and the variety of how you claim to punish them.
Reward.
24:29
You can reward long enough that you can then extend the gaps between reward, so eventually you don't need a reward anymore and people will continue to do the activity because they have always done it.
So it's the exact example with Doctor Kashi and the guy.
Yeah, I would imagine if he was doing this over and over again.
24:45
He proved the point that he's not like a full time reading teacher.
The concept is that he would read and then maybe the next time he comes in he gives him a skittle every other time he reads and the next time, I'm by every 3rd time and the next time I'd be only when he when he hits a new record.
If I can get the kid to read long enough that he actually starts to like the story, then the story starts reward in and of itself and then I can move away and then the kid reads without me.
25:09
And so fundamentally, that's what you try to do when you train any activity is that most people who are experts at anything get rewarded from the activity itself.
Because once you develop a level of mastery and the skill, you enjoy it because you're good at it.
So we hope, I hope we will meet again and maybe speak longer.
25:25
Thank you very.
Much dude, I appreciate you Kristoff.
Thank you so much.
Thank you for inviting your community and hopefully your community got value from the event and hopefully they use the books and and grow the economy and hungry and and all get you know way way better at whatever it is they're.
Doing You are incredibly committed to education and self improvement.
25:43
How do you select what you will pursue for education?
There's so many possible topics, So what process do you go through to select what you're going to be educating yourself on, and how do you also select potentially someone to educate you on that topic?
25:59
We do everything off the theory constraints at acquisition.com, which is basically that a system will grow until it's constrained, until it's limit.
So it's kind of like the idea of the weakest link, right?
So it's finding what the weakest link in the chain is, what the constraint of the system is so that we can decontrain it and then grow to the next natural constraint.
26:15
It's a very simplistic look, but it's extremely effective because it just cuts down all the noise into like if I had to pick one thing that is the big limitation of this business, what would it be?
And so then we just get laser laser focused on solving that one problem, solve that problem and then we move on to the next constraint.
And if we solve their problem and the business doesn't grow well, then we pick the wrong constraint.
26:32
And so sometimes the constraint is your ability to judge what the constraint is, which is why, you know, wisdom is one of the hardest things to earn, which comes from experience, right, is that you're able to, you know, recognize patterns.
And so for me right now, to answer the other part of the question, I'm focused on learning about brand stuff right now.
26:47
So brand is my big topic that I've been diving really deep on brand and media.
And I'll probably write a book on brand just from the findings that I have because I don't think there's many good books on brand because you can, I could read you 20 different definitions of brand and branding and they all sound like cockamamie.
And so coming up with an operationalized version of what that means so that it can actually be useful.
27:07
And I I try to learn this stuff so that I can use it.
And then whatever I learn, I just, you know pass it forward because branding for me, despite being now quote known for this or like an organic content guy, I've only been doing this two years.
Like this is brand new to me.
Like I, you know, I have way more experience on the paid outside.
27:22
That's what I did the last decade.
And I, you know people got to see a tiny taste of that when I was launching the book.
But that's that's the big thing is finding out what the constraint of the businesses and if you need to chunk all the way up, it's if you want to grow a business you have to sell more clients or make them worth more or decrease risk.
Those are the, those are the things that are going to grow the value of a company.
27:42
And so just simply asking the question like why do we not have 10 times more customers or why are we not making 10 times more money?
And then figuring out what the answer to that question is, often times is the constraint.
Just because you're saying, hey, I'm I'm currently educating myself on on branding and that's fresh for you.
What would you say is like a major take away in terms of education for the topic of branding that you're just like?
28:03
I wish I would have maybe known this when I started to try to learn about this two years ago.
This is like a Pandora's box.
If I start talking about it, it might be like 10 minutes.
So I I can, I can riff on it, but like buckle in the audience.
So if we look at the origins of what a brand is, right, where do brands come from?
28:20
Brand comes when you brand cattle, right?
That was the original use of a brand.
And so why would you brand cattle?
Because you want to change the behavior of people who look at the cattle.
So if you have a cattle that doesn't have a brand and the cattle that does, the people were looking at it will behave differently if the cat, if the cow doesn't have a brand, I might take the cow for myself, or I might kill it, or I might eat it, I might do whatever.
28:39
But if the cow has a brand on it and I know the guy, I might return the cow to him, right?
So it changes what I do.
All right, That's important point.
So the point of a brand is to change or elicit A desired behavior in the widest percentage of your target audience.
All right.
Now how do you do that?
28:55
You do that by making associations between something they don't know, your brand in the beginning with something that they do know that is positive and rewarding, if that's what you want, right.
And so the index, it's a 4 by 4 box of what brand really is.
You have the, the, the directions you've got away from and towards and then you've got strength.
29:13
So very high and very low.
So, you know, if you have a really weak thing that's away from, it's like, I kind of don't like this thing, you know, slow Wi-Fi, you know, like.
Whatever.
Like Bad Brand.
On the flip side, you might have a political party which depending on the audience might be super strong and away from or towards now Taylor Swift, for example, would be someone that I would say has a very strong brand and towards there's not a lot of people who really hate Taylor Swift and a lot of people who really love Taylor Swift, right.
29:42
So it's positive and it's strong, right?
Somebody like Ray Romano, if you heard that you know, or like Tim Allen from the old sitcom days, might be someone who is positive but weak.
A lot of people know who he is.
Am I going to show up to his event?
Probably not.
The idea is that in order to build a brand, we simply pair things that people know, things that they don't know.
30:01
The things they don't know is our logo, our tagline, our company, with things that they do know and think are positive.
If you were to think about the brand as a bouquet of flowers, it's like having many flowers in a bouquet.
And so if I were to break the bouquet and spread all the flowers, there is no bouquet.
30:18
But simply by gathering them together, by making associations, I create something new.
And that bundle of associations is the brand.
Now, if I were to break one of the flowers or make it rotten, it would affect the appearance of the entire brand.
And so that's why if you make a single mistake, a Dylan Mulvaney move for Bud Light, you can affect the entire brand.
30:37
If I get a DUI or somebody, you know, gets, you know, accused of doing some sort of terrible heinous act, right, it affects the entire brand.
R Kelly bad brand now, right?
Despite all the positive, the one broken rose or the one rotten flower affects the entire bouquet.
30:52
We have to be very deliberate about what associations we want to make with our own brand so that we can continue to positively associate ourselves.
And the point of the brand is that we get a desired action or behavior from a specific audience.
The idea of growing the brand a lot of times is that you sacrifice some audience for other audiences.
31:11
So like, when I was starting making content, I did it in my closet, right?
And there were some hardcore people in the OG Mosey media days that are like, I appreciate you that were like, man, I miss the closet videos right now.
I might have lost some of those people when we started making a little bit more polished videos, etcetera.
31:28
Some people not, All right, I traded, I traded losing some audience to gain more.
When you were making a brand move, you're basically always making a bet that you will gain more of your desired audience than you lose by making a change.
And so you can approximate or slowly move a brand over time by making more associations in One Direction and fewer associations in the other.
31:49
And so that's how you can move a brand over time.
Bud Light made a wrong bet.
They thought, and maybe this is just corporate group think, right, that if they made an association, Bill Mulvaney, that they were going to get more people to buy their beer.
That would.
I mean, fundamentally that's the only reason you would do it as a company.
32:04
Right.
You believe that?
Long term, you get more people to buy your beer.
The problem was that wasn't true.
Now the interesting thing is that there probably are people who were a big fan of that move.
It's just that there were more people who weren't.
They were far away, right?
There were more people who were not a fan of that move.
And so that became an away from association.
32:22
And so that is what I am trying to encapsulate and put together into how to brand.
Because now that I feel like I understand it a little bit, I see it as in my opinion, you know, it's kind of like Neo in the Matrix when he's talking to Morpheus and he says, so you're telling me that I can dodge bullets?
32:40
Morpheus says, well, when you're ready, you won't have to.
And so we learn all these tactics about sales and marketing and show up rates and CRO hacks and all this shit.
But if you have a brand, if you see the Matrix, everyone shows up to your calls.
No one has price objections, everyone is excited and refers to their friends.
32:59
It just takes longer to make associations because fundamentally all branding is, is teaching.
You're teaching someone to do something, you want them to behave a certain way and you have this red, red card.
And when you see red, it means stop.
That's all we're doing.
33:15
So green lights have strong associate, strong brands.
They're positive.
Everyone loves green lights, right?
Like it's a simple thing, just no one owns it.
But green lights are great, positive association.
It's a great brand, right?
And so that's, that's the idea of what I'm what I'm kind of diving more into and I see it as the ultimate cheat code for business.
33:32
It just takes a long time to do and most people aren't patient.
You're telling me I can dodge business problems?
I'm telling you that once you have a brand, they become irrelevant.
You talk about deleting problems as your favorite way of solving them.
How do you decide what's deletable versus what's not?
33:51
Because I can imagine the the person who really loves that strategy doing nothing and just deleting all problems.
So how do you prioritize a problem worth solving versus a problem that is believable?
Well, it's just percentage likelihood of impact chunking all the way up to like, will this cost me number of sales, like sales velocity, will this decrease the lifetime value of customers?
34:13
And will this increase or decrease the likelihood that that whatever I'm doing right now continues to occur?
So what we're trying to value a company, right, we look at what's the sales velocity, how many customers they sell, what's the lifetime value of every customer Because then you can extrapolate what their run rate's going to be at at scale, at Max, unless we change something.
And then you divide that by risk, which is how likely is it that there's going to be an outside event that's going to change this thing from continuing to occur, this box of making money, How likely is that they will, it will continue to grow or at least stay the same.
34:40
And so if I have a problem, I have to be able to track it back to one of those three things.
And if it doesn't really track one of those three things or there's another problem that has a much higher likely to impact in terms of its higher likely and it has a greater effect size, then I'm going to prioritize that.
It's just that often times if someone's like, man, I really think we should change the colors on the site.
34:58
I would just say, like, what's the likelihood?
Like, I've been notorious for having ugly as shit sites my entire career and you can make branding, make associations and I think there's there's an argument there, but what's the likelihood that it's going to affect how many companies do a deal with us?
It hasn't up to this point.
And so is it a constraint of the business?
35:16
No.
Is it something that I can improve?
Absolutely.
There's also 100 other things I can improve.
I could also send more emails, which I don't do like there's lots of things I could do, but what are the few things or the one thing that matters most which then ladders back up to what is the constraint of the business?
If I look at the highest price competitor in my market and I1UP them and then they one up me potentially like is there ever a point in which we just say like we're price premium enough or do we always have to go for the top, like how do you make the determination of premium?
35:45
There's basically 4 positions in the market.
You have luxury all the way at the top, which is technically a Veblen good, Which basic?
Which means when I increase the price, demand goes up.
And that's because there's an association with the price that makes it more valuable.
So the fact that everyone knows how expensive it is affects the value that I get, that I get from it.
36:03
The fact that everyone knows the Rolex is 100 grand, the one that I'm wearing.
Whatever, then I actually admit it makes the Rolex more valuable, so it becomes a virtuous cycle, which is why LVMH is one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Then you have premium, which is basically the above average.
So it's there you have to pair utility with the premium.
36:21
In luxury the Pre the the extra price tag is the value whereas with Premium like BMW is premium, they're not luxury, they're a little bit better at a lot of stuff and so you pay a premium because it is a little bit they use better materials, it breaks less whatever, right.
36:38
And so then you have your, you know your mid to your, your run-of-the-mill, your commoditized space which sucks and then you have your low cost leaders which they make their entire business on.
How can I drive efficiencies in operations at all levels of the business so that I can be the lowest priced person in the marketplace right and still make a profit to to route to your question of like when is enough enough.
36:59
The key indicator for me and most of this like that that quote higher to your world you're not luxury goods.
The fact that it's expensive is not the reason that people want to buy it right.
It's so it's actually technically a premium.
I'm more extremely about the price to value discrepancy than anything else.
And a lot of people get into trouble because they raise the price so much that it is, it's just an excess of the value they provide.
37:22
And so then they actually create a negative experience.
Like if Chipotle were $50, people would probably not like Chipotle even though the product is really good.
But at $50.00, I don't know.
And so the reasonably is so viral, you know what I mean?
It's like the price to value of carpentry is so good that they tell their friends, right.
37:39
And so that's where this kind of marriage of how can I just short circuit people's brains from value perspective, which is what I what I try to do with the books and the courses so that it becomes viral on its own.
And then my cost to acquire customers is 0.
And so then everything after that is just gravy.
37:55
Are the four variables when you're using this as you've got the price, the value at the top, which is what they get right?
The price is what they pay.
You've got your.
Cost of goods to.
Deliver and then you have your profit leftover.
And so it's playing with those four variables so that you can maximize the the amount of absolute profit that the company makes.
38:18
Pricing high has become shorthand And where I think people get a lot of benefit from the offers book is that when you price higher, you automatically weed out shitty customers.
And I think many times that is.
The.
Real reason that a lot of people's businesses grow from that price.
38:34
Now obviously there's more profit, there's you have access things that you can that you can deliver on, but a lot of people don't actually take that excess money to create a better experience.
They do a gotcha and then they never get anything from that customer again.
And so that's the wrong way to use it.
But if I had to think like OK, what are the reasons that you know a company might be successful that does charge premium is that they actually reinvest the the, the premium price into a superior product.
38:57
And they are very clear about the avatar that they go after and what the quantitative requirements are that are black and white that they know from looking at their best customers, their top 20, top 5% of customers.
And then saying we're only going to cater to these customers in the future because the likely that we can give them a great outcome is higher and then that can create, you know you can merit or earn the premium that you have because you have data that supports that if you are this type of person we can get you this type of result.
39:24
What does the ideal experience with an accounting firm look like to you?
And I asked because one of the things that stuck with me, as you said, you've never done your own books like you've always considered that something that was delegatable, important to delegate.
You've also referenced bringing I believe accountants in house kind of going back and forth between outsource and in house.
39:45
So what does that ideal relationship look like to you now and maybe what did that ideal relationship look like when you were going through your first, you know, 7 figure and eight figure company?
A lot of professional services should look at Wi-Fi for inspiration.
You know, like, what does that even mean?
You don't.
40:00
You don't want to, like, clap when the Wi-Fi is working.
You just notice when it doesn't.
And so you just want it to be in the background.
You just want it to work right.
And so a lot of companies are like that, like there's a lot of services that people think they need to like over.
You know, communicate stuff on like I just want the financials to be accurate and I want them to be timely.
40:18
That's it.
And I want things broken down in a way that allows me to make business decisions.
And that's where like I think the, the, the top tier of accountants transform into fractional CFO and CFO kind of materials where they actually help you use this data to make informed decisions about the business.
40:35
Is there a way that I can translate what we do into how it would affect a business owner's life?
So I'll tell you a little story cuz I think this might be really well.
This will be really relevant for you guys.
Mosi Nation real quick, if you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
40:57
And if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
So one of our portfolio companies has had a ton of growth three years.
They went from one location to I think we're at 38 locations now, right?
41:14
All self funded off cash flow, all right.
So really, really tremendous growth in three years and it's compounding.
So it's growing faster and faster and when we were at about 30 locations, we were stuck at 30 locations for like two quarters.
And so I got on the phone with the CEO and he was like, dude, I just, I just feel like I don't know how many locations I can open based on cash flow And because they had net receivables were a little bit extended, things like that, right.
41:42
I I like shook the screen for a second because it was a zoom call.
I was like I need you to freeze frame this feeling you have right now.
It's like, OK, I was like think about this feeling you have.
I was like what you were feeling is finance as the constraint of your business.
You do not have a finance function that is operationalized enough like you do not like you are underdeveloped in the finance function.
42:00
You have a bookkeeper who's not that good.
As soon as.
He like I could see it just clicked.
I was like, that is the constraint of the business.
Until we get the finance function in, you're going to just be operating blind.
And then once you know we have this much cash flow, we can open two locations a month or three locations a month and you can be more aggressive with everything else because you're confident that you're not bankrupting the company accidentally on your own.
42:20
If I were an accounting firm, I would try and pinpoint the problems and relate them to how it's going to affect growth in the business like how it is the constraint so that you can talk in the language that a business owner is going to understand like they just how many.
I'll bet you like if I could see everyone's hands, how many people in your audience, all the business owner does is go to the right, go to the bottom and say so we made more money this month, great.
42:46
And so I think adding that level of strategy of like by the way I think this is a little fat compared to other companies that we're looking at.
This is a little bit under compared to other companies we're looking at and this might be an area of opportunity, little things like that that actually add value to the business if I were somebody who is in charge of account.
43:03
I'd like to get this answer in less than 60 seconds because I have.
I know we got to go and I want to be respectful of your time.
This has been incredibly informative.
How much of a skill should you develop or how much did you educate yourself before hiring for it?
So for example like do I need to be a sales manager before hiring for sales management?
43:23
What you What you hit at is one of the hardest parts of business.
You need to make an informed decision without context, which is why being an entrepreneur you end up becoming a Jack of all trades so that you can have enough context to make at least an informed decision.
And so I'm going to steal a playbook out of oops, wrong shoulder there We go out of Layla's book here and I'll give you my tactic around this, which is you want to interview for people who are sales managers and you don't want to hire anyone for a little bit, which sounds tough, but what you want to do is you basically want to interview for information.
43:53
Now if you meet a a a Gold Star, that's amazing.
But you want to talk to people, and if you know more about it than they do, they should be teaching you.
And once you talk to 1020 people, they're basically like expert interviews for what it should look like.
And so then you get a very good idea of what the role should look like after listening to people.
44:13
And you'll get an understanding of the level of nuance.
And I'll give you this one little tidbit that is super powerful when it comes to judging skill.
The quality and quantity of data that someone chooses to collect around their particular department is almost directly proportional to their skill.
44:30
And so, for example, I have lots of marketers who are like, I'm going to my product's amazing.
And I say, cool, tell me your metrics are I was like, what's time to value, right?
What are the key activation points?
Like, what's churn, right.
Like just some of these metrics.
And they're like, well, dude, our refund rate's really low, right?
44:45
But I'm like, OK, I was like, well, what about the marketing side?
They're like well CPMS are this, this is our click through rates.
This is our, you know this is our conversion on the page.
This is our percentage the schedule, this is our percentage that show, this is percentage open rate, this is percentage click.
Like they go through all this stuff and I'm like right.
So I can see very clearly that you're a better marketer than you are a product.
45:03
And so simply getting an idea of the quality and quantity of the data that someone collects around their department, we'll get.
Like when we hired our director of people, it was the first time that I had someone actually tell me metrics I'd never heard of and I was like.
She's the lady.
She's the girl.
45:18
My community loves you and that's how we are here.
And I literally got like 150 questions.
I had to narrow it down to five or six.
It was so hard.
You mentioned something in the $100 million offer that to hit your first 100K you don't need a lot, you just need an offer to sell and that's exactly what we did.
45:36
But right now we are hitting a bottleneck and our biggest bottleneck is operations.
And I want to know how exactly you got out of Jim launched operation because we have a very similar business model for and all service providers.
For what service providers?
Mostly agencies and digital consultants with lead generation and sales where we do it as with one-on-one consulting and in a group coaching format.
45:57
So coaching models in general tend to be very difficult to scale because the reason people come to you is for expertise.
In order to get other people to provide that expertise, then you have to create lots of experts who then eventually walk off and start the business on your behalf and take your customers with them.
46:12
I would say like there's a couple approaches.
So the first is that there's the law firm and the McKinsey kind of consulting model.
There's a track to become a partner in the business and then that's kind of the whole business structure.
So there's a way to share in the profits.
They do make lots of money, but the owners of those end up having to dilute themselves out.
46:29
Not that there's anything wrong that you can make lots of money doing it, but that is that is a a version of the model.
The other way is to productize the basically get narrower on the solution that you're providing and productize it to the greatest degree possible so that anyone could do it even if they have no knowledge of it.
In terms of like the implementation of the thing that is more the direction that we went with Jim launch because we had a very specific we don't even, we didn't even work with all gyms just to show how narrow we were with it.
46:55
We worked with only micro gym owners.
We have now expanded to health clubs as well.
The five or six years that I was doing it before we sold, we were only micro gyms.
And so just to show like how incredibly narrow that was, someone had to have at least 30 members assigned, lease one employee and be running this type of model for them to be a customer.
47:12
And then if they fit all those things, we could generate a lot of revenue using our playbooks.
I could have somebody who had no gym industry, no expertise whatsoever and still say send this e-mail, say these words, here's 10 recordings of people doing this exact same thing.
This is the expected value.
And so that's like from the delivery perspective.
47:28
Now operating the business overall comes from talent and being able to find people who are just as smart or smarter than you.
And people say that, But like when you actually meet somebody who's smarter than you, and then they admire an aspect of what you've done so that they start to work for you, That's where you really start to have the magic happen.
47:45
What are some of the things that agency owners should avoid doing if they ever want to scale any experience?
Okay.
So what things should an agency owner avoid when they're trying to scale?
Yep, Yep.
I mean the same things that any business owner would want to avoid when they're scaling.
Agencies tend to fall into the, you know, they, they tend to fall into the bucket of trying to be everything to everyone.
48:03
So maintaining the discipline to be very focused about the problem that you're solving and who you're solving it for.
And I think that solves 90% of the problems from a strategic perspective for any small business owner including an agency.
The second piece is that if you're a service based business, the quality of your talent is going to be directly proportional to your growth because you're you're basically selling people, fractionalized people.
48:25
That's what service businesses are, right?
You're selling some level of training that you're able to give and having more efficiency than an individual business owner would have, like the the classic, you know, small business owner, lead Gen. agency that charges $2000 a month.
The idea is that if they were to hire somebody full time to run these ads, it would cost them five or $6000 a month.
48:45
But you have copywriters, designers and media buyers and page designers who all work a fraction of their time for this one business, and they can get it more efficiently.
And you can still do it at good margins, right?
Like that's fundamentally what services are.
And so the quality of that talent and the culture that you have at the business to attract and keep that talent are the kind of the key or the crucial pieces of the success of the model.
49:08
You mentioned something in the book where you mentioned the agency model, where you hire an agency to learn the stuff and you internalize it, and then when you have stopped learning, you replace an agency.
But me, Teaching Agency models agency businesses how to become irreplaceable.
49:24
In your perspective, how should one go there?
Should we start with one business, then upsell the next and upsell the next and upsell the next offer?
Creating the irresistible offer isn't necessarily about having a zillion products.
It's more about explaining and communicating the many small things that you have to do anyways.
And so rather than saying like, I'm going to generate leads for you, that's like 1 outcome, but there's many things that have to happen along the way.
49:44
You have to create landing pages.
You have to write copy.
You have to, you have to have follow up sequences.
You have to work the leads, you have to have scheduling.
You have to, you know, you have to split test, you have to make new creative.
Like there's lots of things that have to happen in order to just get the single result.
And it's just making sure that we're delineating those things because an unbeknownst or an ignorant business owner has to ignorant in the technical sense, like they just don't know, would have no idea what you're doing.
50:04
You're like, yeah, just go get me leads.
It's like, well, it's much easier said than none.
And if I was doing it from an outbound perspective, might be like, well, I have to warm up domains.
I have to, you know, spin up different accounts.
I have to split, test different e-mail openers.
I have to split.
Like, you have to explain all the steps and like, wow, there's a lot more work that goes into this.
Now I can I can appropriately value this price tag that you described to whatever the service is.
50:22
That's piece one.
In order to be irreplaceable, often times you'd have to go after significantly bigger customers.
If you're an agency for Fortune 1000 for Fortune 500 companies would be so costly for them to spin up at scale the level of talent that's required to do like programmatic media buys across 100 from platforms in different countries.
50:41
And then the likely that they want to leave or do this on their own is significantly lower The idea that any service provider is going to become truly irreplaceable.
Like any business can do anything on their own.
And I would prefer to put myself out of business and do it in a way that aligns my customers with me.
50:56
Then have a model that I know is is basically has a timer for obsolescence.
Not everybody works.
It's Fortune 500 companies, right?
Sometimes you many people, they might work with, you know, small and medium businesses, they help them.
Let's say you become a marketing agency for chiropractors and you work.
51:13
You become so good at that.
In general, people won't leave you because you're just good at that particular service.
And The thing is, the small business owners are really tough because they're the problem.
Like they're super erratic, they're super volatile.
Their cash flow is lumpy.
They don't know where their next paycheck is going to come from.
And to no fault of your own, they can cancel because they just can't make payroll that month.
51:30
Look at the biggest agencies that exist, Ogilvy, you have Vayner, you know who's up there now?
Who do they service?
Massive companies.
Why?
Because the quality of the customers are higher.
And so they know that when they sign a contract, they actually stick with the contract.
We all know that if you have a small business owner who signs a 12 month agreement for agency services, he's good for three months.
51:47
The biggest model that I've seen for small business owners from a marketing perspective was an agency that was running $300.00 a month, $300.00 a month price point because they had figured out and like there's a key here is that, like those business owners are so price sensitive.
It's not whether you can sell them, it's whether you can keep them on their worst month.
52:04
The price isn't based on the value that you can deliver on the best month, but how much you can keep on the worst month because that's where the churn comes in.
The best model that I saw was doing SEO for small business owners and they had completely automated every aspect of it.
It was basically just a playbook and I think it generated reviews and maybe a couple phone calls a month.
52:23
But at a $300.00 month price point, if they got one or two phone calls a month, it was worth it.
So the bar to get over to, to ascribe value, and especially on something that I call like a nuisance business where it's like I know I should be maintaining my reputation, I know I should be doing some of this stuff.
OK, for two or $300.00 a month, I don't feel guilty about not doing it because this is being handled.
52:42
We are in the consulting model, right?
What happens is some clients actually do the work and they get results and some clients, they need a lot of follow-ups and they need a lot of accountability from you.
How do you maintain that?
Like I'm I know I'm getting very nitty gritty into this, but.
I'm good with Nitty Gritty.
You talked to basically one of the core problems of all B2B businesses, which is that you end up taking over the person's entire business until eventually they're like, yeah, if you could just send me a check every month and you do, you run the business, that would be awesome.
53:07
That's why being very disciplined about problem definition from the services that you provide, number one, and here's the one that everyone messes up who you pick.
It's not like even if you work with chiropractors, right as that, as that example, you don't necessarily even want to work with all chiropractors.
You look at the customers that you have right now that are the best customers, like the top 20% or the top 10%.
53:25
You say, OK, what characteristics do these people have that other people don't have in my client list?
And that's both from the soft the heart perspective.
What are the quantitative differences?
They have a certain size business, they're over a certain amount of month, They have a number of locations.
They have a certain amount of employees, number of customers, like you just get all that data on them.
53:42
And then also, what was the experience that they went through when working with me and was it different than some of my other customers?
Because one of the things that happens often times is that the first few customers you get become really sticky and then you start scaling and then you have this front revolving door, but you still have your core business of these people that you had in the beginning, right?
53:58
So why is that?
Because these people got more help from you and actually got delivered more value.
And then you basically tried to scale without scaling the value that you delivered to the original customers, right?
And so if you're at, whatever, 15,000 a month and you've got 5 customers and they're all like having a great experience and you keep signing people on, they keep leaving, it's like, OK, well, instead of me trying to sell 5 this month, why don't I just sell one and do a great job and then not lose them.
54:20
And like that's the key to compounding in a service business.
Once you pay down the basic pay down the inefficiencies of them not knowing what to do yet and being very specific about who you serve and who you don't like.
We didn't work with personal trainers, cycling studios and like yoga studios, 100% could use our model.
54:36
We didn't work with them because the founders tended to be psychologically different.
Their adherence was super low because they just come from a totally different world view than the guys who are more fitness, weight loss, transformation focused.
Even though at the end of the day it's just a membership with a backroom where people work out.
But mindset wise they had a very hard time kind of adopting a different model even though monetarily it totally made sense.
54:59
Which means you need to have discipline to say no.
This is so hard to say no to this new upcoming business because you know it can help them, but they just don't fit your criteria A. 100% I have 13 companies.
I get 1800 a day who reach out right?
55:14
So you have to say no.
It feels weird to like say no because a lot of the time I get so specifically that's why most.
People stay poor, they can't say no.
And what happens is you go for the short term money and you sacrifice the long term money because then you just get in this operational rat race and then you scale up your your costs to meet the fact that you took on all these customers that you shouldn't have taken on to begin with.
55:32
And then you have to pay them every single month.
So then you have to keep on taking on customers that you shouldn't have taken on to begin with, and you're getting this vicious cycle that you can't get out until you downsize.
You take 2 steps back, five steps back, fix your ego, and then say I'm only working with these customers because ethically I know that these are the ones that have the highest likely to success.
With everyone else I have mediocre success and I can say it's their fault.
55:50
I can say it's my fault.
It doesn't really matter.
All that I know is the likely that they achieve what I think they should achieve is low.
Period.
So I'm not going to solve.
Them.
Aren't you afraid that the Tam will go smaller like of?
Course you can build a niche an inch inch wide and a mile deep.
There's 30 million small businesses.
56:06
You don't need to service them you like.
There's there's 50,000 gyms that fit the model that we have.
Now if you want to build a $10 billion company, then yeah, you're going to have to go after a bigger problem.
But if you want to build a nine figure company, you can do that in almost any industry.
So you mentioned that when you started out, you started with the 1st 5 customer framework.
56:23
That was awesome.
And then you just grew with referrals.
So this question came from a fitness consultant herself and she said that with the competition that the fitness market is, how do you stand out?
Honestly, it's just being authentic. 99% of the fitness market just looks at what other influencers are doing and say, I'll just, I'll copy that and I'll do stuff like that.
56:42
But then you just do a worse version of what somebody's already doing, zooming all the way out.
Fitness like there's no secret, work out more, stop eating shitty.
You'll look better over a longer time horizon.
Like that's what it is, right?
There's going to be a subset of an audience that is like you genuinely, and they want to get their they could get fitness information from Alex, but if I'm a, you know, a 45 year old Indian mother, I'm probably not going to be her source for fitness information, even if I see the identical stuff as another 45 year old Indian mother.
57:09
Now if that 45 year old Indian mother looks at my fitness content and tries to make content like mine, it's going to seem weird.
You can stick out by actually being yourself.
I know it sounds trite, but the real like this is real.
There's so many unique aspects of someone's life and the things they're interested in compared to other people that if you just lean into those differences, those those unique as the things that you're actually into that are weird, right?
57:31
Rogans into aliens and mushrooms and comedy and fighting.
Who would have told him, like, you should be Joe Rogan and you're going to have people who like some aspects and then the Super fans will be people who overlap on two or three of the interests that you have.
57:47
If you picked my brand, it'd be like dessert, working out, philosophy, business, marketing, sales.
They're different.
They're people who follow me because they only like the business money stuff.
They're people who follow me because they only like the philosophy stuff.
They're people who follow me because they just think the desserts and calves stuff is funny.
Like it just depends on what someone's going to come in for.
58:04
But if you're just you, then you can stick with it for the long term.
And that's what's going to build over time and make you quote, stand out because there is only one version of you that's lived your life.
So just live it publicly.
Thanks a lot man.
I think we are at the end of our 10 year.
Thank you very much for being here and keep writing great books.
58:20
I hope, I hope you make so much money from the book and just and crush it.
Because at the end of the day there's more problems than any one person can solve.
It help we build businesses to solve them.
So explain to me how the franchise works.
Yeah.
So we have a lot of clients that want to work with us, and we have a lot of closers that want to work with us.
58:37
And Jovan and I, we just can't manage everything ourselves.
It's just too many people.
We had two options.
Option #1 is place managers to replace us, right?
And then give like two to three accounts, client accounts to each manager so they can manage them obviously and we can scale that way.
58:52
The problem with that was that managers only get paid so much and they only care so much about the business itself, right.
But when it comes to partners, they get 50% cut, they get exactly what we are getting, 5050.
The franchise thing is interesting because I feel like you would be able to achieve that simply with with a profit share rather than getting investment and equity and all like the.
59:13
Because if if speed is the goal then you could basically do the makeshift in terms because like they're I'm assuming many of them aren't planning on selling right.
And so the only reason the equity would be valuable is if they're going to sell it sometime in the future and buying quote more locations isn't really a thing either.
I would imagine that just like it'd be a lot faster just contract, you know, basically put put legal language around getting a profit share in the structure that you know the cut that you have like many companies have scaled sales orgs.
59:37
You know what I mean?
Like insurance brokerages are just massive sales orgs, like real estate agents are massive sales orgs.
And so they don't necessarily have equity, Eurodynamic equity deals because those can just get litigious and there's lawyers and just take, I'm sure you guys have already seen this, like it just takes more time.
And I feel like there might be like you could probably remove a couple of components to get the same behavior, which is ultimately what you're trying to do is get people who act like owners.
59:58
So that's just, that's me just shooting right off the cuff of just looking at it.
So that's kind of why we kind of came up with the franchise model to put like a nice barrier.
There.
So it's for people?
Who like have the experience in the space of running an agency or like scaling, managing high ticket sales teams, but now you're getting like the infrastructure that we kind of built over the past four years.
1:00:16
I mean, you can still do all that without the without the franchise agreement, but what problem are you solving?
Why are you not bigger?
It's a management problem just in general with bringing on more partners and doing it faster and doing it more in a more organized way.
So what you said it does make sense because that will remove some friction and it would allow us to bring more people without risking, you know, the the equity in any way.
1:00:39
I mean based on the model you have you guys can own 100% of the you know like the franchise or but even if you if it was just like you know the the main Co you can still have streams because you have the software.
So tracking becomes the issue.
But since you already have that infrastructure bill the ability to just make sure that they get overrides.
Now if you want to put you know a $10,000 buy in or something just because you feel like that increases commitment levels, I mean that's fine.
1:01:01
But if you look at like a Chick-fil-A for example are you familiar with their their model right.
And so that you know each location probably cost.
I actually don't know the build out cost, but I would imagine it cost at least a million, probably 1 1/2 to build a location for Chick-fil-A and the operators put $10,000 in.
And so it's more of a symbolic gesture than it is like them actually, you know, contributing capital to whatever The thing is, but they actually don't own equity in the business.
1:01:23
So they get a 5050 profit share after a royalty that goes to Holco.
Just looking at what they've been able to build, it seems that that that structure works without the equity in our in terms of eliciting the behavior that you guys are going for.
But from everything that you said, even right at the beginning, you're like, well, we need something that was more scalable because obviously we had lots of people.
1:01:43
There's many people who have scaled businesses with lots of people.
And so it sounds like it's actually a talent deficit like you need to hire somebody or bring someone who's a high level operator who has scaled a sales driven org, what's what's revenue right now?
Revenue for the phone sales organization, well, every month is different around like 4 million right now.
1:02:01
Per month is at GMV.
So like gross gross sales volume and then you're getting whatever, 2025% on that.
Yeah.
So you'd be looking at at somebody who's scaled a sales work from you know 10 million to 100 million and who's really OPS heavy.
So you want somebody who looks like who's very, very leadership driven, not a systems person.
1:02:19
Wrong.
That's not the right person.
You're looking for somebody who's who you admire, take this away.
I mean that you need an adult, right?
It doesn't that's that a function of age.
Just saying you need someone who has experience doing this because if I were looking at like if I were going to go buy in right to phone sales, the first thing I would do is hire an operator.
1:02:35
Because right now all the things that you've described have been people issues.
So if I'm operating on the theory of constraint, which is what we do, I'd say, OK, well then people issues seem to be the main problem for this business.
So I'm going to hire somebody who has experience in this particular domain in a sales or who has gone from X to ZA. $1,000,000 question Where do you find such people?
1:02:53
Well, you guys are sales guys, right?
So it's outbound.
Outbound is the easiest thing to do.
You could also run ads but the best people already have jobs and I mean you guys know this from from your business right And so it would be it would be outreach.
Outreach is the is the easiest thing to do.
1:03:09
Go to LinkedIn.
And LinkedIn has so many tools now like search for people who meet these, you know, these three or four job titles, probably like a, like a senior vice president or, you know, VP of sales, Sales director might be a little too low, but probably AVP of sales or VP of sales OPS, something like that.
1:03:27
Like you'll have to play with the title.
It is kind of like an ad in advertising.
Like you have to play to figure out when you get the right avatars on the phone.
But as soon as you get it to click, then you're like, OK, these are the types of people I want.
And then you talk to as many as you can.
And the limits test that I have for high level talent is that I should be learning from them on the phone call.
1:03:44
So if I feel like I have to teach them stuff, they're not the right person.
Like if they're teaching me things, which is also great because then you can keep taking notes and after 20 or 30 phone calls you're like, OK, I have a very good idea of what excellent looks like and I can make a more educated decision on the type of person that I want.
1:03:59
But that person who's very operational should be a people driven leader, especially in this type of work.
For the second part of this call, we would like to just bring our partners too and just ask some sales question in general and learn from you.
You know, with our models, do you believe that we should utilize group selling methods like webinars, seminars, events?
1:04:20
That way we can compress the time frame we make money or just focus on one to one sales.
I think it depends on the on the product that's being saved usually.
Products above $30,000 and that's why we were focusing on like 1 to one model right now.
I think you can do so.
The way that I like building sales orgs is having repeated sales materials and then individualized.
1:04:39
So like repeated sales materials are going to be like the VSL, the webinars, things like that.
But you're not, you're not closing on those webinars, you're just qualifying and setting.
And so I want sales guys to be doing as little information spewing as humanly possible and really being able to start the call with so you ready to buy and then yes or no and then work your way.
1:04:56
So you have 60 minutes to close rather than OK, great.
Now like discovery, like let me talk to you about how we might be able to help you because if you, because then sales guys get really tired of saying the exact same pitch, then they sound like robots and they get zoned out because they're saying something, they're not listening.
And so the talk ratios get way off.
1:05:12
And so I prefer having as much of the standardized information sharing being done before the call so that the closers time can be maximized to closing rather than just shit like teaching.
But I wouldn't be trying to pitch 30K stuff directly to a a payment page.
I'll probably be pitching that to, you know, qualifier set calls.
1:05:31
Yeah, that's how we're we're doing it right now.
But we've seen some other people, they have like live webinars, you know, and they have the sales guys on the live webinars.
And even though they're selling super high ticket offers, they try to like do that communication slash information, stage of the call, like just through the chat and then once they show level of interest then they get them on the call.
1:05:50
Well, they're using the webinar as the set, correct.
At at the end of the day, there's a certain amount of information that someone needs to have or certain amount of like exposure that they have to have to a brand or a product for them to, you know, make a buying decision.
And so that can be a long set and then a short close.
It can be a set webinar close, it can be a long webinar.
1:06:07
Then a close like there's just a certain amount of selling, you know the runway for the plane has to be a certain length.
Doesn't really matter where you slice it, it just has like this is amount that the majority of people need to have before making a purchasing decision.
Now some people might need less and that's OK because they probably got it beforehand from other things that they've consumed.
1:06:23
So if you want to say OK, how do I sell, why would I increase the likelihood that some that the the highest percentage of people buy.
Then I want to create an experience that the highest percentage people get all of the information they need prior to the closing conversation.
And so if you do a webinar as a big set thing, I mean to me that's the same.
1:06:40
I mean that's all the same.
Like if you run ads to webinar, ads to VSL, then they go to a scheduler or you know, if you have a live call team where you have a number that becomes the CTA and then the call teams answering calls in real time.
Operationally, I wouldn't, I wouldn't upend my entire business because of just a slightly different way of doing it because I I think it's more happy to glad as long as your throughput is good and you're, you know, like you're making money and you're growing right now, I would, I don't know if that would be the constraint of the business.
1:07:03
So like I think the stuff that we were talking about earlier like that seems more of the constraint than kind of the the, the individual tactics you know in in the example you gave.
What's your method for building trust and credibility on a sales call in like the fastest way possible?
Like what method?
What approach do you often take for that?
1:07:20
Well, I mean brand matters more than anything like right off the bat and the the, you know the, the vast majority of like the, the hard closing tactics and hard sales tactics have to exist in lieu of not having a brand, right.
It's like we have to make up all this hard stuff.
1:07:36
It's kind of like in the Matrix when it's like when you're good enough, you won't have to dodge bullets are like you're saying I can dodge bullets.
It's like, well, when you're ready, you won't have to.
So like the brand is when you're ready, you won't have to.
But if you don't have that, which is the big thing that you should have, but if you don't have that, then it's the same things that you would normally do.
1:07:53
You're going to try and find common ground, be relatable, trying.
Like a lot of it just comes down to how well do you understand the avatar, right.
So I think a lot of sales teams under under prepare by under understanding the avatar, the prospect, and over educate on the product.
Like if I understand what a 45 year old woman's suffering from, I can basically do the same sales call and at the end of the call say I can pitch therapy.
1:08:15
I could pitch, I could pitch weight loss, I could pitch a gym membership, I could pitch, you know, I could pick cleaning services.
It doesn't really matter, because if I understand the avatar really well, I'll be able to speak to her pains.
And what you said is true like brand is extremely powerful and with the clients that we take on for our agency, do you recommend that we go for people with very strong brands and take that approach that's that should always be the focus like always go for the brand and from there.
1:08:36
Yeah, Strong brand, strong product for sure.
Fair question though.
Yeah, Relatability.
Common ground.
What's been the number?
One reason you've seen show up rates increase or decrease, it's it's 100 golden babies, no silver bullets.
So when we when we go into a company, we have something called lead nurture Checklist.
1:08:51
And so it's just like 17 things that we do and each one of them adds like 2 to 5% And so that's how we can get something from like 3040% show rates to 85% show rates.
It's just doing a lot of little things.
So I I would not look for like the one trick, it's just like OK, how quickly are we responding?
1:09:07
How how much information do we provide them beforehand?
Are we providing A personalized video like can we give them a gift card for showing up that they can share coffee with us?
Like just how many different things can we add in to increase the likely that they show?
Can we, can we create an open loop between the set and the close that they're going to get information that they are they had got their their their interest peaked.
1:09:25
Is there a way that we can say that we're going to show them that we're going to do a certain amount of work on their behalf and we're going to give them the deliverable on the next call?
Right.
So they have a huge incentive.
They have huge curiosity so that they would want to show up.
Like, this is particularly true in insurance products.
So like, we have an insurance company.
And so, like, we create personalized insurance plans.
It's like, OK, well, how do we get more people to shop?
1:09:42
But we don't want to send them the insurance plan that we're going to make them.
Before the call.
We just say, we'll explain it to you on the call.
Yeah, we implement a lot of those tactics as well.
Probably there's some stuff that you're doing now we currently don't have at the moment as well.
I don't know if it makes sense to share on this call, but you said those kind of like 17 things.
Is it possible you can maybe like, send it to us?
1:09:58
No.
So.
Oh, no.
Something, man.
All right.
Honestly, it really depends on what the business is.
If we're looking at an insurance business versus weight loss business, like it's more applying a principle across.
But that being said, the big one that's that's probably missing like it's usually the big obvious thing, which is we can always do the hundreds of little tactics, but you're trying to dodge bullets rather than like winning before you start, which is like why?
1:10:24
Why do so few people trust you?
Like, that's the big, that's the big.
Like I see the matrix and then everything else becomes irrelevant.
So for acquisitions.com, our show rate on calls is nearly 100%.
So if we call, so if we say, hey, we'd like to find out more about your business.
Today is Tuesday.
1:10:39
Our next opening is Thursday of next week.
So 9 days from now show rates still 100% because of brand.
We actually don't need to do any of those tactics.
Now we have those tactics so that we can help the the companies that don't have those level of brands.
But like you want to stack the deck, you want to answer the question why does no one trust me and solve that Otherwise you're always going to deal with these issues like do the fundamentals for sure.
1:11:01
But the big, the big things that will matter most is who you're choosing as your customers.
So Vista, you guys heard of Vista Private Equity, so they're the biggest, they're the biggest software private equity, they've got a gazillion dollars, whatever.
The way that they look at a business is that they do a customer analysis and so they look for the 8020, right.
1:11:16
They look for the 20% of customers that are worth more than everyone else and they then do a customer analysis and say what are these 20% have that the other 80% don't.
And then they exclusively look for customers that are that 20% and then they say no to everyone else.
And so then what happens is if the sales velocity remains unchanged, they 5X the business.
1:11:34
So sometimes you'll make more money just by saying no.
So you can have the capacity to say yes to the few guys that matter more.
And if you're not getting more of those people than solving that problem, rather than saying like, how do I keep getting, how do I, how do I Polish a turd instead of going from that perspective, just saying like maybe I just should not try to Polish turds because it's still a turd, right.
1:11:50
And like, how do I get the people who are much better companies to be attracted to my business?
And if you have a customer list that people aspire to be like, then you'll get more and more people Like.
That's where that's like kind of the branding side for you guys, which is how can I associate with better quality brands so that other better quality brands realize that what we do is legit.
1:12:11
You can try and optimize the shit out of something, but like usually it's the big obvious stuff.
And we don't look at the big obvious stuff because they're actually harder problems to solve and they take longer, but it's where the most value is unlocked.
What's the ideal frequency and the topics of coaching calls that would increase the overall performance of setters and closers?
1:12:27
So I would say it's less about the topics of the calls and more about what you're training repeatedly and what you're rewarding.
So sales is one of those really interesting businesses or like you know departments that you can see very clearly like you guys are probably seeing different sales teams and they have very different cultures.
And so it'd be like what are the cultures that create the highest performance in our experience.
1:12:45
You know you can go on on either extreme, you can have a very punishment driven culture which is very individualistic or you can have a very team driven culture which is typically reward based.
What you want to reward is adherence to the script not closing like and that's a huge shift for most sales teams.
If you reward adherence to the scripts then what happens is you get everyone to follow the script.
1:13:02
Now if they aren't closing, they need to change the script.
But it's much easier to change the script once you've taught adherence than it is to have a bunch of lone wolfs who do anything they can to close the deal, which then impacts your brand.
So like a really simple, you know, tactic we did at one of our chains was we just said cool, we'll give them 5 bucks if they follow the script, whether they close the Now mind you that the tickets are smaller, right?
1:13:21
It's just higher, higher volume.
We'll give them 5 bucks if they follow the script and if they close or they don't close, they get paid either way.
You know what's interesting?
The thing they're most curious about when they send their managers is do I get the 5 bucks for the adherence even though they make three times more on the clothes.
So we still we still give them benefits for closing, but they want to know whether they got the approval of the manager because the $5 actually matters less than the approval from the manager saying you did a good job.
1:13:44
The $5 is more of a token.
That makes a lot of sense.
And if you can imagine, because you everybody here has sold before, if you got on a call and you knew that you could get paid no matter what just for following the process, it takes some of the pressure off.
Like think about like you hop in the car, like I'm just going to make sure that I get my bone no matter what on on the adherence.
But guess what happens when everybody hears to the script you fucking close more.
1:14:03
Because sales is one of the biggest issues where you have false positives where someone goes rogue and then closes and basically gets reinforced for doing the wrong thing and then they start doing the thing that they did that one time that worked and then it doesn't work over and over again.
So they change the behavior, they learn the wrong thing And so then you have to course correct, right.
1:14:23
That's why sales like it's all about adherence and then then we can be really strategic about really making sure the script is beautiful and crisp and concise and we just and we just drill the team on adherence.
The big topic I want to address is how to sell emerging tech.
You don't sell emerging tech, you it's it's selling the plane flight versus the vacation.
1:14:40
If I could tell you that your financials would be absolutely accurate and updated in real time, would you want that?
How much would you be willing to pay compared to what you currently pay?
A lot more.
Great.
What if I said I could do it for less than what you're currently paying?
Are you interested?
Great, this is what I need.
The fact that I'm using AI is irrelevant.
1:14:55
Just sell the outcome and then you not really.
AI is great for YouTube click bait, but for for sales it's irrelevant.
That was like one of the main wanted to get a cup.
What else you want to do for the next 16?
You must be getting a ton of businesses, actually some a lot of AI businesses that are coming across your desk right now at acquisition.com.
1:15:13
What are the things that's making sort of jumping out at you?
And what are the sort of commonalities between things that make you really go, Oh well, that that seems to have some kind of staying power?
The vast majority of AI businesses that I look at that are are are dog shit and so they're either they're not real AI, which is 99% of them, they're basically just built on Chachi BT, which is fine, there's nothing wrong with that.
1:15:31
But I'm just like let's not claim that we're creating AGI.
On the other hand it's it's people who'd have no business acumen and so they're like it's totally different, like the the normal laws of business don't apply.
It's like they have always applied and they will always apply because they're just how business works, right.
Those are the the vast majority of people that I see in that I do think that AI implementation for Main Street is an enormous opportunity to AI Ifying if you will.
1:15:56
And I, I don't think I think your first conclusions right, which is being the custom guy is tough.
You know what I mean?
It's just it's it's all things to all people which is nothing to know one if I'm talking to the audience now if you guys want to get into this world, what you want to do is look at an industry or an avatar that you understand well.
1:16:13
And so one of the things that like Y Combinator and some of these great, like, you know, legendary investors look at is how much time a founder has suffered and lived through a problem.
I can talk about breathing because I've had two nose surgeries.
I've been falling asleep on my hand since I was in 8th grade so that I could breathe.
So like, I've lived with the problem for a long time and I've tried many different types of solutions.
1:16:32
So I have tons of industry knowledge if I were to start a company like that.
If you have a job right now, or have had any type of job you've worked in a business, that's a great baseline of background knowledge that's difficult to just jump like it, even if you were a server at a restaurant for two years.
1:16:48
You still will.
Probably know more about restaurants than 99% of people who aren't in the restaurant industry.
Like, I don't know anything about how restaurants work.
I've just never really worked in one you could probably be aware of because you now also have this understanding of what AI can do to think, Okay, there's 100 problems in a restaurant.
Is there one very specific problem that I can solve well and is very similar between restaurants?
1:17:07
Because as soon as you get the point A to point B, you can create the clear value prop and you can message around that Getting extremely specific, which is I think what you were saying that you give the advice to is super smart and it makes the problem set really narrow to salt so you can become an expert that's a an inch wide and a mile deep.
1:17:24
The exact same thing.
The reason that most people don't do that when they're starting out is because you don't have enough demand.
You have so few leads that come to you that you're like, why?
I mean, shit, I need to pay rent this month and I only got 4 leads this month and all four are completely different.
But I need the money.
And so I get it.
1:17:40
Redeploy that cash into getting really concentrated on your marketing, which is what offers and leads is all about, so that you can find that specific avatar that you can over and over again repeat.
Which is also why referrals are so strong, because if you do a good job, they will send you other people just like them.
1:17:55
The question is, is yes, I can pick a niche to do this AI automation.
I can build AI solutions and sort of targeted 1, but what is the opportunity that I should target within the niche?
And that comes down to either A, as we said, industry experience that you already have or sort of B, what we've said is finding some sort of partner within the industry.
1:18:11
So we say you can either try to pay them for the time as a consultant or you can just message enough people and say, hey, look, I'm looking to bring these kind of solutions to the industry.
Would you be willing and working working on this with me?
I need a little bit of your specific knowledge, but in exchange, I'll create this thing and you can refer it.
You can basically have first dibs on sharing it to your network and you can make some money that way, so.
1:18:29
Yeah, I definitely wouldn't do it as a consulting relationship.
The, the thing that you're going to be selling is the product.
And so having a consultant who's the one who's in charge of the primary value that you're driving is not a good idea.
And so you'd want somebody who's long term incentivized to continually improve the product, continue to innovate the product, see the things that are coming around the corner to keep it up to date, make it better, make it stronger, etcetera.
1:18:51
It really just comes down to how to have a normal business partnership.
So all the normal rules of business apply and this person has some specific knowledge you don't have and you should ideally have specific knowledge they don't have.
They should be asking the question like why do I partner with the people in your community if I'm an AI developer right?
If you're trying to figure out which of the problems to solve in an industry, it's just value created times, ease of implementation.
1:19:11
That's the equation which if you chunk it up, it's number of potential customers times gross profit per customer.
If I have six different problems I could potentially solve, which one has way more people who have it?
Which one's easier to do?
Which one unlocks the most value?
One thing that we're starting to see as as us ourselves actually trying to build one of these these AI automation agencies now AI development companies well is that by building a a development team that is capable what is is your take and your experience with how important that development resource is.
1:19:36
I mean assured your event you must know working with developers can be a complete plan, but having them in house and and having a really good team to rely on as you shoot for those big opportunities can be key.
What's your experience been like this and how important do you think that development resources when you're going for this bigger place?
Very I.
1:19:55
Mean we were thinking the same things I was glad to know you agree on.
That it's the product.
Like if you're in a service business, the quality of the people that you use to provide the service is the product.
And so those people usually want to be compensated well because if they are really good, then the places that they're coming from will want to pay more to keep them.
1:20:13
And so you have to give them.
A great place to work and a financial incentive or some upside that they get exposed to that they wouldn't otherwise like.
You want them to feel like owners and the best way to do that is for them to actually be owners.
If you're trying to get on the cutting edge of technology, then actually having the people who are good at that is the business.
1:20:32
Well, it is a great reason to have a really killer marketing team under your belt.
But the the development side of things I I again to find, at least in our experience has been a harder thing for us to to create.
Because we don't know it.
Like it's easier for you to do the marketing stuff because you're good at it.
So you know if someone's full of shit on the interview.
You just don't know if anyone's full of shit on the interview because you have no context.
1:20:48
The most important hire, which is why I say this, is you need a technical Co founder.
You need somebody who has a real stake in making sure that the people who are coming in are actually good.
Not that you're checking a box and saying, hey, I have 14 people in my development team.
Anybody in the in the true high tech world knows that one amazing developer is more valuable than 100 the developers.
1:21:06
This is the hardest part of business is hiring people who are really good at something without knowing the in depth knowledge.
And that's where like leveraging somebody who might not want to work for you that you do think is brilliant to at least interview or double check on how good they are is really valuable.
1:21:21
That's where like building a network becomes important and getting even some.
Tests.
Like of aptitude for them to take so that you can at least get some sort of baseline, but it's all going to be about how skilled that person is because ideally if they were as good as you are at marketing, then you guys would probably have a really successful business.
1:21:39
We've been fortunate enough to to find that, find that magical sort of technical cofounder.
So we're starting to get them really well compensated, both getting inequity as well.
So we are off to the race and that's completely changed our business.
I can't even stress for for anyone of you in here that that key hire is just a complete game.
1:21:54
I'm sure you've had it, Alex, and your businesses where you've just found that right person and just completely changed this thing.
All right.
Appreciate you guys.
Thank you and appreciate the community.
Thank you guys for showing up.
Hopefully the book serves you guys well.
So do you feel like in general?
Do you think that you think you brought as much value as you promised?
I hope so.
1:22:10
I try to answer the questions to the best of my ability and provide value O.







0:00
Everyone's trying to take a shortcut to get there when they realize, like when I'm telling you right now, you're never going to get there because you're not good enough.
Like you're never going to get there because you're not good enough.
You have to do the Rocky cutscene.
You have to eat the shit for a period of time so that you can get the reps in, so you can put your time into the bar in so that you can actually get good.
0:19
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
The hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I'm going to walk you through the best way in my opinion to pick the niche that you're going to focus on to start your business.
0:45
So picking the niche, I think this is something that's like wildly misunderstood.
And I'll tell you where most people get wrong is that they pick a niche and they have enough, no idea about the niche, all right.
And so Y Combinator, which is a venture, it's like an incubator type thing in Silicon Valley.
1:00
They have their things that they look for when they're investing businesses and they're accepting the mid to YC.
And one of the ones that was really interesting to me is that they look for past experience within the space.
And because I think a big part of that is that a lot of times new businesses are not actually really new.
1:17
They're slight iterations on things that are old, right?
And candidly, within my own business experience, I don't even do anything new.
I just try and do stuff better, which people somehow poo poo on.
It's like you can go into dry cleaning and do it better than everybody else and still win.
Like you can go into lawn care and do it better than everyone else and still win.
1:34
And I think that's wildly underrated because you will 100% make money if you just try hard and know how to do business.
You don't need anything new, right?
And so like I think that is a wildly underestimated component of having strategy in business is just like how do, how do I get the use the value equation in the book, like how do I provide more value to my customers than anyone else can.
1:53
But like the actual industry itself that you're serving doesn't need to be new or different, right.
So that being said, like service with a smile while they're underrated, but the the piece that I want to hit on here is that like I'll tell you this story because I think it really drives this point home.
So in Allen, our software company that we recently sold a majority stake in, one of the agency owners, you know, for nine months was just like never making progress, right?
2:15
Like was always hopping on, was always having issues.
And it was like his clients were getting results and he was like, how do I get around that?
And I was like, you don't you need to fix that.
And it got to the point where I just said, listen, man, like, you don't know what you're doing, which is why your clients are getting results, period.
He said, well, I've got this one guy who does, you know, who makes all this money using our, you know, using the leads that we get him.
2:34
And I was like, OK, well, why is he getting making money?
And the other ones aren't.
And he was like, well, I don't know.
And I was like, right.
So that's not because of you, that's because of him.
And So what I told him to do, which was wild at the time, I said I need you, I think that you should close your agency.
I was like, I don't think you know anything about real estate.
2:52
I said, I think that if you know how to get real estate leads, then you should go get your realtor's license, go generate your own leads and go build a real estate business and learn it.
And then once you have succeeded in doing that, then if you want to then go make the agency and show other people how to do it because you've actually done it.
3:10
And so there's a a tweet by Leila, my wife.
She said, like, stop listening to people on the sidelines about like, sorry, stop listening to people about how to play the game who've never been anywhere but the sidelines, right?
And the problem is too many of the people right now, y'all are on the sidelines and have always been on the sidelines and are trying to pick a niche to get into, to sell.
3:30
How to do the niche?
Well, that's dumb.
You've never done it.
So a lot of times people are trying to skip to a higher leverage opportunity without having done the requisite work of understanding the niche.
Which is why the Y Combinator people look for like, if you want to make a software in the payment space, we'd love to see that you have experience in the payment space because there's so much stuff that you don't know that you know when you actually spend 35, you know, years doing something in an industry, you understand the lingo, you understand the avatar, you understand the problems, and you can see opportunities.
3:59
If you have an entrepreneurial hat on, there's always problems in every industry, which means there's always opportunity.
And fundamentally business is just solving problems that exist with A and making sure the math makes sense.
Like, that's literally it.
It's like where is there a problem?
How much do they think this is a problem and is there a way that I can solve it and charge for it?
4:17
That's it.
Like, that's really all that business is, right.
And so and really how well you solve the problem is going to dictate how much virality your business has because if you solve it really well, people will tell people and you will and your your business will grow, right.
I think the problem that a lot of people have is they didn't know how to make an offer, right.
4:33
It's the fundamental thing that is the beginning of building a business is you got to know what you're selling, right?
And so that was a problem for a lot of people.
And then people got that problem solved and then they told their friends and books sold 100,000 copies in six months with no promotion, right.
And so I'm only, I'm sharing this because I couldn't write a book on offers without having made a ton of offers.
4:51
And I feel like there's too often people who are trying to focus on a niche who've never actually done the thing in the niche.
And this is really, really rampant in the Internet space because everyone's trying to take a shortcut to get there when they like.
When I'm telling you right now you're never going to get there because you're not good enough.
Like you're never going to get there because you're not good enough.
5:08
You have to do the Rocky cutscene.
You have to eat the shit for a period of time so that you can get the reps in, so you can put your time into the bar in so that you can actually get good.
And before you are good you will suck.
And you have to accept long period of sucking and you do enough volume that eventually you'll suck so little that you'll actually be good.
5:24
And then then at that point then you'll actually have a real decision to make, which is I'm actually really good at this thing now that I've learned, do I want to teach it to other people or just want to do more of the thing that I'm doing right?
Because like a realtor can then just grow a team of 100 Realtors and own the entire thing, which is what I'd recommend this guy do, right rather than have an agency quick wise.
5:43
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything and so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
6:01
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take 10 seconds or one type of the time.
It would mean the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else that doesn't, right.
And so this is kind of where where I think the problem is, is that like, I had another question that was sent to me on Instagram, which was like, hey, how do I soft turn?
6:21
Because a lot of my, a lot of my clients are getting results and I'm like, well, duh.
He's like, I know he said, he said, how do I sell from 10,000 to 100,000 a month when I don't have a lot of testimonials?
I was like, you're not good at the thing that you're supposed to be good at, which is why you don't have testimonials, which is why you're not going to $100,000 a month.
6:37
Like, he's making the goal $100,000 a month rather than being good.
I, I, I, I have no words.
I have no words.
I don't get it.
You know what I mean?
Like, everyone's in such a fucking rush that you will never get there.
It is.
The slowest path to getting there is to fool yourself and to thinking that you're good at something that you're not.
6:54
You have to go and pull the thread and say which.
And The thing is just like, well, do what you're passionate about.
Whatever.
You're not going to be passionate about stuff that you suck at.
What you have to do is like which of these opportunities seem like they have potentially have high leverage, right?
And I'm going to learn from the bottom, right.
7:11
It's like one of the best ways to learn stuff is starting at the bottom, Not because you because it's the only option, but because if you understand the entire pathway of of a client journey or of an industry journey, then you will have more trench knowledge, more depth of experience that you will be then able to apply.
7:29
Right.
Like people see my, you know, videos on personal finance, people see videos of mine on sale, people see videos of mine recruiting, People see videos of mine of marketing.
And it's like, how did you acquire all these skills?
It's because, like, I just not only because I tried to jump to the spot that I'm at.
And then like you, you can't skip.
You can't skip.
7:45
Like there's a sequence.
Buildings are built with foundations and your career is a pyramid.
And the peak of that pyramid is based on the depth of the foundation that you build.
And so like I've said this before and I'll say it again, but your work works on you more than you work on it.
And so even though you might not be getting paid in the period that you're at, just because you're struggling doesn't mean you're failing, right?
8:05
And it means, and The thing is, as long as you're getting better, you're making progress.
And the progress is the success is that you are getting better.
And like you will turn the corner.
Like that's an inevitability if you put enough time in period.
I promise you that if you don't stop doing something for 10 years, you'll be really good at it, period.
And if you're really good at it, you'll like doing it right?
8:23
And if you like doing it, then at that point you won't wonder why your business isn't making money because you'll actually be good and then you won't have these questions.
But the questions that I get, I'd say a third of them come from a very short time around.
It's like, why am I not a millionaire?
It's been, it's been 90 days, Alex, what the hell?
8:38
It's like, well, you didn't put the five years in.
So if you're trying to figure out what niche you're going to pick, the point is to just pick and then accept that you're not going to be overwhelmingly successful for like 5 years.
Like every entrepreneur like that I know of puts five years in before before anything really happens.
8:57
And you're like, fuck, five years probably shouldn't tell new entrepreneurs that yes, you're going to be very successful very quickly.
You should put your job into it.
It takes a long time to learn because there's a lot of stuff you got to know.
You got to know how to generate leads.
You got to know how to work leads.
You got to know how to set appointments.
You got to learn how to close.
9:13
You got to learn how to set up bank accounts.
You got to learn how to transact.
You got to learn how to do billing.
You got to learn how to do payroll.
You got to like.
You got to learn how to actually fulfill a product.
You got to learn how to create a customer journey.
You got to learn how to ascend people.
You got to learn how to decrease churn.
You got to like, there's a lot of stuff you got to learn how to recruit.
You got to learn how to hire.
9:28
You got to like.
There's a lot of stuff that you got to learn.
And so to think that it's somehow going to take 90 days, it's like, why do you think that you can get a chemistry degree in four years and think you can somehow be able to become a master an entrepreneurship in 90 days?
It doesn't.
It doesn't give respect to the game.
Like, you have to respect the game.
9:46
Like a lot of people been playing this for 40 years, No one's getting their master's degree for 40 years.
Well, some pH DS are right, and they're probably pretty good at whatever their thing is, right?
And so it's like to think that you're going to beat guys who've been playing the same game for 40 years in your first try in 90 days doesn't respect the game.
And so, like, I was fortunate that I started young.
10:04
I started when I was 23.
I mean, the only thing I could have done before the do without doing that is just start instead of going to college, right?
But you have to, you have to put your time into the bar.
Like your legs aren't going to grow until you like you can't do 4 squat workouts and expect your legs to grow.
10:20
You'll get better at squatting and that getting better at squatting is a requisite for having bigger legs.
But you still got to put the volume in.
There's a depth of understanding that happens with volume that people cannot appreciate.
Like Napoleon said, quantity has a quality all of its own, right?
You got to do the boring work and you got to love the boring work.
10:37
And if you can do that, you won't lose because the only person who's injecting this artificial timeline on on you is you.
And so anyways, it was like one of the number of questions that I was getting in in my comments and stuff is like, how do you pick the niche?
How do you know where to start?
Like you don't know where to start.
You just start and then you start accumulating knowledge and then you will learn.
10:55
It's like reading books on sales before you've actually had a sales call.
I'm actually very against it.
I think you should start selling and then read books on sales because then the books will actually make sense to you, right?
Like trying to read 100 books on entrepreneurship before you've actually had a business is silly.
Start a business.
How do you start a business?
11:12
You get a bank account, get an LLC, and you figure out what you're going to sell.
Like that's what that's what you do, right?
That's how you start a business.
So it's going to start with promotion and selling because you can't even have the rest of the stuff until you learn how to do that.
And if you don't know what you're selling, it's because you probably aren't good at the thing yet.
So you got to go like get some industry experience, right.
11:28
That's why banks by the way, they don't loan to people who don't have industry experience.
So if you're like, hey, I want to get a you know, loan to.
This was actually a story I heard from from Jim Odor.
I ended up working with this for a period of time was and Jim Lynch was he wanted to start a gym and the the and get a loan from the bank and they and he went to like 10 banks and they all said no.
11:46
And they said and he said the reason was because he didn't have experience.
So what he did was he went to Bally's and worked at Bally's for like 3 or 4 years and worked his way up to becoming the personal training manager.
And then at that point started his gym.
And he didn't even need the bank loan at that point because he'd saved some money and he learned how the business worked.
12:05
And lo and behold, he was like, that was some of the best advice I ever had.
So sometimes you just got to get the industry experience.
People just want to skip to the the last step when like there are prerequisites to getting there, which is why prerequisites exist.
So this is hopefully the the real answer to how to pick your niche, which is like you just need to do something that is at least not you're not, you know, repelled from that you see people making money in and then stick with it for an inordinate amount of time without convincing yourself that you're smarter than you are.
12:34
Which is a a loose paraphrasing of a Twitter quote that I can't remember who wrote it.








0:00
And So what they think they're doing is they're like, well, that's what everyone else is doing.
So I need to build my personal brand.
You're not building anyone's fucking brand.
You're just reinforcing an identity that everyone already knows about and does not find you interesting because you're the same as everybody else.
If you remember when you were in middle school, there was like the preps and the goth kids and then the Bros or the athletes or whatever.
0:17
When we're growing up, we're trying to figure out our identity.
And maybe some of you weirdos actually switched tables once or twice because you're figuring out who you were.
And what happens is we learn these identities that come with these sets of beliefs.
You see this a little bit in the political seat if you're a Republican.
All the sudden you have to wear flannel and trucker has America and shoot guns.
0:33
And on the flip side if you're a liberal, you have to just say all homeless people can do whatever they want whenever and we should let everyone across the border no matter what, we all should raise taxes.
Basically.
Ridiculousness on both sides.
What happened to the real middle people who just like, hey, you can marry whoever you want, please don't tax me too much.
There's this middle and that's why people like Rogan have blown up because the people like he's a Republican, he's a liberal.
0:52
It's like he's just Joe Rogan.
Like Joe Rogan is interested in UFC.
He's also interested in aliens.
He's also interested in stand up comedy.
He's also has like this kind of fitness carnivore, whatever thing going and biohacking.
So he has these like very different interests that he's super deep on and no one would be like Joe.
1:07
So what we're thinking is you need to increase your biohacking by 15% so we can capture this audience.
No, if you want to stand out in your marketing or even a personal brand, just actually saying what you really believe, the thing that you're afraid of saying because maybe it's two or three or four beliefs that don't go with the uniform that you wear every day actually makes you significantly more unique.
1:26
Most people wear their clothing as a uniform to say I am this type of person.
People will look at you and they'll assume you're a goth or crap or whatever.
Here's where it gets cool.
You start talking, then all of a sudden there's something over here and then there's another belief over here and what happens is they start paying more attention because you don't fit the mold.
1:43
It's my favorite way to differentiate any of the portfolio companies or even my own brand.
This may sound crazy, actually just be myself.
Because as soon as someone feels like they have figured you out, they'll move on because they're like, I can predict all of this person's behavior.
They don't need to stay in tune or stay updated because they know everything about you already.
1:59
And I'm sure you've met people like this.
He wears this uniform.
He says these things.
He believes he is this person.
He's category 17.
Don't have to think about it again.
Everyone knows the starter kit for real estate.
You know, the haircut, they cut the side here, right?
Buzzed on the side, hard part, hard gel over suit.
Don't forget the glass is very important.
2:14
Maybe the high level BMW mid series wax with rims.
Maybe a picture of the A watch.
He's like, yeah, just bought this beauty.
Those guys are all the same and So what they think they're doing is they're like, well that's what everyone else is doing.
So I need to build my personal brand.
You're not building anyone's fucking brand, you're just reinforcing an identity that everyone already knows about and does not find you interesting because you're the same as everybody else.
2:34
I think that you would be better served actually doing you.
And that comes with all the weirdness that you are because I've met some of you.
Y'all are weird as fuck.
And if you stop pretending to be this identity that you wrap into the starter kit of whatever Instagram influencer you're trying to copy, and you just worry you, what happens is your unique individual personalities are like weirdness.
2:53
Because everybody had different parents, everybody was born in different cities.
Everyone has unique things.
Like, your dad might have been a mechanic.
You might know a bunch of shit about heart.
And if you bring that up, all of a sudden people look at what they expect from the real estate starter kit.
And all of a sudden, if you've got these points over here and you become interesting and people lean in, they pay attention because you don't match the mold.
3:10
I'm going to shift this to business.
There was this time where there was this competitor who moved in my marketplace when I had a local gym guy was out speeding me.
And I was like, man, I'm going to have to do something about this.
So what I did was I copied the guy's landing page.
So I copied everything, changed the logo, whatever.
It was like probably 90% the same.
Here's what's crazy.
His page did worse than mine did.
Why am I copying this guy?
3:26
I actually just got worse outcomes from this Fast forward.
I was gym launch days.
Somebody came, came to the marketplace, started marketing really similar stuff.
I subscribed to the list to see what the emails they were sending and they were my emails, Literally 100% word for word.
Didn't even like, swap anything out.
They were my e-mail.
I'm like, man, I'm thinking about copying this guy by copping on his newsletter.
3:42
He's just using my shit.
A lot of people say stay in tune with your competitors, consume everyone else's stuff.
I actually don't feel that way.
I actually turned off all my ads on my news feed when I made my marketer made my content.
I just made it about whatever stuff I felt like talking about.
And so people were like, man, your stuff's always so different and so original.
3:57
Whatever.
And it's really easy to be original if you're just not looking at everyone else's shit.
The act of consuming everyone else's stuff.
What ends up happening is that their thoughts become top of mind for you, and you become another Mickey Mouse, another Instagram influencer starter kit.
They've got the Wat, the car, 100% hustle, 0% grind.
If other people copy you, it's a good sign because it means that what you're doing is working and most people aren't original.
4:17
If you copy them, what it means is that you accept the position of 2nd place.
You accept that they are inherently first.
You literally say you are better than me at this.
And if you claim to be the best at whatever it is that you're trying to do, or at least that you're trying to be the best, you copy copying their identity, their look, their feel, their brand means that you are accepting to lose.
4:34
You will never win because you aren't going to beat them at being them.
Quick stories client and our software company, Allen, who was a real estate agency.
So we worked with agency owners in that business And so this guy was continually struggling.
Like you couldn't really ever breakthrough there and he was always selling new people and they would always turn out the back, whatever.
It took me 6 months of like just battering him over the head with this, publicly embarrassing him to finally get him to change his behavior.
4:54
I was like, you're not that good.
Like, it's not some marketing hack.
It's not some sales hack.
I was like, you're just not that good.
I was like, you sell to Realtors and he was like, yeah, I was like, have you ever been a realtor?
He was like, no.
Then you have no idea what they go through and what your marketing looks like and what your sales process looks like is the same as every other fucking person trying to sell Realtors promise you put your terrible agency, go take the 12 weeks, pass the test and actually be a realtor.
5:15
Sell some fucking houses using your marketing skills that you claim to sell.
In the first month of him doing this, he was like, oh shit, he's like, these leads aren't as good as I thought they were.
I was like, no shit.
That's why no one wanted to keep paying you.
But you know what he did over the next 12 months?
He got better and better and better at it.
And here's the crazy thing, 12 months later, he actually still a realtor and he's making more money because he actually got good at it.
5:33
But here's the thing, if he had kept trying to look like everybody else, he would've been Mickey Mousing until he kept trying some new thing or new some new hack.
But he just didn't confront the work.
And you know, what happens now is that if he actually did want to go back to the agency thing and actually did want to help Realtors, he would have the context to do it.
And it would make him unique because so many other people are just like him, pretending to be model their Instagram page after the same thing with the other influence you're looking up to does, rather than being like, I wanted to figure out real estate.
5:58
Most people don't do that.
They just look what everyone else is doing, do the same thing, water it down, and then literally blend in like everyone else and they wonder why they don't win.
You've heard me say replicate before you iterate, right?
That comes to skills.
If you want to learn how to sell right next to the guy who's making calls, you want to learn how to knock on doors, walk with the guy who's the best guy on the team who knocks doors, right?
6:18
You duplicate the skill so you know you can do it.
That's different than replicating a story and replicating an identity.
I've seen like Hermosify and Hermosi style content and Hermosi style edits.
It's not about the captions, it's about the content.
What they can copy is the way it looks and feels and sounds, and what they can't copy is the story behind it.
6:36
Fix the story and the brand will take care of itself.
If you tell the story, that's true.
And so if you don't have the story to tell, then do the shit that's worth doing that no one else is willing to do, and then you'll have the story that will make you a one of one.








0:00
The goal was if I if I ask people to promote something and I say that it's going to be worth it, that I have to absolutely deliver on that, so that next year or two years from now, if I say we promote my next book, they'll do it.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:20
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I hear that.
And I'm also like, if I reflect back, if we lost every football game, yeah, I think winning matters also, you've got to have some wins.
You know what I mean?
You got to have.
If I'd have lost every game for four years, I'd probably be like, this is not fun.
0:37
Sure, I'm becoming a better athlete and I'm competing against great people, but just always losing, I wouldn't be a challenge because you'd be like, this is not fun.
It's fun to win.
It's not fun to lose consistently.
You learn more in your losses.
0:53
Probably you learn more from the bigger breakdowns in the challenges you face than always winning.
The difficulties, the challenges develop.
Us having easy wins doesn't make us stronger and better.
But I think having all losses may just say that, OK, maybe this is the wrong thing you're at, you should be in something else.
1:12
Use this energy and effort and and attitude towards a different thing, a different purpose, a different sport, a different mission, a different art.
After a period of time, it's always so much losing you because yeah.
I want I I I mean I could.
Because I think the confidence.
I think the confidence comes in the effort and the journey, but it also you've got to back it with some external results I think or or some type of credibility somewhere.
1:39
It depends.
If so, the credibility is if you're trying to be an expert and a spout and give advice.
But.
Credibility to yourself if you have no external results.
I still I.
Broke today.
Yeah, yeah.
No one would listen to me.
That's OK.
But how would you feel about you after 10 years?
1:56
Totally 15 years?
I'm busting.
And I did it for five years.
I get it.
OK, but 10 years though?
50 years, Right, Right.
I think.
But that's where I'm saying, like, what has changed about me that has made me better, stronger, faster is because I I genuinely believe that the more I can divorce, that when even when you say like, you know you got to win sometimes, it's like even that small statement still makes it king.
2:21
Yeah, easy for you to say with 100 million and all the wins.
Yeah, easy to say at this stage.
I know, like you said to others, but.
I think that the reason that I'm gonna go from 100 to a billion and 10 billion and beyond is because I do genuinely like I am working harder now than I work to get here, and it's because I've learned a better way to work.
2:39
And so this is me sharing that better way to work.
Now to be fair, maybe I have certain skills that if I don't work as hard, I can still win, but I would still know.
And so I think that if you can, like if the whole point of anyone who's listening to this is that you can open up another level of effort, I think that is the next level of effort.
3:00
Because I if I had thought the way I think about business now and work now, I would have been here faster.
And that's me catering to the audience who wants to win.
But I'm saying I would have become who I am faster.
And I think that as a result, I would have evidence that would support that for every for the court of public opinion or for the court of Alex, it's it's just it's I I know what it's like to for me to give it my all and it's the absolute proudest I am of myself and there's nothing anyone can do to take that for me.
3:35
And that's when I feel bulletproof and there's not many times I can do that.
And so when I have realized how much work it takes to do something well to gain the approval of my 85 year old self, I also realized hand in hand that there's only a few amount of things that I can do because I have to be dramatically more focused because the amount of work it takes to do something well is so much greater than I used to think that I can't do 20 things if I'm going to do it well.
3:58
And so it goes back to like one of my favorite sayings, which is if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.
And The thing is, is that most people focus on the back half, but I think it's focusing on the first, like most things aren't worth doing.
If it is worth doing, then it is worth, yeah well.
Cut out the things that aren't worth doing.
4:13
Right.
So that you have all of the energy to actually give your honor something.
And I would say this is that most things aren't that hard if you really try.
It's that most people don't know how to try hard.
They just don't have, they don't have the skill to try hard.
4:31
And so the the number, I mean, you probably know the staff from the podcast world, right?
Which is it's 90% of people only upload one podcast.
Of the remaining 10%, 90% of them don't make it past 20 uploads.
4:51
So to be in the top 1% of podcasters, you have to upload 20 podcasts, right?
It still may not be successful, you still don't make it downloads, but you're doing a lot better than the other 90 percent, 99%.
The price for excellence has never been so cheap.
5:07
Yeah, it's showing up consistently.
Everyone is so soft now that to win you just have to not be made of glass and be willing to have someone tell you I don't approve of your life and you say that's OK.
5:24
Why do you think so many people are soft in our society today?
Well, I think we've put a lot of guardrails up that prevent people from getting hurt.
And I think that ends up resulting in people who don't know what getting hurt feels like.
And they feel like it's death, but it's not death, you know?
5:41
I think that's just, I mean, at at its absolute core, no one knows how to have hurt feelings.
And I think people think their feelings matter a lot more now than they used to.
Yeah, I don't think they matter that.
Much why should I like to think people's feelings matter that much?
5:58
Why should their feelings matter?
Why should my feelings matter?
Like if I if I hurt someone and I say what makes me feel good and why does that matter?
It hurt somebody.
So it's just looking at the actions and I that's.
I mean, to be fair, I'm very extreme in that manner.
But I think that if we can, for me, the more I can ignore my feelings and simply do the things that are required, the more I tend to see the results that I want.
6:23
And one of my favorite internal sayings, like the things that you repeat yourself, I'm sure everybody has like a couple things that like you say to you whenever I have something that I'm like, I want to like the the next rewrite of the book or hey man, we got to reshoot that whole thing because the mic was off or you know, the worst.
6:39
Sure, man.
Is I have this I have this refrain that's been trained faster and faster which is I will do what is required.
It's not what I want.
It's not what I feel like it's.
I will do what is.
Required.
I'm enjoyable.
I'll do what is required.
Yeah.
And that's it.
And so like there's not, there's not a question, there's not a.
6:56
If it's just I will do what is required and that has helped me a ton.
Yeah, you try to learn from the the pain or the challenge that occurred so it doesn't happen again, but you got to do what's required.
I saw this slip recently of this podcast called the All In Podcast, which I saw the.
7:12
I see these clips a lot online.
I want to start actually listening to this whole show, but I think they go too long.
But they have a lot of great insights.
It's like these four, like venture capitalists and they're all billionaires and they all like, are puppet masters in their own world, right.
And one of the clips was of a guy, I can't remember his name, but one of the guys who said he was spending a lot of time in Italy over the last month or a couple of months.
7:36
And he was saying, you know, I really like spending time over here because my friends in Italy know how to relax.
They know how to have great conversations.
They know how to talk about life and arts and magic and wonder and music and not just focus on more money.
7:55
Because this guy's a billionaire multi billionaire.
And he was like, there's more to life than just making lots more money.
When you already have a lot of money, what do you think about a, a point like that or a conversation like that where it's like, you know, live in Europe and yeah, take three months and relax and travel and.
8:16
I think there's an overarching assumption which is that life should be a certain way and I think that I would, I would reject that notion.
And so it's like we should because implied in that statement I think is we should be more like them.
And whenever I see a should, I kind of don't really accept any should frames.
8:35
It's like why?
Why should we?
Because you prefer that.
Which is fine.
You could say I prefer to live the same which case go live that way.
But to then say everyone should live that way Or you know then now you're casting a your personal preference on everyone else.
And I reject that wholeheartedly.
8:51
So if you, if you want to, if you want to play video games all day and be the absolute best in the world at it, and you are the best in the world at it, and you get twitch sponsorships and you have all that stuff and you learn to eat because of you're so good at it and you're so obsessed with it, who am I to stop you from doing that?
You're gonna die and I'm gonna die.
And at the end of your life, would you rather just go, you know, be a formative factory?
9:10
That's not a disrespectful thing.
I'm saying more so that if you love doing what you were doing, choose to not do what you love because you now are legitimate in the eyes of people who you don't care about.
Like there was one rule for me is do.
You do you?
Yeah.
I wanted to ask you about this.
9:28
Yeah, this book launch just happened and I know you, I know you did a vlog on this recently, which I want to dive in deeper, but can you give big context why this book?
Why the launch style that you did?
How many people showed up, how many people bought and upsells everything and how did you get that result to happen?
9:49
Not that we focus on results here, but the efforts, how did you get it all to come to fruition?
So my first book $100 million offers was a book that answered one question, which is what do I sell.
And so now that has 17,005 stars and you know it's.
Incredible.
It's a great book.
10:04
Actually, it's still on Amazon charts, top 20 of all Amazon.
And so is that 1.
So it's two of the 20, yeah, Right.
Yeah.
Not that we're calculating results or success here, yeah.
Of course, of course.
And I didn't even sell it on Amazon, I sold on Shopify, so all those sales didn't count.
But anyways, this book, the purpose of this book was to once someone knows what they're going to sell, they ask the next question, which is who do I sell it to?
10:24
You need leads, right?
And so this book is about advertising.
Now I split test the title four times to figure out what people like.
I tried marketing versus advertising.
I tried advertising versus leads.
I tried leads versus promotion.
And leads one as the categorical leader for what's the name of the book.
10:41
And so that's why I called it $100 million leads.
But advertising in of itself is the process of making known if no one knows about your stuff, no one can buy it.
And so that one more time if no one knows about your stuff.
Sorry, the first part, advertising.
Why is the process of making known?
Is making advertise the process of making known, Period.
10:57
If no one knows about your stuff, no.
One buys it, right?
And So what happens is most people have an offer and no one knows about it.
And so you have to make it known, You have to advertise it.
And so this book, so that the first book all hinged on something called the value equation, which is people talk about, hey, provide value, provide value, but how do you mechanize that?
11:17
How do you operationalize value?
And so it was actually solving a problem that people want increasing the likely that they think it's going to happen.
In other words, decreasing the risk that when they buy they're not going to get the thing that they want, decreasing the time it takes them to get whatever the outcome is and decreasing the effort and sacrifice that's associated the work that they have to do in order to get the outcome.
11:34
So there's the four variables, you decrease the last two, you increase the 1st, 2:00 and you have a more valuable thing which we covered in a different in a different video.
So you can watch that one with $100 leads.
I talk about the advertising cycle and so there's eight pieces to this.
So it has a little bit more pieces to it, but I think it it's simpler to understand in some ways.
11:53
So the first four is a core 4.
It's the only four ways any person can let other people know about their stuff advertise.
And so it's just a four box.
There's one O 1 and one to many and you've got people who know you, people who don't.
So if you're letting people who know you one-on-one you were doing warm outreach, you reach out to your friends and say, hey, come to my book event.
12:13
If you're letting people know one-on-one who don't know you, that's cold outreach, that's reaching out to strangers.
If you're letting people know one to many, two people who know you, that's posting content.
And if you're letting people one to many know who don't know you, that's running ads.
So there's the only four things that you can do to let other people know about your stuff.
12:30
Now the natural question is, are there other things that you can do?
The answer is yes and no.
No in that you can't do anything else.
But yes, there are other people who can let people know. 1st.
Right.
And so there's four, which I call the lead getters.
So you've got customers who can send you referrals.
Now, in order for them to send you referrals, they use the core four.
12:47
They either reach out to friends, they post content, they do the same four things because they're the only four ways a person could let other people know about stuff.
The 2nd is you've got employees, right?
Like, so when I was making content for the book, I didn't actually make the content.
My team made the content, and then they posted it on my behalf.
And so I got leverage on the amount of content I could put out because I other people help me from the paid ads.
13:07
Sorry, from the lead getter, #3 is agencies.
So you can pay agencies to help me make content.
You can pay agencies to help me run ads.
And for me for this book launch, I had agencies run the actual ads for the book, right.
Because we're a holding company, we don't actually transact.
So it made sense to contract that out.
13:22
But my team made the ads, their team ran the ads, but it was still leverage.
And then finally we had affiliates.
So that's another business who refers you business just to find?
It for the audience, they get a Commission, yeah.
They get paid in money, free stuff, or both, right?
And so we had 27,000 affiliates. 27,000 and we had a. 104,000 people who attended from affiliates.
13:44
We had 100 and. 37,000.
People, 137,000 people came in from paid ads.
We had just probably just like 210,000 people came in from content.
Organic.
Yeah.
And then the hour rates and then I would say that employees kind of factored into into that piece, right.
14:01
And so I used all the methods in the book to advertise the book itself.
So I could have just made AI, could have just emailed my list and just, you know, done a presentation or just released it.
And I probably would have sold a lot of copies.
But I wanted to use everything in the book to advertise the book to demonstrate that everything, proof that everything that I do here works and that they it'll work for them too if they just follow the steps in the book.
14:23
And so I purposely followed the scripts that I have in the book for making ads.
I followed the scripts that we had for making content throughout the whole thing so that people could look back at my ads.
They could look back at the content that I made and be like He followed this to AT and resulted in a, you know, world record-breaking event.
And so how much did you spend on the ads to get the leads 2?
14:42
75. 275.
Yeah, which is not for anybody.
That sounds like a lot of money, but for the context of how big of an event this is, it's nothing.
And then how much did you pay out affiliates, which is another form of advertising, How much does that pay out?
I guess 00.
They got free stuff.
14:58
How many people?
20,000. 27,000 affiliates they.
Didn't get any commissions correct on nothing really.
Why did they promote it then?
What was the leverage or the the value add for them?
I.
Think there's goodwill?
Wow.
And they also knew that the last book was good.
15:15
And I'll I'll give you the the the tactical piece of this is that most people require money to advertise to their audience because it's extracting goodwill to a degree.
And So what I mean rather than saying, hey, the top 10 affiliates get Lamborghinis, which only benefits the affiliate, not their audience, it said the top 10 affiliates, I'll do a live Q&A with your entire audience.
15:38
And so it benefits the audience to have the person who's promoting it win.
And it doesn't extract any goodwill.
In fact, it it builds goodwill because he's like, hey.
I've got this.
Amazing event, this book.
I I know, Alex, I've been following this stuff forever.
It'll help you out.
So go do this thing.
15:54
And if we're in the top ten, we'll also get, you know, time with Alex and we can answer his, you know, answer questions and do this stuff so it can apply to us.
So like, it's a win.
Win for everyone.
And so trying to find, like in my opinion, I talk about this in the book, like the best way to use affiliates is to find a win, win, win.
Which is it wins for me, it wins for them and it wins for their customers, right.
16:11
And usually it's only two wins and one loss.
And that's how most people do affiliates is why they have to pay an arm and a leg in order to get them.
Now a lot of times also they haven't built trust or goodwill with an audience before making an ask.
So I'd spent two years doing hopefully nothing but providing value.
And everyone expected the launch event itself to be probably a pitch of some sort.
16:30
And I tried to sprinkle that in because I wanted to build up the anticipation and the tension for the event.
But you know, upon the events we had five.
So the official count was we had 542,000 people who who registered for the event.
We had 188,000 Click to join, live with us and it was it was wild, right?
16:48
How many book sales in that first day do you know?
We saw 100,000 in like 10 minutes or something, yeah.
Yeah, it's incredible.
And that was with no large bundles.
Wow.
So that wasn't like, buy 100, get this.
It's like. 1-2 or three, maybe.
Three was the largest one that was incentivized.
17:03
Wow.
Yeah.
So I just said if you buy three, you get a hat.
And the main reason that I did that was because the whole mission of acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone.
And so it's like if you share my book with two friends, you've earned this hat.
And so this can't be bought, only earned.
17:20
And so you earned it by giving it.
And we had 50% of people.
Two chose 2.
Get three.
That's incredible way.
Real quick, guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
17:37
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So.
If it was a review.
If it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another.
17:54
Entrepreneur And so was.
There an upsell after that or how was the that was it?
That was it.
I mean, if I if I had wanted to make money, right?
You do coaching.
I would have been a very, it would have been a very different.
You know, I would have, I would have structured things very differently.
But the objective of the event was to demonstrate that the concepts of this book work.
18:13
And the objective of my last book was to show that making an amazing offer can grow the sales on its own.
So that one I did 0 advertising for and it sold 500,000 copies.
Wow.
None.
No paid ads.
No event.
I had 10,000 followers on Instagram when I posted that.
It was before Alex Romosi became Alex Romosi.
18:29
It was literally an internal SOP that Layla encouraged me to post as a book.
So I said fine and I added stories in it to make it interesting for my team because I was like if they don't read it, it's not not going to matter.
So I added stories in it and then I post it as a book and then then it just continues to sell more month over month.
And so that is the hope.
You know, obviously with this book too is that you make the product so exceptional that you get that, that that lead getter bucket of customer telling other customers and affiliates telling other people.
18:52
And I think that the goal was if I if I asked people to promote something and I say that it's going to be worth it, that I have to absolutely deliver on that.
So that next year or two years from now, if I say we promote my next book, they'll do it.
Now if I had gone and and sold whatever some you know, coaching thing or something like that, right, that would have been the last time they would have promoted because I would have been for free, right?
19:15
Yeah, I would have been siphoning their audience or whatever.
But I wanted to just install even more goodwill at scale by doing something that hopefully would be memorable that no one else would do.
And so I made a huge pitching presentation to stack all the value that I gave, you know, with this book and I pricing it, did it at $12,000.
19:36
Then I started.
Started.
Dropping down and and then I was like it's free and then everyone you know became much more memorable event and then the.
Book was free or what was free.
Book's free too.
Books free too.
O the course is free.
19:51
The book's free on my podcast, so on the game I have, I actually also made my offers book free as well, just because Eole are like Alex makes his money on the two that the book costs.
So just to dispel the myths.
Offers and $100 billion leads, or both on my podcast in sequence.
20:06
You can just listen to them straight through.
But if you want it all together in a physical book, you gotta pay.
For it, Yeah.
If you wanna pay for it, yeah.
I mean, if you physical books cost money to print and ship, so, right.
But it was but.
Otherwise people get it for 300 podcasts and we have to just.
And the course is on my site with no opt in.
You don't even have to opt in for it.
20:21
You can just have it.
And So what I will say this, this, you might find this interesting is that it's always the scariest thing in terms of give.
Like giving is always scary, no matter how how much you have, whatever it is.
Like if you work really hard on something, there's a part of you that wants to monetize it, right?
20:38
It's just it's innate to us, right?
You want to get something back.
And so that's why it's so hard to delay gratification for such a long period of time.
But it's also what will make you stand out in a marketplace of takers.
And so that was what I, I have consistently, I mean I've preached this message of just give, give, give and you will be able to grow faster than you can imagine.
20:58
And the event was probably the largest demonstration of that that I can do.
And what has now happened since then is you know, we're number one in business on Spotify.
We're, you know, we're 19 in all podcasts.
From doing that we get a, you know, 150,000 unique views a day on my site.
21:16
Wow, because the course.
Is free.
It's huge.
And so people share it and that's the thing and people share the podcast because they got value from it and they know that they, you know, it's a $20 book.
I think on Audible, Audible picks the prices for that.
But like, it's but because there's intrinsic value, people will share it.
21:31
And I think it's that's The thing is people give away free fluff that sucks because they will spend no time on it.
And then people consume it, realize it's junk, and then associate that junk with the person.
And then say you have a junk brand because I've associated you with the one thing that I've consumed from you.
And so, despite the fact that your customer's only gonna be 1% of the people that you ever advertised to or less, your reputation is made by the 99.
21:53
Wow.
And so if you want to control the representation that you have, then you didn't give away more stuff.
And in a world where trust is going to continually decrease and the amount of information and content is going to only increase with AI and things like that, I believe that personal brands and trust and authority are going to be increasingly important.
22:10
I think that more companies will have celebrity partners in order to gain trust because cost to acquire customers on paid ads has gone up 100% in a very short period of time when you have, when you have CAC.
So cost of our customer increasing at that rate.
You have to have something that is going to counteract that and that's what brand is.
22:27
And so brand has never been more important than it is today and I think we'll only increase in importance.
And so this was a brand play.
That's incredible.
And so yeah, we saw, we saw 190,000 copies so far, the 1st.
What week and a half?
Two weeks.
Yeah, 10 days or 11, it's whatever.
Wow, man, 190,000.
22:43
That's crazy, man.
Yeah, with no, with no thousand pack bundles.
It's amazing.
Yeah, it's inspiring.
What are the?
What are the how many pieces of content do you put out a day on all social media platforms right now?
We put 300 a week out. 300 a week?
Yeah.
22:58
And if you could go back to two years ago when you only had 10,000 followers, Yeah, to now you have 5 million.
Yeah, on all platforms in two years.
What would you say to your younger self, two years younger, about the path to getting here?
23:16
The honest truth, I wouldn't say anything, so I wouldn't want to mess anything up.
It's like that's the the real real.
Do you think you can get there by posting less?
No, I think the volume, the volume is you know, quantity creates quality like you learn, you learn how to do things better by doing more of it.
23:32
And so I've, I've wholeheartedly embraced that, that perspective when it comes to making content.
But I do believe that it's not just like because there are people who will post every single day and they get zero engagement etcetera, you know?
You're not learning from it.
Right, you need feedback.
You still need feedback.
23:48
You need to take the feedback from the market.
And ideally, you can also have feedback from people who know more than you.
And so you use those two feedback mechanisms.
And the faster you can make the feedback loop, the faster you'll learn and change your behavior and get better.
And so you want to do tons of volume with tons of feedback, because the like quality is better than quantity, but you only get quality through quantity, and the only thing better than that is quantity with quality.
24:11
Correct.
Then you really start.
To grow and then you, then you get.
You get wild in terms of all the different platform distribution.
Yeah, it's been a it's been a super fun ride.
I'm very proud of the book.
Yeah, it's great, man.
I know that there's nothing else that I could have done to make the book better at my current level.
Maybe in two years, right?
24:27
I might have been able to.
I wrote it.
I did 19 drafts.
I had 4-4 rewrites.
I did 6 hours a day for two years.
That's great.
I work from.
I work from six to noon every day on the book, on the book, and then.
Unless you were here during the interview with me.
24:42
Of course, in the afternoons.
My afternoons when I do my meetings and take calls and do the remainder of my actual job.
Right.
The only thing that I would add to this conversation right here, I'm sure there's a lot more, but things popping out for me is people could hear that and say, OK, you could keep working on this for another two more years until it's perfect.
25:01
Because you said, I like what you said is you put it out at the current level that you're at.
You couldn't have done anything else to where you're at right now.
Maybe in two to four years you would have been like, I could have changed this a little bit.
I think a lot of people get hung up on that.
They wait, wait, wait, wait.
That's not ready yet.
25:17
And this isn't ready for yourself 10 years from now, right?
It's it's not as good as it could be in 10 years writing it, but it is as good as where it is right now for your current self.
And I think people need to learn how to also ship quality with with what they can do it now and not just wait forever.
25:35
I think a lot of people hide under the guise of perfectionism when it's really just laziness and fear.
So the reality is they're like it's not ready yet, but they're working on it 3 hours a week.
They're not going all day and obsessing.
About it, so I mean like I I think the whole like it's it's tension between 2 extremes, right?
25:54
You've got the MVP which means minimum viable product.
Ship it as fast as you can.
If you are proud of your first product, it sucks, right?
And on the other hand you have, you know, Apple that ships new products every like three years or you know, and they they really only have four products and built a $3 trillion company.
26:09
So we're, you know, we're on this continuum.
Do you lie?
And I think it's it's learning the right to, it's honestly probably matching your personality to the work that you do.
But regardless, work has to be done.
And so I can see this, it's like if you work on something for six hours a day, every single day and you truly work on it.
26:26
When I say work, I mean like you set a timer and when the time when you step away or you look at your phone, you stop the timer.
When you use six hours of actual work on something every single day, you will know the things that you could do to make it better.
And if you do all of those things and the difference is is being very clear on the problem definition, so that's OK.
26:46
So this might round out this whole conversation if you're really clear about the problem that the product, if you're if we're talking about making product is supposed to solve.
And so I could then of course write a whole book on sales and I could write a whole book on, you know monetization I could like, so then then the scope would then change.
27:04
So you have to be ruthless with the problem definition of the scope of whatever thing that you're trying to solve is.
But then within that very narrow line, is this everything I can do in this tiny little sliver.
If it's everything that I can do, then you can chip it.
And I think that's the that like you're not going to create the everything solution.
27:21
You're not going to create HubSpot CRM when you're a coder in your basement, but you can probably create an auto responder that works exceptionally well and so do that.
Just do that.
Don't add the other dude.
Just make that.
One of my favorite stories about product iteration was Dragon Dictation.
27:36
Do you know Dragon way back in the day like 90s, right.
And so the you got a you got a headset and you would talk and it would type and this was like a CD the whole thing.
I remember this now and they got loud and praised by like Tech magazine or crunch or whatever it is for Dragon Two Point O and in Dragon Two Point O they literally added zero new features.
27:59
They just made it work better.
And I think that is like the spirit of true product innovation is that a lot of people think they need more bells and whistles.
But if you just fulfilled the first promise that you made and really did it and did it better, then you can make 10 times more money by doing something twice as well, because it's just how much better?
28:18
Like if I said.
More efficient?
Yeah.
If I can, if I said I can get you customers I don't need to also hire your staff.
If I can just do that.
I fulfilled my promise And this book specifically only sits between somebody who doesn't know you exist and someone says they're interested in what you have to sell.
28:34
That's it.
As soon as someone says I would like to find out more that book is done.
Everything that that 280 pages is to get you from I don't know who you are to I'm interested to buy.
To find out more I would I would like to consider buying your stuff.
Which is why the sub headline is how to get strangers to want to buy your stuff, not to get them to buy your stuff.
28:52
To buy your stuff is sales.
Yeah, and that's the third book.
Stay tuned for that.
They can get the book for free on your podcast.
You get a course on your site, acquisitions.com, acquisition.com.
They can follow you everywhere.
Or Mosey.
If you love hard copies, you can go to shop.acquisition.com and grab a hard.
29:08
Copy I would get this.
Get a few copies for sure.
It's pretty, right?
It's on.
Where can they get the hard copy?
It's on Amazon too.
It's on.
Amazon.
Yeah, I think paperbacks aren't even hardback.
If you like hardbacks, I have them.
Shop.acquisition.com.
Shop.acquisition.com I'm sure if you just go to the site and.
29:24
Make all the money.
All your 299 in books?
Exactly.
If people are business owners that are looking to be a part of your portfolio, I'm sure they can go to acquisition.com and they can learn more and apply and see what's going on there.
And business owners, it's just for absolute clarity, It's really like if you're doing 2 million or more in profit and we have actually narrowed our focus a little bit more to brick and mortar chains.
29:48
So we've just, we've just crushed all the brick and mortar chains that we have invested in and so we are smart, we are.
At least for what you know best of you did brick and mortar.
Yeah, I mean, you're speaking into it.
You've done, you did gyms, you know?
Physical photography studios.
Teeth whitening.
We've like, like if you have like a if you have like a health or a beauty icon, like body services, anything.
30:08
Tanning salon.
Or yeah, exactly.
Tattoo.
Removal, laser skin, hair removal, that kind of stuff like that is our there you go, that is our gym, they'll.
Reach out to you.
They can message you.
They can go on acquisition.com, get a few copies of the book.
30:25
I think this is really inspiring.
I love this stuff.
You know, I've been doing a lot of this for the last 10-15 years on myself, and I went through this and I was like, oh, there's actually some stuff that I can really start to start to apply even better, even though I've, you know, mastered to a certain level.
30:40
There's so many different things that I was pulling out from.
I was like, OK cool, I can steal like an artist here, here, here, here, so.
Control X control.
I was like, this is really smart.
Yeah.
So it doesn't matter if you're a beginner or if you're, you know, got a big business, you're going to learn something from this and make sure to get a few copies, give them to friends.
30:57
I can't wait for the next one.
I can't wait to have you back on in the in the future soon.
Grateful for you, Alex.
Thank you for being here.








0:00
And So what you have to do is you have to appeal in your past and say, when did I exhibit these things?
Because all of us have exhibited these character traits at some point in our life.
And then what you do is you say I am this way because.
And then you tell yourself the stories of the things you did in the past that exhibited those traits.
0:18
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk, and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
The most powerful things that change our behavior and our character are the stories we tell ourselves.
0:40
I think that when I started out of business, I heard all these things in the personal development space, like you should read these affirmations every morning, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I never did that and it was because it felt stupid to me.
Now, that being said, there might be some people who've had life changing results from doing that.
But what I did notice is that the stories I would tell myself about myself were the things that changed my beliefs.
1:01
They were the things that changed my character.
And so a lot of times they've talked about how entrepreneurship is about three things.
It's about changing the beliefs that you have.
It's about increasing the skill set that you have and then the character traits that go along with that to make sure the skills are successful.
So I'll give you a simple example for this.
1:16
So a friend of mine, he started a fitness app.
It was doing about $20,000 a month.
He was a top game CrossFit Games competitor.
But he was really ashamed because he wasn't the winner.
He was like, you know, really, really highly ranked one.
But he wasn't the winner.
And so he felt he believed that his app wasn't good enough and so he never promoted it.
1:32
So it grew to $20,000 a month in revenue with him doing 0 promotion, right.
And when he realized that it was OK for him to promote it and people got a lot of value from it, and the app was good enough, he went from $20,000 a month to like $150,000 a month like that.
1:48
And the difference was his beliefs, his skills are the same, right?
His character traits are the same.
He changed his beliefs, right.
So let me give you a different example.
So when I actually started out getting in my own business, I had a chain of gyms.
This is a very, very, you know, this is 10 years ago.
I had chain of gyms and I knew how to run sales teams.
2:07
I knew how to generate leads.
I needed to do all these things.
But what ended up happening was I had one missing piece, which is also a belief.
Darn.
I was actually trying to give you a different one, but I had a mentor come in and say you need to be, you need to get in the licensing business, you need to license this model to lots of people rather than doing the actual model yourself.
2:23
And so I did make that transition and then we went from, I think, you know, I think we did like 2 or $3,000,000 to doing 7 and the next year we did 28 million.
So the year that we made the transition halfway through is what jumped us from two or three to seven.
And it was just in the last like four months that we saw this crazy growth.
And then we did 28 million the next year.
2:39
And so it was because I had all these skills and I also had the character traits.
I just needed again to change for the beliefs.
I was trying to give you an example with the character traits.
Also let me think of 1.
So if you have, for example, if I had had those skills but I didn't have the character traits of being disciplined and being focused on one thing, I would have jumped between multiple, you know, entrepreneurial endeavors and never been able to see success.
2:58
Because even though I had the beliefs about what was possible, like if I'd said, OK, I'm going to do gyms and I'm going to do chiropractors and I'm going to do dentists, I'm going to do XY and Z, right.
Until I had the character trait of focus, the character trait of discipline, then I would not have seen the success.
Right.
And so the next answer question is, OK, well, if I have to have aligned beliefs, skills and character traits at each level of the ladder, because you can have.
3:19
And this is what's crazy.
When you see the overnight successes, this is what happens.
I want to describe it to you so you understand it and how you can do it.
All right.
So let's say that there's a ladder.
All right.
And you've got this pole on one side.
You get the pole on the other side, and you get the middle bar.
OK.
You need all three to move to the next level of the ladder, Right.
3:36
And so, for example, you might have the left side built up six stories above where you're at, and you might have the right side build up 10 stories from where you're at right now.
But all of a sudden, if you change your character and that character trait development gives you three more runs, all of a sudden you go three runs because you already have the constraint has been removed.
3:55
And so you can be more advanced in your beliefs than you on your skills.
Or it can be more advanced in your character trait than you are in your skills, or you can be more advanced in your skills than you are in your beliefs, right.
And so it's having all three of those that are checked off at each level of entrepreneurship that gets you to one $1 million a year, $3,000,000 a year, $10 million a year, $100 million a year, whatever it is, right?
4:13
Is you have to have all of them.
And so the point is to get you to understand how to actually develop those soft things.
Because the skills are straightforward, right?
The skills are you just go by the course and you read the book and you consume the content like this and you practice, you apply, right?
That's what you have to do.
That's it.
That's it, right.
4:29
One of the skills that I see lots of marketers these days not have is they don't know how to sell.
They don't know how to develop a sales team.
They don't want to manage and grow a sales team.
They don't want to lead a sales team.
That's a skill they don't have.
And as soon as they do, they go from 3 million to 10 million like that very, very easily, right.
And so it's understanding that that's the skill deficit and as soon as they do it, boom, they blow up.
4:47
I was fortunate because I had a ton of the skills in my skill toolbox, but I went from making nothing to tons because I had all of these rungs of this ladder already built out to to a $30 million level.
Except I just didn't have the beliefs.
That was my issue, right?
And candidly, I think still one of my biggest issues is belief.
5:03
I suffer from a lot of insecurities.
And so my wife was the one who was like, you can do this.
Like you don't have to have these gyms, like you can license out the model like you can you can really succeed like this.
And I honestly just thought she was a really smart person and very wise.
And so I trusted her belief in me before.
5:21
I really trusted it for myself.
And so hopefully you can have something like that in your life.
But maybe that that could be me.
I trust in your.
I trust in your your skills and your beliefs.
So.
So hopefully you can borrow some of that trust because I promise you the world does get better when you when you take those leaps of faith.
But the point is, is if you have these three things right, the stories that you tell yourself, right.
5:39
One of the things that Layla always says, who's my wife, she has her own channel.
You can check it out is she's like, what's the evidence?
Right?
What's the evidence that you're so bad at this?
What's the evidence that you have?
Because you keep beating yourself up about this, but what's your evidence, right?
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
5:55
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check on my YouTube channel, It's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
And if not, keep enjoying the show.
6:12
What I do when I identify a character trait that I lack or identify a skill that I don't have or a belief that I don't have, and this one I'll just specifically talked about the character, Trace could think it's really important.
It's probably the one that people struggle with the most is what are the stories that you tell yourself about yourself, right.
6:29
A lot of times I had dinner recently with a $5,000,000 entrepreneur and he was like, I had a lot of trauma when I was a kid and that's why I am this way.
He speaks like he is this way because.
And I was like, I think that's a really convenient story to tell yourself about why you are anxious or why you exhibit anxious tendencies.
6:45
I was like, but what if you did that and you just didn't exhibit anxious tendencies?
What then?
What if you just chose not to?
What if you chose to not give power to that situation with that parent when you were growing up?
They already made you suffer.
Why would you let them make you suffer more by telling yourself that they gave you this character trait?
7:04
And it's because it's uncomfortable for you to suffer through the change of changing your identity, right?
But Leila and I both believe this is that your identity is fluid and you need to be able to change your identity and your character traits based on what the business requires.
If you want to grow, right?
Like if you're not a patient person, then you need to become patient.
7:21
Macro, micro speed, macro, patience, right?
If you want to develop a reputation, you need to become a person of integrity, which means sometimes short term, you have to sacrifice, right?
You have to not make the quick buck if you want to be disciplined and have focused.
And it means that you have to be able to say no.
Strategy means what do you say no to that still looks like it makes sense on paper.
7:39
That's strategy.
That's what it is.
It's what things do we choose not to invest in, right?
And the people who learn how to make the most money are the ones who know how to focus, and that's a character trait.
And So what you have to do is you have to peel in your past and say, when did I exhibit these things?
Because all of us have exhibited these character traits at some point in our life.
7:55
And then what you do is you say I am this way because.
And then you tell yourself the stories of the things you did in the past that exhibited those traits.
And by doing that you'll start reminding yourself.
So if I want to say like because I'll tell you, I used to have more angry tendencies.
8:11
I used to tend and trend towards being angry as response to things that I didn't like, right?
But one of the things that I liked like that I try and tell myself is that I am wise, right?
And this is a character trait.
That's probably been the number one character trait that I've tried to develop over the however many years just because I believe discernment is the single greatest character trait you can have.
8:28
Because if you make the right decisions, the whole world is your oyster, right?
If you can make the right call, the whole world is your oyster.
And so for me, wisdom is the #1 character trait that I wish to develop.
And so when I think to myself I am wise because I use the same formula that most people, and most of us, myself included, use to destroy ourselves with these insecurities, with these, with these negative character traits that we believe we have.
8:54
And instead of saying an affirmation you tell yourself the story of why what you're saying is true.
You learn to argue against your own thoughts and that's how you start developing this muscle, this these traits that start to become a whisper and then a shout, and then they become they emanate from you and you project them when you walk in the room subconsciously.
9:13
But it's a practice that goes from active to passive in your mind, right?
If you are a patient person, if you are a kind person, if you are an Integris person, right.
If you are a hard working person, right.
We all have these stories that we tell about ourselves.
And so if you have a limitation right now on your character trait or traits, you don't feel like you are patient enough, you feel like you are too easily distracted, you feel like you don't focus enough, then you need to start telling yourself the story.
9:41
I am this way because not I am wealthy stupid in my opinion.
I think our brains are too smart for that stuff.
You have to give it the reasons you have to make the argument.
And I think instead of affirmations, if you make affirmations into arguments that you make with yourself every day, then those become things that will change who you are.
9:59
And if you change who you are and how you make decisions, you'll change your entire life and you'll be able to watch your business grow as a result of who you have become.
And so this is one of the things that was most powerful for me in my entrepreneurial journey.
I I had had tons of insecurities, right?
10:15
I had tons of anxieties, I had lots of anger, I had lots of perceived trauma.
And I'll say it that way because I don't even want to make it into trauma.
That's what I perceived as trauma because I was a child in the world with the the the emotional regulation of a child.
And so things of course affect you more when you're a kid.
10:32
Everyone's traumatized.
Traumatized perceives trauma.
As a child, like if I go to a stage and I say, hey, who here had a traumatic childhood in some instance or had a traumatic event occur, everyone's going to raise their hand.
So stop thinking that because you have trauma.
And I don't say this, I'll say this with, I'll say it this way better for me, I chose to stop giving trauma power.
10:54
And I think if you can do that and you can tell yourself a different story about why you are who you are and make arguments instead of affirmations, you'll be able to have stronger, faster change in the direction that you desire and you'll have more control over your emotional state.
11:09
And then in so doing, you'll be able to level up the business that you have.
Because most of the times when I see business owners, the reason they're not successful is not because they don't have the beliefs or because they don't have the skills.
It's just because of who they are.
I had to call the other day and somebody hopped on and and they were like, and honestly, the guy was an asshole.
And he's like, man, employees suck and I can never keep any good talent and blah, blah, blah, blah.
11:28
And I just paused and I was like, that's not surprising.
And he was like, what?
I was like, have you met you?
Like, I don't know what else to say, you know?
And have you met you?
Like, I don't need to change this guy's marketing, right?
I don't need to change this guy's beliefs about his own business.
I he's just changed who he is.
11:44
And the only way for that guy to do that is for him to get over the reasons that he tells himself it's OK to be who he is.
And I think a lot of us do that.
We give ourselves the the excuse for being impatient.
We give ourselves the excuse for cheating, right?
We give ourselves the excuse for being unfaithful.
We give the excuse for being unloyal.
12:00
Well my dad was where my mom was, or my brother was or whatever, right?
Or when I was growing up or what?
From my town.
IXYZ.
I'm this way because the cows is one of the most powerful words in the English language.
It's great for persuasion.
Make sure you use it to persuade yourself in the right direction.
So anyways, that's just my two cents.

And The thing is, you're going to hire somebody who you think is going to be good at marketing and they're not going to be, then you got to hire another person, right?
And if you're like, man, that sounds tiring.
That's the reason most people who own big companies are like it is hard to do this.
This is not easy.
This is not for the faint of heart.
You must have a long term vision that you are committed to because you will burn out if you're only doing it for the money.
0:21
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
I hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy. 99% of businesses end up closing down over a long enough time horizon.
0:45
Only 1% of businesses ever get sold are trained chance and the reason for that is not because you know the the what you might think, right?
You might think that it's because business owners don't know how to sell their business or don't know how to market the business to get sold.
But that's actually not the real reason.
The real reason is because most businesses are worthless.
1:02
And So what I want to talk about today is how to go from a worthless business to a business that has actual value.
All right.
And so right now if you're a small business owner, which you know there's 30 million small businesses or whatever, it is a lot, most of these businesses don't actually have value.
And the reason for that is because they are not businesses, they are jobs, right.
1:21
And so if you remember Robert Kiyosaki's is wealth quadrant, I think it goes employee, self-employed owner and then investor.
I believe that's the quadrant.
I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's what it is or at least that's how I would draw it in my head in terms of some progression.
So most of us have, you know, most people have jobs first, right.
And then they make a certain amount of money.
1:37
They're relatively skilled and they think, you know, I could do something like this on my own, right, or I could do something else on my own.
And so then they switch to self-employed.
And what they don't know is that switch from box 1 to box 2 is that you actually take a decrease in pay.
And the the reason for that is because you actually aren't that good yet.
You know how to do one thing well here.
1:53
And because of that, because you fit into a larger machine, you're able to earn higher pay because as a as a sum of parts, you can actually provide more value, right.
But when you actually have to be each of the parts, you're not that good at it yet.
And so you become self-employed and you actually make significantly less for a long period of time.
2:08
The thing is, is that most people who are self-employed have an LLC, right.
And so they consider themselves to be business owners, but the reality is that they are not business owners.
They are self-employed.
And even if you have other employees that work for you, you were still self-employed.
Here's the litmus test for this, right?
What happens is, and I have these conversations all the time because there's companies that apply to, to to become portfolio companies with us.
2:28
So we can invest in the companies and help them help them grow, consume it all, right.
The the thing that happens though is that they stop doing the actual fulfilment of the thing.
Whatever the widget is, whether whatever they're selling right or the services, they're not actually doing the fulfilment.
And so in that moment, they're like, I now own a business and I am a business owner, and now I can sell this business.
2:47
And that's so far from the truth because there are so many other things that must happen, right, in order for a business to be sellable.
Because for a business to be sellable, it must be an asset that can run without you.
Now, you might think, again, here's the fallacy that your business can run without you.
And that's because maybe you don't do the actual thing, but you're still involved in maybe the marketing and the sales, right?
3:06
If you can't get someone to replace you in that, then you can't sell it.
Now you might think, oh, I'll just sell it and then somebody else will do.
That is not going to be a solvable thing.
No one's going to do that because they're like, well, you haven't done it.
Well, why would I believe that someone can do it besides you?
Because you haven't proved it.
And So what you have to do is prove to what a future buyer would be that this business can operate on its own without you, right.
3:27
And so the next step, right, is that you replace the acquisition.
So first you have the services that you're not doing.
Then you replace the acquisition process to be something that is reliable.
Pick one of the channels you want, you could pick referrals, you could pick affiliates.
You could pick a manual outbound which is cold calls, cold emails, whatever.
You could pick owned media which is like all the people that you already have contact with that you can message.
3:45
You could have earned media, which is that you you start creating a channel of your own that that a platform will distribute your content.
That's how you generate business.
Or you could do paid traffic, right?
You could, you could do paid media and start running ads on a consistent way to generate sales, right.
No matter what it is, you have to have a consistent process where you know if you put X effort or X dollars in this side that you will get Y outcome on the other side, right?
4:05
And if you don't have that, then you don't have a sellable business.
Now here's what happens next.
So first you you productize your your service.
It's a consistent thing that you deliver over and over again.
You're not custom.
If it's custom, it's going to be terrible and it's going to be, it's going to be valued as a service based business, which is going to suck.
And you're not going to be able to sell it.
You're going to have a massive earn out, which basically means you're going to work for the next five years to earn the exact same pay except you no longer own the business and the person who gives you the earn out has all the upside and you, you take all the risk and they get all the upside.
4:30
So no bueno there.
And so you've you've productized the service, you have a predictable acquisition process, right?
And you're like now I can sell the business.
Ah, wait, there's more.
Because The thing is, is that you still own all the hats.
You still might be managing the sales team, you might still be managing the marketing, you still might be innovating the product, you still might be making all the chief decisions, right?
4:50
You still might even be operating the business, just not actually doing any of those things.
And so to say that, like I am now a business owner and this, this works without me is not true.
You were just, you were doing higher level skills which believe it or not, are more expensive to replace.
Believe it, you know.
And so now you have to go find someone who's going to become your VP of Sales.
5:08
So you can take that hat off and who's going to become your Director of marketing.
So you can take that hat off and who's going to become the chief product guy who's going to be consistently innovating the product and improving it so that it you know, delivers excess value to your customers, right.
So you have all these hats on.
And so the process of entrepreneurship of transitioning from self-employed where you literally have 100 hats, right, to transition to business owner, You take all the hats off your head and you were just a shareholder, which is I prefer to see, it is like you have to think yourself not as the owner but as the director of the board, as the chief shareholder in the company.
5:37
Right.
Rather than the owner.
OK.
Even that change in language I think is helpful.
And it was for me what we have to do here.
And if you're like, man, that's going to take a long time for to do that.
Duh.
That's why most businesses don't get sold.
And that's why it sometimes it takes years to build something that's great, right?
It might take you three years.
It might take you five years.
5:52
It might take you 10 years, right, To get the business to that point.
And if you're like, man, if I only just had XYZ insert person, I could do this.
Welcome to entrepreneurship.
Like the game is about people, right?
Once you have the model and you have some of the tactics in the beginning so you can get some initial traction like the rest of it is people, right?
6:09
People are the thing that are going to run this machine for you and that means you have to learn how to recruit, have to how to hire, how to manage and how to lead, right.
And those are the soft skills that are harder to to they're they're less tangible but they're just as important if not more so right.
When you look at the the biggest billionaires and multi millionaires out there, they have, they keep their space around them very clean.
6:27
They know what they stand for, they know and people are attracted to them because they have admirable qualities and traits and that is how you get the higher level people.
So think about this.
So let's say that you've got somebody who's a brilliant marketer who can generate demand like crazy for you, right?
Well, that person isn't going to work for someone who's lower skilled than they are, right?
6:48
You have to have more skills to attract the type of people that you want who are going to help you run this business and grow it because they have to believe in the vision.
They want to do something that's meaningful.
And so the the journey here is understanding and this is the piece that I think most people miss, is that they don't even know the hats that they are wearing.
7:04
You making decisions is a hat.
It's an important hat, right?
And so selling it without the person who can make the decisions isn't a business, right.
If you're selling it and you're still the Chief Marketing Officer, you're the one who's controlling the messaging and the branding and all of those things, it's still like that rule still exists.
7:22
Hey MO's Edition quick break.
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright, so send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with.
Tag them in one of my relayless posts and I will give you all the love of the world.
7:38
Alright, so let's get back to the show.
And so there's typically far more leadership that has to occur in order for the business to be sellable.
And here's the thing.
Now all of a sudden, all of these roles that you've been doing up to this point, you've been taking profit, profit, sell, discretionary, earns, SDE right from the business, when in reality a lot of that profit must be allocated back to the roles that you're doing.
8:01
But you're not choosing to pay yourself for, right?
What happens is a business will become more sellable as you replaced all of the pieces that you're doing and oftentimes the margin will drop, but that is OK because now you have 100% of your time back and then you are truly a shareholder in the company.
And this takes years, not months, not weeks.
8:17
And The thing is, is you're going to hire somebody who you think is going to be good at marketing and they're not going to be.
And then you have to hire another person and then you think they're going to be good at marketing and they're not.
Then you got to hire another person, right.
And if you're like, man, that sounds tiring.
That's the reason most people who own big companies are like it is hard to do this.
This is not easy.
This is not for the faint of heart.
8:34
You must have a long term vision that you are committed to because you will burn out.
If you're only doing it for the money, you will.
Because once you satisfy your personal needs, you'll just stop being.
You'll stop being inspired by the reason that you're doing this right.
And The thing is, is your employees will be even less inspired because all of it starts with you and then gets diluted down.
8:50
And so if you are not extremely potent, right, you are not extremely distilled down in terms of your vision of where you want to go and why you're doing this.
Why does business even exist then other people be even less so and less committed to that vision and you will attract lower quality people and they will, they will turn out and they will not be skilled, etcetera.
9:06
What happens is the small businesses become big businesses because you need to slowly grow them so that you can accommodate more people, right, Who can actually do all of the things that you do.
And the reality is that you're not going to find because right now you're like, well, there's one of me, so I just need to hire one more person.
But that's not, that's not reality, right?
9:23
You might be doing 6 things and you might have to hire six people to do what you are doing.
And of course you do.
And that sounds unreasonable, but welcome to business.
And so for businesses to be scalable, often times they have to have significant enough gross margins and volume to be able to pay for high quality talent to be able to actually do these things to take decisions off your plate.
9:41
And where you get into the point of kind of like hyper growth and hyper scale where you starting to talk 10,000,020 million, 30 million plus per year, right is when you have people who come with solutions preloaded, they come with experience of having done the thing that you need to solve already.
So this like you'll notice the transition, the business owner, and I'll tell you this right now, is that once you start crossing multiply 8 figures, the people that you are hiring are better than you are at everything.
10:06
And that's one of the, that's one of the, that's one of the weird things that happens because in the beginning, most people don't have the skills that you do, right.
And so you have to hire people who are, who are, who are not as good as you are and then you have to train them, right.
And then later on, you start hiring people who are OK at some things.
You still have to train them on how you want it done.
10:23
So they have, they've done the type of role in the business in the past, but they don't know how you want it done here.
So you have some training, but there's less and there's some experience, right?
The level above that is when people come in, they know what to do and they know how to do it better, better than you for your specific business.
10:38
And when then that happens, then you realize how how little utility you actually have in the business and how your really only role is to just recruit people, right?
Recruit people and cast the vision of where you are, want to make the bet for the company of where you want it to go.
And so anyways, the reason that most businesses are worthless is because they sell entirely customized things.
10:58
They sell it to everyone, which makes it completely unscalable.
They're the ones who are still heavily involved in the acquisition in the rain making.
And so because of that and then even then even after they've graduated from getting out of the selling and getting out of the fulfillment, the the the business still doesn't have value because they might still be the talking face, they still may be the spokesperson.
11:14
Which means that the the business has no value outside of themselves because no one else could take it over, right.
Unless the person agreed to a three or five year earn out, which then means that you transfer the ownership to someone else, they get all the upside and if you don't hit the milestones they get your business anyway ways and you get none of the money, right?
11:30
And so it may sound arduous to do this and it is, but I can tell you that having now gone through this process it is one of the most worthwhile things that you can do is look at the business as a true sellable asset.
Because I heard this quote from an MIT dude who spoke from John Warlow's book.
11:46
But anyways he said all of you guys are busy selling your services.
What you should be doing is selling your business, right?
You as the CEO or the owner, your job is to sell the business.
The job of the of the sales people is to sell the products, right?
Once you can make the transition from your businesses or your products rather than your services of the business or the products you look, you move up in a level of of an order of magnitude, right?
12:10
And so I'm not saying that you should immediately be selling your business, right, but you should be making your business sell a bull.
And the beauty of this is that when you go through this process, you end up having phenomenal leverage in any kind of negotiation that you want to have in the future.
And this is a a key hack for negotiating, FYI, is that don't need the deal.
12:27
The guy who needs the deal, the less is.
The way that you negotiate like that is like everyone wants all these tricks and tactics and things for negotiating.
The way to have the way to have the best negotiation is to have the most leverage.
The way to have the most leverage does not need the deal.
Simple, right?
Simple, not easy.
How about that?
And so if you want to sell your business someday for a lot of money, then the business must be sellable.
12:46
And in order for you to do that, you must get the business to the point where you don't even mind keeping it, because it's still cash flow, so much money to you and you don't do anything.
That is the position of FU.
That is the position where you'll get the most money because now you have something that people want.
No one wants a business where the owners, you know, no one wants to buy themselves a job, right?
13:04
And they don't want to buy themselves your job.
And so you have to think and this is the critical self-awareness of thinking like what are the actual things that I do?
Everyone's going to think, Oh no, I don't do anything.
This thing runs itself except if you step away and didn't answer calls for two months, would the business still run itself?
Probably not.
Right.
So then we have to look at what are we actually doing And it might be little, little fractional things that we're doing all over the place.
13:23
But we still have to quantify those things and we still have to put processes around them and then hand them to people and then see how they do and then continue to improve them until eventually you get to that promised land where you don't actually have to do anything and you can still own the business.
And I mean to prove this like you can probably own shares of companies on the public traded market, they have figured this out, right.
13:41
And you can own a piece and and participate in the upside without ever ever looking at what Apple is doing for their, for their road map, right.
And so we have to get to that point as business owners in order to make the asset that we own the most valuable thing that we have.
Probably the biggest thing on our net worth balance sheet is all the the equity that we have in our businesses and to increase the value of that equity, we have to make it so that it is actually a business and we transition from employee to self-employed to owner, right.
14:05
And then the transition there goes from owner to investor because when you make that transition, that is when you start seeing your business for what it is, which is a sellable asset that sits on your net worth balance sheet.
All right.
And so this is one of the hardest lessons that took me the longest amount of time to learn And hopefully just translating this to you because I I see so many people were like, I want to sell my business, but the business is not sellable and it is worthless without them.
14:25
And so we can't just say, oh, the next person's going to figure it out because they're not going to, I'll tell you right now, they're not going to.
You have to figure it out.
And what most people do instead is they just start another business because they don't know how to solve the problem.
And so we must confront the problems that we have, which is you have to articulate the thing that you don't know how to do as a problem that you can solve, which is I don't know how to insert, find, hire direct a marketing director.
14:45
I do not know how to find AVP of sales and train them and manage them and grow them.
I do not know how to find a chief, you know, product Officer who's going to innovate the product on my behalf and make it better than I ever could and make a better product and make a better client experience around it and consistently improve it based on these metrics.
15:01
Until we can articulate what the problems are, we cannot solve them.
And if we consistently live in this world of like, I just want to sell my business someday, you're not going to be able to until you put these pieces in place so that the business is sellable and actually has value in and of itself separate from you.
And then when that happens, your net worth will skyrocket, because now you have something that everyone wants, which is an asset that produces cash while you sleep.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect.
0:15
And let's rock and roll, everybody.
Happy Tuesday, man.
I'm doing two in a row on a Content tear, but I wanted to make a short video.
So I don't think it's gonna be as long as the last one was, but this one's just a very Optical video just kind of an understanding of the business model that you have within a local market.
0:35
And so, one of the questions that we get all the time is like my markets different or this.
I don't know if this will work in my market.
So there's, there's probably two main points that I want to make.
And then kind of an example of how this applied with our jars.
0:51
So why our Market shouldn't matter if your model is designed properly, is the title of this?
And how am I to best locations were in polar opposite markets?
So why are you mark?
It shouldn't matter if your model is designed properly is that the model should be able to adjust to a given market and so what I mean by that is that my two best or you know the locations that make the most money were in polar opposite location.
1:15
So let me give you just numbers to back that.
So my La Habra location was in my probably You could argue my porous market and so the Porsche market and so this is Southern California, median income was 31,000 and in Southern California, that Is not a lot a lot of gang activity in areas.
1:33
Like it was it's I mean it's considered a lower and lower socioeconomic status area on the flip side.
The best location I had was the second-most looking ahead that was in Lake Forest California.
And so you have these two polar opposite facilities, right?
1:52
And the way, and the reason that these work well, and my Huntington Beach locations, actually almost the same there too.
And Huntington Beach probably sits You're to Lake Forest in terms of demographics and income.
That one median income was like 90 body Forge Lake Forest was 120.
2:09
I think it's the meeting him there.
So you have 31,000.
Got 120 on this side, you got 90 in the middle and then we had another one in that was, like, 60, 60 or thousand median income.
But the point is, this is that the reason that they were able to do so, well, is that we had a bifurcated model, which is a hybrid model.
2:24
And so, the reason that a flexible model can be flexible, is that independent of The marker that you are in is provided you are not super super super high ticket in for me.
What I would I would Define super, super super, I take it as is you know, if you're doing two thousand dollars a month, probably, yeah.
2:41
I mean, if your minimum, take it as a thousand dollars a month, that's going to be very high ticket and that would lend itself better to a truly, very wealthy market right now that being said, the hybrid model that we espouse, which is what all the gyms that we have and going to gym Legacy.
2:57
End up adopting is the hybrid model, which means that their first level of service is going to be large group, which is between 150 and 200 $25 a month.
And then, their second level of service is going to be semi-private, which is one on four and then the ticket price there is going to be 500 or $700 a month.
3:14
Now, why did this apply to the store that are the examples that I was giving earlier my, the harbor location had way more in the large group.
We Less in the small group and broker markets tend to have more people.
It's just then sir there are more poor people than there are middle income and wealthy people.
3:31
And so when you are in a poor Market, the advantage that you have is that your ads will go further, you will get more leads, they will be cheaper.
That being said, the lifetime value goes customers, may be slightly lower.
And so you're going to have a larger large group, right?
You'll still have people who have through this is a high priority for.
3:47
I can't tell you the amount of times I have people who had the hubcap missing on their car and had like, you know, Doors, a different color.
Paying 400. $500 a month for semi private reading because it was a priority for them.
It mattered a lot to them.
And those guys are the types of people who would work, the extra shift at their job, would pick up Uber on the weekend so that they could do it because it was a priority for them.
4:07
Right?
So in La Habra, that was the way it broke down in Lake.
Forest is the totally opposite, right?
It's going to be majority, majority semi-private training clients, but we still obviously had people who were staying at the, the Lesser Price, Right?
4:22
Steve going to Beach.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
4:47
And so, if you have a flexible model that is designed, well, it can adapt to the market because you have more people who will Ascend, but less of them or you have more people who will not Ascend, but more of them and then your ads will be responsive in the cheaper markets.
5:02
That should be more responsive because you're just gonna have more people per demographic.
That's what that's the nature of.
I don't want to use the term ghetto but like, but poor sa, you know, so cute.
Socioeconomic status areas right now.
More people per capita.
But a period is, what is your semi reason to get you further?
5:18
Right.
Whereas here you just got to squeeze more out of each person as your model has to be able to do that.
If your model does not do that, then you have a less flexible model which makes you not optimized which means you're less likely to win in a competitive environment which this is right and so your Market should not matter for your model it shouldn't.
5:37
And so I mean I can obviously lead on for anybody who is it was on you know who's not actually in our world yet you know just look.
The bazillion decimals we have from super-rich markets to supermarkets, but if the hundred thousand, testimonials doesn't do it for you.
5:53
Then hopefully, this theoretical explanation should make sense to you like, no matter which you do.
There are going to people who respond to either level of service that you're marketing period.
That's true, right?
It's just that some of them are going to be more apt to ascend, which means that if you are not allowing them the opportunity to ascend, if you're not asking for money more money, past the first sale, if you are a wealthy wealthy or middle high income market, then you are leaving money on the table and you're not utilizing your Marketplace for the optimal outcome that that Marketplace can provide right now.
6:27
The people who can get away with it, better, believe it or not other ones who are really broke markets.
I love, broke.
Markets, broke markets.
Are the fastest to grow?
They're the easiest to get in because most people don't even have a second level service because they're afraid to do.
And so most people because most models are Just large group.
6:46
When they start with us, those ones tend to be more demographically dense, right?
And so, those ones, get cheaper lead pasta, they get more of them.
But when they try and do some my privates, right?
They're not going to get as big of a bite, but they also have a huge client base that they can pull from.
So, if they have 300 people on EST, then getting 20 or 30 of them to pay. 500 is only ten percent so it's actually really not that bad whereas maybe in a Huntington Beach type Market, you're going to get maybe 30%, they're going to be willing to up.
7:15
Grade 2, 500 $600 a month, but you're going to be pulling from maybe 180 or 200 FTS and so, the numbers of kind of workout accordingly, but I hope that makes sense for everyone, why your, why your Market really shouldn't matter for you.
If your model is defined properly, the advantages of poor markets versus Rich markets and ultimately If you were like on the fence, either way you need to Market your business, you need to have an acquisition strategy.
7:42
And if you're like, I'm not sure if this would, you know or like the gym launch way would work for me, it's kind of silly because there is no gym Lunch Way like it's just profitable acquisition but we just mark it, the best promotions that are out there.
And we just know that we're making money on the acquisition, which means that everything after that is lifetime, value, is all profit.
7:59
That's the point.
And so it just doesn't really matter and if you want you can lean on the bazillion.
Testimonials go to.
I don't hate money.com.
Like man I really need something to help me up do that.
But it should make sense to you from me from a theoretical standpoint.
You should understand that.
8:16
Yeah.
Hope that helped anyone who's not?
Sure or like man.
My market is XYZ, it doesn't matter, it never matters.
And the thing that really does matter is how Beecher people are?
It's how good your services and everyone thinks that that might be the next video.
I make everyone thinks that they're good but they're really not.
8:32
I think I'd make that my next video but of this make sense guys.
Have an amazing Thursday, and Brian Stevens.
I appreciate you brother.
Thanks for always tagging.
All right.

I learned $6 million lessons at my first job working hot summers as an 18 year old in a warehouse at a fifth generation fur coat dealer.
And this business made it from two world wars, multiple recessions, and these lessons I've taken with me for life.
0:16
The first lesson you ever taught me was how to deal with angry customers.
I don't.
Mind having care if I could walk in the store?
And get the part.
This lady comes in and she is piss angry.
She's like.
Where's Johnny?
He sold me this coat and this button came off.
This is so ridiculous.
0:32
I spent so much money on this coat.
Blah, blah, blah.
She's just making a scene.
I didn't go in the retail store that much 'cause like I looked like an 18 year old and I wasn't going to be selling any $25,000 coats.
John, the owner of the store, I'm on the other side of the door so she can't see me and he's walking towards me to turn out to go deal with her.
0:48
As he's walking towards me, I see him roll his eyes and then as he turns a corner, he goes right into character.
Missus Johnson, that is ridiculous.
I cannot believe that you had a coat that had a button that was missing.
Who sold you that coat?
I need to find them right now.
We'll get rid of them.
Did anyone see you with the coat without the button?
1:05
We're we're going to get to the bottom of this right now.
All of a sudden her whole tone changes.
She started backpedaling and she's like, I mean it.
You know it wasn't that big of a deal like it was.
It was just a button.
It probably.
No, we need to get to the bottom of this.
This is not acceptable.
And she all of a sudden became calm as kidding.
1:21
She's like, you know what I I just, I just want it to be fixed.
If you could fix the coat and he's he grabbed it for me.
He's like, we're going to handle this right now.
He goes to the back, They fix the thing in 5 minutes.
He hands it back to her and she's like, John, you're always the best.
Thank you so much for dealing with this.
I'm sorry I was a little bit over the top.
1:36
I just, you know, I've spent so much in the jacket and he's like, as you should be.
She walked out the door, he turned him in.
He was like and he said there could only be one person in the angry boat.
So whenever someone comes in the angry boat, what most people try and do is they try and downplay them.
And so they say, well, it's not that big of a deal.
1:52
And what happens is the person doesn't feel validated.
The person who's upset then increases how angry they are because they want the person to validate why they're angry.
And So what happens is they just keep getting angry and this person keeps trying to make them less angry and then just creates more and more of a discrepancy between the two people.
Now the flip side is she got in the angry boat, and so she had to get out of the angry boat.
2:10
And so whenever you're dealing with an upset customer, you need to validate their anger.
And in a real way, if something was messed up and you have very high stands for your business, the moment you say it's not a big deal, it means you're not actually taking responsibility.
Even if their complaint is ridiculous, it still is your responsibility.
And so you have to take ownership of it, because the alternative is you don't and you never get better.
2:30
The second lesson he taught me was about creating a new product.
They realized that in the summer they never had any demand because people aren't trying to buy fur coats in the summer.
And they're like, huh, what can we sell to people during the summer?
And so they came up with a genius idea.
We'll store and condition the coats for them as they sold every single customer coat.
2:48
They said, hey, every year, make sure during the summer when you're not using the coat, you bring it back here.
We can repair any damages.
We can sew things up.
We can condition the firm.
We can make it last 2-3 five times longer so you can pass it on to the next of kin.
And then he would give this a little analogy.
He's like, right, If you're going to buy a $50,000 car, you'd pay 100 bucks a month for insurance.
3:06
It's the same thing here.
So you created this analogy that compared for which people didn't understand as well to a car which was something they did.
And So what happened is overnight he created what I would consider an insurance product.
Insurance products don't actually have to be insurance.
You can charge people for the safety that whatever they just bought will continue to provide value for a longer period of time.
3:26
And the cost to deliver on this was so low because we had 118 year old two air conditioning, 3 storage facility and the upsell was lesson three was getting people to say yes by saying no.
When I first learned no base selling, I actually learned it from this job when I was 18.
3:42
Storage is the first core thing, which is I just hang your coat up and I keep it air conditioned.
And the upsell is I'll also brush it and I'll fix it and I'll do these other things.
And so when they would call up customers and they'd say, hey, do you want to, you know, turn in your coat for the summer, what they did was say, hey, we're going to store and condition the coat.
3:58
You don't want anything else, do you?
And they would say no, no, no, I don't want anything else.
And so implied in that they got them to say yes to storage and yes to conditioning the coat, pretty slick.
People want to just get the default option.
We're so trained to say no to any kind of upsells, but if you get someone to say no, but in so doing get them to say yes, you actually click into their subconscious automated response.
4:20
Most times when they say no to salesman, they save money.
You flip the script and you align it so that them saying no actually gets them to say yes for you into the purchase.
So lesson 4, when they wanted to get people to actually take them up on the upsell that they had, they gave them a little piece of bait.
And it was what I call sawdust.
4:36
And so sawdust is anything in a business that has created an excess that you normally throw out.
So a lot of famous things were actually made out of sawdust.
IKEA pieces of furniture.
They just glued together all the sawdust from lumber mills.
Whey protein used to get scraped off the bottom of dairy centers because it was waste product and now is one of the most expensive products sold from dairy.
4:56
What he did was he took the scraps from all the coats that they would make in the back.
They made tiny little things that were made of fur.
So think like little purses, little earmuffs.
And so they said anybody who would turn in their coat would get this as a bonus.
They gave away something that cost them nothing, that people still perceive value as bait to get people to come in and actually take the upsell.
5:16
What's even more, when people did come to turn the thing in, they would actually say, well, you want to store that too, right?
And they would say yes.
And then they would charge them for that.
Even though they got the product for free, the storage didn't come free.
And if people are listening to this, if you're listening to this and you're a consumer, you have to get around the like, someone selling me something makes them evil.
5:32
Capitalism is the only system where both people say thank you after an exchange.
It means both parties are better.
And if someone threatens you, that's different.
That's not, that's just a form of robbery.
But if I say, would you like this thing?
And the other person says yes.
And they give me money and I give them the thing.
No harm was done.
If someone didn't want to store the earmuffs, then they didn't have to and they just got it for free, which is a benefit and for the business, just a cost of doing business to get the person in the door.
5:55
How he was able to double the amount of coats people would buy the first who she said no dealers.
Everyone who's a consumer thinks, oh, these must be great deals.
That's why dealers aren't allowed.
Once they got in, there was a sign on the door that said limit to coats per customer.
They're like, oh, there's a limit.
I have to use up the scarce resource.
6:11
On top of that they would have multiple strike downs on the price.
It said final price, all sales are final and he purposely let people in on a single file line and a fixed amount of people in the store.
At the same time.
It created this huge perception of demand and you feel like you got to go get yours.
By creating this continuity product where people would come every year to get their fur coat insured and fixed, you become the dealer for life.
6:34
And So what happens is instead of them price shopping you were going all over town.
What they'll do instead is they go to you first.
Instead of being that one salesman who sells one car one time, you become the car salesman for the the rest of your life because of what you do between the sales.
So in your business, if you have a one time product, especially that's a little bit bigger in purchase, having little things that you can do even if you didn't make money on them and then you know that on average you get customers to buy two more products from you.
6:59
It more than makes up for the effort and cost of time that you put into it.
And this leads me to my final lesson.
This fur coat dealer was able to withstand all of the PEDA pressures and all of the people being upset about animals even though they wear leather and they eat meat every day.
He was able to whether that for five generations because he never stopped doing the boring work, what they do has not changed fundamentally in years.
7:21
All they did was get better and better and better at it.
One of the things that I found through all the portfolio companies that we work with, we own acquisition.com to portfolio.
It is $200 million a year.
The difference between small business owners and the big business owners is that the big business owners do the same thing for a very long period of time.
They do all the things that right now you probably know you should be doing but aren't in your business.
7:39
They just do those.
They just do all the basics every time, every day.
And if you're like, man, but it's going to, it'll take me time to set up a blog.
It'll take me time to do e-mail, follow up consistently.
It's going to take me time to create content.
It's going to take me time to build a sales team.
Yeah, those are all the things that you probably know you should do.
And they take time, which is why building a business that's big takes big time, but it also creates even bigger outcomes.








0:00
In those early years you put a lot in, but then there was significantly more on the tail.
And so the rush is ultimately what kills most people because they're so concerned about like I need to make money tomorrow and I can appreciate the short term need for that.
But as much as you possibly can balance, how can I solve a problem for good so that I can just move on to the next boss rather than having to keep fighting every month to pay payroll or pay myself or make whatever nut I need to make?
0:25
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
All right, everybody, we're here at Arcadia with Alex Harmozi, the legend himself.
0:40
Thanks for coming bro.
Yeah, Damn.
See.
You didn't think this was your crowd?
No, I didn't.
I didn't.
I really didn't.
I was like, I didn't know if anyone even knew who I was.
Yeah.
Well, because the bottom line is, as much as we set our sights on our own personal transformation, our own growth, our own, we also care about earning money, making money for our family, doing good things with that energy that we collect.
1:06
We were just talking about the Tesla battery.
We want to keep that battery full, the battery of our bank accounts full, find a way that we can actually affect the world in a positive way and support our own community, our own family, in the best way possible.
So everybody gives a shit about it.
A lot of people pretend they don't give a shit about it, but they're lying.
1:23
And so many people I found in the spiritual community, they'll be like, no, I don't care about money.
Money is the root of all evil, blah, blah, blah.
And then you have a little business deal that you put in front of them and they get greedy as hell and you're like, whoa, where'd that come from?
You know?
1:39
So the bottom line is, is that we all do care, even if we care, so that our our desire is to share that money.
We care.
And if we don't care, that means we don't trust ourselves to do good things with the money we make.
I agree with all of them.
1:57
It's just it's funny that red flag that you mentioned is like almost like decision algorithm that I go off of which is if someone says I value X over money in any business deal, for me that's always the this person I need to watch out for because they're being dishonest.
It's been true every time.
2:14
Not just like oh some like sometimes that it's every time it's been true.
This is a side note for you guys.
So if someone's like I just value this relationship over, if we both make money, we'll want to keep this relationship, right.
So like just tell me what you want and I'll tell you what I want money wise and if it makes sense then we'll both be super happy.
2:35
And I've, I mean I'm getting like right into tactics on this.
But let's making deals as though I'm always dealing with a stranger has always been the best frame.
That is because now we do deals for a living now for the most part, and then everything above the deal is gravy.
2:56
So rather than trying to factor in the intangibles, I just don't factor them in and say so if I'm I could employ my mother and I would still do the same deal, which is like I would do this for somebody of your experience because that way all my downside is covered because this is the deal I would give somebody who's not my mother, who I don't XY and Z and benefit in other ways from.
3:15
And so that way it's like I think that's how you unlock plus plus deals where it's like the very worst case is that this is the same deal I'd give a stranger everything else is just bonus.
And so that's that's helped me a lot.
And even setting that frame at the onset, which is I only do deals with strangers in terms of how we do deals because if it makes sense for you and I and our relationship didn't exist, then it will make sense if our relationship does exist.
3:38
But if the converse isn't true, then it won't work.
I've seen so many different partnerships develop amongst friends and there's an inequitable value proposition based upon the friends, but they're friends.
So they're like we'll go 5050 on this deal, but actually they can't contribute 50% to the business.
3:57
So it all sounds good.
It feels good as you're kind of moving along, oh, this is great.
We're going to do this together.
But then one person with 50% of the business needs to do 90% of the work.
And then over time, that just doesn't work because you're going to need to start selling more equity and then there's going to be more dilution.
4:12
And then things get imbalanced.
So the impulse is beautiful.
It's a beautiful impulse.
Share everything evenly.
If I have a sandwich, you have half a sandwich.
I believe in those type of things.
But then there's business.
And business has its own codes and its own rules that also have to be like acknowledged.
4:31
There's probably a disadvantage for the spiritual community within the world of business that everyone kind of has to deal with.
Because there's this, I would imagine, cuz I I sit probably on the exact polar opposite side of the world from the spiritual community.
4:47
So this is like the only time I've been in anything close to this.
Seriously, I got in here and I was like, are we going to talk about like, money at all or like any of that stuff?
He's like, no, we like making money.
I was like, awesome, all right.
5:03
I feel like a little more comfortable.
I was like, because I'm like the if you die, nothing happens and everything's meaningless.
Person.
I was like, I don't know if that's going to vibe with this community.
I was like actually like kind of, I was like, I hope because when you guys welcomed me, which I I really appreciate that.
That meant a lot because I was like, I'm surprised by that because I felt like most of this room would be like, I disagree with all of those things.
5:24
And so, and that's also, that's also one of the things that myself and Joe Rogan and a lot of different people stand actually as a disruptive force saying like no, no, no.
All the spiritual stuff, all the beliefs, and we're going to fucking kill it in the gym and we're going to be savages in the bedroom and we're going to also make as much money as we can because we trust ourselves to do good shit with that money.
5:48
So it's like trying to embody this different model, like you don't have to be one of the other, you can actually be all of it.
I love that.
Yeah.
So how do we do it?
6:04
Making money?
Yeah.
One of the things I was, I was, I was kind of getting into with the part you were talking earlier about everything is equal.
And that perspective is people equate their equity value with their human value.
And I think that's where the big misunderstanding, especially people who are getting into business together, it's like why aren't we equal?
6:23
Like, we're both even people.
It's like, but we won't be necessarily even contributors in the economics of the business.
Like I have 100,000 followers and that's going to be the initial demand for this entire business.
And right now your skill set is something that I can hire for at a value of 70,000 a year.
6:44
And so if I can replace you for 70,000 a year, it's basically like instead of me taking a loan for myself or some someone else for whatever 7000 or $6000 a month, I'm giving you this slice.
And so $6000 a month is only worth this percentage of equity relative to the value of the company.
7:00
And so I think translating that especially at the onset because I don't know where everyone actually this would be really helpful for me.
So OK, I don't know how I'll just do this the way I would do it and you guys can be uncomfortable if you want to.
So if you don't have a business but would like to start a business, could you raise your hand for me?
7:19
OK, cool.
That is helpful.
If you are between like that, so you so you've made your first dollar and like 100,000 a year.
Could you raise your hand for me, OK, if you're between 100 and 250, OK, if you're between 2:50 and a million, a million plus, OK, this helps me a ton in terms of like what to be talking about.
7:43
All right.
So we were just talking about, here's my ADD, equity, equity, thank you.
Whenever you start a business, you always incur debt.
And so the question is what type of debt are you going to incur?
8:00
And so you can incur financial debt, which is one that people can understand.
You can incur management debt because you hire people that are under skilled for whatever the opportunity is.
You can incur technical debt because you don't have the infrastructure to build the business off of.
And so you want to take on the debt that is easiest to repay as fast as possible.
8:18
And so when you think about that from the onset, it's not like we're going to do this thing debt free, you're always going to incur debt.
And so when you think about that you have way more leverage to play with in terms of how you want to build this structure for whatever you're ultimately trying to achieve.
Now if your if your goals are to make, you know, 100,000 a year or 500,000 a year or $1,000,000 a year, you can pretty much do all of that owning 100% of the equity and just developing skills like I don't, I don't really think you need much more than that to do it.
8:44
And sub a million everything comes down to sub a million everything comes down to marketing and sales is that you have to let people know about your stuff and you have to be able to convince them to give you money in exchange for it.
Unfortunately for what I'm about to say, product matters significantly less at that level because you honestly aren't making enough of a dent for the word of mouth to really catch up given how big the world is.
9:10
And I'm saying that from a very realist perspective, if you just know how to market and sell, you can pretty much scam people for $1,000,000 a year for the rest of your life.
I'm being very honest with you.
And that's, and that's why there's a lot of bad advice that I think is out there from people who make around that, because that's true for them.
9:29
And so they're like, that's all you need.
And it's true.
But I would imagine that this community doesn't want to be that way.
And so on the longest time horizon, the only thing that matters is product, which is how good is the thing that you're ultimately given in exchange for money.
And do people feel like they're always on the better end of the deal?
9:45
And I have my I've gone like 180 from when I first started in business until today, where in the beginning everything I cared about was sales.
And then I learned that you could like do sales one to many with marketing.
And I was like, this is like sales on steroids.
10:01
This is so much better.
And I got really good, really good at that.
But then I realized that it's a perpetual hamster wheel because nothing stacks.
And so in order to get credit for the like, in order to build something really big, you need some, you need to be able to get credit for work you did over time.
10:20
And that means that I want to get paid today for work I did three years ago.
And the only way to do that is to have a product that somebody I sold three years ago is either still using today or it's still at least has positive things to say about me today.
Otherwise, you're basically always hunting every month to find your next nut or whatever it is.
10:38
And so if you always want to like, everyone's going to always work, but you won't always accumulate.
And you can only accumulate by building something that people always have good things to say about.
And that takes a lot of work.
And now we build businesses very differently, which is, let's not, let's not put any gas on this until we get everything right, until everyone absolutely loves the product, can't help but tell other people about it.
11:05
We get referrals every single month.
We grow without marketing and sales and then you add marketing and sales on top and then that's how you build a really big shit.
But or and I'll try and taper this because you can go all the way in the sky and like talk about like how you know trends of like what markets you want to go after or it's like I just want to get to 20,000 a month, Alex.
11:27
And are most people here doing products and services, OK.
If you're doing products and services, you raise your hand.
OK, so that's.
And is technology the other slice there.
OK, so it's mostly products and services.
OK, so if you're in, I'll shut the fuck up whenever.
11:45
Keep going, keep going.
This is the.
Sweet spot, babe.
Let's go.
Keep hitting these bitches.
Let's go.
If you're If you were, I'm always amazed at, and it might be more prevalent in this community not doing the math.
12:04
And so I know that there's probably a little bit more woo woo in this room than there would be in rooms that I'm accustomed to to say just on a comparative basis, right.
Strong Woo Woo family here.
Representing.
And so I think there's probably a misconception that you can woo woo your way to money and some of you probably know that that's not true.
12:24
And so reverse engineering, what you actually want the math to look like is probably the 1st place to start.
So I, you know, I get a lot of inbound questions of like, I just want to make $1,000,000 a year.
How do I make $1,000,000 in 90 days, Which is a terrible question to ask.
But if you just look at number of units you need to sell and I break things down into two days and weeks because that's a lot easier for me to comprehend.
12:47
And so it's like, OK, $1,000,000 a year is $20,000 a week.
OK, so divided by 7, so 3 grand a day.
OK.
Well, how do I do 3 grand a day?
I we do investments based on like the world's simplest formula, which is just number of units sold multiplied by lifetime value.
13:04
That's it.
And so if we want to grow the company, we either need to sell more units or we need to make people worth more.
That's it.
Like everything else really just over complicates it.
And so if you were in the beginning and you're doing stuff, if you look at your calendar in terms of how you spend your time, because that's the asset you're going to be spending the most of in the beginning.
13:22
If it's not contributing to either getting you more customers more, making them worth more than stop doing it.
Like you're wasting time.
Like literally you're just spending time.
Because right now if you, if you work every hour of the day and you're not making more money, you're working on the wrong stuff.
13:41
And that's like at the at the most basic level.
And if you can accept that, then it's like, great, then now I have room to to improve because you're not making any money.
That means you can probably eliminate 90% of the shit you're doing and nothing's going to matter because you're already not making any money.
So that that's that close.
That stuff clearly isn't working right.
And so getting the more customer side is really about just letting people know about your stuff.
14:03
And so I wrote the, you know, I just recently came out the leads book and it was to try and simplify this for everyone.
And if you are starting out, so if you're sub a million there's there's eight ways.
Well shit if you're at a billion there's still eight ways to let people know about your stuff.
Four of them you can do four of them use other people for.
So you can just tell people that you already know about the thing you have and you cannot be a scumball about it and just say, hey, I'm starting this thing, you know anyone who'd be interested in it.
14:27
And nine times out of 10, when you ask someone like that, it's way low pressure because you're not asking them for it.
But on the flip side, 9 times out of 10 they're like, actually I am kind of interested in something like that.
And so they're like, screw my friends, tell me more about that thing.
And then you actually get a more meaningful conversation where you can probably help them.
14:44
Right.
And that's like, the cheapest thing that every single person can do.
But people are like, I'm so afraid of talking to my friends, but you're just asking them that they know anyone.
And a lot of people still don't know, like, where do I go for that?
It's like, well, right now every single person here has a means to contact probably at least 1000 people.
That's, like, super conservative.
15:02
And when I challenge an audience with that, oftentimes someone's like, well, I don't pull out your phone, search contacts, export into an Excel sheet.
That's list one, List twos.
You go into all the old emails and gmails and yahoos you've ever had and look at every message you ever sent.
Export those sent messages into list 2GO into social media, all the different social medias you have.
15:22
Look at followers.
All of those give people have given you permission to contact them.
Now most social media are like that, with the exception of YouTube, but like Twitter, you can DM people, Instagram you can DM people, TikTok, you can DM people if they're following you, and you can export all of those into a list.
And so just like that, if you took all your followers, all your friends on Facebook, all your your DM contacts, your emails, your contacts on your phone, you put them into one list.
15:44
It's probably pretty pretty decent sized list.
And so I am a big fan of violence in terms of action and in general and take a violent approach, which is OK, I will reach out to 100 people per day and that takes about 5 hours.
16:02
And if you're like, wow, that sounds like a lot of work, like welcome to business, like and if you're starting out, it's welcome to business and being broke at the same time.
It is what it is.
And so the asset that you have right now is time and you got to spend as much as you can on it.
And so make sure making sure that OK, if I'm putting 5 hours a day, it's 2020 outreach attempts per hour.
16:19
And that's very inefficient.
The better you get, you'll get dialers and automation and technology that can help you do that stuff faster.
But if you're like, I'm poor and I don't understand any of this shit, start with that.
And that's your first five hours of the day.
I especially when I had less means.
I started doing that around like four or five in the morning, and then I'd be done around 10:00-ish.
16:38
And then at that point I'd start my day.
And so your job as the founder in the beginning is always promotion.
Like that's the job, is let people know that you exist.
Because right now you're just in obscurity.
Like, no one knows.
Like it's only exists in your mind.
You have to make it exist outside, right.
A little spiritual, Yeah.
16:56
Know the audience, right?
Yeah.
So there's thank, thank you for that and there's I want to, I'm going to double click on a few things, he said.
One is one of the deep spiritual principles which actually you talked about without knowing it is there's a Quechua word, which is a medicine language, you know, that's largely associated with the ayahuasca communities and the word is ini and the word is reciprocity.
17:19
And so one of the things we believe in that lineage which I studied when is that this is a universal law of the universe, that reciprocity, that there is a natural give and take, that when you're in accord with that give and take, things are going to be a lot easier, like a lot more fluid for you.
17:37
It's actually going to help.
So when you're giving, there's a natural impulse for someone to give back and it's just actually a law of the universe.
And when you are selling cheap shit or taking advantage of people, you're going to be acting in accord with that reciprocity.
And actually there's going to be some aspect of yourself which will make yourself fail because you'll feel like you don't deserve it because you know you're I need your reciprocity is off, right.
18:02
So finding that right level of relation reciprocity, that's the way it was with Anna.
I knew every time we sold an alpha brain for $30.00 that they were getting a $30.00 worth plus or even more worth of that of that supplement they were getting.
So when people ask like oh you know, you're selling so many and just how do you feel?
18:20
It's like, yeah, every single transaction, every customer service transaction I need is we have a positive account balance.
And whenever I can, I'm just depositing in that account balance.
And it's proved to be, you know, where the universe itself and people and myself always feel in right accord.
18:37
So I think that's one of these principles, that's a crossover principle that applies to business and it applies to this more kind of spiritual mindset as well.
And the other thing that I really want to, you know, double click on is you kind of know when you got something that people really want.
18:56
You know, like if you're hitting up your close friends and you're trying to offer your service or the thing that you think is awesome and you really have to convince them like, oh, come on, like and they're like, oh, yeah, I don't know, like, Oh yeah, you know, I'll try that when I get a chance and blah, blah, blah.
19:12
It's probably not the thing.
But I remember, like, the most successful things I had.
Alpha Brain, of course, was one of those.
We had a sample batch.
We gave it out to a few people who are curious and then they couldn't stop hounding me to get more of my sample batch, right.
I was like, yeah, like we got a little more.
19:29
There'll be, I'm actually out like I'm sorry.
Like you could just feel it.
You could feel the demand coming in.
And of course that ended up, you know, extending out to the whole rest of the world, you know.
And so there's another, you know, I'm, I'm starting another supplement company actually now and there's another product and we've been exploring a lot of different things.
19:48
People like, yeah, I tried it.
I thought it was good, you know, like caramel apple flavour is kind of weird for me but and blah, blah, blah.
But then there's this one that we got and I'm not going to share what it is, but there's this one thing we got and our whole team is like, yo-yo, you got, you got any more of those samples?
You got any more of those samples, bro?
20:03
And I'm like, oh, we got a winner here.
We got a winner because I'm not having to convince my homies to take it.
They're like, they're hounding me, like, hey, can I dip in that private stash?
You know, and so and that's the same with services too, you know.
It's like when you know one of the things that I don't do as a business, but I was apprenticed in a particular type of body work.
20:26
I don't have to hound my friends if I want to offer them somebody work.
They're like, fuck, yeah.
When?
Now.
Sure.
Like, well, don't you want to eat dinner?
They're like, Nah, fuck it.
You know what I mean?
So, like, when you know you have something good, it'll be reflected to you by your inner circle.
20:42
And then when you feel that really, like uphill, like, it's uphill, like come do this healing, come do this thing, and it's like hard to get your friends to do it, it's probably going to translate to being hard to get the world to do it.
I will double click back on on giving out free samples.
21:00
You know what I mean?
Like the like from a from a products perspective you're you're you're giving it out for free And so fundamentally you're incurring cost to give this thing to somebody.
And in your mind you're incurring this huge cost because there's also all the time of formulation and and and getting the the right cap size and like all that stuff and then you're giving them out and the person just receives in two seconds but they don't know that it took you five months to put that whole thing together.
21:21
And so you feel like you're like you need to love this, right.
But I think that you do it kind of effortlessly, just from me just And the five seconds of me just saying this is that you're also giving without a lot of expectation.
And the only expectation you have is that you tell me that it sucks.
Like, just you serve me better by telling me it blows than by lying to me.
21:40
And so this is also just like one of eight ways of talking to let people know about your stuff is letting friends know I just start there because it's the cheapest and easiest.
But with services you can do the same thing.
But the nice thing with services is that you can change it kind of in real time based on feedback.
21:56
And so asking someone if you can do something for them, you can change what you're asking to do for them until they're like, yeah, I would love that, can you take care of that for me?
And then all of a sudden you can see the interest, their eyes lit up, they engage with you and you're like, OK, maybe maybe this is right.
But the whole time though, and maybe this committee will love this aspect, is that if you give without reciprocity, you only get you only because like the sorry give without expectation, then anything you get back is just bonus.
22:23
If you're giving an order to then you will always be let down and that's like that's just hard to take, but it's just reality.
And so I think the the more you can do that.
I mean the reason I built my brand in this way was just on the thesis that if I gave more stuff that was better than everyone else.
22:42
In my mind, I'm sure there are many people who do better things for free that eventually I had no, I had no monetization.
You know like there's no monetization master plan.
It's just eventually an opportunity would come up that would make sense and so and it has worked out that way.
22:57
But you know, the amount of people that you know asked me to do XY and Z for for a quick, you know, whatever money dollar is a lot and it continues to increase.
But it's because they can see that there's this goodwill deposit in an audience and it's just that the audience size just starts really small and it grows.
23:13
And when I was starting out, one of the easiest frames of mine that helped me get through kind of like the shitty.
The 2nd way of letting people know is letting people know publicly.
When you post stuff on social media for free is that when I would see, like, I would click and see the little views and it'd be like 17 views.
23:30
I actually imagined a room like this.
So I was like, well, if I would get in front of a room of 17 people or 22 people and they wanted to hear something that I was like, that would feel fine.
I'd be like, oh cool, they like.
It's like a class presentation and so just fraying it that way is like in the real world rather than like looking at Instagram and social media metrics as in comparing those metrics to Mr. Beast but just comparing it to the real world.
23:52
I was like, oh, this is actually making an impact.
And so that actually got me through a lot of the early because a lot of people don't know is like my podcast.
I was telling the beginning of the story earlier I made.
I made podcasts for I'm now on my 6th as of July, I think my sixth year of making podcasts for the 1st 4 1/2 years.
24:12
I average 2 to 3000 downloads a month.
And that's OK.
There's nothing, you know, nothing wrong with that.
But it stayed there for the entire time.
But for me, I was like, I'm given a keynote every month.
All right, that's not bad.
You know, three, you know, three times a week.
24:28
I do that in total and that all of those together is a keynote every month.
And I was like, that's not bad.
So if I had to talk for a full day, because that's pretty much what a month of podcast was, I was like for a keynote, that's a worthy trade.
And so I think if you can reframe it that way, it can get you through the early rise real quick wise.
24:47
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
25:05
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review by taking 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
In comparison, comparison is such a is such a challenging thing to deal with because you start comparing yourself to the people that you follow and the people that you like.
25:27
You can get in some really negative psychological feedback loops.
Like I remember my podcast kind of plateaued around 20/15/2016 at like 25,030 thousand people and it's just stuck there and I got like kind of hella discouraged.
25:42
And then somebody goes, hey, what?
When was the last time you went to a basketball game, man?
I was like, Oh yeah, you know, I went to a Lakers game, you know, a little while ago.
It's like, how many people are sitting there?
I was like, I don't know, 20,000.
They're like, yeah, yeah, your podcast is reaching more than that.
And I was like, imagining that stadium.
25:58
I was like, oh, shit, you're right.
Why am I, why am I being disappointed?
It was because I was looking at Rogan's numbers.
I was looking at Tim Ferriss's numbers, and these are my homies, you know?
So I was like, well, these are my friends and they're fucking killing it, and I'm stuck.
But that perspective shift shifted everything.
26:15
And it, like, reinvigorated my love for the podcast.
And it's important to, yes, look out at the field and be aspirational about it.
But comparison is, is really the root of all difficulty.
One thing I say is competition is sacred.
Comparison is profane.
26:31
You know what I mean?
Like, compete, go out there, compete, set your sights on some of those people and be like, all right, like, I think I got the goods.
I'm coming for you in the in that loving, friendly, competitive way.
Same way I'll come at it on the basketball court.
I'm going to come for you.
I'm going to come for your ankles, You know, like let's go and and then at the same time, but not getting lost in that comparison, which then demoralizes you and then puts you into a state of inaction.
26:57
I actually really like this topic a lot, and I won't.
I won't spend too much on it.
But the nuance of comparison I think I find really interesting because I find comparison to be an exceptional tool.
It's the judgment of the comparison that hurts, right?
So it's like I can say that Rogan is doing better than me, period.
27:15
And that's objective.
There's nothing wrong with that.
He's doing better than me.
He's got more, more listeners, all that stuff.
It's where it's like he's doing better than me and therefore I suck, is the it's the second part I think that that people get in trouble with.
So, like, I love comparison from a measuring tool perspective, just not as a judgement tool.
27:32
And I think that's been helpful for me because then I can like, look at everyone's stuff and say, what is he doing better than me?
Because one of my, one of my big rules in business is that if someone's making more money than me, they're better the game of business in some way.
And that has served me really well because a lot of people don't like to, well, I don't like what they do.
It's like, OK, well, do they make more money than you?
27:47
Yeah, but they're not.
What are they doing better than you?
Because they're making more money than you.
And the nice thing in business is that it's a it's a very objective game.
Like you can see how someone's doing objectively, like they're doing better.
And so it means that they're doing something or they did something prior to that point better than you did.
28:04
And I think dissecting that, like the reason that I'm on this stage right now is because Kylie Jenner was on the front of Forbes when she was 20.
And when I was 27, I felt like really cool, like I was.
I think I told him just under 20 million that year personally.
28:20
And I was like, I'm good at business.
And then she was a billionaire and she was a girl and she was eight years younger than me.
And I was like, what the fuck?
And so now I did feel terrible, But I was like, she is doing something she understands, something that I don't understand.
28:38
And at that point it was brand.
I didn't get it.
I was super transactional with business which was just like I was all about like conversion optimization.
How much they like, what are CPM like customer impression, how much we're spending, how much we're making like what are conversion rates across the whole process, like where can we do more upsell all that kind of stuff.
28:54
Like, it was all quant.
And when I saw her just like overnight become a billionaire, I questioned kind of like my fundamentals around business.
And it was that.
And then The Rock and then Clooney and then Conor McGregor and Hooda Beauty, all of these people starting these billion dollar brands overnight that I was like, I don't understand brand.
29:15
And so that's what actually launched me into doing this.
It was only because of that.
It was.
But I think if there had been a flip side of like, well, it's just because Kris Jenner's her mom and whatever to protect me like my ego, then I don't think I'd be here.
And so I think it is valuable to compare and be able to pull out like what what they're doing better than you.
29:33
And then just looked at that objectively.
Like, I'm not saying I want her brand, but I can see what she did and then emulate that in my way.
Or at least that's how I see it.
And and prove it.
If you believe you're better, go prove it.
You know, like that's the reality so many times, you know, you'll get this.
29:49
And people, I mean, people do it with me all the time.
You know, they'll be like, Oh yeah, it must have been nice with daddy's money.
My dad, my dad went insane when I was 30, like, literally lost his mind.
And I started on in at 31, and there was not a dollar that came from my family or came from my parents.
30:05
But my dad was a very successful commodities trader.
He's written about in books and things like that.
Yeah, people don't know the fucking story, but they want to say that I was successful because, oh, it must have been daddy's money.
Must be nice, must be nice.
And then you get all of these things where people try to discredit your success based upon their own things because they don't want to look hard at themselves and say shit, Maybe I could have done that too.
30:26
You know maybe I could have raised, I mean I raised 100 on it started as a ultimately A9 figure business.
It started with I scraped together $110,000 from 1.
My best friend Bodie and another this investment banker who I'd done a lot of work with and working with other companies and making pitch decks for them and just helping them out.
30:44
And neither one of them even looked at the business plan.
But they like, they love me and they're like yeah bro and like are you into this?
And I was like yeah, I'm into this And we never had a Series A we never raised any other money.
We just grew it from that amount of money to a nine figure business and that's just actually how it went.
31:01
Now I'm not going to discredit that My father implanted psychological ideas because he made his own money.
He started with a $30,000 account, turned it into 40 million as a pioneer in Futures Trading.
So he believed in himself and he gave me that belief and that is a privilege that I had a model of somebody who said son, like if you're good enough you'll be able to make it, but that's what I got And and that's invaluable, granted, but people will always try to discredit what you do because they don't want to look hard in the mirror and say fuck, I could do that too.
31:33
Like it's possible for me.
I really like.
This a lot.
No, I do.
I really do the because the because the the must be nice.
Perspective is actually one of my favorites because.
There's I feel like if you're.
31:50
Playing like chess, right They're like making a chess move at you like must be nice and they they want to discredit whatever it is.
But I I've spent a lot of time trying to think about like the right what's the right answer and at least for me it's been you're right and.
Then you just keep living your life.
32:10
You know what I mean So.
Because like at at the end.
Of the day, like let's say all of my success I owe to my father which I came out as a sperm.
So sure you're right.
And and to the same degree I was born in America.
32:25
I was born as a man.
Both my parents were there for the first five years.
You know what I mean?
So, like, sure you're right.
And because at the end of the day, like the the stuff needs doing, right.
And so like to build a business of this size.
32:41
These are the activities that create that.
And so you can be an absolute douche bag.
You can be a white guy, a black guy, a girl in Pakistan, whatever.
And if you do those things, you get the outcome.
If more people find out about your stuff, you will make more money.
Fight me if.
32:58
Right.
It's just like.
They're, they're they're I I try and make bets on the objective truths.
And so like for and I'm.
I'm circling back to money.
Get back to it if you want to.
You want to win on plans that don't require luck, and so if more people find out about my stuff, I'll make more money.
33:17
OK?
If more people like my product and tell their friends, I'll make more money.
If every person who bought my product told at least one other person, I would never need to advertise ever again.
So if that were the actual problem, why would I not put all of my emphasis on solving for that like that alone?
33:34
Because if you accomplish that one thing, you're done.
And so people spend a lot of time on the logo, the brand, the website, the colors, the whatever.
And it's like, how do I make it so good that people A are like, Oh my God, I have to get this and let me tell my friends about it after I've consumed it.
33:50
And if that's where you put the disproportionate amount of your energy, you'll get a leverage return.
And so I talk about leverage a lot because I just believe the game of business about leverage and to define leverage, it's the difference between what you put in and what you get out, right.
So if I do, if I if IDM people one-on-one, I put a certain amount of effort in, I get something out.
34:09
If I use a dialer that does 10 times the amount, I put the same amount in, in terms of effort, but I might get 10 times back.
So that technology gave me leverage, right?
If I can borrow someone else's money to start a business 10 times bigger, right off the bat, that's leverage, right?
It's just the difference between what you put in and what you get out and brand.
34:24
For example, the reason I think it's a worthwhile endeavor to invest in it is because if you build it one time, then you can use it multiple times.
So it's the idea of build once, sell twice.
So if you can build things that like, I mean you spent a long time on Alpha Brain and the work that you did on the onset of Alpha Brain continues to pay dividends to this day.
34:45
That's a high leverage activity.
In those early years, you put a lot in, but then there was significantly more on the tail.
And so the rush is ultimately what kills most people because they're so concerned about like I need to make money tomorrow and I can appreciate the short term need for that.
If any of you guys know my story, I get that.
35:02
But as much as you possibly can balance, how can I solve a problem for good so that I can just move on to the next boss rather than having to keep fighting every month to pay payroll or pay myself or make whatever nut I need to make.
And so building a brand works like that in terms of if more people, my reputation, can spread on its own, then I don't need to do more advertising to get more customers.
35:26
And so I'm going to, I'm going to hit the the 8 real quick, just because I think it'll be helpful for for you guys.
But you can reach out to friends one O 1.
You can reach out to strangers one-on-one.
That's cold calls, cold DMS called messages, whatever.
You start with friends because they're a little nicer.
Go to strangers.
You can post content publicly, or you can run paid ads.
35:43
Those are the only four things that you can do to let other people know about your stuff.
And so right now, if you're like the majority of my day, I'm not making money and I'm not doing those four things, you're fucked.
You're not going to make more money.
Like those are the only four things that one person can do to let other people know about their stuff, Period.
Now the more leverage is getting other people to do that stuff for you.
36:03
And so version #1 is that you get your customers to do those core 4 for you.
They tell their friends, they tell strangers, they tell their audience by posting about your stuff, leaving a review, leaving a testimonial, whatever.
Or now they're probably not going to run ads for you, but those are the four things that that customer could do on your behalf.
You could get an employee to do that.
36:19
So you hire somebody.
Say, hey, I've got this system where I reach out to this many people are cold, cold e-mail as many people are cold.
Call this.
Many people are make this amount of content.
Can you.
I'll record these videos.
Can you edit it and cut it so I can do more.
Right.
So you get some time back.
So now you just record and then they do all the cutting and distribution.
36:34
So you get more for what you put in leverage.
You can hire an advertising agency to either make content for you or run ads for you, right?
Those are things that there's also cold outbound agencies that do that as well.
You can hire an agency to do it.
And then finally you can get affiliates, which is just other businesses that already have your customers.
36:54
And so affiliates also work like influencers.
So like Rogan would be in at equity and whatnot, but fundamentally somebody who already has your customer base, they've already done all of the work to assemble everyone, they already have everyone's attention.
And then you make and This is why the the thing that we started with this with deals, you make an agreement that makes sense.
37:13
And so maybe you do have a friend that has a medium sized following.
Treat them as though they weren't your friend and ask them to treat you like you're not friends.
And then if you can still come to a deal, then you'll both, then you'll both benefit because you would have done it anyways with a stranger.
And so those are the four ways you can other people to promote your stuff.
37:30
And so right now, if you're not using the Core 4 because you can use the Core 4 to get those other ones.
So you can use the Core 4 paid ads, outreach, posting content to get employees.
You can use those to get affiliates, you can use those to get agencies, you can do those to get customers and then that's the cycle.
37:47
So you use those four get customers and then those customers use the Core 4 to get you more customers, use the Core 4 to get affiliates who then get your customers.
And then it goes in around and around.
Is this making sense?
OK.
So if you're not spending your time doing that, you are not spending your time trying to build your business?
38:06
What about for?
People who are listening right now and they're like, damn, I don't know if my product's that good.
I don't know if my service is that good and they're thinking like I think I got to go back and ID 8 and figure this out like what what what do you what advice do you have for that type of person so.
38:26
There is a baseline of promotion that you have to have, because if like again, like, let's base this on absolutes.
If no one knows about your stuff, you will make nothing ever.
So someone has to find out about it.
So you have to promote first.
You have to let people know that you have a thing.
Now scaling that promotion, you only want to do when you know the thing's good.
38:44
But in the beginning you will have to let people know, and you have to accept the fact that it won't be as good.
And the reason I'm a big fan of the samples is that it lowers the stakes, especially in your personal reputation.
And so you're like, hey, I've got this new service that I'm trying out, Can I try it out?
38:59
Like, can I, can I give it to you?
Can I, can I gift this to you, please, Right now, if no one wants to take your free thing, that's great.
Feedback like this is probably not something they're going to pay for, right?
But if people are willing to take the free thing, there's three ways you can make money from somebody you give away for free.
Number one is that they become a paying customer.
39:15
Awesome.
They're like, hey, I've given this up to so many people that I actually can't take the demand anymore.
And so I have to put a pay wall up because I just my time's limited and people get that of course.
Well I am willing to pay great version #1.
Version #2 is they say you know what I can't financially whatever right now but I think this is awesome and you're like great.
39:31
Can you leave me a review And so then they leave you a testimonial, case study, whatever so that you can then use that to get you another customer.
And the 3rd way I have in my book, but I forgot what it is but it's in there.
But that's but basically they can leave you a review.
39:47
They can send you a referral or they actually, I think I just called two as one.
They can, they can get you another customer as a referral, yeah.
So they leave a review, get you another customer or they themselves become a customer for you.
And all of those come from you just giving something for free.
And so if you're like, OK, well, my shit sucks, fine.
40:04
Give it to them for free and then ask them for feedback.
And that's so if you want to make a trade, it's like, listen, I'm not going to charge you.
I just want honest feedback on how I can make it better.
That's it.
And if they like it, review.
If they don't like it, personal review, not public review.
And then you spin the wheel of iteration and like if I can.
40:22
Grill this into everyone's mind like you're not going to get it right the first time.
Like I love the, I mean I love the Matrix.
It's my favorite movie of all time.
But it's just like everyone falls the first time when they're talking about Neo trying to make a big jump.
And like I just think it's so true with with the business stuff is like everyone falls the first time and everyone has this idea that they're they're going to be Jeff Bezos on their first swing.
40:41
And like almost every entrepreneur with the exception of Bezos and Zuck have many a, a a graveyard of failed attempts.
But they're not really failed attempts.
They're like, Oh yeah, that's when I learned that this thing was really important.
So then my second business, I did this better and that one did better than my first business did.
41:00
But then your second business you're like, oh, I didn't understand this part.
And then you make your third business.
And so like every one of the businesses just becomes lessons to ultimately build the asset that matters which is you.
And that's at least how I see it, which is that, like the friction we get from the marketplace only serves to build who we become.
41:15
Because at the end of the day, we're going to die.
Everyone's going to forget about us.
It's not going to.
Sorry, this is me.
Sorry.
Yeah.
And and it's not ultimately going to matter whatever accumulation we have here.
And so I I see that as my my in progress journey so that I can get rewarded for the actions that I'm doing despite not necessarily having, like money manifest.
41:34
See, there you go in front of me immediately, right?
And that's that's at least the the framework that I have with it.
But if your shit sucks, give it to more people and ask them for feedback and then just ask them what it would take to suck less and eventually it'll be good one.
Of the things that that's really been helpful for me is there was a time when I was trying to develop like this mouse trap that would be valuable or not an actual mouse trap.
42:00
Using that as an example, something, some widget, some service that would be beneficial to this niche audience that I was imagining existed and that never fucking worked.
The only thing that ever worked was, do I want to be a customer of this now?
Like, what do I want now?
42:17
The alpha brain was born out of a conversation with me and Joe Rogan.
What supplement would you like the most?
Because I had a couple other failed supplements.
They worked for me, but I was in this kind of unique position.
It's like, no, I'd like an all natural cognitive enhancer and nootropic.
It's like, all right, great, we're going to make one because I wanted one too.
42:32
So I was a customer and I'm still a fucking customer.
I think I got a fucking alpha brain in my in my pocket right now.
Right for my for my talk coming up.
It's in my other pocket.
But regardless, trust me.
I was a customer.
I was a customer and that's one of the important things.
42:49
And then it's not only are you a customer now, you can also go back in time and be like man, when I was 25, what would 25 year old Aubrey really have fucking loved?
Because you have that data and you know it.
You know that if you would have bought this when you were 25, then maybe that's your audience.
43:05
That's OK.
Or maybe you're you're hypothesizing like, what is the me of tomorrow Or five years from now, or three years from now?
What does that person really want?
But using yourself as a guide and then not only using yourself as a guide, but then also if you're going to be the founder of this, you got to actually embody and represent what that thing you're selling on.
43:28
Its slogan, our tagline was total human optimization.
If I was a lazy fat slob and I'm trying to market a company about total human optimization, people look at me and go like, really, bro?
Like, really?
Because you have to have the clout also to represent that.
43:45
So if you're offering even a service, you know about regulating your emotions, but your emotions are all over the place, Maybe that's not the right service for you.
Like find what you're actually competent at and then say, like, all right, what could have helped me get more competent if I would have offered that to me five years ago, etcetera.
44:03
You know, and that's also it.
It's sometimes it can work.
I do know some people who sell, you know, weight loss supplements who are about 100 lbs overweight and it's like, you know, but they still are able to do it.
So it's not that it always fails, but to me that's the surest guideline would be like, all right, what's your core competency?
44:21
Can you prove it?
You know, do you have the evidence?
You back it up and are you a customer or were you a customer or will you be a customer?
And all of those have to hit the checks, I agree.
Wholeheartedly with all of that, I would, I was, I was just, I would, I would honestly make the same three points in a different way just to add color or texture to it.
44:45
So number one is Y Combinator.
If you're familiar with them, they're like pretty big investors in Silicon Valley.
And now one of their stipulations is that they want founders to have lived with the problem for five to 10 years.
So whatever the problem that is you're trying to solve, you're like, man, I just wish this didn't suck this much.
45:00
And if you've really lived with it, like I've had breathing problems for my whole life.
And so like I've always like thought of like if I were to start some sort of business around that, that would be one that I've tried every solution that's out there and I can tell you the pros and cons.
And I would want to become which is .2 for you is like I'd want to become a customer of that business from a from a tactical perspective.
45:16
So .2 this is this is services specific.
What I'd recommend doing.
Is giving way more away than would be reasonable to charge for.
So you start with the kitchen sink and you basically keep adding things to how much you're willing to do for someone until eventually you're like in their house cooking them dinner and you're like, OK, would you do this?
45:44
They're like, yeah, fine.
And they're like, OK, now I can, I can start trimming things from this and thinking, OK, there's 100 things that I could that I am I committed to doing For these first five people, it turns out 80% of them they don't really care about and I can actually charge the same price and eliminate 80%.
46:00
So it's like get the yes and then work backwards because sometimes it's a lot because with physical products you basically have to keep iterating on the product and so you get the yes.
With services you can just keep adding and then when you get the yes, work backwards.
And so that's just a tactical thing.
And so if you story about that is when I was starting in the gym business I kept trying to sell memberships and it just like really didn't work well for me.
46:20
Not that probably was I sucked at sales and I I didn't really think gym members was that valuable myself.
I was a Chiefs gate so I know 50 bucks a month you and me sister and so so but then I was like, well, what do they really want?
I was like, well, they really want us to lose weight.
They don't really care about the gym.
46:35
They just want to lose weight.
And so I was like, well, what would it actually take for somebody to lose weight?
And I was like, well, I was like what if I texted you every morning just to make sure that like you were you were on point.
What if you you could send me all your meals every day And I would I would like make sure that they were matching.
And what if I like when you go out to eat.
I'll give you a list on how you can do that at restaurants and like, what if I can, I drink like you can if you do it on this this way.
46:57
And what if and and and when you work out, do you want me there with you?
Yeah, that'd be awesome.
OK, I'll do that.
And then so I started adding all these things and supplements that you probably want to take along the way.
And I had this big amalgamation of stuff that everyone needs because whenever you're solving a problem, there's always one another problem that's going to happen if you actually solve it.
47:16
But there's also like 100 micro problems.
So if someone joins a gym, it's like, well, they're like, shoot, I don't have gym clothes.
I don't know how to buy the right food.
I don't know how to cook the food.
I don't know how to store the food.
I don't know how to make the food taste good.
I don't know how to work out.
I don't know, like, there's all these other problems.
47:34
And so I was thinking forward of, like, how can I solve all of them?
And that becomes this huge thing.
And then I started offering that.
And people were like, yeah, I'll do that.
And I was like, great.
But I was able to charge way more than I did before because I was actually solving the problem rather than selling a commoditized solution that they could price compare me with somebody on the street.
47:51
And so that was .2 is give away the kitchen sink and then trim down to make it profitable.
Because in the beginning you're not worried about that yet.
You want to get people to actually want to buy your shit and then you can worry about the profit.
And then the Third Point that you made was about legitimacy.
48:11
So I see this on the content side too, and I'm sure many of you guys see this, which is, you know, the girl who's an emotional wreck giving.
Emotional advice.
Or the couple that you're like and they're like, come to our love workshop and you're like, I don't know if I want to.
48:33
And so I'm just a big advocate of proof over everything because your message is consumed within a context.
So like Elon Musk can tweet, like shits are awesome.
I'm on the toilet and it'll get a million likes because.
48:53
But if you tweet that, you probably won't.
Right.
Some people will be like are you OK does someone steal your phone?
Right.
But it's it's consumed within that context And so I would say that the context on a, on a on a Skype, from one to 100 of the message, 90% of the message is your background. 10% is the actual thing that you're saying.
49:12
And so I'm not, I'm, I'm not an idiot when it comes to the fact that like.
I had to go.
Build $100 million net worth.
Have a $50 million exit all these other things before people listen to my podcast.
I made the podcast for five years.
No one gave a shit.
But then when I had objective proof, then people went back and listened to five years of podcasts on road trips straight through like this is gold.
49:34
And then they told people, but they couldn't consume the message because there was no context around it.
And so I would say solve for context.
And then the message kind of takes care of itself.
Because also when you do have the proof, you also will have the pudding because you got there and so you do know how to get there.
49:50
Whereas if you were on the journey and I think there's an element to like documenting something like hey we're working on our relationship is very different than come listen to me for my relationship it's I ate this for breakfast.
I thought it tasted good versus this is what you should have for breakfast.
It's nuanced, but it's different.
50:07
And so if you're on the come up, I would stick to how I rather than how to.
And it will protect your reputation when you're making this content because no one can, no one can shake a finger at you.
You're like, I'm just saying it'll work for me.
You can do whatever you want.
This is will work for me.
And I think that will help you get over some of the creation block for those of you who do choose to make content to advertise your stuff.
50:27
And it certainly is.
Help has worked for me.








0:00
If everybody on the team has to say what their personal goal is and they get to set it, and if they hit their personal goal, as long as it's aligned with the company goal overall if they set that goal.
They can set it as big or as little as they want.
What happens is that the social pressure of wanting to set good goals automatically self cracks welcome.
0:23
To the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk, and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy a good friend of.
0:38
Mine in my building had a really, really interesting way of managing talent to get and drive higher performance and output.
And so the reason I wanted to make this was because at the end of the day, every entrepreneur has the same problem, which is they need better people and they need to get more out of the people that they have.
0:55
And a lot of that comes from culture and training.
But every once in a while, you stumble upon a process that has teeth.
And so I think it's super cool because it, it is reinforced through multiple different psychological levers and it's got really cool stuff to it.
1:11
So let's have that.
So one of the things that he shared with me that he did is that he has a level of variable compensation that's not new.
It means that there's some level of performance check marks etcetera that they have to hit in order to get paid.
Makes sense.
Now the way that most companies do this and I'll tell you that what we've done up to this point for us is that in positions where that are not directly like sales for example, it's very easy to have a Commission structure etcetera, but for let's say leadership and executive positions.
1:39
So this is important.
If you're trying to build your solo apprenticeship into an actual company that has values, you need to have people who are all aligned and driving hard like owners towards the same goal.
And honestly it's much more enjoyable that way.
And so the way that we have split our things up to this point is that we do something called MBO such management by objectives for the company and then also for the individual.
1:59
So we usually split them 5050.
So let's say we've got a, a leader who let's say like a director of marketing, it's going to, they're not going to like get a sale, but we know that they're in charge of all of the, you know rain making for that particular business line, right.
And so they might get let's say half of their, they might have a base, let's just use round numbers, let's say they're making their targeted earnings is $200,000.
2:20
We're going to give them $100,000 base and we're going to give them $100,000 of variable compensation Right now of that variable compensation that half we split that again in half, half of that which would be 25% of their total comp is going to be of whether the company grows overall.
2:35
So if we hit XY and Z metrics they'll get you know of growth or new sales or profitability then they're going to get those things right.
And the other half is going to be on whether they did something personally that they have control over.
So might be adding a new channel or a new platform or creating some sort of process that we want to automate or bringing in a new XYZ manager, right.
2:56
Those would be things that they have complete control over that we can check box even if the business doesn't do well or it doesn't hit the goals of growth or just you know marginally grows, they can still get half of their variable comp.
So if you've got 100 grand they they got that guaranteed and they've got 50 that as long as they do their all their stuff they've got and then they get to purchase being the upside of the business if the business overall grows, right.
3:15
And so that is how we've done it up to this point, it's worked well, right.
But what he presented was a different way that that I really, really, really liked.
And a key part of this is that the management by objectives and the things that we set, we set for our team, OK.
3:32
So they don't have a choice in it, they just accept it or you know, they might try to negotiate a couple terms, but that's that's more or less how the compensation structure works, right.
With the way that he sets it up is that every position has a level of variable compensation.
And that level you can determine, you know, you can say you want it to be 10% or it can be 20% or it could be 50%.
3:51
You know, it depends on the role, but maybe let's say a frontline customer service role, right, let's say 15% of their compensation variable.
So if they're targeting let's say $50,000 a year then that would mean $7500 would be potential to be variable.
So that would be like whatever, 600 bucks a month ish, right, of their compensation is kind of in the air, hung in the balance.
4:14
And so here's the cool thing.
What he does is that he says this is the variable comp and you get to set the goal every month.
So it's a 30 day rolling goal and every month they get to set the goal of what they're going to do.
4:30
They have to show up publicly.
So you get some social pressure in there, right?
You also get autonomy because they're the ones who are picking it.
And so here's what's cool is that if everybody on the team has to say what their personal goal is, right, and they get to set it.
And if they hit their personal goal, as long as it's aligned with the company goal overall like it, it's going to contribute to that goal, then they can make it, right?
4:53
They have to obviously prove that it in some way furthers the overall division or department's goal.
But as long as it's aligned with that, the extent to which and the amount that they have to take has got to be quantifiable, right, if they set that goal.
They can set it as big or as little as they want.
What happens is that the social pressure of wanting to set good goals automatically self cracked.
5:16
So you might think, well, what if they just say they get, you know, a half a percent, you know, improvement or something like that, and then they hit it cool.
But The thing is, is that people on the team are going to be like, dude, come on, that's the goal.
And then all of a sudden they raise it, but they raised it, no one else.
5:33
And so they have complete autonomy and ownership over that goal.
Now for you as an owner, what you can do obviously is let's say that your targeted earnings for the person who's 50,000 a year, that's fine, you just take 15% and make it variable.
So like they have the potential to earn the whole thing or they have the potential to earn somewhat less like don't worry about the variable comp.
5:51
The, the piece is that we have intermittent reinforcement which is another way of saying variable reward for employee.
They have complete autonomy and they have social pressure and they have some level of competition.
And this is really useful in roles that don't necessarily a directly, you know, tied to the bottom line like sales does and are more difficult to quantify, right.
6:14
And so this gives those roles the opportunity to feel like they're contributing to the overall growth of the company and have something in the balance that matters.
So I wanted to share this with you because I thought it was really, really cool.
We're going to be implementing stuff like this in some of our portfolio companies.
6:32
But I thought it was just incredibly sexy.
I didn't want to.
I didn't want to keep it from you because I think it's really, really cool.
Because there's just so much psychology behind doing things this way and it just allows everyone to participate and grow as employees within the company and as a as a tangential, tertiary benefit of this, your churn will go down because people will feel like they're making progress.
6:58
Pretty cool, right?
It'll they'll feel like they're making progress and that they are growing and that they are challenging themselves.
And that, at the end of the day, is what you want every workplace to fulfil for your employees.
Now whether they feel fulfilled, you have no control over.
But if you can create an environment that increases the likelihood that they feel that way given a normal human construct, I think that you're going to build a Better Business.





0:00
My investment strategy after all of this time, has gone completely back to my business strategy, which is singular focus.
Do the things you know, do more, do it better, and keep doing that for an extended period of time and it would be unreasonable that you don't win.
The wealthiest people in the world see.
0:17
Business as a Game This podcast.
The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
I hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
The game has changed.
0:36
The entire economy has shifted, and so too should your investment.
At least mine has.
And so there are three things that you absolutely have to know #1, The way you put your money has to shift because the economy has changed.
Number two, I've taken all my money out of banks and I'll tell you where I put it instead.
0:52
And it's safer and gets me higher returns.
And at the end, I'll explain to you exactly what I'm doing with my money right now and how it's different from the two other investment strategies I've had throughout my life.
So #1, because the economy has changed, things are priced differently.
There's inflationary pressures.
1:07
Real estate is a is hanging on by a thread.
Crypto has crashed, stocks have crashed.
So what is a boy to do?
Well, I'll tell you my investment thesis.
First off is what do you do with your cash?
All right, So if you've ever heard Warren Buffett or you heard people in the news say he has X billion dollars in cash or cash equivalents, I never knew what that meant.
1:26
And so I'm going to rewind and explain what actually putting cash in a bank account means and why it's important in today's environment.
So when you put cash into a bank, you're actually writing the bank alone to then loan your money and get something back.
People don't know this, but you actually are a creditor of the bank.
1:45
All right, So if a bank goes out of business, they owe you money, right?
You loan them money.
Now, what happens is the bank will do one of two things.
They will loan it out.
Well, actually, they do one thing.
They loan money.
But they will either loan money to the government by buying bonds, right, Which is buying debt, or they will loan it out to people and mortgages and things like that, right?
2:03
Or credit lines for businesses, whatever it is, they loan the money out again and they make more than they pay you.
And so right now, if you look at your Bank of America account, they'll pay you between .1 and 1% annually on your money.
OK, Boo.
That sucks.
Now here's what's interesting and most important about debt.
When you loan people money, there are two factors.
2:21
One is what are you going to get back, which is the interest rate.
And the 2nd is how likely are you going to get it?
OK, so the interest rate is if you loan someone the money for a house and it's 5% or whatever, then if you put 100 grand and you get 5000 back, right, that's what it is, you get 100 plus the extra 5.
2:36
That's the interest and you get paid that for taking on risk.
All right, Interest is a function of risk.
That's how it works.
Now this is what's crazy.
And I didn't understand this when I was putting my money in the bank.
If the bank goes under, you lose all your money outside of the FDIC insured amount.
2:51
Now the FDIC right now is completely bankrupt anyways and on top of that if it exceeds that amount you get stuck in the bankrupt company.
Whoop Dee Doo.
Probably not the best outcome you wanted when you wanted to go withdraw your money down, right?
Of course not.
So what if there were a better alternative that was lower risk and had higher returns?
3:10
I just learned about this and the reason I always ignored it was because it looked boring and ugly.
So when the bank has your money, I said they loan money out.
You know who they loan it to.
A lot of times?
the US government.
Now why do they do that?
Because the likelihood risk that the government's going to be able to pay them back extremely high.
3:29
Why?
Because they can print the damn money and give it back to them. #2 is that they are making more than they are paying you.
So they take your money for .1% a year and then they give it to the government.
And the government gives them 4% a year.
So they get 40 times what they pay you by giving the US government money, right?
3:50
And so what's interesting is that if we were to analyse both, one you have a bond from the bank, right, 'cause you're putting money in and they pay you a little bit, Which one of these pays more?
4% from a treasury or .1% from a bank?
The treasury from the US government.
Now, which one is more likely to go out of business, A bank or the US government?
4:08
Well, let's see who's gone out of business in the last 100 years?
Banks.
Oregon. the US government.
Well, more banks have.
So this is both lower risk and higher return.
Bingo.
Ding Ding Ding.
Right.
We have a winner.
Now, the only other reason that you get lower interest here is because the money is immediately accessible.
4:25
It's liquid.
So you can go tomorrow and get money out, right.
That's how it works there.
But The thing is, is that Treasuries are also immediately tradable.
So the only other reason that you would get a lower interest rate is because something is more liquid, meaning you can trade in and out of it at your desire whenever you want, right?
4:42
A more liquid thing will pay you less because you can get in and out, right?
So here's the thing, Treasuries are just as liquid as a bank account for two reasons, #1.
Because you can take a loan against Treasuries in real time, you get 80% of your money.
So if you put $100,000 in bonds for the US Treasury Bonds, T-bills is what they're called.
5:01
You can get 80% of that up to at a super low secured interest rate to go and plow into something else, #1 #2.
Country and entire governments trade in U.S.
Treasuries, which means that you will never have an amount of money that you can't trade in half a second, right?
5:18
So like for example, right now, if you wanted to trade Bitcoin, you could go and sell it in half a second, right?
It's not a problem.
Like, you can get the money T-bills trade even faster than Bitcoin by a fucking mile, right?
And so you have immediate access to the money.
It's lower risk because the government's not going to go out of business compared to a bank.
5:34
It's lower risk, right?
And then you're going to get 40 times the earnings that you are in a bank.
Now here's an interesting thought for you.
Instead of putting the money in the bank and then betting, the bank's going to stay alive and paid a little bit.
You could do an identical transaction and just buy a bond from Bank of America and get 5% or 4.7% from Bank of America.
5:56
And it's literally the same thing.
You're betting on the fact they're going to stay there, but now they pay you 4.7% rather than .1%.
And the reason you're like, why don't people do this?
Because they don't know and the banks are you're like, why don't they talk about this?
Because why would they?
They are happy to take your money and go make 5% on it and pay you .1.
6:16
That's the business.
Why would they tell people, right?
This is how it works.
So in this economy, I have shifted to almost all cash.
I have a few ETFs and I'll tell you what I'm actually doing with the money now, and this is important.
So my entire structure of investments has changed over the last five years, really the last 10 years.
6:34
The first chunk of my life was SME 500.
I put all my excess cash into learning skills, getting access to people, coaching munches, workshops, etcetera, courses.
All of that so I could increase my earning capacity.
Highest return investment I still have ever made today, #1 #2.
6:51
Once I had more money than I could possibly reinvest in courses and coaching and whatnot, I started plowing it into the S&P 500 because that's what Uncle Warren told me to do.
Figured if it worked for him, it would work for me.
So I plowed all my money into indexes.
That was the next phase of my investing.
The third phase came post sale.
7:06
All right, so we sold three companies last year, and I talked to a bunch of different friends who were very, very wealthy, and one of them is a very good investor.
And he outlined a strategy formally called a barbell strategy, which is I have stocks over here.
I've got real estate over here, very little in between.
7:22
And then I just have my private equities of the companies that I own personally, right.
Those are the, those are kind of the three different buckets that.
So I'd make money here and plowed into these two, right, with basically nothing in between.
Now here's the thing that you don't know.
In the last two years, I've maybe made five investments, and those investments represent in total maybe 10% of the cash that I have.
7:44
Not a lot.
Real quick guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
8:01
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
I didn't realize what the problem was until I saw a video from Dave Ramsey.
8:18
And before you cast judgement, you really need to hear this out because it really changed my life and I hope it changes yours.
So I was watching a video where Graham Steffen was having Dave Ramsey analyse his investment portfolio and he said, hey Dave, don't you feel like I'm over indexed on real estate?
He said like, you know, 80 plus percent of my of my net worth is in real estate deals.
8:38
And Dave Ramsey gave one of the wisest responses that I've ever heard in investing, and it changed my life.
He said, well, if you put a big circle on the table, and I'm loosely paraphrasing and we had to say what percentage of your knowledge is real estate versus stocks and bonds and other stuff, What would you say it is?
8:55
He said, oh, well, I don't know, 8085% of what I know is really about real estate.
He looked at him.
He was like, well, then that's a perfect distribution for you because it reflects your knowledge.
So where you invest is what you know.
And so then he went on to say I have talked to many, many billionaires, probably far more than I have.
9:14
He said I've learned two things from them.
We've learned many things, but two things from investing, he said.
They don't do many things, and the things they pick are things they understand and they do a lot of them.
And for whatever reason, the combination of understanding that in the circle, this is the slice of the pie that he knew and that the people were the richest in the world.
9:31
Just pick one game or two games they knew really well and they do a ton of those games, is what changed my perspective.
And so as soon as I heard that I won, took all my money and put it into treasuries because I understood that the banks weren't going to give me anything for it.
And this is lower risk and gives me a better yield and it's immediately liquid, just better in all accounts.
9:52
And then we decided this is a big deal for me.
I only do private deals.
And the reason that this became real for me is that I had the biggest deal that I will have done, which I'll tell you about later.
Maybe a few years from now financially.
That normally I wouldn't write a check 110th that size to a real estate deal or an apartment complex or some other thing that I don't understand.
10:15
And so I always was banking on other people to be like, do I really trust this guy?
How much is he trying to scrimmate?
What are the fees here?
What are the hidden things?
How do I know this is going to pay off and things?
It's like, real estate's not my game.
It's not my game.
I'm not a real estate whiz.
It's not my thing.
If you're not a real estate whiz, I would recommend not putting all your shit into something that you don't know.
10:35
And so when I got approached for this private deal, it was an industry, I knew it was an operator, that it had a ton of experience.
We had a shared vision of what we want to do with the company, and the biggest thing they lacked was capital.
And I understood exactly where the capital's going.
I knew how I was going to get returns.
And here's what's crazy.
10:51
This investment will probably get somewhere in the neighbourhood of 100 to 500% a year.
You're like, how is that possible?
It's only possible because it's an incredibly high risk investment, but it's high risk for somebody who doesn't know what they're doing.
And so Warren Buffett has two quotes about this that really shifted my perspective.
11:09
He said #1 diversification is a hedge against ignorance.
It's a hedge against not knowing the reason that he tells most people to do the SP500 because he realizes the vast majority of people don't know what they're doing.
It's the best and safest thing they can do is just invest in everything and just bet on the stock market overall.
Just bet on the economy growing over time.
11:25
You're betting on the stock market.
You're really betting on a country.
You're betting that this country or even the world, because many of the companies in the top 500 are global.
Just that the world will grow.
That's all you're doing.
The second thing that he said is that it's only risky when you don't know what you're doing.
And so if you understand the variables.
11:40
And it's funny because as I've gone through this deal, I told the guys that imagine you have unlimited capital, I'm willing to write basically a blank check for you if these are the economics of the deal.
And he said awesome.
And I only feel comfortable with that because I know where the bodies are buried.
11:56
I know what risk to look for.
I know what the upside would do.
I know how I'm going to add value to this deal.
But in a real estate apartment building, it's not my game.
And so I feel so much more comfortable writing an enormous check because it's a game that I know when I write that circle on the table, for me it's all business.
12:12
And so I will be divesting from the very small percentage of my net worth that's in real estate.
I will hold the equities that I have in ETFs, and everything else that I have goes straight into treasuries.
And then when big deals come, I plowed into the deal and then I repay back my war chest.
War chest goes back up, plow to another deal, repay back the war chest plowed into another deal.
12:32
That is the investment strategy that I am following.
And the reason this is so important is that in the economy today, you have to do the things you know.
There's a lot of risk out there right now.
And so if you were not sure, I would say hold and figure out a game that you understand because then you don't have to feel like you're betting.
12:52
Because that's all I felt like I was doing.
I felt like I was betting on people and trying to like, see between the lines, like do I trust this person or not trust this person.
Fuck that.
Find something, you know, go all in on that one thing.
And this is.
It's funny because my investment strategy after all of this time, has gone completely back to my business strategy, which is singular focus.
13:13
Do the things you know, do more, do it better.
And keep doing that for an extended period of time.
And it would be unreasonable that you don't win.
So for example you can go to Robin Hood or whatever exchange you you invest on.
If you don't know where to do that, just say like how do I invest in stocks and you'll be able to download an app that does it and you can search treasury or bonds and you will be able to go and buy a bond.
13:33
It is not complicated.
Now I will give you an advanced strategy though, because Mosey Nation love you.
So great strategy for for buying bonds is that there are maturity dates which means that when does the bond come due.
So I was telling you earlier that liquidity matters a lot.
So it's like can I trade in and out of it.
13:48
Now bonds come due and when they are due you're owed the money plus the interest.
So what you gave them plus whatever interest was supposed to be owed on top of that.
So one strategy is to buy them all at a certain, you know, maturity date and then wait.
What we have opted to do is buy 612-1824 month bonds, basically go one quarter, one quarter, one quarter 1/4.
14:06
And that means that every six months I get a pop back of cash plus interest and then I put it back to another 20-4 months.
And so it becomes this cash recycling machine in the meantime.
So that is how I do it.
You can still take loans against it.
And if you're worried about the value of bonds going up and down, don't.
14:22
Because if you do that strategy, you're just banking on the fact that you are going to get the money back.
You don't even have to worry about trading them in and out.
That's not, you're not a bonds trader.
It's not the point here.
The point is you're putting somewhere safer than a bank account that will pay you money pretty much guaranteed unless the government goes under, in which case we don't need to worry about the banks are definitely fucked when that happen.
14:38
Yeah.
So if you're a dentist, right, at a certain point you will have enough money if you're good at being a dentist and don't do this until you are good enough at being a dentist, that you have a lot of extra money that you could go and buy another dental office.
It's a business, you know.
And what's crazy is that you will get significantly higher returns on that purchase than you would on the stock market.
14:56
So for example, if you wanted to buy a dental office that did $1,000,000 top line and $200,000 in bottom line, right?
Most of these professional services businesses you can get for a little bit of seller financing.
You might only have to put, I don't know, one or two times down.
OK.
15:12
Now if you put, let's say, one times down, meaning you pay $400,000 for the business, $200,000 comes in seller financing from the person who's selling it to you, they let you pay debt off over time and then $200,000 you put in their pocket.
OK, well, year one, you get your first $200,000 back, right?
15:30
And then year 2, let's say you pay off the rest of the debt.
All right.
Well, when you did that year three, you make another $200,000, so you're ready to return there.
This is me doing back napkin.
It's basically like 333333.
So compared to the stock market etcetera, you're going to do way better.
Now if you know the business, that's just assuming it stays the same.
15:49
But if you're better at business than the other dentist is, right, because that's maybe why you're buying the business, then you might be able to overnight double that and then all of a sudden you're one, you pay back everything and year two, you make 400, right, versus your 200.
So now on a two year basis, you already doubled your money in two years.
16:07
And here's what's even crazier, you doubled your money on a cash basis, but now you own your dental practice plus their dental practice and the combined value of those things is even higher than in either of those individually and you still own those.
And so your total net worth based on the equity value of those companies has grown tax free this whole time and you already put the cash back in your pocket.
16:28
That's where you get competitive advantages of knowing the game you're in.
So if you're like, well, Alex, I don't know a ton about business, cool.
If you recall, I went through three steps of my investing phase.
All right, So the first one was investing in you, right?
16:44
Investing in increasing your skill set, which is later going to be compounded because we talk about leverage all the time, how to get more for what I put in, You're going to invest in a skill set and then when you get better at it, you might end up start doing deals only around that stack of skills that you acquired.
But phase one, learn shit.
Phase two, When you have earnings but not enough to really get into the big investing world, you can plow it into the S&P and diversify your risk because you still don't know what you're doing yet.
17:09
You still have cash flow in access to what you can reinvest in your in your education.
But you're still not like the Super G yet, right?
At investing.
Not saying I am.
You get my point.
All right, The third phase is OK.
I'm making so much money from the game I'm in that it makes more sense.
17:24
And it's less risky for me to do more of this game than the stock market.
And then that is where you build the crazy wall.
And so that's what I would consider to be the three-step, Step one, invest in you.
Step 2, invest excess in indexes, basically the weight as a holding pattern.
17:40
Keep stockpiling the war chest up.
And then when you feel like you're good enough at the game, your main game, then you have the stockpile and you can deploy it and then that starts the compounding machine.
And so when you're like, I'm not sure if I'm getting the leverage I need on the skills I'm learning right now.
That's not the point.
Right now you're learning this shit so that later you can lever the crap out of it in conjunction with capital, and then you'll blow up.








0:00
So if you have trouble being productive and I would consider entering a season of no, Warren Buffett once said.
The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.
When I look at the periods of my life in business where I've had huge amounts of growth in very short periods of time, I've gone through things that I call the season of no.
0:20
And a season of no isn't forever.
It's just for now.
And sometimes seasons can be 3 months, sometimes seasons can be three years.
The longest season of No that I had was a three-year season.
During that that season of no, I said no to friends.
I was a little bit extreme, but I also was running from absolute poverty and I had started seeing some success and I was so afraid of messing it up that I said no to alcohol.
0:42
So I stopped drinking entirely.
I stopped saying yes to any social events.
I was in a paid group that I was paying like $35,000 a year to be in, and I didn't go to any of the events for two years, even though I paid for it.
A lot of people think it hurts to say no to things because it does, because you feel like you're rejecting other people, and most of us have been on the other side of that, and feeling rejected sucks.
1:01
You have to kind of trick your brain into thinking that the no is actually a yes to the thing that matters most.
Because the way that I've always thought about this was from my first principles perspective of if I achieve this really big thing in three years or five years, all of these doors will be open for me.
But if I allow these onesie twosie one off conversations, one off favors one off things to take me away from that one big thing, I know that five years from now, me not having the thing makes it far less likely that even those first doors are still open.
1:29
They're only reaching out to me now because of the little bit of success that I've experienced, which I got here because of being focused on the one thing that mattered most, Jim.
Launch in the big $50 million, whatever exit was built during a season of No and all the people that I said no to still hit me up.
1:45
But if I hadn't built that during a season of no, and I had said yes to all these little things and I said no to the thing that mattered most, they might not be here still hitting me up.
There's two scenarios that I play out in my head.
One is that at the end of this where you achieve something, 95% of people are going to be even further behind you and so you'll still have access to them.
2:04
The people who were on par with you shoulder to shoulder, always mutual respect.
You still also have access to them.
If for some reason someone is offended that you said no to them earlier on, guess what?
There are other people that in this future state will be walk into your life.
2:20
And so there's a lot of Nos that I made early on that I can't even remember the door that probably permanently shut because I have so many other doors that have opened for me.
I like to think of yeses that I give to other people as withdrawals from my personal energy account, and I think of No's as deposits into my gold account.
2:38
Here's how Warren Buffett told people to make goals.
He said write down your 25 top goals in life.
He said really think about it.
Make them in order, 1 to 25.
Then circle the top five.
Tear off everything underneath and throw it away because those are the only things that matter during the season of No, I put all of my effort into the one goal of those five that matters the most to me.
2:58
Then I write down what is the minimum that I have to do to not move backwards in these ones.
Kind of like bodybuilding, you usually can only work on one weakness at a time.
Steve Jobs said.
People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on, but that's not what it means at all.
It means saying no to 100 other good ideas that are out there.
3:16
You have to pick carefully.
I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done you when.
You think about focusing, right?
You think, well, focusing is is saying yes, no.
Focusing is about saying no.
Innovation is saying no to 1000.
Other good ideas?
3:31
There's the opportunistic yeses and Nos that we have to make.
So the better and better your business gets, the more attractive the opportunities that will present themselves.
And so you may have this marketing agency, for example, and it's doing well.
Then all of a sudden one of your clients is like, hey man, how about I give you equity in my business and you can keep doing the marketing for me and then you start thinking yourself, well, yeah, because I'm going to make more on this deal, I should do this deal.
3:52
But The thing is, is there's so much inefficiency in this one off or onesie twosie relationship that you lose on the main thing if you build this massive agency, that's the thing that everyone's going to come to you for.
If you have this weird thing with two or three odd appendages from these one off deals, I'll tell you as an investor, when I see that, I see an undisciplined entrepreneur, I see someone who cannot focus on the thing that matters most.
4:14
And that's why when we talk about leverage in terms of getting more for what you put in, that's why being so selective on the one thing that matters most is so important Because most people don't achieve the success they want because they either don't do the thing that matters most enough times, they don't do it for long enough, or they're doing the wrong thing altogether.
4:30
Most plans taken to their natural end are actually pretty good.
So even if you had a local business that was a dry cleaning business, if you did it for 40 years and never got distracted, I promise you that one, you'd have a pretty good dry cleaning business too.
You'd probably have multiple locations.
And three, you might have been able to scale nationwide.
I was in the gym space for a decade, so I could have gone into probably having a hundred locations of my own or doing the franchise route.
4:50
I went the licensing route, but just staying in that game for a decade straight without doing anything else.
And when I did do something else, which is why I make these videos, because it was one of my bigger mistakes, I started the supplement company and I probably shouldn't have done that.
I probably should have kept doing the main thing.
There's also the know of doing work that's below your pay grade.
5:08
This actually happened with the portfolio company recently.
They have access cash flow, they're making profit every month, but the CEO in the short term didn't want their cash flow to go down.
There was this clear role that he was spending 10 to 15 hours a week on it.
I'm like, dude, that's two full days of your work week, but he didn't want to give it to somebody else because it wasn't 40 hours of his week.
5:25
Do you not think that in the two full other days you can make up for the work that you shouldn't be doing, that somebody else can do?
And realistically they'll do it better than you because they're actually fully focused on it rather than trying to get it done?
You have to say no, and this is going to be a controversial 1 to family obligations.
5:41
We even say the Word family obligation as though it's assumed and expected.
It's a choice, family choice.
I'm not saying don't talk to your family.
I'm saying you might not want to talk to your mom every day.
What you really have is a family trade off.
You're going to trade getting a one off comment or a stink eye.
5:59
You think you're too good for us now?
Or Mr. Big Shot comment for the one thing that matters most.
If you can't talk to me, your father, you got all the money.
But you know what you don't have?
You don't have no heart.
You ain't got 2 balls.
You have to let other people's dream of you die so that your dream can live live because there's only so much of you to go around.
6:20
Everybody else is trying to get you to be the version of you that best serves them, including your family.
I don't think it's a malicious intention, but they have goals for you that are probably not your goals for you.
And somebody's goals have to die, and where most of them die is right in the middle, which is you try and do theirs and you try and do yours, and you actually accomplish neither.
6:37
So you might as well do 100% yours, do none of theirs, and then actually achieve.
The long term goal, which they probably have, is that you live a happy and successful life.
You only get there by saying no in the short term to get the long.
Yes, this is a big one.
This is business contacts and this is one of the hardest ones to say no to.
6:56
So you hop on the call, you hop on the zoom call, you take the Hey, you got a second?
Hey, you got 15.
I'll show you.
Literally, I looked at my inbox.
Let me tell you the actual words, what it sounds like.
Hey, I wanted to touch base real quick about something.
Hey, I've got this opportunity I think you're going to want to take a look at.
Let's catch up.
It's been a minute.
It's not the 10 minutes they're stealing from me.
7:12
It's the time that I'm thinking about what I'm going to say before I get on the call.
It's what I'm thinking about after the call.
It's the one I wake up the next morning and I'm still thinking about someone else's business rather than my own, and it's the actual cost of switching.
They've done a ton of research on this, but basically you are like four times more productive per unit of time if you do 1 task rather than try and go A&B.
7:33
And they just did it between two tasks, just asking people to go switch between task A and then do task B.
And they were different tasks.
And it took people four times as long versus just doing A and then B.
So when people interrupt your day, think about it as they just 4X how much longer it's going to take me to get this thing done.
7:51
That's the real cost of saying yes to them.
Now in the beginning, if you want to hop on calls to other people because you want to provide value to them, by all means do it.
But you're being conscious about it.
So if you have trouble being productive or getting the things that you want done or achieving the big goal, then I would consider entering a season of no.
8:08
There was a season where I was going from six locations to 10.
Now, I ultimately talked to a mentor, decided to sell my locations, turn into licensing, and I was like, shit sucks right now.
I was like, I'm working 80 hours, 100 hours a week, every hour of every day.
I gave up football, I gave up Netflix.
8:23
And what I started doing is writing down the things that I was willing to sacrifice for my goal rather than things that I was willing to do.
It's a lot of times people have these really big to do lists, but what I don't think people do is make really big to don't list.
Everybody ahead of you has the same time.
So if you're working all day and you're not making progress as fast as you want, it means the people ahead of you.
8:40
It's not that they're doing things you aren't, is that you're doing things they are.
They're choosing to say no to more activities than you are.
And if you say no to everything else, what's left is the work in front of you that just needs doing.
Jerry Seinfeld talked about how he wrote comedy.
He never forced himself to write, but he said during the time block he wasn't allowed to do anything else but right.
8:59
He said I could sit there bored, but I couldn't do anything else except for right?
It's a long time to spend on something that means absolutely nothing, but that's what I do.
That's what people want me to do is spend a lot of time wastefully so that then I can then waste their time.
9:17
People aren't willing to sit for that two or three minutes and they allow themselves to get distracted.
And so I think one of the easiest ways to be really productive is just allow no space for anything else to occur.
And then what happens by default is you become productive because you have nothing else to do.
When I need to change a behavior, I try and change the environment rather than changing myself because it's way easier to change everything else than to change you.








0:00
They literally feed them back the stats about their own life, just as a whitewashed character.
So they don't either know they're reading about themselves.
And they say what do you think this person should do?
They give better advice than what they actually do as the person that they're describing.
And so it means that we give better advice than we follow.
0:20
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
One of the things that I think I really like about what I've heard you say on other shows before is that we can look at anything as a trainable skill.
0:40
We can look at anything as a trainable skill.
And one of the probably most beneficial skills that I've had that has been absolutely, you know, invaluable and inextricable for my success is the ability to make friends.
The ability to make friends.
0:56
And somebody think, oh, well, that's just natural.
That's just, you know, just, you're just born with it.
Well, yes, there's some certain attributes that some people have, certain personality traits, etcetera.
But actually learning how to make friends is also a trainable skill and part of that trainable skill.
1:14
Like how did Joe Rogan and I get to be friends?
Well, I realized early on that people were interested.
If I had vast experience or unique novel things, stories I could share, things that I could talk about.
1:29
So by the time I met Joe Rogan, I was, let's see, I met him when I was like 28.
So I was 10 years into my own psychonautic journey, and I heard him talking about psychedelics and I was like, damn, I got a decade's worth of experience.
I can tell him some crazy stories and we can talk about that and it was hell hard to get that first meeting.
1:50
I had to come up with all kinds of different reasons and advertising this flashlight on his podcast.
And I was like, and he was like, this is so weird.
But there was no podcast advertising.
So I recognize.
I was like we we should meet for coffee to talk about.
He's like really, no you can just fucking.
2:06
I'll just send you the check like I was like no, no, no.
Like let's meet for coffee.
Because I trusted that if we met that we would become friends.
I trusted that.
So I I bet the whole thing on even willing to lose a deal.
Nope, don't deal unless we just meet for coffee.
2:22
Well, that coffee turned into a 3 1/2 hour dinner.
Turned to him inviting me on the podcast, turned to a two year friendship.
That two year friendship turned into a business partnership and that was one of the ways that I was able to be successful.
And it's still one of the ways in life today, is I trust that through all of the different experiences, the challenging things that I've done, the interesting books that I've read, becoming a really interesting person, a person that someone wants to hang out with and also knowing how to navigate and regulate my energy So that I'm bringing a super like positive, fun, competitive, whatever vibe into a situation.
2:59
So that my presence is additive to their experience with me.
And that's something that not only is somewhat natural, but also I'm constantly cultivating.
And I think for people out there who want to know, like how do I build a network like Aubrey?
3:16
How do I have all of these friends that you can do stuff well, build mastery.
Mastery is irresistibly attractive.
Like, I will talk to the world, you know, foot ping pong champion.
If they're the like, I see those on Instagram, I don't know.
My Instagram feed is always like people doing the craziest shit.
3:34
I'm like, whoa, I will fucking have lunch with you like you were playing soccer ping pong and you're killing it.
You know, like if you've done something like put yourself through the path of mastery, I'm going to want to hang out with you.
Maybe that friendship won't last long, but there's something to training that skill so that you can become a friend to anybody that you meet.
3:59
I love all of that.
I do.
I agree with all of it.
OK, so this might be really valuable for you guys right now.
There's the person you are, and there's probably hopefully, the person you want to be.
4:14
And there's a gap, right?
We agree on that.
OK, so that person that you want to be has traits and has skills that you don't have, right.
And I think that traits have been a word that we use as shorthand for bucket of skills.
4:31
And when I say it that way, it I think it'll help make more sense.
And so we might make the argument that if you were more charismatic, you would make more money.
Let's say that that was, that was the argument we're going to do.
You're like, OK for whatever profession I'm in, that would be true to me.
OK, fantastic.
4:47
Be charismatic.
What does that mean?
And so right now, if so, the more skilled you are, the more general a command can be given to you and you can still be effective.
So someone can at this point say, hey, Alex, can you start this business?
5:04
And I would say, sure, that's a very general command.
Now, one level below that, it might be like, can you advertise this product?
And I would say, yeah, I can do that.
One level below that would be do you think you can make a post that people would click on to buy this thing?
5:20
And I would say yes, and we can keep going down.
But the point is, is that if you have a skill set that you want to attain and you don't know how to attain it, it's because you're using a bucketed word that represents many smaller skills.
And so I'll use charisma as the example.
5:37
So if we say this guy's so charismatic, you have to ask yourself, or at least I asked myself why?
Well, I describe him as charismatic because when he walks in the room, he greets everyone immediately.
He uses people's names, he shakes their hand and he makes eye contact.
5:54
When someone's talking to him, he makes eye contact and he nods his head.
When he talks, he looks there and he looks at them and he bounces back and forth.
He asks questions up to the other person about themselves when he's talking.
Now that's like 7 things.
6:11
If I said, do you think you can nod your head when someone else is talking and keep eye contact?
You'd probably say yeah, I can do that.
It's like great, that's one of seven skills that it takes to master until eventually people would describe you as arithmatic.
6:28
And so if you don't understand how to do something, you just need to break it into a smaller chunk.
Because like, we teach toddlers how to speak by approximating sound.
It's like And then they they're like they and you're like clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
And they're like, ah, And then we keep doing it until eventually they're like mum And you're like, yeah, right.
6:47
And so that's their first word.
And then you start comparing things between what they know and what they don't know and making an association.
You say bottle, right?
And then they're like bottle.
And so they're like they can see with their eyes something they know and then they don't know the word.
And so that's how we teach things.
7:02
And so if we consider I, I like to think of myself as a toddler from a learning perspective because it allows you to take your ego away from a skill.
So a lot of times the skills that we need to learn on the other side of just kind of like humbling ourselves and saying, you know what if someone said it, go advertise.
I don't think I would be able to do it.
7:19
It's like, OK, well, let's break it down into six things.
Do you think you can message someone I can do that?
Well, that's that's a component of advertising.
Do you think you could make a post that talks about something that's interesting?
Maybe.
OK Well, do you think that you could ask a question in the beginning of a video that someone would find interesting?
7:38
Yeah, I can do that.
OK Well, then after that question, we then would make some sort of explanation around why we asked that.
OK, I think I can do that.
Right.
OK Then at the end, we want to reward them for the ultimate thing that we asked them to begin with.
Great.
Well, great.
If you record that and you post it, that's a piece of content.
OK, I can do that.
And so the reason that, like I write the books that I do and I try to try to try to make the content in that way is that if you can, if there's something that a trait you want or skill you want and you don't understand how to get it, it means you just need to break it into smaller pieces.
8:07
Because if you break it down low enough, you'll be able to do it.
And then when you have that, this is, I'm going to go full 180 here.
So remember when I talked about the beginning about you just need to figure out how much money you want to make every day, right?
I need to make $3000 a day.
OK.
That means I need to sell this many units.
Well, then you connect that and you sell this many units to whatever activity or input you have to do.
8:26
Because if you look at your calendar in terms of the things that you actually have to do with your time, then it gets a lot easier to plan and allocate because your time's your only resource, especially if you're starting out.
And so it's like I need to make 100 DMS because that will get me one customer and one customer is worth $200.
8:46
Great.
That means that if I do this every day, I'll make $6000 this month, OK.
Based on the economics, will will those people buy again next month?
If so, then great.
The next month I do 12, next month I do 18.
At that month I hire somebody who who's going to do it for $3000 a month.
9:01
And then I can keep stacking.
And then now I've got one person doing the same thing and the business keeps stacking.
I'm like, wow, I'm a businessman, right?
But that's the idea is that, like, I I believe in, in breaking things down to the absolute lowest level so that you can make it manageable.
And then the more skilled you become, the more you can bucket all of those activities.
9:20
Like, if someone's going to say, hey, Alex Advertiser, so Barbie's like, hey, I want to do this, this thing with you, this new supplement.
Do you think you could write an e-mail?
And this is the headline for the e-mail and this?
I'd be like, I got it.
Like, I'm good.
You know what I mean?
Like, understood.
But if he was talking to somebody who is super junior, that's probably how we would describe it.
9:39
But the only insist is that you are the person who's junior in this conversation and you are the one talking to yourself.
And that's, that's the gap.
What does this person that I want to become have in terms of skills and traits?
Can I break those things down into individuals?
And then can I break that into activities that I can do on a daily basis?
9:56
And does that ladder up to the amount of money that I ultimately want to make?
If so, great.
What's stopping?
Let's go, Let's go.
There's, and there's certain traits that people think also that you just have.
10:11
You don't have.
One of those would be humor, right?
Humor.
Well, humor is something that some people have a natural affinity towards.
They're just kind of naturally funny.
They've probably been funny for a while.
Maybe they had a funny parent.
I don't know what it is.
However, there's improv classes that are available in every fucking city that help you think fast, think in unique ways, and actually practice.
10:34
You practice being funny and like this idea of like, oh, he's so funny.
And of course everybody wants somebody around who's funny, because if you're hanging out and someones funny, then the whole energy of the environment raises to another level.
So your energy is actually cultivating another positive energy feedback loop because you're creating laughter in the space.
10:55
So go to a fucking improv class, practice being funny, and then you get more funny.
And then you find that meeting, you know, somewhere out there and something's going on and you come up with that funny thing.
Or you improv this little skit.
And then you get a couple people laughing.
11:10
And then the people gravitate more towards you and they're like, oh shit.
And then all of a sudden that friendship kind of can blossom off of this thing where you just have given yourself, well, I'm not that funny.
Well, OK, work on it.
You know, get better.
You know, like there's there's very few things that you can't train yourself up to that you want just hype.
11:35
Yeah.
And then, you know, there's.
But then there's also, like, all right, how do I appear with that kind of largeness, Largeness of presence and being.
And that's also trainable.
You know, like like literally all of these things, Even your physical attractiveness.
11:52
You know, they've even done studies about how you stand, how you present yourself.
I've seen a lot of people who look a lot of different ways, but you just look at him and you go, wow, that person is beautiful, right?
And it's not actually the visage that they're wearing and all of these people chasing all this Instagram filter.
12:10
Beauty to me, I'm like, that's not beautiful to me.
To me, in my eyes, I don't see that like I see.
Yes, I recognize that there are, you know, physically attractive traits and qualities, but beauty is something that also can emanate from within, is a skill that you can actually train yourself to actually be participatory in to the highest degree possible.
12:32
So all of these different disclaimers of why you can't be this or do this, throw all that shit out the window, whatever you want.
You can train that skill.
I really believe that.
I'm going to piggyback on that with with violence.
So, so like the the reason I want to bring that up is because one of I'll tell you the story because I think it'll it might hit home.
12:58
So when I was starting my first gym, I had a mentor and I wanted to advertise and get people to find out about my gym.
And he had a bunch of tanning salons.
And I was like, hey man, like, how do you, how do you get people in the tanning salon?
He's like, oh, we just put Flyers out.
And I was like, oh, duh, I'll go do that.
13:14
And so I printed out 300 Flyers because, you know, paper was expensive and I was broke.
And so we put out 300 Flyers and you know I get, I get back to the gym and I was like 300 Flyers, 300 members.
I was like boom, I'm going to be full.
And I did get a call and it was a guy and he was like, hey, did you put this flyer on my car?
13:34
And I was like, I did as a matter of fact kind Sir.
And he was like you scratched my Mercedes.
And I just, I remember just like immediately hanging up the phone.
Like I didn't even think about it.
It was like it was like I don't have the money for this and thank God he never called back.
But that was the only call I got from my 300 Flyers.
13:50
And and so I called.
I called the mentor back up, kind of pissed off.
I was like, hey, man, like he's like, oh, how'd that Flyers thing going?
I was like, I'll tell you I was like, it went terrible.
I didn't no one.
I was like, I spent money in the Flyers and you know, we went out there, put them all out.
And I was like, and I all I got was a call from a pissed off guy And he's like, well, how many did you put out?
14:10
I was like, I put out 300.
He was like 300, like, yeah, 300.
He's like, ah, not you can't really know anything off 300.
And I was like, what do you mean he's like, I mean we test with 5000 just to like see if any, if like one flyer is good or not.
14:27
He's like and if it's good, we do 5000 every day.
I know and I heard that and I and I felt like such a Pansy and I remember thinking to myself that was 150,000 Flyers a month that he was putting out to market his business.
14:44
And I I was calling him to get pissed off at him for the fact that my 300 didn't work.
And so there's this big misconception when you're starting out about the volume of effort that is required to win.
And one of the the fastest shortcuts is to get around somebody who's already doing that level of volume because you just you you, you leapfrog levels, right?
15:07
I remember I had a A A guy and I was doing it just for context on that math.
I was doing 1/5 thousandth of his effort so a lot of people are like oh he he doesn't work twice as hard.
He was working 5000 times harder than me And so like people can't comprehend that because everyone's like special snowflake and whatnot but from an output perspective it was it was it wasn't I was I was a rounding error.
15:31
I literally was rounded to 0 in terms of my level of effort and a lot of the beginners that I see who are getting getting their business going.
When I say beginners I I I'm all right.
How do I say that the right way making less than 1,000,000 bucks.
I'm still including that in in this kind of concept with with volume is that it takes so much more volume and for so much longer than you expect.
15:55
And so the best thing to do that I found is to find people who are actually succeeding at that level and find out how much volume they're doing and then double it.
And the reason I say double it is because they're probably better than you at it.
Like if I make 100 phone calls and you make 100 phone calls, and assuming no reputation whatever, I'll probably be better than you had it.
16:16
Why?
Because I did it for a long fucking time, right?
That's all I did for a very long time to get people into a gym.
And so my skill gives me leverage what I get back from what I put in.
So I put 100 calls and you put 100 calls in, I get 10 appointments, you get one or zero more leverage.
16:31
But if you do 200, you'll be able to start catching up to me in terms of skill.
You'll start getting better and better and better until eventually you're also getting 10 and you're getting 10% of 200.
Now you're getting 20, right?
You're getting more than I am, but you have to put that X.
Like there's the work that you do to match someone and then there's the work that you do to catch up.
16:50
And I think that frame has been helpful for me when I was coming up because I don't know where everyone's at in terms of their their family, their life, whatever.
But I remember looking at, I had a mind you, I started really young.
Well, really young nowadays isn't young.
But I was 23 when I started my gym and there was a competitor down the street.
17:06
And I remember seeing him on Facebook.
I post a picture of him and his wife and his kids and I was like, fuck, yeah.
I was like, he's enjoying his time.
I was like, I'm fucking calling right now.
I was like, I'm getting ahead of him now.
I'm competitive like that.
And so I I kind of like those Rocky cutscene days.
17:22
But the issue is that the Rocky cutscene lasts like 2 minutes in a movie and it can last five years in real life.
Yes, this is, this is something that I think we lose sight of.
We think of that.
We imagine that these rewards are going to be instant.
17:38
They're just fucking not.
You know, they're.
It's a grind and it's not only a grind.
And if some business just seems to pop off and take off you, what you're not seeing is the countless failures that happened for 10 years prior.
So that gave them the leverage so that when they started this new thing, it just took off, right.
17:58
So it's like there's no getting around that amount of effort and that amount of work.
And again, you can disclaim and say, oh, it must be nice.
Or you could say like, huh, interesting.
What did that person do to get them in that position to be that way?
How did Brampella get to be as funny as he is?
18:15
How did he get to be on Wild N Out and clown and everybody else out there?
Well, he's got the reps, He's got the fucking reps to do it.
He's put in the time and effort and yes, yeah, keep going.
Keep.
Going Yeah, yeah.
18:31
And you guys are going to get to hear.
Who's Brent Pella?
Get them.
But that's like that's the fundamental thing and and so I want I want to shift gears a little bit because you have a really powerful tool.
It's a tool that I use as well, And the tool is the psychological tool.
18:49
And the psychological tool, and I'll let you explain it, is you actually talk to an older version of yourself to give yourself the kind of guidance and the pep talk or whatever it is that you might need.
So tell us how you came to that practice.
19:05
OK, so First off, if we're looking at you like who here could use advice on something in their life, right?
I mean, right everyone, everyone could use advice.
And so if I'm looking at a source for advice, I want three things.
I want competence, I want context and I want alignment.
19:23
So, like, if someone's competent and they have context but they're misaligned, that is a recipe for getting fucked.
They know, they, like, know exactly what they're doing, They know exactly what would hurt you and they are not aligned with you.
Like it's a great way to get destroyed.
And so one of the issues that I saw with a lot of modern like therapies, etcetera, was that I felt like the incentives were misaligned.
19:44
And I would often spend a lot of time trying to.
I would spend 90 minutes trying to provide context for one decision to somebody who might not even be as competent as me within whatever the regard was.
And their alignment was for me to come back again next week.
And so I was like, I'm missing 2 or all three of the three things here.
20:02
And so that just felt like a broken model to me.
And so I was like, OK, well then what would, what would it look like to have somebody who has all three?
And so I stumbled upon this to the psychological principle called the Solomon paradox.
And so King Solomon, as you know.
A typical figure known for his wisdom and his wealth.
20:21
But what was interesting about him as a character was that he also had a personal life that was in shambles.
So he was known for, like cheating on his wife and partying and he sent somebody, you know, somebody.
His son was a a mess and he died and all all the stuff.
And so it's like, how can this man be so wise?
20:36
And yet the other side of his life is a mess.
And so that's why they call it the Solomon paradox, is that people would come to him because his advice to other people was so good, but he wasn't very good at following it for himself.
And so they've now proven this that when they whitewash someone's own life, they literally feed them back the stats about their own life, just as a whitewashed character.
20:58
So they don't either know they're reading about themselves.
And they say, what do you think this person should do?
They give better advice than what they actually do as the person that they're describing.
And so it means that we give better advice than we follow.
And so I thought about that.
21:14
And I thought, well, most of the time I feel like I know what I should do, but I'm just a Pansy about it.
Or I want someone else to tell me, But I don't have the alignment.
I have to provide context and I have the same three issues.
And so I was like, what if, what if I could talk like, because the ultimate version, who would have all three of those things would be end of game, Alex, right, 85 year old me.
21:35
That's accomplished the things that I want to accomplish.
Who embodies the traits that I want to embody?
And what would he say to me in this particular instance?
Because he already knows how the game finishes.
Now 9 times out of 10, he's like fuck off.
This doesn't matter, but he's a Dick anyways.
Just treats me like a kid.
21:52
He doesn't understand.
But the way that I do it is that every Monday, the first hour of my week, it says Solomon on my on my calendar.
And if for whatever reason, I call him Solomon, even though it's me in the future and it's basically, I do it like a chat to you now, I don't think you need to do it that way.
22:11
You could probably do a voice memo.
You could do a video, You could do whatever you want.
But for me, I'm, AII think through writing.
That's why I like writing books and things like that.
And so I basically, it's me.
And then I hit enter.
And then he's like, well, tell me about this.
And then I do this.
And he's like, well, why do you think that?
22:27
And then the nice thing, too, is that when I sometimes my session's 7 minutes, like, I just get to the answer and it's like, all right, that's it.
And often times it's I'll tell you one story, hopefully it'll it'll resonate with someone here.
So I had this really big thing that I've been building up to.
22:43
It was like a multi year project and all this anticipation, all this you know excitement around it and it happened and then there was something that just like didn't go the way that I'd wanted it to go.
So I was very disappointed about this.
But the thing that happened was actually now everything's ultimately under our control, but this one was a promise was made by a vendor and they had, you know, said that they would do that.
23:04
And based on the decision making criteria that I had at the time, which is that other people had done the same thing that I had done with this particular vendor, I felt like it was a reasonable decision just to have trusted this vendor to be able to do their job.
They didn't.
And so it cost me about $15 million and it's it was real money.
Not like I hypothetic like it, it sucked.
23:21
And so I had to like I had to like work through this.
And so I had the session with Solomon and he knew the amount of time that I'd put into this project and he said I am the product that you were building, not the thing.
23:37
And he's like an eye and I know what you put into that and I am satisfied and that is enough.
And that was like it.
It like I was like, OK, that was it.
23:55
And so for me, that kind of, I believe in nothing.
And so for me that's it's like, those are.
And like The thing is, you can be absolutely real, at least for me with Solomon because like, there's zero ego there.
24:14
He knows if I'm bullshitting, you know, he's like, come on, I'm like, ah, fuck.
And so I usually keep going until I get to actually a resolution, which was that, like, I am the product and I am satisfied.
And that is enough.
And The thing is, is that to be fair, his satisfaction is fucking tough because he knows if I could have tried harder.
24:35
And so one of the tough parts is like, beat it like so.
I'll say this to everybody who considers themselves a winner in the room.
Once you start winning, it's easy to impress other people.
And so the only way to raise the bar is like, well then how do I impress me?
And so future me knows the difference between how hard I tried and how hard it looks like when I try, when I have nothing left in the tank.
24:58
And so, like that delta is what Solomon pushes me towards.
And so like, because I get the question a lot, which is like, OK, Alex, how do you still stay motivated?
I'm sure you have stuff like that.
And for me it's because that has been the game is like, how do I close that delta?
25:15
Because like, I think I'll die and I don't think people will remember and that's OK.
But I'll know at the end how hard I tried.
And that is what I've been trying to make my W, which is like leaving with nothing left.
And so that's what I like, really, really try for.
25:32
And I feel like Solomon is aligned with that and he holds me accountable in a way no one else can cause.
Like I could talk to a therapist and say all the things that I did, they like, you must have tried hard, but like, I know I could bullshit someone.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
25:57
You can check on my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into, and if not, keep enjoying the show.
And we can do that with our friends too.
We can, we can enroll any one of our friends into believing our story.
Especially we're in like a relationship conflict.
26:13
We talk to a friend.
We can enroll them in our belief system so easily.
You know, it's so easy to get other people enrolled, but if you really and you can even enroll yourself, well, that's the tricky part.
If you're not careful, you'll enroll yourself in your own story.
26:29
But then if you really go beyond that and then go into your own version of Solomon, some part of you really knows, some part of you really knows what the real truth is, like what really happened.
And that I think is also one of the key components to really loving yourself.
26:47
What you said is like, and that is enough.
And like that feeling of, yeah, you gave it everything, man.
And that was that was enough.
And of course that's the best, that's the best of you.
That'll say that.
But it will also hold you accountable.
27:03
It's what Don Miguel Ruiz calls ruthless self love.
It's like ruthless.
It's like you could have given that more.
You could have stood, you could have stood more firm on your beliefs.
You could have more courage.
You could have hustled harder.
You could have tried more.
You could have given it another chance.
27:19
You could have done that, you know, And so get after it, Get after it.
Like, really like, that's that's the wisdom that we all have the availability to tap into if we use this kind of device.
I also think that Solomon has been like.
27:36
The frame of Solomon has been especially powerful because it removes external judgement to a large degree.
Like imagine telling your 85 year old self.
I mean, like, imagine it like, I so sometimes it's a weird, a weird, fun gratitude thing.
If you're into that.
I've struggled with gratitude of like, people are like, I write a journal.
27:54
I'm like, yeah.
And like, right now it's like, can you guys name 10 problems in your life?
Right.
But like, I got 20, right?
But it's like, name five things that are good.
I just stand there and I'm like, I am alive.
You're like.
And so a really fun one for me has been imagining Solomon reborn as myself in a present moment.
28:15
So it's weird and trippy but you're like you wake up and I'm next to my wife.
I'm like, I remember when she was this young like look at us, we're just kids and I like look out the window.
I'm like, man, I remember when Vegas looked like this was before all the flying cars and shit and then I wake up, I'm like my back doesn't hurt, my knees don't hurt.
28:33
Like man, it's nice to be young and like it's a it's a very weird experience to just imagine what life would be like as 85 year old you and then actually live through that and 85 year old me doesn't give a fuck about what Susan thinks about my decision, right?
28:51
And so a lot of times and I've gotten better at this as you know I've gotten older and whatnot.
But I remember when I was trying to sell the company, we were trying to sell the company.
I I was like really not sure if I wanted to do it or not.
And I was like why am I hesitating?
29:07
Like what's?
Like why am I what?
What is this?
And it's like, well what are what will people think?
But it's never people.
It's like 2 people and then you name the two people And then I was like, do I really want John's opinion to be the reason that I and I was like that's fucking dumb.
29:23
But it's like as soon as you name it, then it's like becomes real rather than this amorphous thing.
And Solomon just makes me name shit.
And he's like you really don't want to become me because of Tom.
He's like, no, you should do that.
Do it.
I mean, he's a Dick, you know, But, you know, lovingly.
29:42
Ruthless self love.
Yeah.
And so I I I also used to think it's a really powerful frame for getting around.
Like there is the thing that you want to do, and there's the thing that everyone else thinks you should do and everyone else thinks you should do.
It's probably not the right thing to do.
One of the another another thing that I've used before in my life is very similar to that.
30:02
And it's imagining that I got beamed into my body and my life right now as like a fresh new consciousness that came from another came from another dimension.
And i-beam in and it's I use this when I'm really kind of in a shitty mood or like down on myself or whatever and I kind of look around and I'm like, wow, look at my wife.
30:22
That's fucking awesome.
I'm like, wow, like I can bawl.
That's cool.
You know, like, oh wow, my house is beautiful and and like, all right, well, maybe there's these things that I don't like.
Well, I can fix that.
And I can fix that.
I can.
I can work harder in this area.
30:39
I can bounce back from this.
But we get saddled by all of our past regrets, our past grievances, all of this baggage that we carry because we're blaming ourself of the past and then holding ourself as the person who made that mistake rather than the person who grew and evolved from that mistake.
30:57
But if you can come in clean slate and just go, all right, where am I at?
Oh, fuck, I'm.
I'm at Arcadia.
Damn, this is cool.
What am I going to do?
Fuck, I'm going to have a blast.
And then I'm going to after this, I'm going to go home and I'm going to figure some shit out.
And I just heard Alex Hormosi and I'm fuck, I'm going to fucking grow my business.
31:15
I'm going to make some money.
Like, all right, I can do this because you lose that history that keeps you saddled to what you once were, but you're not that person.
Like Heraclitus said, one of my favorite quotes.
No person steps in the same river twice because it's not the same river and they're not the same person.
31:30
You're the person who grew and evolved and learned from everything you did.
So if you can give yourself that blessing of just being, like, all right, here it is.
Clean slate, right?
The fuck.
Now what are we going to do?
Build something awesome.
Be something awesome.
I love that because there's these two the River thing slaps.
31:52
That was great.
So I was involved in this lawsuit a few years back and it was something that I invested a lot of time in.
It was like a really big amount of money.
And I was right at the, you know, right at first You're like, I feel wronged.
But it's like the immediate, like, that's not fair.
32:09
Whatever.
And I played it out through a Solomon frame, and it's like, all right, well, what changes about your life if it goes the way you want it to go?
And if it doesn't go the way you want it to go?
I was like, well, if it goes the way I wanted to go, I'll be young, wealthy, happily married and have a little bit more money from this lawsuit.
32:28
He's like, what if it doesn't go the way you want to go?
I was like, I'll be young, married, less work because I won't be working on this thing anymore.
And yeah, it's like sounds like a win win, bro.
It was just very weird because like a lot of like, my dissatisfaction was only about the expectation that I had of what I thought I deserved rather than like, what is it going to change about my life?
32:48
And I remember like, especially if if I ever get into a Pansy mode about being super sad about something, it's like, well, I had nothing and was pretty happy too.
And so the worst case is like that.
And that wasn't that bad.
33:04
And so just like, how much is it actually going to change my life?
And I think the reason that I, I the reason I talk like, the reason I think developing frames like this is so powerful is that the vast majority of the time, the things that limit us in business is not knowledge.
Like, I used to sit down with women all day long because that's what I did for the weight loss stuff.
33:25
And I'd be like, Susie, let's be real.
You'd be like, I just don't know what to do, but, like, do you?
And they would just look at me like, did he just say that?
And I'd be like, what do you think's going to?
Because they'd be like, tell me about the program.
I'm like, what do you think it's going to be?
I'm like, they're like, I don't know.
I was like, what do you think?
You're going to eat Donuts all day.
They're like, well, no.
33:40
I'm like, do you think you're going to move more than you do now?
They're like, yeah.
And I was like, you're on the right track.
I'd be like and then like, I'd tease out the point that I'm like, knowledge is not the issue.
You're going to stop eating shit.
You're going to move more, right?
That's not the problem.
But the problem is that you're not doing it.
So let's tackle that right now like anybody.
33:56
Like if you guys are in the, like, I want to grow my business phase.
Learning to like that stuff's straightforward, let more people know about the stuff, give them shit in exchange for money.
And he's like, what do I give them?
Give a lot of people free things until eventually somebody comes back and says I want more of that and that's it.
But it's like, why are you not doing that?
34:13
And I think a lot of times the frames like this, like Solomon frame and whatnot are to hopefully debaggage you or whatever release the weight that you're carrying around.
Tom, he's like, did you do you DM my wife?
Did you DM my wife about your business?
Like yeah.
34:35
And so like a lot of times like the the, like, absolute acceptance frame has been super powerful which is like must be nice.
You're like, it is is it like, it just it just melts people.
Like if you're in these like you know, like you get in a comet war or something and they're like, it's because your dad gave you everything.
34:53
You're like, you're right.
And so it's just because we have this fear of being labeled something by somebody.
It's like, well, I don't label me that, but if you do, that's cool because you're going to die eventually.
35:10
So why?
But if you're going to die eventually, it means it doesn't matter either.
So like, fine, then I can use it both ways.
And so, like, that's just been really helpful for me just because, like, like, my ultimate expression of myself in terms of, like, solemn in me is just absolute agency.
So like, I do what I truly want to do.
35:26
Now obviously that's not hurting people, things like that.
But like that I do it without fear.
And I think that's that's, I think that's what I really spent a lot of time trying to tackle, which is like, what am I afraid of?
And it's not like the big the monster and whatnot, It's usually just judgement, or rather perceived judgement from people who aren't thinking about me.
35:44
And then it comes from a combination of discounting the value of their judgement and increasing the perceived value of Solomon judgment.
And I think that like over time, if I can just keep sliding more and more marbles into just gaining Solomon's opinions or Solomon's approval, I think it's a better version of me.
And so I just see it as a as a continuum rather than a binary of like I am this person or I am this person.
36:03
It's just like I'm more this person today and I'm going to keep sliding more marbles onto the side until most people describe me in this fashion.
I love what you're saying, too, about how to deflect those kind of comments and judgments that come in in this more.
Yes.
And model.
Your dad gave you everything.
36:19
Like.
Yes.
And he gave me way more than you possibly could ever imagine because he gave me beliefs and he gave me a field of value and he gave me a lot of these things that you will never even quantify.
So yeah, you're right, you know.
And yes and, you know, rather so instead of trying to combat people and getting in this, this battle, you know, just like, yeah.
36:42
And.
This will be really fun for you guys.
So like, and if I were if if we like transitioned into Q&A or something like that.
I'm not saying we do that.
But if if we, if that were to happen, right, someone would get up and say, well here's why that won't work for me.
Special reason 16B whatever, right.
36:58
And so I've just because I've done a handful of Q and as now and I've just realized it's been more powerful to just say like you're right, next question.
And then they're like it's like no, no, this is the reason that I can't succeed.
And you're like, yeah, you're right, you'll never succeed.
37:14
So And then they're like, well, yes, I will.
And you're like, right.
So here the fighter showed up great.
You were fighting on the wrong side.
Right.
It's like it's it's silly though but like we like we we do this contrarian thing for no reason to like to give ourselves excuses.
37:34
But like if someone were to say you're right, you'll never succeed.
You're like, what the fuck?
Yes, I OK, great.
Then you don't have any questions, So move on.
Right.
Like it's just this, this is like it's just conflict for no reason.
And so I think that right now if you have certain excuses because like right now there's probably a reason that you're like whatever it is, is the reason that I am not winning.
37:56
And I used to call this in because I I do a lot of sales training stuff too.
I call it the reason close, but it's insane how effective this is because it's so silly sounding.
Whatever the reason they say is just say and that's the perfect reason you should do this.
They're like, I can't sign up for this weight loss program because my husband, husband doesn't support me.
38:13
You're like, the reason that you should sign up for this weight loss program is because your husband doesn't support you.
I you know, I can't do this because I don't have the time.
It's like, that's the perfect reason to do it.
It's like I can't do it right now because it's a really busy cool.
I don't have it because I don't have the money for that.
It's like, well, that's the perfect reason you should do it.
38:30
It doesn't really matter.
Like, whatever reasons you have are basically irrelevant because the doing just needs doing, and it doesn't really care if you have a reasoner.
You don't have a reasoner if you're a good person or a bad person or what you think about yourself because like, really shitty people can still win.
And I'll tell you something that's kind of weird for me, but like for a very long time I consider myself a very bad person.
38:50
And maybe somebody here has a similar belief.
But like, I had that internal feeling about that, which was like, I feel like, I feel like the bad guy.
I feel like the villain and a very freeing thought for me.
Was that like, I can still do the stuff that successful people do and still win anyways?
39:08
And that was kind of cool for me because it was like, oh, this is still under my control.
Like, it's not like only the good guys win.
Like bad guys can win too.
I identified as that.
And so I just like boiling things down to behaviors because everything else I find to be completely distracting.
39:25
Which to be fair is probably why I've been, I would say on the other pole, which maybe when you go all the way around we're in the same spot from 180 spot, you know, perspective.
But I I have spent very little or zero time thinking about manifesting and thoughts and psychology and like all of these things, at least as as I understand it in this community.
39:45
I could be totally wrong.
But I'm saying as I see it, because I just never felt like it mattered.
Because if you do 100 reach outs, more people will find out about your stuff.
Whether you set affirmations in the morning, whether you wooed it into existence, whether you it's like it doesn't matter.
40:04
And so just focusing on the behaviors and the activities that I needed to do has just been my absolute razor to cut through the noise.
And if you have that frame, you will also be able to basically throw out 90% of the bullshit that you hear every day on your news feed from people who haven't been there and never did it anyways because they have to feel lots of fluff.
40:23
In their content because they have no substance, because they don't know the actual activities that did it.
And so if you get to the end of something, all right, this is, I'm going to go on a little thing here.
So I'm going to find two terms that I think are very meaningful.
So learning and intelligence.
So intelligence.
40:39
I'll start with that.
Well, fine.
I'll do learning first.
So learning is same condition, new behavior.
So if I showed you all a red card and then I slapped you, you'd be like, woah.
And I don't say anything.
Then I show you a red card and then I slapped you, you'd be like whoa.
40:57
And then I showed you a red card and you duck.
Same condition, new behavior you learned.
Intelligence is rate of learning to speed.
It's how like if I if I show you that and it takes some person 10 times for them to duck and one person the second time, the duck the second time person is smarter, they're more intelligent than the 10 time person.
41:21
And so a lot of you here I'm looking at, you think you're really smart, but you go back home to the same condition and you do the exact same thing.
So how smart are you?
Red card slap.
41:37
You don't change.
And so by defining it that way, it actually makes intelligence under our control.
And so if you, I'm sure you wanted to grow to some degree by coming here for this whole event and obviously you guys here today.
But if you leave here and your behavior doesn't change in the same conditions, it means you learned nothing.
42:02
And I think that's been a really powerful frame for me because if I go somewhere, I'm like what behavior will I change from this?
And if you go somewhere and there is no behavior that changed, then maybe you shouldn't go there anymore.
Or maybe you should change one of the two is either that didn't give you anything or you're not receiving anything, right?
42:18
And so that has been helpful for me in terms of how I consume information, which is like, will this change anything about my behaviour?
No.
Well then, either this wasn't valuable or I need to change something.
I remember there's a, there's a story that when I was working for, so I had a, you know, kind of a boutique marketing company.
42:39
And again, I've already mentioned it.
So my stepdad is the founder of Fleshlight.
And so, yeah, I know it's crazy, right?
And so I was helping him out with his marketing and he brought me into the office one day and he fired me a couple times, actually, which was rude.
42:56
I just felt like it.
Must be nice.
But he brought me in right before he fired me the last time, which I'm super glad that he did.
But he brought me in and he goes, you know what?
He just brings me into him to like a meeting into his office, which eventually became my office.
43:13
I took over his whole building and that's right.
And he goes, you know what, Aubrey?
You will never be successful without me.
And I go, that is a fucking Dick thing to say.
And I'll be like, mark my words, motherfucker.
43:29
And I remembered that.
I remembered him saying that.
And our relationship was strange for some years because I was like, that is a fucked up thing to tell your stepson.
And finally, you know, when actually I was sitting Shiva for my father who passed and I brought my step dad because my step dad knew my father and I brought him in and we were just sharing.
43:48
It was just me and him and say, hey man, it's one fucked up thing that you said, you know, And you brought me in that office today and you said you'd never be successful without me.
Like, why'd you say that?
And he goes because I knew you were a fighter.
44:05
I knew you were a fighter.
And I knew if I said that to you, you wouldn't rest a single fucking minute until you prove me wrong.
And I was like, God damn, God damn.
And it was so like for him to new, to, to have that awareness and know that that was exactly the right thing.
44:26
He could have been like, you're going to be so successful.
I've seen how hard you work.
You're a hard worker.
You're going to do it.
That wouldn't have accomplished a fraction of what that one thing.
And he knew he was going to have to bear the price.
He knew that I was going to resent him.
I was going to hate him for a little while.
But he knew that that would propel me because he knew me.
44:44
And he told me he was like, I watched you.
I was a, you know, I was a basketball player and our crosstown rival was the Bowie Bulldogs.
Fucking Bowie Bulldogs.
And is this the rowdiest crowd?
You mean the the bench was right in the stands and it's they like, literally spit on you and you're on the bed.
45:00
It was like fucking savage.
We hated each other.
And I remember I like, I shot an air ball that day and they were just, I was like team captain and they were just fucking ripping into me and I was like, fuck you guys.
And I just went on a tear.
I just went on a run, scored like 10 in a row and one foul.
45:19
I'm at the free throw line.
They're chanting air ball, air ball.
And I just take my time and I look over at the visitor stands and I just winked at them and switched it.
And he's like, my step dad recalled that.
And I I don't think about that that much as high school basketball.
You know, I remember that moment.
45:34
He's like when I saw that when I saw you after all of the whole crowd turned against you and you went twice as hard and you just wouldn't be stopped.
And then you looked at all of those people who were chanting in unison, air ball, and you just winked at them and you hit that shot.
45:50
Like, I knew you were a fighter.
And I knew that's what would bring the best out of you.
Is not everybody pumping your tires but someone to say that you couldn't?
And I was like, fuck, fuck, like, thank you.
You know, I'm like, thank you, Steve.
Like, thank you for that gift.
And so many of these people, so many of these detractors that you have, you know, you can look at it like, I can't believe they're saying this.
46:12
I can't believe they're doing this.
Or you can go.
Thank you.
Watch me.
Watch me.
Yeah bro, any any closing words you'd like to leave the people here with?
46:34
Any Any final final sentiments?
I don't know what would serve you guys the best, but I talk about this thing in my book called The Rule of 100, and so I'm just going to close on something tactical.
I already gave you the learning thing, which is if you don't do anything different when you go back to the same condition, you've learned nothing.
46:53
And that's probably not what you want, which means you probably should change your behavior.
The rule of 100 is pretty simple.
You do 100 primary actions every day until you get to your goal.
And the the hard part is figuring out what the 100 primary actions are.
47:12
And so those hundred primary actions, if you're in a business, is probably going to be some level of promotion.
And that might be promotion to get an employee.
Like you can use this stuff to get customers.
You can use it to get employees.
You can use it to get affiliates.
You can use it to get influencers.
You can use to get agency, whatever it is.
But set a timer, kitchen timer works 5 bucks and do the 100 reach outs.
47:39
Do the 100 minutes of content.
Spend $100 a day on ads, whatever it is, and start your day with that.
And if you ever look away to your phone or you go to get a drink of water, you go to the bathroom, like, pause the timer and see how long it actually takes you to do it.
47:55
Because I found that a lot of times my fear around doing some of this stuff is it makes it feel.
I think this is a Layla quote that she says.
But it's like fear is a a mile wide, an inch deep.
So it looks like it's an ocean, but you take a step into it and you realize it's really shallow.
48:12
And so we have these fear of rejection, fear of making content, of making the post of whatever it is for a bad comment.
But when I started quantifying things based on the amount of time that it was going to take to do whatever that action was, and it's like, all right, my 100 is going to take me two hours and 15 minutes or it's going to take me 3 hours and 12 minutes on average.
48:33
All right, It's seven.
All right.
I'll be done at 10:15.
And then you just crank the timer you start.
And so a lot of times there's been a lot of, you know, recently, and I I like to speak out against it, a lot of woo, woo around these extended morning routines and things where people like, have to prepare to work.
48:50
They masturbate about the idea of working.
And I'll tell you, the best morning routine is the one that gets you to work fastest.
And so like the work needs doing.
49:09
And the faster that you start, the faster it will be done.
And so everything that I do before that moment is just actually elongating that time.
And so if it if I'm it's 7:00 now, it's like, well, if I do an hour of prep and then I still have 3 hours and 15 minutes of work, it's like I just want to fucking start.
And I think if you can just confront the work and disassociate the long term reward for the actions that you're doing and reassociate the work with Solomon or whoever that person is that you want to be.
49:39
As you chopping the wood or sculpting the marble of the person that you want to become and giving yourself that basket of skills and traits that they eventually ladder up to, Then every day you feel like you are crafting that masterpiece.
And the the thing that I'm spending the most of my mental energy on right now is defining winning by level of effort.
50:01
And so I can only win.
I only get to win if I if I leave nothing in the tank.
And by doing that, it's like it's going to take longer.
Awesome.
I'll have less in the tank.
Oh, it's going to, it's going to be even harder.
Awesome.
I'll have a bigger opportunity to empty my tank because that's the only way that I win.
50:19
And so I think if you can redefine it that way, the external winning takes care of itself really easily.
And so that's that is my parting word is that if you don't change your behavior, you learn nothing.
And that is tactically what I would do if you don't know what to do is start it first thing, start a timer and do not stop until the timer is done.
50:40
Let's go.
Let's go.
It goes.
And and I love that as I love that, as as the parting words.
And I just also want to say, like, for people who claim they don't have enough time, just take a gander at your screen time calculator on your fucking phone.
50:59
Take a gander and then come up with that excuse to somebody while showing them your screen time calculator on your phone.
You're right.
You're never going to be successful, right?
You know, so fundamentally, like we all have more capability than than we need to.
51:15
Like Steven Pressfield, when he asks about how he writes, he says I just fucking sit in my chair at 9:00 every fucking day or whenever he whenever he ends up starting and that's just where I am, I show up.
That's that's what he talks about in turning pro.
That's how you turn pro.
You just show the fuck up.
51:31
You put in the effort, you do the work and the results will come.
Love you guys.
Let's have a fucking great time.
Thank you, Alex.
Thank you guys.
Thank you.
Thank you guys.

If you're picking businesses, the difference that he and I had is that his mentors always went super, super big.
They wanted to go change the world and whatnot.
But what I don't think we see or appropriately risk or value is the graveyard full of people who went big and struck out.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:22
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
There are two big risks that exist in business.
The 1st is the execution risk, the second is the idea risk.
0:39
Now you could maybe make an argument for a third being, you know, environmental risk, regulatory risk, things like that.
But I would say big picture is, does the idea fundamentally work?
You know, is having strangers, Dr. kids around in cars going to be a really good idea, Uber right?
Or creating lockers for cats?
0:55
Is that going to be a good idea?
I don't know.
Right?
Or am I going to be able to execute the idea itself?
OK, so I was having a really good conversation with a friend of mine who's a software entrepreneur.
He's had three or four software companies, none of them have really hit.
He's about the same age as me and he and I sit in very different financial positions at this point in our life.
1:15
And we were having a really in depth conversation around this topic, which is appropriately measuring risk.
And so one of the issues that I see with a lot of newer entrepreneurs is that they overestimate the payoff for a risk and underestimate the cost, number one and 2nd is they overestimate the likelihood of success they're going to have and they underestimate the risk in terms of the likely that they fail.
1:39
And I think this is really interesting because he and I were discussing the first quote that I have.
It's kind of, it's in the intro of my book by Jeff Bezos.
I'll read it to you right now.
Outsize returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right.
Given 10% chance of 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time.
1:56
But you're still going to be wrong 9 times out of 10.
We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot.
But if you're also going to hit some home runs.
The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution.
When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is 4 in business.
2:13
Every once in a while when you step up to the plate, you can score 1000 runs.
This long tailed distribution of returns.
It's why it's important to be bold.
Big winners pay for so many experiments.
Jeff Bezos And so The thing is, is that there are two big costs when you're making these risks.
One is you've got the money and things like that.
2:30
But I think the biggest cost is time.
And so if you think about portfolio theory which is for example like venture capital VCs though let's say they take 50 companies on and they're betting the fact that one of those fifty companies is going to, you know 100 X and pretty much carry the return to the entire portfolio.
2:46
And for the vast majority of the other ones, they either go out of business or basically not really do anything spectacular.
And so for the VC, for the venture capital, the investor, it makes sense to take this approach because they're going to get very good returns using, you know, you know, using this, this method.
Whereas if you are one of the 49, you know, founders who has pretty much all of the net worth invested in this thing and it takes five years of your life away to only fail, it can be harder to swallow.
3:13
And so he and I have had very different careers and lives and it's because we, we value risk differently.
Now he would say that he is not interested in making money and he just wants to do something really big and really cool.
I tend to be more money focused or money money driven, whatever you want to say, because I think that the accumulation of money will allow me to do really cool things later on in my life.
3:33
And when I say later, I mean like, you know, give me 2030 years of doing this and I think we can do that now.
So the reason that I want to bring up this topic is because picking the business that you're going to go after I think is a very important question that your goal that you're going to ask yourself.
And you have to understand that you're probably going to fail many times before you are successful.
3:49
And one of the hardest questions in entrepreneurship and this is also one of the things that come up in the conversation is when do I push or when do I pivot right, when do I keep pushing, when do I keep persevering on this idea that's not quite working and when do I pivot?
And it's one of the hardest questions in entrepreneurship because you don't know whether it's you or the idea.
4:08
And that's what's hard, because sometimes it's like how many great business ideas have the founders have abandoned 6 inches from gold, where they just needed to push a little bit harder and they were going to have the breakthrough.
And I hesitate to talk about the subjects.
I think most people just don't know how to push it all.
And so, you know, I put that as a big caveat.
4:24
Now, when we're talking about business in general, I, and this is my difference from my friend, I prefer to only go after ideas that I think have virtually no risk of not being ideas that people want.
Which then leaves only me as the variable, the execution risk, that it can be done well, it can be well businessed, right?
4:42
And so I think in a lot of ways this is just Alex's two cents.
Most newer entrepreneurs, I think would be better served going after boring businesses that have established needs, right?
So people want to have, you know, businesses want more customers, people want to make more money.
4:58
People want higher paying jobs.
People want to have skills that are valuable.
People want, you know, to lose weight.
People want love, People want, you know, entertainment.
Like these are all things that are not going to change over time.
And So what that allows you to do is hone your skills at business because you know if it doesn't work, it's only you.
5:16
It's only your fault if it doesn't work, right.
And so because the problem is that having the perspective from which to make a judgement on whether you have product market fit can be, I think a much harder decision of when to push and when to pivot.
You know, as a as a total side note, because I think this is really interesting, I think there's three big questions that are really dichotomies that you have to manage as an entrepreneur, right.
5:35
One is 1 to push and one to pivot.
The 2nd is how much do I spend versus how much do I?
Sorry, how much do I consume versus how much do I invest, right.
Because you're going to be living your whole life.
If you, if you always forgo the immediate satisfaction, you may reach the end of your life and never have enjoyed anything, right?
5:50
So there's a little bit of a a balance there that you have to strike, right?
And it probably shifts over time, but there still means that there's some level of consumption even early on in your life and at the same time, you also don't know if you're going to live tomorrow, right?
And that's where it gets really interesting.
It's a personal question, right?
And the third is, is kind of the balance between like how much do I, you know, delegate to other people versus how much do I do right, 'cause you got to do something and you can't delegate everything, right?
6:13
Like.
And so there's there's balances here.
And so today, it's just about the the push and the pivot and idea risk versus execution risk.
And so for the newer entrepreneurs, you probably suck at business and that's OK.
And that's because you're new, which is totally reasonable and totally acceptable.
And of course you should suck because it's hard and a lot of people do it right.
If you want to be in the top 1%, it's 1% of people.
6:31
That means you have to beat 99 other people out of 100 in order to be the top 1%, which is only 400,000 a year, right.
Not only, it means a lot of money, right.
And so The thing is, is that Instagram makes everyone feel like if you're not making money, you're poor, which is not true.
You can save 400,000 a year for not that long and and have a lot of money, You know what I mean?
6:48
And so anyways, back to the point, if you're picking businesses, the difference that he and I had is that his mentors always went super, super big.
They wanted to go change the world and whatnot.
But what I don't think we see or appropriately risk or value is the graveyard full of people who went big and struck out.
7:05
And I think it's an interesting caveat to this.
Jeff Bezos gives this example and I want to dive into it in a little bit more detail is that let's, let's zoom out for a second.
Let's, let's eliminate Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett from the names that you have in your head.
If we were to think what would be required to be #1 in the world at a thing, right, You'd have to have the natural proclivity, right?
7:25
Because if you're committing, it's everybody, The people who are going to have natural advantages based on genetic code upbringing, whatever are going to, they're going to, they're going to win more, right?
So that'd be the first thing we'd want.
If we wanted to create this person who's going to be likely to win #2 is they'd have to have a tremendous amount of skill, right.
7:41
So they'd have the natural proclivity, the the, the nurturer that created an environment where they had work ethic to pursue the skill.
Right.
So they have to be very, very good.
And 3rd they'd have to be lucky, right?
Because if you think about a whole bunch of people like imagine everybody who's born really, you know, has his natural tendencies or proclivities towards these activities, right.
8:00
And then does a ton of it in terms of volume.
So they get very good.
What then separates them?
Luck, right.
The people at the very, very, very top have all the all of the things aligned comma and luck.
And so it's interesting that he has this quote around risk because one of the things that's unique about Bezos and even Elon, right, and this is probably a a a further discussion on business strategy overall is that they've had virtually limitless access to capital, right, Like as in they can basically raise money endlessly to fund these risks, right.
8:33
And so the equation that he said, which is imagine go to a Vegas casino and there's a there's a table that has a 10% chance of winning, but you get 100 times payout when you do.
If you can play the game on an unlimited time horizon, then you absolutely should just play it as many times as humanly possible.
8:49
But most of us do not have unlimited spins, right?
And that's where this gets more interesting.
Hey, MO's edition, quick break.
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, So send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
9:07
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with.
Tag them in one of my relayless posts, and I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And so if you were to imagine a dollar as a year of Life, OK, that you have in your entrepreneurial career and let's say to build something really epic would take 10 years.
9:27
And that's like minimum.
You know what I mean?
Like Facebook was 20 is 20 years old now, right?
Which is kind of insane to think about.
I think it's 20 years old.
Is it 20 years old?
I feel like it's 20 years old.
It's pretty old. 15 years old.
It's pretty old, right?
Let's just say 15, right.
If you want to build something epic, which means.
And how long does it take to test the idea before moving on, right?
9:47
That's another big question.
Like how how long does it take to really give it your all on a thing.
And so we were having the discussion and he said I think we should say $35 would be you know you have 35 years of life and and you know how long do we do we chunk and we agreed on five years as a mid ground because it takes 15 to really you know see something all the way through.
10:07
If we said 15 was the chunk that didn't seem realistic because it does take you 15 years to find out something doesn't work right and so it's that bad.
So we said five was the was the number you can come up with your own right.
And so a more realistic way to see this right would be, you know, you've got a one out of 10 shot at 100 times payout, but the minimum bet is five and you've got 35 bucks.
10:29
Interesting.
The conversation changes.
Now let's say that you're now 15 years in.
Let's say you bet three times.
You lost all three times, which would be reasonable?
That would be expected that you'd lose three times.
You could even lose all three of the first times.
But now you're 15 years in and you have still no money.
How do you feel about yourself?
10:46
How do you feel about your skill, What's your reputation?
All these things kind of weigh in.
You know what I mean?
And This is why I think this is a really interesting discussion.
And so I will give you my two cents because he and I disagree on these things, because I have the perspective that all the people that I know, the wealthiest in the world, eliminate risk.
11:01
So that's what they do.
They control risk.
They they, they virtually eliminate it.
They figure out ways to play the game in new ways where they cannot lose.
Right.
I'll give you an example.
If The Rock, he came out with a, I'm trying to think of something he hasn't come out with because he came out with apparel and whatever.
11:18
Let's say he came out with, let's say he came out with a book, right?
Let's say, let's say the Rock writes a book.
Maybe he already has written a book.
I don't know.
And he writes a book.
What are the, what's the likelihood that it's not a best seller?
Virtually 0, right?
It's virtually 0.
11:34
So he's basically eliminated the risk because he controls another variable, which is a massive audience, right.
And you can build that deliberately.
And so when we think about these things, the richest people that I know control Risk and only play games where if they wait, they win.
And my friend has not taken that approach and he's like, hey, I just want to go big or go home.
11:50
And The thing is, is that he's gone home more than he's gone big.
And so I I will give you Alex's two cents and you can choose to do what you want with it.
And I'll just explain my views on risk.
I tend to go with the highest likelihood bet, and I tend to if I have two bets, let's say one where I have a 10X payoff for a one out of two shots, right?
12:13
Which would be a 2 to one risk adjusted return.
All right, if you're crazy, just multiply the payoff by the the by the likelihood.
Or is that's a 5X?
Sorry I've messed that up, but you get the idea.
You multiply the payoff by the percentage likelihood and if I had an equivalent risk adjusted return in another one but I had a higher likelihood of achieving it.
12:32
So if I had a 5X that I or a 6X that I thought I had a four out of five chance of getting versus a 10X that I had out of the math on it.
But whatever a one out of two shot of getting, I would pick the the four out of five shot that had a lower upside.
That's me.
And I think part of that is because the games that are set up that way are usually going to be just execution risk businesses.
12:53
And I feel like I can, I can pay that down in other ways, right?
I can pay down that risk.
So I can virtually nothing's guaranteed, but I can virtually guarantee the outcome.
And so my goal is to string as many of these virtually guaranteed upsides in my favour for a long enough period of time that I let compounding work.
13:14
Because compounding on a long enough time horizon creates the outsides return.
And so the idea is how can I play?
How can I get as many WS in a row and as few LS as possible for a long enough time horizon so that I create the outsides return comma and get delivered pretty cool and and stress free or not stress free but like a pretty cool life along the way.
13:37
Right now if we played the game the way that we talked about earlier, where you have the 35 years that you can bet and you're 3 bets in, you're 15 years in and you don't have anything that can be pretty hard.
Hard on your ego, hard on your reputation.
Maybe you learn bad habit, like there's a lot of things because you won't know, especially if there's an idea risk that's at hand.
13:54
Like, is it me or was it the idea, right.
And so for that reason, I'm in favor of the significantly lower risk.
And he and I were, you know, talking back and forth.
He's like, you know what I've observed from you is that you just, you go for the sure thing.
And that's 100% what I do.
That is I've always gone for the sure thing and then I just continue to try and trade up the upside of my sure things right.
14:15
So the first sure thing you can have is a very high paying you know income job.
And then the next sure thing would be like if I were to quit a job I would make sure that I had more income from my side hustle probably where I believed it would be very reasonable for me to get that you know within a very short period of time.
So then I would you know make maybe that switch and then I would look at you know all the opportunities that existed and think OK what are these things on a risk adjusted basis.
14:38
And this is again where people make it, you know errors just assume you have to take the negative assumptions.
And I'd say like the the better I get at this at at thinking this way that the more I I continue to make which is I'm going to assume everything goes wrong.
What what then do I make right.
14:55
And so if you can just say, like assuming none of the good things that you think are reasonable are going to happen, happen, can you still win?
And I think when you think that way, what happens is you give yourself room to be pleasantly surprised and exceed expectations.
But what happens is when you set up the game that way where you're like, I'm assuming these are the five things that I think will happen and will go right.
15:17
But I'm assuming none of them are going to go right.
Do I still win?
And if you can still win, then that is an opportunity worth pursuing in my opinion.
And so that's that has been the approach that I have taken, which is, how can I virtually eliminate the execution risk, the limited idea risk, by only going after things that people I already know want?
15:36
And then how can I stack the chips in my favour like the Rock, where if I want to write a book, I want to make sure it's a best seller no matter what, right?
How do I do that?
And then think about all the things that can go wrong, assume they go wrong, and then think, what would I do in order to still succeed even with all these things going wrong?
15:52
And then I think when you take those actions, you may not hit the thousand X return, but let's paint a different game that you could play.
So let's say you could play.
There's there's the two games, one was the one that Jeff Bezos outlined, right, which you got, you know, one out of 10 shot at getting 100 times payoff.
16:10
The game that I prefer to play is how can I get a 3X payoff with a 95% chance of certainty And I still have the same 35, right, minimum bet.
Well, I'll bet 5 and get my 3:00 and then I'll bet my 15 and I'll be at 45 and then I'll bet my 45 and I'll be at up.
16:33
There we go.
I'm already at 120 whatever, so already got my 100 times payoff by thinking about it from a risk adjusted basis.
Now it's not going to be sexy.
It's not.
But if you double or triple or 5X things enough times, you get to the 100 X very quickly and you can do it with limited downside, knowing that you've controlled for the idea risk and have only focused on the execution risk, which is yourself.








0:00
For me, I've relieved a lot of the pressure in my life so that I could make better decisions by zooming way out and thinking 10,000 years from now will this matter.
And then if I can make the decision of like good or bad based on my new context that I created, then I can live a life a lot easier.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
0:19
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
I hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
When you're building a business or you're building your career, there are stressors that come into play, right?
0:41
And how we manage the circumstances or the conditions that come to us is dictates how our life turns out right?
Like everybody has bad stuff happen.
And I say that as a pause because you probably believed and nodded your head like, yeah, everybody has bad stuff happen, but that's not true.
Everyone has stuff happen, and then we choose to make it bad or good.
1:00
And so I'll tell you a quick back story and then I'll tell you how I how I deal with it.
So imagine for a second two children that are playing, and then one child tells the other child your nose is really big or you're fat.
1:16
And what's interesting is that the child who hears it is unaffected, and the child who says it is unaffected, they're like, you're fat.
And he's like, huh, Two people communicate.
Parent comes in and overhears it.
And she's like, oh, my God takes the child that that was called fat, comforts them, gives them the expectation that they should be upset, and then tells the other one that that was bad.
1:39
And in a moment there was something that is now traumatic that otherwise wouldn't have been, because the adult tells both of those children that that was bad.
And so when we're kids, we walk into the world with no meaning.
All we do is we observe and then we say, what does that mean?
What does that mean?
And then whatever the adults around us tell us and say, this means that we take as fact, and it's not true.
2:00
It's their interpretation of the world, and we inherit those.
And then we spend the rest of our life trying to undo these and examine these beliefs that we have been told by people that we probably don't agree with.
And so it's hard to track back every single thing you've ever been told means.
2:16
But you can just on an exception basis, when something bothers you, pull it out and look at it and say, what happened and why is this bad?
What if it were good?
And what would it look like if it were good?
And so the two tools that I use for this are time and volume.
2:34
And so the volume example is thinking, OK, I'm in traffic.
If this happened every day, would I be upset?
If it happened every day, I'd probably expect it, which means that I would not be upset about it because it's just how things always are.
And so if every time every person got into a car, it always took 30 minutes to get somewhere, then that's just how driving a car is.
2:56
And so then our expectation meets reality.
Or if you want to make it positive, you say, well, what if every time I got in a car, normally it would take an hour and today it took 30?
I'd be pretty excited about it.
And so all we did is just change the volume on the circumstance to recalibrate the meaning that we're choosing to ascribe to it good or bad, right?
3:16
And so I like to think of circumstances a lot like weather, which is like you've got sunny days and you've got rainy days.
And the problem in my opinion is that people, any day that rains, they say is bad and any day that's sunny they say is good when in reality it just is.
3:32
It's just the weather and you need both.
And if it was only sunny every day, you wouldn't be happy about the sun because it's just how it always is.
And so contrast is what creates the the quote good and bad when reality, there's just a middle line and half of it's above and half of it's below.
And so if we know that, then what we can do is artificially move the line in our minds by saying whatever this circumstances, what would it look like if it were worse?
3:57
And what would it look like if it were worse all the time?
And then now, how?
How would I look at my current circumstance?
And would it be better now as a result if it were always worse than it is today?
And if so, then maybe today's a good thing, right?
The 2nd frame that I like to use is time, right?
Which is if I go not just 100 years out, but 10,000 years out, how much is this going to matter, right?
4:19
And so a good example of that is like, if you're looking at the reason something effects you is because you have deemed it meaningful.
You've said it matters, right?
And it's my world view that nothing matters with a capital M Like nothing matters in the universe, right?
4:36
There's one little Pebble into a big thing of sand inside of lots of things of sand inside of lots of things of sand 14 billion years, whatever, right?
It doesn't matter.
And the easiest story that I saw about this can't remember the writer's name but there's this statue of a head that's in the sands of Egypt eye and it's bigger than this whole room.
4:53
It's just the head and it's worn out and then in scripted along the forehead was it was that it was a tombstone.
It says here lies crazy name, whatever.
Here lies crazy name.
Who owned everything that the eye could see the immortal so and so.
And the only thing that was left was a worn out statue head that no one knew who he was and it was 5000 years old.
5:14
And so if that guy who ruled the known world, to him, wealth probably mattered, right?
But does it matter?
No, probably not.
And so for me, I've relieved a lot of the pressure in my life so that I could make better decisions by zooming way out and thinking 10,000 years from now, will this matter?
5:33
And then if the answer is no, does it matter to me?
And then if I can make the decision of, like, good or bad based on my new context that I created, then I can live a life a lot easier.
And so for me, that helped me decrease anxiety.
It helped me decrease, you know, sadness around certain circumstances.
5:50
And I'll give you the last example of this.
So I had a cat named Bill.
Chill Bill, Rest in peace, homie.
Love the cat.
Really like the cat.
And he died like some freak heart thing or something.
So he died in like 2 years and he was a cute little cat.
Really nice dude.
Anyways, when he died, I was bumped.
6:08
I was like, this sucks.
But then I thought to myself, what if cats only normally lived six months?
How stoked would I be that he lived four times the normal length of a normal cat?
I was like, I'd probably be really stuck.
I'd be like, dude, he lived a long life.
I can't believe we had him this long and all of a sudden my perspective around the death completely changed.
6:25
I was like, I was so grateful that I got to have him as long as I did Mosey Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
And if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
6:44
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
When you play with time and you play with volume, how regular is this?
Could it be worse?
What if worse was normal and this is what today was?
6:59
Well then that's the example of the cat or the traffic.
Like then all of a sudden you can make your current context much easier to deal with, or even positive, even though you thought of it as negative because you ascribed a different meaning to it.
And then if we think about this on a very long time horizon, we think that none of it's really going to matter because in 500 million years, the sun is going to expand enough and engulf the Earth, and so it won't matter.
7:20
Like, literally everything that you do here is going to get engulfed by the sun, and it'll only quote matter if we expand to the other, you know, universes.
Now imagine that you invented something that changes humanity, like the guy who found fire.
Good dude.
We appreciate him, but you know what?
None of us know his name.
Did it matter for us?
7:36
Sure.
Does it matter that that was his name and he was the guy?
Probably not.
When you look at your towns that you live in and you see, like Henderson and Jacksonville, right?
These guys were big deals and named cities after themselves and we barely know them.
7:52
And you probably have areas in your city that you would you would aspire to have a street named after you, right?
Or an entire county named after you.
Clark County, right.
But no one knows who Clark.
I don't know.
Clark is, right.
I live here and so I think a lot of times we inflate the micro importance of things when in reality they aren't important at all and we just choose to make them meaningful.
8:13
First off we have to be aware of the levers of meaning that exist and then once you're aware of them you can start moving them in your favour and then looking at your current conditions through different lenses and say what would this mean if it were amazing?
What would the conditions have to be in order for this to be an awesome thing?
And then all of a sudden you just exit the game of Happy Sad and get to be your own game maker.
8:34
At least that's what I tried to do when I get upset, look at it, pull it apart thing like, is this real?
Is this true?
And then go from there.
I get asked about mindset a lot on podcast.
They're like, you have a unique view of the world, Alex.
And to me it's weird because it's just how I see the world.
8:50
And so I don't.
To me it doesn't feel unique.
It feels like how it is to me in general.
And so I have trouble sometimes articulating it because to me, I expect that everyone else is thinking that way when sometimes it I was surprised that they weren't.
And so the first time this came out was on the Iced Coffee Hour podcast where they talked about just different views I had on things which apparently were contrarian, which I didn't know.
9:10
And so it generated a lot of kind of press and media around it.
And so my team said, hey, do you think you could make a video just specifically around meanings since you talk about it so much with us?
And so this, although short, is my best attempt to give you 3 different scenarios that I used to create and destroy meaning in my own life that helped me decrease my stress, increase the decrease the emotional affect I have to circumstances so that I can make better decisions in my life.
9:33
And so I think the reason that people struggle with this a lot is because they try to control the uncontrollable.
They ascribe their feelings to things that they are reactive to, which means if this.
So they create these equations for themselves.
If this happens, I'll be angry.
9:49
If this happens, I'll be upset.
If this happens, I'll be, I'll be stressed.
And so their life is just a series of piano keys that are being played on their emotions and they have no control.
Whereas if you can flip the script and make it so that you were the one who writes what that equation is, then you can change what the keys mean.
10:09
So even though it's high on the keyboard over here, it turns out low over here when you hear it because you're the one who's setting what that key means rather than taking whatever the external circumstances.
So if people treat have to treat you a certain way for you to be happy, then it means that your happiness is in their hands.
10:28
If you have to have of job raise or amount of income every month that you have to make in order to be fulfilled, then you set up circumstances for yourself to not be fulfilled, right?
And so we want to make, at least in my opinion, the feelings that we have, we want to derive them off of circumstances that we can control.
10:49
And then what happens is then you create the shell around yourself.
Not realistically, but because internally is where your emotions are being generated.
Now, is anyone doing this perfectly?
No.
But simply being aware of the fact that these piano keys are being played.
But we are the ones who get to assign what the sound is internally.
11:07
Gives you a lot more control over your own perception of life and the conditions that are presented to you.








0:00
I just gave a guest lesser last week at University of Texas for a class on entrepreneurship.
There are some people here who don't try for.
One of the key questions that many of the Spire entrepreneurs in the classroom asked is what should I sell?
First off, we have to define what are the actual things that can be sold.
0:16
And this may sound crazy, but there's actually fewer of them than you think.
And there's digital and physical formats of each of these things, which actually give you 14 different things you can possibly sell.
Once I define those, I'll talk about how we can increase the scale of the deliverable that we have using something that I call the delivery Cube.
0:33
Number one is you can sell products.
You could sell a physical product, which would be like I sell water bottles.
A digital product would be something like a PDF.
The second category is services.
So this is stuff you do for other people in the physical realm.
A service would be a massage, mowing someone's lawn, fixing someone's car.
0:51
On the digital side, oftentimes that service is something that happens in the digital space.
So if you are an ad agency and you make ads, the ad itself that you're making is a service.
Also, buying media is a service.
All of those things would be digital services.
Category three, you have access.
1:07
Visual access is like you lease a building, you gain access to the building.
Digital access is you gain access to a library of digital content like Netflix.
Category 4 is attention.
You can sell or buy physical attention that could be like a billboard.
1:22
Cars physically drive past it and see it to the same degree.
Facebook and Google have digital attention and they sell the eyeballs and the attention of that audience.
Category 5, like the hurricane, is risk selling insurance.
But you can insure a building but you can also insure against in the digital from a cyber threat.
1:41
If you're an established business owner and you sell physical products or even services, you can sell the risk associated with it, which is like insuring the products.
So some people give guarantees, but you can actually get people to pay for a guarantee, which is insurance.
Just like Apple Care is just paid for insurance, the next thing you can buy or sell is money itself.
2:00
The entire banking industry is predicated on buying and selling money and the rate they charge is the interest itself.
And so you can have physical money, right, Like the actual U.S. dollars.
You also have digital money, which not going to get into crypto, but that is a form of digital money.
Category 7 is an endorsement or brand in the physical world.
2:18
I say, hey, you can use my logo on your shirt and you give me a percentage of all your sales.
In the digital world, when they sell a check mark on Instagram, that is selling an endorsement, it's selling a brand, it's selling some sort of status that gets transferred and a fee is paid as a result of that.
2:34
One of the key points here is that it can be a combination of those categories.
So if someone sells a rock concert, for example, you're selling access to an experience, but you might also sell drinks and T-shirts while you're there.
Now you might record it and then also sell the digital versions of that.
See what I'm going with here In terms of picking which one to sell, it's mostly going to come down to two things.
2:53
One is the resources you have and your skills value experience.
If you're a first time entrepreneur, then you're like, well, I don't have any other experience, but you actually do and let me hear me out.
Your parents did something.
And if you don't have parents, the people who raised you did something.
And if no one raised you, people you knew did something and you were around them.
3:11
So, like, for example, my mom is a doctor, she's an eye surgeon.
So I know a lot of stuff about eyes.
That would be a category of stuff that I actually know a lot more about than you might expect.
If your dad was a mechanic, you probably know what a carburetor is.
I have no idea what it is.
I've heard the word before.
Often times you've had little odd jobs, like when I was in high school, I was a blender tenor and then I did catering at an Orthodox Jewish company.
3:32
You probably know a lot of stuff.
Just from osmosis of being around it, we have these seven things, digital and physical.
Is there any one of these that I already have a little bit more experience with?
And then of those things, which problem is the biggest that I think I can solve given the resources that I have access to, what I was talking about with this entrepreneurship group is that they had $100 to start their business.
3:52
Now that would probably preclude you from most physical products, probably most kind of digital like software type stuff.
And so most of the time you're going to start selling your time, which is often services.
Here's the person I provide the most value to for the least amount of money.
To me, that's where your sweet spot is as the first or next thing that I would probably package and sell.
4:12
Once you've established that, how can I enhance or make it more or less valuable or more or less profitable for me as business owner?
The delivery cube has six pieces to it.
That's eight six.
Number one is, can I deliver this thing one to one in a small group?
Can I deliver it one to many?
4:29
Each of these have different value propositions that are associated with them.
If you sold semi private group stuff, it's a small group of five people doing something that's different than doing a webinar to 1000 people at once versus having a call review system where you review someone's calls to give them feedback one-on-one.
4:45
The 2nd frame of the delivery cube is do it yourself DIYDWY, which is done with you as in you're holding their hand through the process of whatever it is you're doing or done for you where you do all of the work yourself and you sell them a final product or some final outcome.
Each of these give you different levels of scale.
5:00
Do it yourself.
You can sell unlimited.
Now typically the value is smaller.
Done with you.
You have in between the two extremes of do it yourself and done for you.
Done for you is the most expensive, typically sometimes the easiest to sell.
But one of the hardest things to deliver on the 3rd frame is what level of support am I going to do and specifically on what medium Am I going to offer support via chat?
5:21
Am I going to offer support via e-mail?
Am I going to offer support via phone call?
Is it going to be zoom call?
These are all different ways that I can support whatever The thing is that I'm selling.
Obviously if I do e-mail support going to be significantly more scalable, it will probably also be significantly less valuable than somebody who's real time available to hop on a zoom call whenever they want.
5:39
Filter #4 is how do I want them to consume the thing.
They could consume it visually, they consume it audio wise, They could consume it live.
They consume a recording.
They could consume it visually via text.
So there's different ways we can have people consume some sort of thing.
Whatever it is, anything that's live is typically going to be perceived as more valuable and if it's in person and live, probably the most valuable and probably the least scalable.
6:00
On the flip side, if I did something that was recorded and was digital, it would be the most scalable but probably the least valuable.
The 5th lens is the speed and convenience of whatever we're delivering.
This comes down to multiple things.
One, is it 24 hours a day or is it just nine to five Frame 2 is how many days a week am I maintaining, retaining that level of service?
6:21
3 is, how fast is that response?
So I might be open 24 hours a day, but I have responses that are guaranteed in 24 hours, which is different than saying I'm open nine to five, five days a week, but I respond within 3 minutes.
And the ultimate extremes are either you're overstaffed, but your customers don't have to wait, you incur inefficiency so that they have convenience, or they incur the inefficiency and all of your staff is 100% utilized because they're going call to call to call all day long.
6:47
Different strategies.
There's wildly successful companies that do both.
Frame 6 is what I like to call the 10X to 110th test.
If I charge 10 times more for my current thing, what would I have to change about my thing that I sell in order for it to be worth 10 times more?
7:02
This ultimately gets me thinking in much bigger ways about how much value I would need to provide.
Let's say I go from a $10,000 thing to $100,000 thing.
That still would be profitable at a $10,000 thing.
It just makes me think differently because I now have to justify my $100,000 price tag.
7:18
The flip side of that is equally powerful, which is if I had to deliver the same or even more value than I currently AM, but I could only charge 110th the price that I currently AM, what else would I do that would be perceived as valuable but would not cost me enough so I could still justify 110th the price but maintain my value.
7:37
This gives me a very good starting point to both figure out what the first thing I might want to sell is and then how can I scale it and make it more profitable and or more valuable to my end consumer.
And think through the ratio of how many people I would need internally my company to facilitate that.
And so this is what I was explaining with the University of Texas.
7:54
And if this was interesting to you, we actually have the entire full lecture in QA, the links somewhere around here.
I'm sure it'll be available to you.
If you want to watch the whole thing, go click there and check it out.





0:00
$100 billion company.
This is a pretty exciting time for entrepreneurship.
You're at that point in your stage like this gets important.
The cost of failure of starting a Business Today is by far the lowest has ever been.
Business advice to hardly 10 years ago.
You've got one thing you can tell welcome everybody to the game.
0:18
I got a special episode for you guys today.
As you know, I do not have many guests on my podcast.
I don't like sharing the spotlight.
So if somebody's going to be on, they've got to be really, really special and have true expertise to give.
And I think the person that I have with me today or that will be joining us today definitely meets that in spades.
0:39
And so Harley is a God amongst men, a legend in in the making and runs a a small company, you may not have heard of it Shopify, which right now is a publicly traded company.
It's worth right now.
0:55
I think it was 80 billion if I'm not mistaken.
Probably correct me there.
Closer to AI think it's closer to 100 billion but.
Yeah, that was 20 billion.
You just, you just rammed it down by $20 billion, which for someone like me, like, you know, this is like, I I don't come from this world.
This is, you know, I'm a I'm a tourist here.
1:11
That's a lot of money.
So $100 billion company, so that's so 1010 figures is a billion 1112 a 12 figure company.
There you go.
And just the only thing that rivals the the business success that he has is just the humility that he brings to it.
1:30
He was willing to hop on a call with me before this and we hit it off and I was like I just, I know my audience would love to talk to you or and and just kind of hear your perspective of entrepreneurship.
And you have such an interesting story that I think will relate to so many people in my audience from the people who are just trying to figure out what they want to do to make money all the way to, you know, right now the 20% of my audience is, you know, winning entrepreneurs with you know large companies and and so forth.
1:57
So we definitely have the gamut from an entrepreneurship perspective, kind of beginning, middle and end.
And yeah.
So thank you so much for taking the time to join us today.
It's.
A great honor to be here, Alex.
Thank you so much.
I'm a big fan of the POD, and I think what you're doing is making business and entrepreneurship, I mean, very similar to the Mission Chava.
2:13
You're making it more accessible.
And I think that is the coolest thing in the world, this idea that business was out of touch for most people both financially from a capital perspective or because of knowledge and insight and experience.
I think those days are long over and I think we're going through an entrepreneurial renaissance right now.
2:30
And I think we have people like you and and and your your community is leading the way on in that front.
Well, I appreciate it.
And I mean everything that we do is just for everybody on the pod is, I know Harley and I agree on this, is to just try and break down as many barriers between where people are and where they want to be, right.
2:47
A lot of people have this vision for their lives they want and there are things to get in their way.
Some of them are between your ears, some of them between your hands and keyboard.
And so Shopify has taken a lot of that between hands and keyboard out of the way that decrease the friction of actually getting a product launch, get it online, actually get customers.
So you can do it from anywhere in the world, which is again something that 30 years ago just wasn't really a thing and now everyone can have access to this stuff.
3:09
So I'm going to go, I'm going to kind of break this pod into three kind of sections loosely.
So first kind of chunk I want to talk about looking back and I think that'll that'll relate to a lot of people who are listening or watching right now.
Kind of like 0 to hero like what What got you to hear?
3:26
And all the things that that that come with that second chunk we'll go over what's hero to to superhero by like what is, what's the what's forward look like what's the future look what do you see And I'll dive into some more you know specific details around that stuff.
And then at the very end we'll go kind of like final Nuggets and wrapping it up of of like forward and backwards what are kind of like the principles and truths that that you would try and pass on to the people who are listening.
3:49
Cool, let's do it.
That's our road map.
So I know a little bit about the story but my audience doesn't.
So you have this really unique thing of being employee one and customer one.
Can you walk us through like just the beginning of Shopify, like even the decision to jump into Shopify, what what the risks that were associated with that, what was life prior to that?
4:11
And then like what were the, the, the, the factors that got you into that step one, because I think that's where a lot of people are right now.
Yeah, so I was born in Montreal.
I was born in Canada.
I moved to South Florida with my parents and my sisters when I was very young.
I was always entrepreneurial.
4:28
My parents did not have a lot of money, but my father, to his credit, my dad's an immigrant.
He came to Canada from Hungary in the revolution.
My grandparents are Holocaust survivors.
And we are, you know, we were, we were poor immigrants.
And although my dad never had much money to give me because I always had these little silly business ideas when I was a kid, what my dad did for me, which was very valuable, was even like when I was like 10 years old.
4:51
Every silly business idea that I had, he would validate it by actually making me these business cards that would say the name of the business and my name on it.
And I I'm now a dad.
I have two daughters, Bailey and Zoe who are five and seven.
And now that I think about parenting and stuff, I'm I'm like, I I think a lot more about that, that story and those stories of my father making those business cards because at the time it didn't seem that profound And in hindsight now is, you know, a father myself, I realized these small things that we do for our kids had this massive impact.
5:21
And so even though these business were all very silly, you know, trading like trading cards and lemonade stands and eventually a DJ business, when I was 13 years old, I was always an entrepreneurial kid.
And partially was because I thought entrepreneurship was this fun activity.
Like, I I wasn't really into sports playing them or watching them.
5:39
I wasn't really into video games.
I was kind of into like this idea of like, you know, selling something.
And that was always fun for me.
Moved to South Florida, went finished high school there and moved back to Canada when I was seventeen, 2001, to go to McGill University.
McGill is in Montreal, where where I live now.
5:55
I went to McGill because it was cheap, My parents didn't have much money and so because I was born in Canada, I kind of got this like in state tuition thing unfortunately very quickly.
And once I moved to to Montreal to sort of McGill, my dad got into some trouble and our family lost everything.
6:12
And once again, I sort of, you know, pulled out this tool that I'd been tinkering with throughout my life called entrepreneurship to to make some money.
I started T-shirt business when I was at McGill, made T-shirts for a bunch of universities across Canada, like the promotional T-shirts you got the first day of school, Frost, frosch or orientation stuff.
6:30
And I loved it.
It was great.
I wasn't necessarily passionate about T-shirts, but I I love this sort of idea of of of being being able to support myself and and help my my family.
I was really.
Can I get?
On this real quick, because I think I'm sure.
Absolutely jump in any way you want.
The.
6:46
The the point that Harley just made, I just want to underline, which is that the first business he had one.
I don't think that you thought this was going to be the business I will have for the rest of my life.
This is my dream.
This is my vision.
You were trying to make money, right?
And I think a lot of people who are aspiring are trying to find this like perfect puzzle piece that's going to fit all of these things.
7:06
It's going to be my passion.
It's going to be fulfilling.
It can be the next Amazon when a lot of times I think it's a big fallacy because the first business just gives you a little bit of like to show you.
The next step to take is because you learn a bunch of stuff from that first business.
And so I just want to just take the pause for the audience that everyone's like.
7:22
I got to find the perfect thing when promo shirts for freshmen and sophomores.
It ain't glamorous.
Right, it's.
It's it's it's not glamorous.
And in fact, the only unfair advantage that I had was that I was selling T-shirts to a customer who was who I also was part of the demographic meeting, like I was selling T-shirts to the student council, treasurer or procurement office so they can give them out to students.
7:46
And I myself was a student.
And so the pitch that I made was that one, I very low overhead because it's just me.
I was, I was the CEO and the janitor.
I was, I was printing T-shirts myself.
So one, I'm going to be cheaper.
Two, I'm going to care a lot because I really need this to work.
And three, I'm going to make T-shirts for people like me.
8:03
And so I I kind of know what your students want because I myself and one of your students.
But just to go step back because I think it's super interesting.
So I sort of skipped over this.
But when I was 13 years old, the the business that really got start like started being entrepreneurship, a real business was again, I was 13.
8:19
So, you know, I wouldn't put too much, you know, credence on the fact there's a real business.
But it was a real thing was I wanted to be a DJI was, I'm Jewish.
I went to a lot of bar mitzvahs when I was 13 years old.
And I thought the DJs were the coolest people in the world.
They were sort of magicians in my mind.
8:35
They would take a group of people that were sitting down eating some rubber chicken dinner in some hotel ballroom and like 3 minutes later using their voice and using lighting and and music, there'd be a conga line.
I just thought they were just they were like magicians.
I called around a bunch of DJ companies to ask them if they would hire me and of course they said no because I was 13, had no experience and and didn't know how to DJ.
8:58
But because I had to sort of you know like silly confidence that that these business cards had provided for me.
I had this idea to start my own DJ company and hire myself.
So that was sort of when this idea of entrepreneurship as a tool to solve problems was sort of cemented in my, in my very, you know, immature young brain.
9:17
And then when I needed to make money again at 17 as an undergrad in college, I once again, I didn't even think about, you know, I should go get a job somewhere.
Immediately my thought was, all right, I got to start another business to make some money here.
So it began to I I began to form this what what is now effectively my shining a Shopify's mission.
9:34
It's also my personal mission, which is an entrepreneurship is this incredibly powerful tool because it's democratic and it allows anyone and anybody around to start something with very little.
It doesn't matter who you are, what your last name is, and and who your parents are.
My parents were nobody's.
It matters how much value you add.
9:52
And so I ran this teacher business all throughout college and developed a really good set of mentors along the way, people that I'd sort of met, and some people were lawyers and others were these random entrepreneurs.
And you know, Dov Charney from American Apparel.
Now he's sort of, I guess, disgraced.
But at the time, he was a very big deal, starting American Apparel.
10:10
He was another Jewish entrepreneur from Montreal.
And I met these people along the way.
And one of those, one of those mentors convinced me to, when I finished college, to go to law school, not to become a lawyer, but rather to become a better entrepreneur, almost like finishing school for entrepreneurship.
10:27
And I was incredibly impressionable.
I was 21 when I was finishing college.
Again, I had a little bit of money from the T-shirts, but not much.
And he said, look, I'm going to teach law next year at the University of Ottawa, which is the capital of Canada.
Why don't you come to Ottawa, go to law school here, I'll be in town.
10:43
I can sort of help you navigate the city and and you'll go to law school not with the mandate to to to get called to the bar or ever litigate or practice law, but rather as a way to accumulate more skills that will be very valuable as you think about scaling a business longer term. 2005 moved to Ottawa, no friends, no family there.
11:02
And by this point entrepreneurship was a part of my, you know, my identity.
And so, like I always did when I moved to a new place, I I asked where the entrepreneurs hung out.
And very, very fortunately, very luckily, I was directed to a coffee shop.
And I was told that there's a group of entrepreneurs that hung out at this coffee shop every Friday evening, and they called themselves the Young Entrepreneurs Club.
11:25
The YEC and I started showing up there every Friday and meeting these young entrepreneurs.
And one of those entrepreneurs was this brilliant programmer named Toby, who had just moved to Canada, I think a couple about a year earlier from Germany.
11:40
And he moved to Canada because he met a girl and he wanted to go be close to that girl her.
Name is as all people move for that reason, right?
Very good.
Very good reason.
Love is always a good reason to move somewhere and Toby had moved to Canada from Germany, didn't have papers to work and so he was told that even as a new immigrant he could start a business.
11:56
And being in Canada where it's very cold, a lot of snow, he loves snowboarding.
He decided he wants to build a snowboard shop on the Internet.
In 2005 there were two ways to sell a product on the Internet.
The 1st way was to sell it through a marketplace at the time like eBay was really the more the the most prominent one.
12:15
Amazon.
I don't think of the time alive for 3rd party sellers.
It was still a first party marketplace.
So you had eBay and you had a bunch of these sort of very nichy marketplaces, but eBay being the big one.
So you could sell on a marketplace or you would pay a company like IBM, they had Web Sphere or Oracle or AT or or SAP.
12:34
All these big enterprise companies had some sort of e-commerce functionality for very large enterprises for like Walmart and and that would be like a couple 1,000,000 bucks.
And Toby did not like the idea of of renting customers from a marketplace and he did not like the idea of well he didn't have $1,000,000 to spend on on enterprise software, so that was impossible.
12:53
So he wrote this piece of software using Ruby on Rails where he was a sort of core developer, Ruby on Rails in the early days with DHH and a bunch of really interesting people.
And he wrote this piece of software to sell his snowboards, and that's runtime where I met him.
He was like just selling these snowboards.
13:08
And it was it was a really neat little business.
He was making real money and around that and and and again I was, I'm in law school now and so I'd asked him if I can use the software to sell my own, my own products, which in my case would be T-shirts.
And by that point he'd already sort of figured out that the snowboard business was a good idea.
13:25
But the software that he'd written to sell these snowboards was a great idea and and and shortly thereafter I ended up building a store on Shopify.
This is 2006 at the time and I became one of the first people to use what would become at the time it was called Jaded.
Pixel wasn't actually called Shopify originally and I would be one of the first people to use the software and I built this.
13:46
I I ran this T-shirt businesses direct to consumer licensed T-shirt business all throughout law school and and that was sort of my first entry into into Shopify meeting Toby and then when I finished finished law grad school I called Toby and said look like I love entrepreneurship it's it's everything I I think it's it's the greatest thing for me it's my passion my hobby I wanted I want to increase the surface area for more people and honestly what I experienced building a beautiful scalable store sitting in my tax law class on Shopify I think more people should experience that and and I joined him about a year later in in 2009 or so and I was like the first non engineer to join the company and it was amazing it was one of the greatest I mean I've just it was I've really fond memories of those very girly days but that's a long answer short question of how I got to Shopify.
14:41
No, this is perfect because that's, this is a great pause point because there I was writing down some notes just for the audience and then I went to definitely, we're going to go from like, OK, you're now in Shopify and what are the trials and tribulations?
Because of course, I'm sure going from that to 100 billion was probably just straight line, very smooth sailing.
14:58
You haven't had any issues.
And I'm sure everyone will be glad to hear that very short story, but we'll get to that one.
But just everyone who's listening, #1 the first business that Harley started was just for money.
And it wasn't just some magical thing that was going to be perfect.
He did what he had to do and he learned a ton of skills that are really valuable along the way.
15:16
Second thing is that, and I want to emphasize this, is people want a lot of times are like, man, I don't know what to sell or what business should I start.
And I think the easiest one to use is just solve your own problem, scratch your own inch.
But like almost every business I've had, well every, every really good business I've had has come from that, which is like, like I mean even the, the, the furthest one we have now because it's not common, it's a family office and I wish I had had this available to me when I was scaling up our companies like somebody had already been there, sold multiple times and like had a vested interest etcetera.
15:44
But scratching your own itch.
Also I want to highlight some people kind of get segmented in one thing or the other like you did a physical products business but earlier you've done a DJ thing even though it was not.
Yeah, you made money, so you made a profit and so like in my mind like self-employed, whatever, like it was a service based business.
So you had a service business and you also had the physical product was.
16:01
So you were flexible in terms of how you're willing to make money?
I was, I was agnostic to what I was selling.
I mean to your point, you know, I, I, I think one of the easiest ways to figure out what to sell you, you know, you said scratch your own itch.
Another way to do it is simply just to like tell a bunch of people that you're thinking of starting a business and just leave it out in the ether.
16:19
The reason that I started selling T-shirts universities was as I told people that my dad wasn't around anymore.
Mom had no money.
I needed to make some money.
I need sort of business.
The more people like I spoke to about that a lot of the ideas that I got were dumb but but more and more people started telling me, hey, what about this?
16:35
Hey, what about that?
Most of the things that they mentioned were not great ideas.
But then someone randomly his name is Jamie once told told me remember this like they perfectly clear.
He said, hey, just so you know, McGill spends $25,000 a semester on on T-shirts, on printed lice, on printed promotional T-shirts.
16:54
It turned out he was wrong.
These universities spent a quarter $1,000,000 has.
To be way harder than that, right?
But because I was putting it out there, this thing that I was looking sort of business a bunch of people sort of became almost like my my my idea generation machine.
17:10
And so this whole idea that like I I know there's there's a lot out there about like don't tell people your goals and and and and keep things to yourself.
I I call bullshit.
I think do things and tell people is super important, even at the early stages of starting these things.
Well, I'm a big, I mean my second book $100 million leads advertising is the process of making known.
17:28
And so if no one knows about your stuff, no one can buy it.
They must first know about it in order to buy it.
And so if you just think about it from a first principles perspective, ain't no customers if they don't know.
So first wouldn't do that.
So two things that I also want to highlight.
So you talked about two different types of people that you surround yourself with.
17:44
One was mentors.
So just for everyone in my audience, we're talking people ahead, right.
And the other thing was the community of peers right here at the coffee shop where we met Toby, who ultimately, you know, got got you into this thing again by chance.
But both of those things increase your lux surface area, the amount of different potential opportunities for exposing opportunity.
18:01
Well, yeah.
And so I just want to highlight that because a lot of people feel like entrepreneurship is lonely.
And it can be, but to a degree, it is a choice, right.
And if you can't physically move environments, you can do it online now.
And that wasn't available back then.
But now we've got online communities, we've got school, we've got, you know, all these things where people can connect.
18:19
And when I say school skol.com, school people can actually connect and meet one another, all right.
Now the last one is resourcefulness.
This kind of ties well into kind of the next, the next chapter of this journey, which is that like you did all this stuff like you, Toby wrote code so that he could so he could sell his snowboards, right?
18:43
Like it's there's just there's a there's this whole like everything.
Of course our whole mission is to make things easier, make things more accessible to people.
But on some level, like, it's the fact that it becomes difficult.
Is what makes the goal worthwhile, right?
And if if everyone could do it, then everyone would do it and then it would no longer be worthy, right?
19:01
Everyone can tie their shoes.
Everyone can get dressed.
And so no one's like, congratulations, There's this whole, I think Chris Rock skit where he's like, what do you want a cookie?
He's like, man, I ain't never been.
He's like, you ain't supposed to go to jail, right?
And he goes through this whole thing.
And so right now, like, the fact that it's difficult, it's just another barrier that somebody might have to compete with or have to go over.
19:18
And so it gives yourself a little stripe that you can show yourself about who you really are, all right.
Also remember, remember this, he's going to think about like you kind of go back to, I don't know, go back 200 years.
When you think about starting a business, the one thing that besides capital to get started and knowledge and understanding and technology to help you do it, forget all that stuff for a second.
19:39
One of the big risks of starting a business historically was that the cost of failure could affect your life in a very adverse way.
Meaning when my grandfather came to North America from Eastern Europe, he started an egg business.
He had a little egg stall at at at a local farmers market which actually still stands today.
19:57
My uncle currently runs it, but he had to take a loan out on his home in order to afford the the fee and the the cost of actually renting this particular stall if this did not work.
The result of that would be no food on the table, no roof over their head.
20:16
And that is that is effectively how businesses were built.
So that people with more capital were able to take more risks, people that had more capital were able to invest more, people that had more capital were able to have, you know, be able to mitigate the cost of failure.
Well, one thing that has changed dramatically and I would say today, like literally right now, Alex, you and I are talking about this, the cost of failure of starting a Business Today is by far the lowest it's ever been.
20:41
Whether you use a product like Shopify or use whatever you decide to do, the cost of failure is effectively $39.00.
If it works, you scale it literally like 3 feet from me, I have.
I was a gift from Ben Francis, who's the founder of Jim Shark, and it's a Christmas gift he gave me, a holiday gift he gave me.
20:59
It's the original screen print from the original Gym shark.
The first T-shirt he made it was it was me.
Ben's been a big part of my life and I've been big a big part of his life.
And so his gift was the original screen that created the first T-shirt for Gym shark.
When Ben started, it was 2012 out of his dorm room.
21:17
If it would have gone, if it would have failed, would have gone back to class.
I mean, he was literally also delivering pizzas, I think for Pizza Hut at the time, if I get that right, or some some pizza company.
But if it worked, he would go on to build a multibillion dollar company called Jim Shark.
21:33
So think about that, the upside and that was 2012, that was like, you know, 12 years ago.
The upside today of starting a business is effectively infinite growth.
If you do it well and you're smart and you're adding great value.
The downside is a couple less cups of coffee or a couple of Starbucks for that week.
21:50
That is remarkable.
And I think that, I mean if there's anything that like if there's one underlying point here, it's the, it's risk adjusted return, right, is that everyone here now can get endless shots on goal right now because of how accessible entrepreneurship is.
You basically just keep taking lottery tickets and if you lose, then you just buy another scratch off, right?
22:11
And you try it again.
And so you still have the upside, except The thing is is it's not rigged for you to lose.
Like there actually is a lot of people who want you to win and there's an entire economy around you.
Well, not just that.
Right now what that's created is nearly a quarter, 25% of US consumers in 2024 are considering starting a business.
22:28
That's the highest I believe it's ever been, #2 is since 2021, there's been 15.5 million new business applications in the US, an 85% increase from 2004 to 2021.
The White House put out a bunch of stats on this recently.
22:44
I mean that is the reason that is happening is not just because technology is getting better and not just because of great podcast like, like and and content like you're putting out there.
It's because people are realizing entrepreneurship may be the vehicle for them to actually find their life's work, make their life better, create independence, but like do the thing that they love most.
23:03
That this is a pretty exciting time for entrepreneurship and I think the cost of failure thing is a big part of it.
So now you're employee number one, non non developer employee number one.
You've you've used the product, you fell in love with it and this is now aligned with your calling.
23:20
So walk me through kind of the stages of growth and I'll just if you can give kind of like internal, external.
So this is what's happening externally maybe revenue levels, customer levels things like that and then mirrored what does that look like internally so that I'm shifting a little bit towards my, my business owners right now.
23:35
All right.
So now we're talking like OK we've got the business we're we're we're generating revenue or is it cash flow positive, do they have investor like how, how, what's?
Yeah, just give me the the scoop.
So we were bootstrapped.
We had a very, very small Angel investor in early on which his name is John, he's he's now a multi billionaire I believe and so was his wife separately because she also put some money in but it was a very small amount of money.
24:02
We were bootstrapped.
We were profitable and we we when I joined we didn't have a CFO, we didn't have a CMOI mean part of what I viewed my role as and and anyone who's listening who is joining a very early stage company as a non engineer like the person not running you know writing code or or building product.
24:24
The the role that I wanted to that I felt I should play and that I think I did play was the Swiss army knife.
Let me figure out everything and anything that is going to be valuable to the people that are writing code and whether that's commercialization or sales or support or I mean literally figuring out like where we're going to like work out of like like figure negotiating the lease for it or figuring out you know what are we, who are we paying for.
24:47
And I think we're paying Rackspace at the time like negotiating A Rackspace contract.
I think at the time we only had one payment integration which was PayPal negotiating the PayPal Rev share In those very early days, this sort of Swiss Army knife type model I think was really, really important because I mean the the you can be the greatest salesperson or marketer in the world if you have a great product matched with a great ability to sell and commercialize.
25:13
That's where this thing gets really interesting.
And I deeply believe that Shopify even back you know in 2010 had this incredible product leaps and bounds better than all the competition.
The competition at the time was like Yahoo stores or a couple other like that, but very, very few competitors.
25:29
And so this idea of being a Swiss Army knife was important and that's what I did.
I, you know, if there was an opportunity for me to tell the story publicly to a local newspaper in in Ottawa, Canada, I would take that opportunity.
If there's an opportunity for me to help someone get a job done internally, I would take that opportunity.
25:45
But that Swiss Army knife was that that sort of model of that was very, very helpful and and as part of that I think I earned the trust of of Toby in particular but but also you know the the other engineers because I was just there to add value that's it.
26:02
In fact I'd, I'd actually been called to the bar and so I think my like I was, I was also the company's lawyer and again I I've been out of law school for all of 10 months I think at that point.
But whatever I could do, I was going to do that And it was only a couple years later we we raised our Series A about a year later I think it was a $7,000,000 investment from Bessemer who let it on a $25 million I think post And then and that's really when we began to realize that OK there is a real there there that this company could be something remarkable, large, scalable and we can really make a dent on.
26:37
At the time it was really, but we were focused on SM, BS and e-commerce only very different than today where we do business of all sizes and retail everywhere.
But it was SMB's and and and it was, it was ecommerce only And it was only until you know after our series B&C that we began really figuring out like okay, what what are each other's superpowers.
26:57
And and this idea of rather than all of us become these sort of well-rounded objects, these sort of river stones.
What if we were all were very precise on the thing that we think we could be the best in the world at and spend our time?
And you start doing that.
So if we're walking through this 'cause right now.
Probably probably like around Series B or Series C we began, we hired ACFO, we hired ACMO, we hired ahead of sales.
27:19
It was around that time where we felt we were well capitalized.
I think our our Series B was about a hundred $100 million valuation.
This is like 2013 or so.
And around that time don't I have, no, I mean it was, yeah, I'm not sure a lot less than than $100 million.
27:37
Employees were around then just I'm just trying to.
Get probably probably 50 to 100 at that point.
OK.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
OK.
Got it.
So like small mid sized.
Got it.
Yeah, OK.
Cool.
And.
And a lot of what we were trying to do then is like find, you know, find at least a lot of how I spend my time is find new channels, this idea that, OK, we can only sell so many people on Shopify.
27:56
But there's this massive ecosystem at web agencies and freelancers and developers who are in Oklahoma and are in, you know, places like South America, and they're in Singapore and they're in Vancouver and they're in, you know, New Mexico.
28:11
And what if we actually created something whereby if someone walked in to their agency, to their business and said I need an online store, what could we do to actually make it so that they would say by default, great, we'll build it on Shopify, that's sort of on the referral side.
On the product side.
28:28
Another thing that was really quick that we created around that time was the Shopify App Store, which I believe today is one of the largest ecosystems of third party developers on the planet.
I mean if you were building an app for commerce today, if the best, most effective go to market strategy is to put in the Shopify App Store because you have millions of of customers for your applications that that now seems you know polished and and a really healthy kind of flywheel of an ecosystem.
28:54
But originally the reason that the App Store was really set up was all these different merchants were coming to us and they all had a very unique and and and a very particular business.
And so we really focused on let's make Shopify Score offering what most people need most of the time, check out payments, inventory, marketing analytics, let's make that like world class.
29:15
But everything that is very specific to a particular merchants business, let's invite third parties from all over the world to build apps on top of it.
Which meant that no matter what the particular needs your business might be, you would find 100% product market fit using Shopify.
Because this app ecosystem and we didn't have to build everything our self which would have been impossible.
29:35
And so some of these things now in hindsight seem like, wow, it's Shopify ecosystem is really cool and the App Store is, is, is is is humming.
But originally it was done because we couldn't build every feature ourself, nor nor should we.
So what were some of the like?
Absolute key decisions or like business principles that you learned kind of scaling through this.
29:54
Focus was really important not being everything to everyone.
I mean today you know last week was was the National Retail Federation's big show, literally like the most important conference in enterprise retail.
And I I sit on the board now of NRF with like the likes of the CEO of of you know Brian from Target and John from Walmart and like you know these amazing people like that that run effectively all, all of retail all all over the world.
30:20
And so now we're really obviously you know getting some of the biggest retailers to Shopify.
But there was absolutely no way we were even considering that in those days because fundamentally we wanted to win our particular market which was SM, BS in in English speaking countries that want to sell on the Internet.
30:38
And so one thing that was really valuable was like focus, don't source.
And a lot of our competitors by the way ended up going out of business because they kind of ran up market way too soon and they left the entire base of SMBs available.
They didn't like the idea that SMBs, you know some churn and not every business succeeds.
30:55
And we thought, well, what if we just slightly increase the chance of success and mitigated the risk if every single person thinking about starting a business like in the in the shower in the morning then did so with Shopify, even though not all will succeed, as long as the ones that do stay with us indefinitely, they will offset the cost of ones that leave.
31:16
And so one was really making sure we were very, very focused.
The second thing that was really important to us I think was that the product was super simple.
And you know, now companies like, I don't know, Mars or or Mattel or Staples or, you know, Glossier, Aloe Yoga View or all these amazing brands.
31:36
All you Shopify skims like what's neat even today, but Shopify is that the complexity of the product almost reveals it's over time.
Rather than simply being inundated with every single feature and functionality, Shopify can be used by someone just setting up a store at their mom's kitchen table.
31:52
It also can be used by Trina, who runs FIGS, which is a publicly traded company.
They make uniform scrubs, uniform scrubs, hospital scrubs and and the fact that the same code base can make those things was something that was always important to keep it really, really simple and a credit to Toby and his sort of vision around product because that's really what he he drilled in all of us was that the the product has to be incredibly simple.
32:16
So first his focus, second is simplicity.
And the third one was we really tried to run a really tight business, meaning we knew what our sort of CAC to LTV ratio is.
So cost of customer acquisition on one side versus lifetime value.
And as long I don't know if you're, I want to make sure I define all the acronyms, acronyms.
32:36
So we knew what our CAC to LTV ratio was and once we got it above one effectively it meant that OK, now it's time to go raise money because the more dollars you put on the left side, the more dollar 80s or whatever the ratio was we got on on on the right side.
And so by being meticulous and thoughtful about that, I think it was really helpful.
32:55
Maybe the last thing I'll say which seems a little bit soft but it's important to say is we were really, really like patient meaning we want like even today we we want to build 100 year business.
We're now about 20 years into it.
We had 80 years left to go, but even then we were you know 5810 years in.
33:11
We still thought about this like really long term business focused which meant that we were not willing to pull forward future profits at a discount like pretty much most of our competitors.
I think we're doing at that point.
So what were, what were some of the key growth kind of levers that you were able to pool throughout this process that like really accelerated?
33:33
Like if you had to name the three biggest things in the 1st 10 years of Shopify that like, man, if we hadn't done this, we wouldn't have been able to get to the next level.
I mean I think the App Store, the ecosystem was really important both on making sure the product had a product had 100% product market fit and also in the referral.
So I think that was really important because it meant that we had a, we had effectively distributed sales force that wasn't on our payroll and just something small on that that really matters.
33:59
I remember at the time the Apple iOS store had an 8020 Rev share split.
So if you build something on, on app, excuse me, had a 7030 Rev share split.
So you built something on Apple, you as a developer keep 70 percent, 30% goes to Apple.
34:15
And I remember when we were talking about our Rev share for our App Store, we actually said 8020, not that we were competing with the Apple, the iOS store.
I mean we were, we were small little nothing company in in Canada.
But this idea that we would be more generous than the incumbents might be was very important.
34:32
And the truth is the additional 1010 points didn't really change it for us, but it just meant that when you built on Shopify, you deeply understood that you were going to get a very fair and a generous Rev share split.
I think that was one.
I think the 2nd, 1:00 we we really hammered hard was this thing called the build a business competition.
34:52
It was like our big aha moment.
And it was, you know, we had an article in New York Times about it, but it started in a very kind of simple way.
We had met Tim Ferriss I think in 2009 or so and he became an advisor and Tim is now a very good friend to both me and Toby and and we've done his pod, he's a great guy.
35:11
But Tim looked at Shopify and said great product.
You guys are missing something.
Most people, even though your product is great, easy to use and you're making entrepreneurship more accessible, most people have a risk aversion to something.
Entrepreneurship for one of two reasons, either too expensive or they don't know how to use it.
35:28
And he had this idea that we should create a competition whereby someone would start a brand new business on Shopify like Jan one and six months later, the store with the highest sales would win.
I think we said $10,000 and then Tim said it's got to be 100,000.
35:46
We did not have $100,000 to give out that way.
But our hope was that by the time the competition ended, we would actually have the type of money.
And we launched the the first build of business competition in 2010 and it got us, you know, I think the article in the New York Times, I have to go check, but I'm sure your listeners will keep me honest here.
36:03
But I think it's like a startup starts their own startup competition like launch their own startup company.
It was, it was, it was kind of a silly thing that we ourselves, we're starting competition.
The winner of that year was coming called Dodo Case that made these beautiful beautiful leather iPad cases the year the iPad was coming out.
36:19
And so that was one of those ways where if you sort of read the sort of the Jeffrey Moore, I think it's different word crossing the Chasm book where he talks about, you know, technology adoption cycles go from early adopters to mainstream.
It felt like the build the business competition helped us cross the chasm from early adopters to the mainstream and and over over I think we did the build the business competition for like 5 years after that.
36:41
And ultimately the stores were getting like gym Shark one one year and and like some Knicks wear a one one year.
Like these big companies ended up winning.
But so we couldn't give out 100,000 anymore.
So we had to come with these new ideas like how do we incentivize the creation of businesses.
36:58
And we did things like the winner would spend a week with Richard Branson on Necker Island and the winner would go and spend like go have lunch with Seth Godin.
And so we created this really cool stuff.
But I would say that's probably the second sort of vector in terms of growth.
We found a way for us to cross the chasm.
I just want I'll pause right there.
37:13
We I'm a huge fan of the the build of business competition and.
Oh, you know about it.
Oh cool.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Super, super.
Well acquainted with it.
Oh, that's so.
They never bring it up.
Yeah, that that was.
I mean that like that.
That was something that was really, really important.
Maybe the third thing that I think was probably really valuable was we began to look at what are the other things like what is the relationship that our product has in the lives of people that use it.
37:36
And the relationship started to look like when someone said they were going to work in the morning, what they meant was they were opening up their Shopify admin on their laptop or on their on their desktop.
So if we were becoming the center of like their day-to-day work where they added products and fulfilled orders and added new SKUs and and ran marketing campaigns, what else can we do to be valuable to be helpful there?
37:59
One thing that most people don't realize today, which is the case I'll bring it back in a second, is that if you were to pretend today that Shopify was a single retailer, like if you were to aggregate all our stores just in the US alone, we would be the second largest online retailer in America after Amazon, OK.
38:16
Why is it important?
Because if you are the second largest online retailer in America and you go to negotiate rates with payment gateways and shipping companies and banks and all these different types of ancillary services, the economy of scale that you have is so massive.
38:32
Well, even in the early days back going back to I'd say 20/13/2014 or so, as we were thinking about adding new features, new functionality we call merchant solutions, we began to think of it in that way whereby could we go and negotiate the best rates from from the payment gateways as if we were the second largest retailer?
38:49
We weren't second, we we were the 20th at that point or the 30th that point.
But we were able to get economies of scale because of the aggregated size of our merchant base.
And instead of keeping those economies of scale for ourselves, we gave them directly to the merchants.
We took a little bit of margin because we want to make money, but we gave.
39:06
So using Shopify, you know, to buy a domain, using Shopify to to figure out who's going to process your credit card payments in your merchant gateway, it became much better to you to do it through us than do it on your own.
And over time, that has turned into things like Shopify Payments and Shopify Capital and Shopify Shipping.
39:24
All these big parts of our Business Today were built on this philosophy that we have an unfair advantage because these economies of scale and if we give it to merchants, it means that Shopify plays an even larger role in their lives.
So the three big growth strategies, the first one is you had referral partners, so you made it easy for other people to basically work on the platform and promote your platform because if the if you're a web agency and people want to store, then if you make it easy for them and maybe they get some sort of financial incentive.
39:52
To and they got, they got a Rev share for it.
Yeah.
We get in the Rev share I think at the time in perpetuity like 20% of whatever we took, they got.
Which is?
Awesome.
Which for an agency is a, as you probably know, like recurring cash flow is is king.
Yeah.
And it's on and what's interesting about it is it's on a business, right.
So it's not like, so basically as long as the as long as the quote customer continues to sell stuff, you get a Rev share basically forever on the business, which is a great long term.
40:17
I mean it's a it's an incentivizing offer.
And also these these agencies are not going to build their own e-commerce stack right?
So they needed someone might as well use Shopify.
And I I bring this up because a lot of the business owners that I have you know they're like how do I, how do I grow, right.
And so that's why I wanted to really zero in on some of these growth strategies.
So one is you had referral partners you brought in you you were generous with them to the app developers and to the web stores.
40:37
They got 20% of the of the of your cut.
Awesome.
The second one was you you had a really sexy competition.
And so I I talk about this in terms of like making offers to to an audience.
It's like how can we make it so good?
People feel stupid saying now right like and so for I would say that obviously it worked.
40:54
I mean I've heard about it.
We've modeled it at school.com.
I just made the largest investment I've made into a platform but so we we saw that and so we had the school games and so we really looked at a lot of the stuff that you guys did there try to make it fun and but the the key point is that you made it fun.
41:09
You made it competitive.
You got you got customers to compete against one another but they're all winning and the major and this was one point I still wanted to ask.
So is it was the New York Times the only promotion that you did for that or was there other things that you did or like was it all word of meant like?
41:26
How?
Well at this point, like when we started this, like Tim was just sort of coming out.
The four hour work week I think was in its second edition, but he had this massive audience, part of the cool part, part of the the the, the, the, the beauty and the value of working with Tim was not just to give us a great idea or like great Tim.
41:42
Now you got to help us tell the world about it also.
So if we would have gone to Tim with this idea, I don't know if he would have said yes.
But the fact that it was like Tim's, we got Tim to generate an idea for us.
It was his idea he felt personally invested in.
In fact he's I I've heard him say this on his on his own show where he'll say like you know he's one of the Co founders of the build a business competition.
42:02
I love that because we created a a real vested interest in him to actually make this a success.
And it wasn't just New York Times.
I mean there was a lot of articles written about it.
But it also it gave us a narrative, a thing that we were able to go and talk about.
It was difficult for me to go around and talk about I'm I'm a like you know I'm I'm shot by chief storyteller.
42:22
It's it's it's it was difficult for me to go around and talk about like software Ruby on Rails or the simplicity of e-commerce.
But it wasn't as difficult for me to go around and say, hey, we created this thing we think, we think everyone has, you know, Nike, convince the world that if you have a body, you're an athlete.
42:39
Like my mind blown.
So, so brilliant.
We were trying to go around and convince the world if you have ambition, you could be an entrepreneur.
And so I had now this new beautiful asset piece of ammunition that I was able to go around to media and to the to anyone that would listen to me, to blogs, to celebrities and say there's a thing here we'd love you to talk about.
42:57
I'm like, oh, that's kind of cool.
That was really helpful.
And so for the business owners at home, one big one obviously was Tim got involved.
And so if you're like, how do I promote my business, finding a brand champion or finding somebody who, I mean, there's, if you've seen I think is it, is it air, that movie that's it tells the story of Jordans.
43:17
Like, yeah, yeah.
So like sometimes you need to find, like if you were like if you have an audience, awesome, then you already know what you're doing.
But if you don't have an audience, you're more of a product person and you're like shoot, how do I get this to the world?
Sometimes finding your Michael Jordan and in this instance like Tim was probably the Michael Jordan for that era, for that entrepreneurship, definitely for entrepreneurship at that time.
43:36
And so being willing to and I'm sure that Tim had a good deal with Shopify for you know, I'm sure that there was a deal with Tim that worked out.
Otherwise for.
Sure that he's profited a lot from.
And so sometimes you just got to be really generous like the Michael Jordan deals.
First of its kind.
It was it was it was kind of crazy that the the founder, you know the felt was like I don't know this like should I really go all in on this person.
43:58
And sometimes you got to make bets, right?
And obviously this bet paid off.
The Michael Jordan bet paid off.
And so you come up with something really sexy, and then you find somebody who's the perfect fit for it, and then you put it together, right?
And so just as.
Like, and there's always a perfect fit, right?
There's always someone out there.
There's someone who if, if, if, if you're, if you have a product, physical product or a piece of software, digital product, there is someone out there that has purchased from you.
44:19
Even if you're a small business who probably has some sort of leverage.
Meaning, they have an audience, they have a community, they have a big newsletter, they have a big following, They know a bunch of people.
If they have bought your product organically and they have a connection to you organically, you asking them point blank, hey, I had this crazy idea you seem to like my my, my tea and I would love to feature you in a promotion.
44:43
Would you be interested?
That is very different than cold calling them and saying hi.
I'm Harley from this tea company from Fire Belly tea and I'd love you to be a spokesperson.
Like I think the days, by the way, especially go back.
Like to come to present day for a second.
The days of Brad Pitt, Hawking, Colgate or or toothpaste are over.
45:02
Nobody wants these artificial connections or sponsorships.
When you look at what Jimmy and Mr. Beast has done with feastables or Emma Chamberlain with coffee, or you see what Kim Kardashian is doing with with Skims, because these are all in Shopify, I have a very deep understanding.
45:17
These businesses.
These are authentic, real products that were built, curated, organized by these credible celebrities who care so deeply about the product.
Like so the the days of artificial sponsorship pay to play thing I think are over.
45:33
And I think and I think what we did with build the business was almost like showcase that hey, Tim's for some reason interested in our business.
Hey Tim, how do you think we can grow our business?
Oh, that's a good idea.
We'll do the competition.
But by the way, we need your help for this competition.
And it's, it was really meta.
45:50
And I I want to, I just really want to hit on this because this is what a lot of a lot of businesses need growth, right.
They've got a product.
They're like how do I let people know about it?
And obviously you you can run, you can run ads or if you already have an audience and you already know that stuff.
But if you're like well, shoot, how do I do it scrappy, right.
And so like making an incentive that gives people a big reason to say yes, right, finding a brand champion that already has distribution can can be the unlock because all of that acquisition is really just based on the negotiation you have with that one person.
46:19
And if they can bring a lot like every you have the opportunity to make a true win win and obviously Shopify one and Tim one and the main one.
All of the people who built stores were the real winners here.
And I'll bet you some of the winners on the stores also did the exact same strategy that was also doing.
46:35
And so you've got a tea company and they find misses T on I don't know on Instagram who just loves tries teas all day.
It's like if she really did like the product then she would be a spokesperson.
So just finding that out.
OK cool.
And then the third one you said and I want to zero in on this was it was the economy.
46:52
So you said the growth strategies and you talk more about the economies of scale.
Was that just that because that seems a little bit more product and I'm, I'm game for that.
I just want to make sure that I I I.
Yeah, I I think on that one, I mean it's product focus, but it's also just simply like business focus.
My, my ability to go and negotiate with a large payment gateway every year got easier and easier.
47:10
Why?
Because I was coming to them as a much larger merchant.
Now if you just take a very simple, you know, a very simple example, 10 individual merchants go to negotiate with the payment gateway on their own.
They're all to get some rates.
But if I do it in aggregate with all 10, my rates are going to be much, much better and I can literally give those 10 merchants the exact same rates, you know, less maybe you know, a couple basis points that I want to keep for myself from from, from a profitability perspective that kept getting bigger.
47:38
It doesn't mean by the way we can talk about you know shop like you know like our our our whole shipping thing because we divested Shopify shipping what's called SFN Shopping Fulfillment Network a couple months ago.
But a year ago at this point because there are sometimes we have gone into areas that were not main Quest, we sort of called them side quests that maybe we shouldn't have done on our own.
47:56
In fact in the case of shipping, we found another company called Flex Port whose main quest is an end to end logistics platform which is what we were trying to build our self.
And rather than build it ourselves, we're like you just do it and that and what we can talk a bit about the value of what some companies are very, very good at partnership.
48:13
I think Shop is one of those companies.
If you look at what we've done with the firm for buy now, pay later or globally around cross-border payments, we've really, we pride ourselves in me, a company that is a really good company to partner with, which is very unique in tech, which is sort of all kind of frenemy esque.
48:29
Yeah.
And I want to and I want, I'm going to, I'm going to bring this to the the the brick and mortar chiropractor like so just just down to home base, those relationships don't need to be these massive billion dollar deals.
Obviously, they work at scale, but you know, I think about my, I think, OK, so if I'm a chiropractor, what are all the things that anybody who's my customer also gets?
48:50
They might go to the gym, they might like smoothies, they might like yoga, right.
They make other things that are ancillary.
And I think, OK, well, what if I go to each of those businesses and say, hey, with every smoothie, just put a coupon, you can slap it on there for a free adjustment.
49:06
So they're going to get a free adjustment and a smooth like you're going to enhance the value proposition that you have to your customers at no cost to you.
But then I get free leads and so they get a win and then I get free customers or at least a free shot at a customer.
And so these partnerships and and you know this has been a huge core to every business that I've built is I mean I think I've built almost the same amount of revenue from partnerships and affiliate relationships as I have just from actually you know, direct sales and and generating them ourselves.
49:33
Because you are known as like I mean you know you and I know each other sort of from the community our our own communities.
Like you were known as being a good partner meaning you leave enough on the table so your partners can make money from it.
You know doctors actually does really really well on their own referral side.
Meaning if you go to see a doctor and that doctor can help you, great, they'll they'll they'll they'll work on you.
49:52
If they can't they'll recommend someone else if you.
What I've noticed is that a lot of them recommend like it's almost like a a closed loop circuit where Doctor A, if they can help you, always recommends Dr. B who always recommends Dr. C and and Doctor C always recommends Dr. A.
50:08
And it's sort of this I think if you're a chiropractor for example, you if you sort of Venn diagram out meaning you look at your customer base and you ask them you know, where do you go, where do you work out, what clothing do you do you like to wear, what what, where do you go to get your smoothies for example.
You probably have your own version of that.
50:24
But also the people hanging out in the smoothie bar are also asking the smoothie person, hey, do you want any good chiropractors?
And the yoga instructors also saying, hey, I think you need a chiropractor as well.
And so creating your own version of an affiliate program, even if it's not called an affiliate program, it's sort of your own creation of it actually is incredibly effective.
50:41
And if you over deliver meaning every time the chiropractor recommends the yoga instructor, the, you know, the yoga instructor's client comes back and says man that yoga instructor you recommended is amazing, you should send more clients to that yoga instructor.
And so there is an opportunity to sort of over deliver, to create even more leverage in this sort of closed ecosystem of reciprocity and.
51:04
I'm going to give everyone three quick tips on this.
Number one, if you're going to create one of these relationships, give them customers first.
If you give them customers first, they're way more like send them five people and then make the call be like, hey, by the way I thought maybe it makes sense if we did some.
Now they're going to want more of what you, Jay, just gave them and going to be happy to talk.
51:20
Second one is in terms of generosity like if you know what your cost to acquire customer is, you should be willing to give at least that for referral 2A referral partner.
Because like you either pay Zuck right or you just pay another small business owner.
And I can almost promise you that a referral from a partner is going to be worth more on LTV.
51:36
So you still get a a better LTV to cap ratio by going to a stronger channel with like a referral partner.
And one little thing that Layla's really good at this and she has just drilled it into me over time which has been helpful for partnerships and she says never count the other guy's money.
And so just because you're making someone else a ton of money like it has nothing.
51:55
Like if if you take out how much that person makes and you just look at your side of the table make the deal make sense for you.
If they make a killing awesome, they're going to be an amazing partner, right.
And so I just want to underline that for because some of the mistakes I made early on is I wanted I saw how much I would make but I've lost deals because I got too greedy trying to say, well he's going to make even more than me and I would encourage you not to think that way because if everyone grows.
52:16
Such it's such an amazing reminder.
So I don't, I don't watch sports.
I don't really play sports.
So my Sunday project, this is a little bit weird and nerdy, but I, I, I have this project, it's it's called Big Shot.
It's an archive that I'm creating of the greatest stories of the greatest Jewish entrepreneurs of the last half century.
52:32
And so I'm meeting these people, most of them are in their 80s and 90s and I sit down with them and I record it.
I put it on YouTube.
It's not a big podcast, just mostly a personal project.
But it's fascinating.
And I I've sat down with people like Izzy Sharp, who's the founder of The Four Seasons Hotel, or a guy named Larry Silverstein, who's the owner of the World Trade Center.
52:49
These were poor kids.
I mean, these people grew up with nothing.
Zero, Or Fran Weisler, who's the queen of Broadway.
These are very poor people that grew up and and and eventually created.
You know, they're billionaires and they created empires.
When you ask them at 90 years old, and I think Izzy Sharp from The Four Seasons Hotel is 95 years old.
53:08
When you ask these people tell me one or two things that I don't know I'm, I'm, I turn 40s here.
So Izzy, tell me something I don't know that I should at my age.
Almost to the I've done about 12 of these interviews so far with these like older you know icons and legends on Titans almost all of them to a tee say make your partners really really rich.
53:31
Now the reason I I bring this up now is because these are people in their 90s in their 90s who they got nothing.
You know they're not trying to have swagger they're not trying to like flex they're so and the reason I love interviewing them is because they're so transparent.
But to AT every single one of them, from these Titans of industry in real estate to the the the the Queen of Broadway has always made their partners incredibly rich.
53:54
And that is not something that is intuitive, but it's something that I think like is is legitimate.
I I I love, I love this entire line of thinking because I mean it goes down to the just more of abundance mindset.
54:10
Most of the people that I know they're wealthiest in the world just don't see business as a 0 sum game, right.
It's just like everyone actually can win, whereas in a lot of games it is it.
It isn't structured that way.
Whereas like even just the the build a business competition you mentioned earlier, like sure there was 1 winner, but do you think that #2 to #100 in on the list was like, oh man, I'm so bummed that I only got to a.
54:31
That's the craziest part.
Number two number and #100 are have build $1,000,000 brands also right and that's this idea of like positive some thinking I think is so important.
I know there's like you know like I'm an optimist and I know you were you were also Alex.
But one thing that I think people misses often when you go to raise money, for those of you that are looking to raise money, one criticism you often get from investors is this concept of Tam total address market, how big is your market And effectively what they're trying to say is that if you look at your market it's a pie and your Tam is effectively the pie and your your your market share is a slice of the pie.
55:05
I think that's very flawed thinking.
And I think if we would have done that at Shopify we would not be $100 billion company.
Our version was not let's take a piece of the pie rather let's grow the pie itself.
And so we'll get to the IPO in a second.
But we took our company public in 2015, May, 2015 on New York Stock Exchange.
55:22
It was a billion dollar company at that point.
So but you know 1% of the market cap that is today at the time every when you when before you go public, you win this road show.
We did 93 meetings all over the US and you're meeting these investors and you're meeting these funds and then you want them to invest in these big funds that have trillions of dollars under management.
55:42
And this idea of Tam would come up over and over again and I needed to have an answer for what the Tam was.
And I remember it off by heart, it was there were 46,000,000 retail SMBs on the planet.
I think at the time we had a hundred or three, 200,000 of them.
55:58
So big, big growth opportunity.
Ironically, if you sort of you know we're now nine years past the IPO.
If you look at Shopify today, a lot of our customers are not just SM BS.
We have very large companies.
We're also well beyond e-commerce.
We have tons of merchants to use this for point of sale physical retail.
56:15
We have, we have a capital business, a payments business.
There was no way for them to actually to for me to give an answer around Tam in terms of like foreshadowing what we would become.
And so I love this idea that you're talking which is like positive some thinking and optimism where share share the wealth of other people around you because rather than sort of thinking of the pie as sort of this finite space, think about the pie as infinite and encourage more people to participate.
56:41
That's how you build these like generational 100 year multi billion dollar companies.
I talked to a fund manager the other day and he was, and he's a public, a public fund.
And he was, he was saying, you know, one of the things that I really like is that I've got 10,000 people praying that I win every night.
56:59
Is that great?
Yeah.
And I I think Zig Ziglar said something to the degree of like you can have whatever you want in life as long as you have other people get what they want first.
And I I just, I just really, really believe that because I've.
So I actually feel like I've actually put some numbers to this.
But I think that from an entrepreneurship perspective it's about 110th.
57:17
And what I mean by that is like you get to keep about 110th of the wealth that you generate for other people.
And so I've just seen that from like the number of entrepreneurs that I look at like how much the market cap like not the market caps, the like total revenue that's run through their platforms versus how much their equity stake is and what it's valued at.
57:35
Like the amount of times that I've seen that equation done where like it's 10X like you have to make 10 times the amount of money for other people as you'll be able to make.
It's just been really cool And I think framing it that ways like how do I make everyone else a ton of money.
Like everyone loves doing business with someone who makes the money and then they will like and then they will want you to doing this with them so. 2022, our our 2023 numbers are not out yet.
57:58
Q4 earnings are coming out soon, so can't talk with it, but I'll tell you last year in 2022 Shopify's revenue was but $5.6 billion under 6 billion.
Our merchants, the people that use Shopify made almost $200 billion in in GMV and revenue and sales that is I mean that is amazing.
58:17
I'm very proud of that.
I love the fact that our merchants made 200 and we made five point something like that is the that the reciprocity that I think is important.
We I also love the fact that our our ecosystem partners made more than $6 billion last year.
58:33
That matters because it means for 2023 they're going to come back and work with us again.
And so I want to this is a really good line of thank you for I think a lot of people in the audience.
So one is we've got we've got this big theme of reciprocity and what are what are some of the other because I'm I'm skipping one ahead but I think I think I think it's worth it.
58:50
So what are some of the you asked you put this question which is what are some of the things I don't know what should which is actually a question that I asked people too.
So I I like that you asked that question.
What are some of the other things that came up from those conversations or just things that you would share as kind of some of the big breakthroughs and like really ones that you were like, I really thought this and I was dead wrong and I see this now and it changed everything.
59:11
All right, let me go a little personal for a second because I I think these conversations don't really add as much value unless you can sort of take off the facade.
I have.
I turned 42 months ago, my wife turned 40 a month ago.
So we've like been doing a lot of like reflection on our life and and you know, we're grateful and we love what we do.
59:30
We're doing our life's work and all that.
So one of the things that I really believe on a personal level is more true to me now than ever is this idea that vulnerability is actually this incredible superpower and my life has gotten dramatically better.
When I became a lot more vulnerable and I'll give you a quick example, I became, I was, I was the Chief Operating Officer of Shopify between pretty much 2015 or so and 2020.
59:56
So post IPO until sort of the pandemic and I love being Shopify COO it was a big role.
I had thousands of thousands of reports and most like pretty much all the non engineering organizations you know rolled up to me and I thought that was cool.
1:00:11
I thought that was really fun and and and I felt good about that but I I wasn't I wasn't happy.
I didn't feel necessarily that I was the best COO in the world but there was no way in hell I was ever going to raise my hand and say this is not the right role for me.
This is not what's going to keep me at Shopify for a long time.
1:00:29
And it was only until I had a really good chat with Toby and I was like, look, I was like, like there is someone who's better at this role than I am.
I'm certain of it.
And turns out it's Kaz who's our current COO.
He he was, he initially was running product for payments for us, our money product, but he's now he he loves being the COO and running operations the way that I love storytelling.
1:00:50
And I never would have had this new sort of this next gear of of my career at Shopify had I not had a little bit of like just gotten over my own, my own shit, my own crap to say this is really not for me.
And I think this idea of of vulnerability, showing weaknesses, being this like weird bravado, insecurity thing.
1:01:10
And the more you show vulnerability, the more you ask for help, the better things become.
And I recognize that it's easier for someone like me to show vulnerability of my stage than it would have been for me to show 10 years ago.
But I actually I I'm as I get older I I believe that less and less that I actually believe in any stage being really honest with yourself and being honest with the people around you about what you want to do, what you love, doing what you're really good at.
1:01:32
Like this idea of I've I've mentioned the term life's work a couple times.
There's a great Japanese term which is icky guy which is effectively like what do you love?
What does the world need?
What can you what can you get paid for?
That idea of of finding your thing at a stage in life which where you're not 95 like Izzy Sharp from Four Seasons but you're 40 like like like I am or you're 50 or 60 or 30 I think is a great gift and I think you're able to find your thing a lot easier when you simply are a lot more vulnerable about that and and more more than ever I I really look at that today as as as a real strength.
1:02:09
That's the first.
The second thing I would say is even Shopify is you know we have I don't know 8 or 9000 people at the company.
Shopify is very much a founder LED company but also the people that work at Shopify have this incredible founders mentality.
1:02:25
They act like an owner with every expense that they spend the speed and agility they use.
They reject like best practices quote UN quote they reject processes that don't make don't make sense don't make don't make it faster and not just that we encourage that.
1:02:42
If you look at the most like some of the biggest areas of Shopify they're ran by founders of companies that we've acquired and they've stayed at Shopify long past the earn out dates because we've created the sort of crafters and founders paradise at this company in in many ways it is like this this incredible like collective of founders and and and entrepreneurs and I think that you can do that at any stage of company but if you but if you're not careful it goes away really quickly and there are very few companies in our size today that feels like a founder LED entrepreneurial everyone calls themselves the largest startup like it's it's almost you know it's such a common thing to say but it's it's bullshit most of them are not like that and I think one thing that you can do as the founder of your company is and still this founders this founders mindset or founder mentality and you can keep it there if you work at it and I think the results are almost always unequivocally better.
1:03:38
What do you do tactically in order to keep that?
So a couple of things are very simple.
In most companies of our size, the way to to get a promotion is to go into management.
There's one track, it is and it's it.
It always leads to a manager type role.
1:03:56
We don't do that.
There are other tracks at Shopify.
There is a manager track.
There's also an individual contributor track where we call the crafter track.
There are these other tracks that allow you to stay at our company for a long time.
And if your craft is engineering or it's product or it's sales or it's storytelling and it's it's sort of brand building, we are absolutely in fact not even OK with it.
1:04:18
We are going to be super happy if your mandate for your career is to get really, really good at being the world's best marketer or the world's best sales Rep or the world's best whatever.
So one is we've created these different tracks at Shopify and we've created which is sort of you know like the way I like to heard is like Shopify is really a craft of paradise.
1:04:39
That's one.
The second thing that is really important is we also encourage like real disagreements.
We invite people to actively disagree when something just doesn't feel right.
Now if like if we've made the decision we've beat it up.
1:04:54
You know you know disagree and commit sometimes has to happen also.
But instilling a place where like you encourage open debate is really I I I think super important.
I I I think most companies talk about transparency and they talk but it's it's it's total bullshit.
Maybe the.
1:05:09
Ethics to encourage that I I just, I I always get into the weeds.
But like, yeah, the the, the trial makes a ton of sense.
Like that was like for me, you know, with, with with our companies like I will, I will.
That'll probably be my #1 take away from just my tactical takeaways.
1:05:25
Like, interesting having individual contributor tracks because one of the big issues that a lot like when you have a Star media buyer right in the company, that guy usually doesn't want to then manage media buy like he's used like that.
Person And why do you want that person to like you want that Star media buyer to be a media buyer and what if that media buyer is A7 and actually wants to become a nine or A10 at some point.
1:05:45
Now all of a sudden you have like the world's greatest media buyer.
So one thing is I think you do have to have a conversation with people no matter what size your company is like what tracker you want are you in a management like there are some people who are just so great at management you want them to manage teams.
They just they they're really good at that stuff.
1:06:00
But I think having a conversation say what track are you on really really matters.
The second thing I think that's also that's also really important is I know every company want likes to talk about things like you know transparency and and open communication.
1:06:16
We write a letter to our board every quarter.
We share that letter with the board, the whole company we and it's not redacted.
It's exactly the letter that even in our size that we share with the board we share with the entire company.
A small now not every letter is going to be this holy shit mind blowing you know piece of content.
1:06:34
They're always really interesting.
But sometimes, you know, it's more like making sure the trains are are are on time and stuff like that.
But what it does do over time is it it really brings everyone into the same page of like, hey, the things we're telling the board.
We're also telling you that there isn't these like two different versions of the narrative of the company.
1:06:52
And I think that's something that is, is it's, it seems simple, but it's really, really impactful, especially if you do it really consistently.
I'll give a, I'll give, I'll give the listeners A tactic that we have done for this, which is we actually run open book financials in all of our companies.
1:07:08
And so when we do Quarterly's, it's like here's where we made money, here's where this, like we spend money and it didn't work out well.
And so that's helped for everyone feeling like they're on the same page, that we're not hiding anything.
And if things are going really well, they can see it.
1:07:23
And if something doesn't go as well, like some of the decisions that happened down line were like, well that was suffering.
And I guess this, this does make sense that we decided to divest in this kind of endeavour that we were doing.
And I know I love Susie, but I get it, you know, like even even if people aren't like stoked about it, like they get it.
1:07:39
So I I was just, I love, this is great by the way.
And so acting like an owner, you, you operationalize that by creating individual contributor tracks and by having manage tracks really, so people can be honest about what they're really good at.
And the one tidbit I'll give for people who actually aren't owners, they're just like entrepreneurs.
1:07:58
Sorry, employees and businesses is no one can fault you once you own your flaws.
Like if you're like, hey, I really suck at project management.
And if you say that up front, then people like they don't.
They don't talk behind your back about it.
1:08:13
They'll just talk to your face about it.
Because it's not a secret.
You're like, I know I suck at project management.
And so the more it's like Eminem's whole thing is like if he claimed every single deficiency and flaw that he had, no one could say anything back to him in rap battles.
And even though, you know, hopefully corporate America is a little bit nicer than a rap battle, maybe it isn't.
1:08:30
It may not always be, but I think you're right about that.
I think also the thing that what happens is when you say to someone, look, I don't want to be a Riverstone, I don't want to be well-rounded.
I want to be really, really pointy at this thing.
And that means that this other things around me, I'm going to hire or I'm going to find teams who are really good at those other things.
1:08:47
Now you're beginning to actually put yourself in a position where if you're not like the world's greatest, I don't know, writer, for example, but you're really good at like coming up with like, you know, great slogans or you're not the world's great ad.
You know, you're not great at writing ad copy, but you're a great media buyer.
1:09:03
Now if you say, look I'm not good at ad copy, but I I'm so good at finding opportunities for for great exposure.
If you say you're not good at that, that means it invites someone who may be really good at copy to come and be your like your your your your your buddy your best, your you know your best friend at work.
1:09:20
That stuff really, really matters.
And I I think I I think that stuff really is really great.
The only other thing I will say is this, I know a lot of coming stuff with Mission and Northstar.
One thing that we are very clear on even from from from day one till now is we are a merchant obsessed.
And what does that mean when given any decision whereby we have to pick one of two things, we always ask ourselves what is better for merchants.
1:09:43
Now by the way that is different than let's say Amazon for example, who is very famously consumer obsessed.
They don't like, that's what they care about.
They're very clear about that.
When you work at Amazon, if there's like 100,000 people who work there, they are consumer obsessed by creating this, this very simple heuristic of which allows you to say given two opportunities both seem pretty good, how do you actually evaluate it?
1:10:06
Well, what's the one that's best for the merchant?
That means that thousands of people work at Shopify on a daily basis, are making independent decisions that all roll up to that centralized mission, which is we are merchant obsessed.
We care first and foremost about the millions of business owners that you, Shopify.
1:10:21
And again, it sounds obvious, but most companies totally mess us up.
And where the the vision and mission stuff gets really important just for everyone who's listening is like, once you get to about 100 employees, that's where you're you're usually 2 to 3 levels away for.
Like if you're the founder, you're 2 to 3 levels away from people who are getting hired.
1:10:38
You're starting to hire people you don't even know their names.
Like.
This is where this really becomes important because decentralized decision making is the only way you can continue to scale.
And you need people to make decisions that would be in a line with a line alignment with you.
Like you can't be in every room to make every decision.
And so that's where mission and values create decision making frameworks that people can use as litmus tests of, OK, what would Toby do right now?
1:11:00
Well, I know that Toby says merchants are North Star and merchants would not like this then we don't do it right even though we beg a little bit more, they don't like it and that's what correct.
I just want to highlight that because a lot of the people, I mean obviously we take businesses on smaller than Shopify that we invested.
1:11:17
But like we'll we'll go through this exercise with leadership because usually when they're at you know between 10 to $30 million a year, this is when this gets really important to get to 100 million a year in revenue and so forth.
And so, like, if you're at that point in your stage, like, this shit gets important.
I also think something that you're you're sort of, you're sort of skating or flirting with a little, which which has to be said is I think that there is a strange thing that as you grow, so you mentioned 100 people, there's actually a real thing, it's called, it's called Dunbar's number.
1:11:42
It's 150 people, right.
And Dunbar's number basically goes back to like the days of like when we're all living in tribes that basically a tribe size should never go beyond 150.
There's some sort of science around.
Humans can only really remember 150 people at any one particular time.
I went through the 150 mark a long time ago at Shopify.
1:11:59
It does change and there's no question about it.
But the one thing that often happens when you cross that 100 mark or 150 hundred fifty person mark is you begin to do this whole, like, you know, macro management.
You sort of get out of the weeds.
And actually I think this whole narrative that micromanagement is bad is total horseshit.
1:12:18
I actually think that the best leaders I know with the running like trillion dollar companies because I know some of those or $100 billion companies or million dollar companies.
The best leaders I know are in the weeds on the things that matter most.
And even not, you know, I'm preparing now for my earnings call, which in two weeks like I'm in the weeds on this.
1:12:36
Like we have an IR team who could prepare all this.
No, I want to actually go through every single word in the script, in the press release, in the narrative.
I want to go like word for word on my own before anyone even takes a look at it because it matters so much.
And if that's it's my crap, that's what I'm supposed to be responsible for that I'm going to be in the weeds on that.
1:12:55
I think there's like this, this corporate America, you know, bashing of micromanagement.
And I I think I, I, I, I think some micromanagement is actually really positive and needed.
We agree and we have a little saying for this internally which is win in the weeds like that's like that's you're going to go toe to toe with somebody's like you're going to win in the weeds like that's how you do.
1:13:14
It and I like I feel the same way if some you know some some president of some other company of our size is not in the weeds on on on earnings on on press on partnerships.
I'm going to run circles around them because I am in the weeds.
Because you have the the visceral knowledge of like the stuff that really makes it.
1:13:31
And one of the things that also helps with this is that if you were in the weeds, when something goes wrong, you know why it went wrong.
And you can make a pivot where if you're 2 levels removed, you don't know why it didn't work.
And then your decision making of what to do next then relies on second hand and it gets really, really messy.
After that, you make really dumb moves.
1:13:47
OK, so we have reciprocity is one of the big driving things.
We have vulnerability and then the downstream impacts of how you kind of implement that within Shopify with the individual tracks and encouraging open disagreement among people and giving everyone kind of a North star.
So everyone's aligned with how we're are like what frameworks are we going to disagree around?
1:14:06
Like it's not whether we're doing customer or we're doing merchant.
The disagreement is going to be which of these best serves the merchant if we're going to disagree, correct.
Right.
So I want to zoom out.
And so I said we're going to look back and I think we took a little bit of a final nugget stuff and moved it forward, which I loved anyways.
1:14:23
So if we're looking forward right, you sit in this really unique perch that, I mean maybe 10 people on earth sit on that.
You sit on top of this mountain of data and you kind of see around the corner.
And so what's kind of what's, what's, what's, what's coming, right?
1:14:39
What are you, what are you thinking about for Shopify and just kind of the marketplace overall for retail entrepreneurs or even just entrepreneurs in general?
Look, we talked a little bit about the sort of idea that the cost of failure is trending towards zero.
It's never going to be 0 because ultimately like it's sort of asymptotes because ultimately like you have an opportunity cost like you could be doing something else.
1:14:57
So it's never going to be 0, but it's getting close to it.
I think a couple things around the entrepreneurship thing.
One is I think entrepreneurship now more than ever before is default global.
I think this idea that we've imported physical geographies and borders of countries in from the physical world into the digital world is really silly, I don't think.
1:15:21
I mean, you know, you'll see a lot of great brands behind me that I'm very close with.
I put up, you know, from Kith to Supreme to Mom's Spaghetti, which is M&M's company, to Fire Belly, which is my little tea side hustle master dynamic headphones.
These are some of the companies that I love that I'm connected to.
1:15:37
None of them have geographic limitations.
That's just not how they operate.
I get it.
It's more complicated sometimes to sell, although frankly we have a product called Shopify Markets and Markets Pro which makes everything really easy there.
But I I don't want to.
This isn't Shopify Pitch, just I think one like your total adjustable market when you're getting started is anyone on the planet who wants to buy your particular product first.
1:16:00
Second of all is I think the idea, if you listen to any of the earnings calls from these big, big retailers, one of the terms you often hear is this concept of channel conflict, which is a very simple thing.
It's online is doing well, but it's hurting offline.
1:16:17
Instagram commerce is doing well, but it's hurting my online store.
I I when I think about the brands and I admire the most across millions of stores on Shopify, none of them, none of them use the term channel conflict.
Why?
Because they are channel agnostic.
What they care about is serving their customer in the way that the customer loves to be served or wants to be served.
1:16:39
Which is very different than pretty much, you know, the history of retail where if you wanted to buy bread, you went to the Baker in the town square, you want to buy shoes, went to the cobbler down the street in the 80s.
I'm a, you know, I'm an 80s kid.
When I went to go buy a video game, I'd have to line up at the store at this hour.
1:16:57
Doors open.
Wait in line, use this credit card.
Nope, not that credit card.
Use this one.
That whole thing was the the the concept of the retailer dictating the process of purchase to the consumer is over.
And the reason that you're seeing, you know, things like shop pay for example, become so popular is because seamless, simple, easy, convenient checkout is what every consumer wants.
1:17:22
And so modern retailers today, one, are geographically agnostic, 2 are channel agnostic.
They sell across every channel.
And the reason why you see us do things like we there's a there's a Spotify channel for Shopify.
So if you're an artist, most, most merchants on Shopify are not artists.
1:17:38
But if you're an artist and you have your Eminem for example, and you have a great popular artist profile and fan base on Spotify, now you can sell your merch directly from your artist profile page on Spotify.
Won't be important to most people, but our if we want to qualify and re qualify to be the retail operating system for these millions of stores, our responsibility is every surface area on the planet, digital, physical, anywhere in between.
1:18:05
That transaction could happen.
We have to make that easy.
That's probably the second thing I think that's happening in retail.
And then the third thing that I think is is kind of like a an interesting thing is that I think business is becoming at all sizes personal and you do this very well Alex, maybe better than anyone, but you know your own personal brand and your business's brand, they're not separate anymore.
1:18:29
A couple a little while ago I saw a very, very high end brand.
Their online store was down.
I'll say it was Versace.
Versace went down I think 8 months ago When I tweeted, I said Versace like let me help you out and it ended up leading to some of the Versace brands coming on to Shopify.
1:18:47
But at that point was I the president of Shopify, was I hardly the entrepreneur, was I hardly the like human like it.
I think this idea that that you know work life balance or work life harmony, the separate, I think it's I think it's over.
I think people, I think we as entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs in 2024, we have to sort of incorporate all these things into our backpack, our businesses, our personal life.
1:19:09
Like, you know, you talk about, you talk about your wife Layla, right all the all the time.
But being part of like you, you sort of mix in between total addressable market and how much your wife, I do the same thing like Lindsay, my wife is a huge part of my life.
And when I go home, I talk about work and I also talk about our kids.
And I like, I think this there's sort of this wonderful harmonious situation now where we don't like we're not separating these things.
1:19:31
We're not waiting to retire to live our life.
I think more and more you're able to kind of like have a personal brand, but it's also your business's brand and you're also an extension of the company, but you're also your own person.
I actually think that's a wonderful new thing, that new phenomenon that is very different than our parents and grandparents and great grandparents had.
1:19:50
And.
They don't really get it.
Right.
I mean Mr. Beast, is he a YouTube, or is he a Or is he a confectionery genius with his chalk?
Who cares?
He's this amazing guy.
He's a great entrepreneur and he makes content and makes chocolate and he makes burgers and he makes cool videos and he's a cool dude.
1:20:08
And like, who cares how you sort of categorize these people?
And that's the reason why.
Actually, back to what we said at the beginning.
Authenticity is going to rule here and if you are, if you are full of shit, people are going to figure that out very quickly and they're not going to buy from you and they're not going to want to participate in your journey.
1:20:24
But if you're not full of shit and you invite people along into your journey and you you talk about your kids and your spouse and your business, people cheer for you.
And it goes back to what I think you said you know earlier is, is that that that quote about, you know you want as many people cheering for you as possible in your journey.
1:20:41
I've read the exact quote, but if something like that.
And because I I like defining terms a lot.
It's like one of my hobbies, but defining it from a behavioral perspective.
So a lot of people are like, well, what is being authentic?
Or like, I want to be authentic, Like, how do you do that?
The best definition that I that I have that's working is behaving as if you could not be punished.
1:21:01
And so often times like we censor ourselves for fear of punishment, we like the many things that we don't say or don't do because we're afraid someone's going to say something or someone's going to do something in reaction.
And so basically, if you're in an empty room, you have almost no, no potential for punishment, right?
And so it's how you act as if you could not be punished is how you are authentically.
1:21:22
And so we talk about the concept of, like, you are the niche.
So it's like, what is Logan, right?
He likes, he likes, he likes aliens, He likes, you know, weird, the government stuff.
He likes fighting, He likes comedy, He likes biohacking, he likes taking crazy drugs.
Like he likes all sorts of stuff.
And so if you're to say, hey, I want to start this podcast where I talk about aliens fighting comedy like all let people be like you're crazy, but it's Joe Rogan.
1:21:45
And so it also creates a one of one category that only you can really occupy.
And so I I genuinely do believe this that everyone is kind of unique in terms of their distinct interest and kind of like if they were a chart like how how they're the point of their rock is in One Direction versus 100 other ones.
1:22:04
And so I do think there is a thumbprint there that that is unique to the individual.
Where people do become rounded stones is because they pull back on their pointy bits and so then they do look more uniform.
And so people look uniform but aren't in in reality.
And so looking at these three big things in terms of what's coming around the corner in commerce and kind of like where the best brands are indexing #1 is that they see everyone as a potential customer around the world.
1:22:25
Not, not not not just their local area, just even people who speak their language.
Second was that they don't really care where the customer comes from.
Like if more people know about your stuff and you put it in more places, more people will buy it and as long as you treat them well, you'll make more sales and you get more repeat customers.
And then third one is creating basically allowing yourself to be you publicly and being more OK with the association.
1:22:49
That's going to happen inevitably with you starting a company because if you really believe in the product, it's going to be invest in your identity.
Like it's going to be part of who you are.
And rather than caging these things out or boxing them, just leaning into the fact that like you're you and you own this thing.
And I think that what we were saying earlier with kind of Tim Ferris and these brand champions like those other people can contribute their thumbprints to your product as well.
1:23:11
Well, if you're authentic, then other people that are kind of like you like I like to I like to be exothermic like I like to take.
I'm very high energy, always have been.
I like to add energy to other people and other other situations and rooms and conversations.
And so I'm just going to like, I want to be exothermic.
1:23:29
And so everything that I do, I want to like, I want to be the exothermic person.
What that means is people see me being exothermic.
I mean, you and I sort of connected like you and I are kind of social media friends.
Like I was being exothermic and you were being exothermic.
Like, hey, let's be exothermic together.
That's how you and I, that's why we are talking right now because I try to be authentically me on the Internet and you try to be authentically you on the Internet.
1:23:49
And so we connected and like immediately we're like, yeah, we kind of like each other.
You get tons of people coming at you asking to do stuff together and immediately you're like something is off here.
And and I I I feel the same way sometimes when people come to me and they say like I want to connect, I want to do a deal with you when you are exothermic and if you are or or when you are authentic, you actually invite other people that are similarly authentic in your way into your lives and you create these amazing communities and friendships and relationships and it's it's really fun.
1:24:18
But you know I mean it's it's great sort of place to wrap up I think which is like there is a deep optimism I think around the entrepreneurial community.
And for those of you that are listening, whether you're an entrepreneur or aspiring entrepreneur, one of the best parts of entrepreneurship is that all of us, no, actually not all.
1:24:33
Most of us didn't sort of start with like some sort of like, we didn't start on third base.
Most of us started at the beginning and we've been building ourselves.
And so when we see other people building on their own, whether they're chiropractors or they're tech entrepreneurs or they're lawyers or accountants or they're someone who's creating, you know, I love my Ember mug.
1:24:52
I love the guys in Ember.
They make these great coffee mugs that stay hot.
Whatever they are, I'm rooting for them and they're rooting for me.
And that actually, that's sort of wonderful.
Like ecosystem reciprocity.
Go back to that.
That makes entrepreneurship a little bit less lonely, and also the greatest tool for humans to find their own version of 6.
1:25:12
Whatever your version's success is, make a lot of money.
Put food on your table, be creative.
Whatever that version is, entrepreneurship is this amazing vehicle and today it's more accessible than it's ever been.
And there's It's tough not to be optimistic about that.
Last question, business advice to hardly 10 years ago you got one thing you can tell.
1:25:33
I think a lot of, you know, a lot of people don't know where to start.
We kind of talked to this a little bit earlier when we talked about T-shirts, but just find a problem that that you feel yourself and just solve it.
Like it's hard to imagine how to scale and how big it could become.
Don't even worry about that.
But like if there's a hobby like, you know one of my best friends is really in is is his name is David Siegel.
1:25:54
He's founder of David's Tea, this big tea empire.
He sold the company 2016.
And he was trying to figure out what to do.
And all along the way David was like coming over to my house and we're hanging out a lot and he's obsessed with tea.
I was like, dude, like you have a thing.
It's tea.
Why don't you build another tea company.
1:26:10
And so that's where Fire Belly came from.
And I love this idea that like you know the thing that you're searching for is probably right in front of you.
And I I know some people say that, you know, you shouldn't commercialize your hobbies, but I'm actually, I'm not really sure.
I believe that like if you have this amazing hobby, this amazing interest, this amazing pain point, you feel a lot.
1:26:29
That's exactly what you should be working on.
That's the first thing.
The second thing I think is like, you know, well this is my 15th year at Shopify.
I'm 40 years old, so more than 1/3 of my life has been spent at this credible company.
And I I if, if people, if Toby and the board will have me, I'll stay there as long as I possibly can.
1:26:46
But finding someone who like from a partnership perspective, someone you work with closely, I think a lot of people start companies and businesses with people that are just like them, people that they would have been friends with in high school.
I think it's fun and I get it.
And you know, Fire Belly for example, Dave and I are both kind of similar with our little tea thing.
1:27:06
But actually I think some of the most impressive things I've ever seen built were built by people that probably would not have been friends in high school.
Again, going back to this idea of like a pointy objects, they're pointy in their own way, but their points are not the same.
And by combining their points, they kind of create this like Avengers thing which on their own they'd be doing cool stuff, but like you know, doing it all together means they can build $100 billion company.
1:27:31
So those would be some of the things I I would say maybe the only other thing is like you know one just going back to like life life and work all together.
I think one of the most important decisions all of us can make is finding an incredible incredible partner, spouse, wife husband boyfriend girlfriend, whatever.
1:27:48
I think people underestimate how important that is and I think I I often refer to to Lindsay at her 40th birthday.
I said you know Lindsay is my superpower that I have this incredible part and and I I I think we all not all but I I I know a lot of people that take for granted how important that particular decision is.
1:28:09
I I think finding a wonderful life partner for you whoever you are is just probably the most important decision you're ever going to make.
And I think we all, some people think about it very thoughtfully.
Others sort of do it haphazardly and I think that's a mistake. .71 Correlation with your subjective well-being.
1:28:26
Hell yeah.
So is that true?
Are you making that up?
No.
No, that's .7.
Correlation with subjective well-being, the strength of relationship with your significant other.
With that, I feel like it's a great stopping point.
Thank you so much for giving your time.
Like just.
Just this is so fun.
I'm I'm.
I hope it's valuable to your to your to your community and your listeners.
1:28:43
I'm I'm a huge fan.
I'm part of your community and I I tried to bring as much insight and and and thoughtfulness as I possibly could.
It's it's an honor, Alex, for me to be talking to you for, I don't know, the last 90 minutes.
It's beyond mutual and on just behalf of, you know, Mozi Nation, thank you so much.
Appreciate you.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else going on.
Everybody happy.
Hump day, happy Wednesday.
I don't know what day you're actually consuming the song, whether it's podcast or video, but whatever way you are consummate welcome.
I am breaking the mold and making three days in a row of content.
0:41
I know crazy stuff and this one was not planned at all but was something that my sales director messaged me just a couple seconds ago and he was saying that he was talking to somebody who's in launch and they basically have grown essentially.
1:00
And as a result need to hire people because their business is killing right?
And they were upset about the fact that that's not included in launch and it's everything that's in Legacy right there.
Like, I think that's ridiculous.
Why would I have to pay more for how to do this, right?
1:19
And so I'm going to try it and and temper my response, but I want it to be appropriate to answer the question.
So the so sick Success creates deficits.
And I'm borrowing that phrase from Rockstar from, but it's, I mean, I don't know if he was the first one to say it, but success creates deficits, there is no business program in existence, right?
1:41
That will solve all of your business problems.
Why?
Because as you solve one another will appear, it's part of growth, right?
And so when Jim's come into our world in the beginning, the first problem they have is an acquisition problem, they don't know how to grow their business app will now the front end of Hose is arguably one of the most important ones, because it's what turns the machine if we didn't have gym owners applying, then we wouldn't have to scale our fulfillment.
2:09
We wouldn't have to grow our customer service.
Team wouldn't have to scale our sales team.
We wouldn't have two scalar operations team.
We wouldn't have that because we don't have an acquisition system, right?
But once you have an acquisition system, the acquisition system does not solve your problem.
It exposes, the problem that are already there in your business and most people just don't know the problems because they haven't had enough pressure.
2:28
Put on the machine that they Built and so your machine can withstand a category one earthquake, which means you have a category 1 acquisition system, which might just be word-of-mouth, right?
Or whatever, which is just not earth shattering, it's not going to be a lot of people walking in the door because you don't have the engine that's built on the front end.
2:47
Now, that being said, all of these different segments, requiring new skill set which, which is why you as an entrepreneur need to grow, right?
Like like the business is limited by you.
I can tell you that if I started another business and this ended tomorrow, I know I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that it would be a 50 million dollar business within 18 months.
3:09
I can tell you that because I have that skill set now.
I didn't have that skill set before because once you have acquisition, then what's the next thing you need like look.
So like acquisition split into three things is going to be your lead generation, your lead, nurturing your sales right, which is what we solve for one level of service and Jim large right but then what happens?
3:27
Oh shit your classes get really full okay.
Now service level starts dropping.
It's not that the service level really is dropping.
It's more so that the trainer's that you've had didn't have processes in place in order to deliver a higher level of service or maintain the same high level of service over twice or three times.
3:45
As many people, you don't have that problem in the beginning because you didn't have an inflow.
Right and so what needs to happen next you have to scale fulfillment, right?
Yeah.
And so what happens like you're going to move down this line and then what happens after you scale fulfillment?
Okay, now we got more people enjoying the classes, the trainers are pumped up whatever, then what?
4:05
But now, our church starts becoming an issue, right?
Because you haven't solved that problem yet, because you didn't even have to worry about turning because you had so few people walking in the door, it was irrelevant, right?
But once you have a huge amount of people walking in the door, a huge people being in classes, you have to schedule your delivery skill, your team that true leadership comes into play, that's where inspiring the team that's where having commission based structures that make sense that are going to be tied to keep kpi's.
4:29
Right.
Key performance indicators.
Those are all things that are going to drive the growth of the business, right?
Right.
And so to try to shine real this back in so like no no, anything is going to solve your business has problems because it's a faulty mindset of thinking that your business has a problem.
4:50
And then what it is fix, it will be done.
Like I can retire now and this is just faulty mindset of in terms of like how you need to be as an entrepreneur business owner like you Need to continue to grow if you want your business to continue to grow, if you want your business to maintain the only way that no extra problems exist.
5:07
If you decide that you no longer want to grow.
And then it's true.
But then if you're not growing, you're stagnating.
And if you're stagnating in this market, in 2018 and a market that grows faster than ever with more competitors than ever, what do you think's going to happen?
5:22
When you stagnate you die?
Which is why one of the core tenets of General Motors grow or die.
And that's more so targeted at us, the employees, right?
The employees of the companies that we need to grow or die because the company would like, one of the the sub statements under that core tenet, is that the business is growth will be capped By the personal growth of each member, right?
5:42
And so if you don't have that skill set, That's okay, that's what part of growth is, right?
Like, that's the deficit that you're feeling the pressure that you feel of like, oh shit, this is messed up, he's a good thing and if you get stressed out because of that, that's not good because it just shows a disconnect between like that's it's always going to be like that.
6:04
Like you're always going to have the deficit, it's just going to be different and then you're going to learn how to fix it.
Now like the whole solution that we have a legacy that we've already gone through those steps for you so you don't have to have in order.
Miss periods of time of struggling, which is why most people go from zero to like, holy crap, they get tons of Revenue really fast.
6:23
Why do so many?
But why do Jim's either break or blow up with Jim Lunch?
Because we force growth, right?
Because if we solve your skewer, your legion, your lead, nurturing your sales issues, right off the bat boom, it's like you step up to the plate and you have like just like home, like home run pitch after home run pitch, like like ball just being thrown at you and like you have to step up to the plate and swing right?
6:44
And these start cracking home runs and you're like holy We practice just like there's so many runs like there's all these things that are going on and it forces growth and so if you're not willing to grow that your business is not going to succeed, right?
It's not going to succeed in the Long Haul because because there's always going to be problems in your step to accept that, but you can solve those problems faster with community and leverage information Advantage, right?
7:09
If we've got 25 gyms that are doing a million plus, do you think we'd be able to go to those guys and say, hey what you guys doing for retention, right?
That only grab best practices from people who are actually doing best and then give those right.
Like, the reason that GM's have made more money, the gyms that are in like see, he made more money than the gyms that I have will not have pack, right?
7:31
It's because we have we've improved like, my model was the Baseline.
My model was 1.0, right?
I've done a lot of iterations.
I had I seen a decent amount of success, right?
But what we are, what we are producing now.
7:46
Now, the gym model that we have now, like, why are we generating so many million dollar?
Why are we meeting so many million dollar-plus facility so fast because we're iterating constantly, right?
And we can iterate based on the successes of everyone who's here.
Who's willing to look at problems.
8:01
Future problems, solve them together, and then grab the best pieces and make one unbelievable superjet, right?
And that's when you have the power information in community Innovation, you can do that really, really fast, right?
And so like at this point, Jim launch And like more sodium legacies, that's the majority of the business, right?
8:20
Is like it's become a new category of business because there hasn't been a business that's existed like this tomorrow knowledge, right?
We're not Mark marketing agency, we're not a guru business.
We had 20 full-time support.
Like it's not a guru business, it's not a master my business because no one gets up on stage, like a mastermind is where everyone is equal.
8:37
And then everyone says their own part that is not how this business is run, right?
So what is it?
I don't know.
I'm still trying to figure out a word for it.
It's like it's like a white labeled micro Jam model.
It's a information broker.
I don't know how to say it, but basically, we just take the best stuff from the best people only and the give it to everyone and then everyone grows faster.
8:58
That's how you've got people, like Joey Huber who liked by his 16th week of Jim launch had like triple his business from like him doing 40 Grand a month to do in a hundred, twenty thousand a month recurring, right by 16th week.
Now if you would just started your Jim, do you think in the first four months, you'd be able to do that kind of growth of Course not because you wouldn't have the roadmap, right?
9:18
You wouldn't know how to like you have to spend six months figuring out how to do lead generation.
And then you go like, oh shit, I'm getting leads and goes well how do I get them to schedule?
How do I get them in the door, right?
Then you have to figure that out for six months.
Right.
And then after that you're like, okay, well now I'm going in the door but I don't know what to say.
One?
Right?
And then you figure out sales for the next six months after losing.
9:36
And that's where most people get stuck in one of these problems and they got their business dies because they can't figure it out fast enough.
Right?
But that's the advantage of having an information.
Like, So if you have leverage, you have people who have traveled the path already, all you have to do is model it.
Hey guys, real quick.
9:54
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
10:25
Okay.
It's okay.
It was already there but but but the reason that Jim launch does not solve all of the business problems because we were coming in to solve one problem which is acquisition.
And then with that problem does is it exposes the all of the weaknesses that are in your business and that is why Jim Legacy is the majority of my business because that is that is the rest of the equation.
10:50
Why don't like why don't I sell all that up front because Everyone be overwhelmed beyond belief, that's why, because they would be so paralyzed seeing all of the holes that exist in their business, that they be like, I don't even know what to do and they panic and they freeze.
It's the number one thing that happens when people get into legacies.
11:10
They see all of the problems that they didn't know they had and then they're like and that's okay because it happens in sequence.
You do one at a time but just happens to be a portal that stuff all of them there.
She take one at a time, right?
First, we saw fulfillment.
Okay.
11:25
Now we saw fulfillment.
Now, let's all for attention.
Okay.
Now like now my trainers want to get paid more because they're seeing how much money I'm making.
Okay.
Now, we start working on leadership and then we have an essential factor that, right?
Like, like now we have a Like, all of these things are grow, things that you need to do at all.
The ends of really happening is that you see a problem, you sponge the problem, as the entrepreneur to fill the Gap, you learn and acquire the skill.
11:48
And then you teach someone else, the skill that you learn, that is the path of the entrepreneur, right?
We see a problem.
We identify the problem.
We become the sponge to figure out the issue in the solution and then we figure it out.
Well enough that we can teach someone else to do it so that they can permanently do it and then learn to do it even better than we did.
12:07
That's the point, right?
And then as you continue to scale yourself as an entrepreneur, then you start having people that you can start deploying against those problems and saying, hey, can you figure this out?
And that's when you start leading people, and you start empowering people because then the entrepreneur can solve multiple problems at the same time, right?
12:24
Your parents is not going in to like, man, the phones to figure things out but at the stage in the course for most people out, who are watching this video right now, we're listening to this podcast.
A lot of times that's you.
Once you have an infrastructure that's big Of, you can start having key players that can go and do those things for you, right?
12:41
And that's how you can start leveraging time and that's why the rich get richer, right?
Is that like the first Millions, the hardest, the first hundred grains, the hardest, right?
I mean for me, I'll be honest with you, I think the hardest thing for me was my first underground trying to talk about money too much because I don't want to come off braggy.
12:57
But like, like that was the hardest thing.
Because once you have that, you can use that to buy more time back, right?
And then it becomes the snowball of growth You can have because you can shortcut more things you can buy information, which in the beginning, you don't have money to buy information.
13:12
So you have to spend your one resource that you don't have much time and attention.
The only thing you got in the beginning of time and attention and so you spend your time and attention to get just enough money that you can.
Hopefully by enough information, the right kind of information to drag your future forward faster, right?
So you can go through this path faster.
13:28
The number one investment that I've ever made in my entire life has been information.
Because it brought me life.
It bought me time, it brought me attention back.
You're like you're 28 years old.
Have you accomplished so much people ask us that right God I really hope this doesn't sound bracket.
That's not my intention like it's happened because for the first five years of my career, every single extra dollar I had I spent on information, I spent on courses, I spent on training, I spent on the bench I spent on coaching, right?
13:56
I spent all of my money to get me better because I looked at the income that I was having and I was like, I see The growth trajectory that's happening.
It's not fast enough to me that I'm not good enough to get there, right?
And so it takes a certain amount of like just don't have an ego about it.
14:11
You probably suck and that's okay because ice up to you, don't, I mean and we just get better together, so the growth path will never end.
Point number one, no problem.
We'll fix your business or no solution, whatever fix your business because your business will always be broken.
14:28
Provided it is growing period, which means that you will always have a skill set that you are in a deficit of because your business requires you to be someone bigger than you are right now.
If you are grown in the reason so many gyms break or blow up, is because the grid of the entrepreneur who goes through, it is willing to grow.
14:47
When they're confronted with a category 5 earthquake, instead of a category one because all of a sudden their machine is put to the test and they can either point and say you broke my gym or they can say I'm going to fix it because my thumb it sucked and I had no idea my culture sucked and I had no idea everyone at my gym.
15:04
My clients are all, oh, geez and no one will welcome new people in my classes and that's my fault because I am the owner and it's always my fault, right?
It's taking responsibility so all right.
I probably At this video but don't answer.
But I hope I hope this is answer some questions of the fact that like Jim Walsh will blow your gym up, right?
15:25
And we either blow your gym up in terms of like you will make more money than you've ever made.
You make more clients and River had.
But the thing is, is the responsibility will always be on you, right?
Because you're the one who's going to have to grow, always right.
That's why we have 500 plus testimonials.
The good news is that as long as you have the effort and you are not somebody who's a victim and is someone who says, you know what I need to grow.
15:46
That's why that's why my business isn't where I want it to be and you could be making a million dollars a month and if you should still be able to admit that I need to grow.
I have so many deficits right now, right?
So that you're never good enough.
You don't know the moment you stop learning is like the time everything does.
So Yeah, so if any of you guys or anybody was injured lunch?
16:08
Yes I do.
Some things like your business probably did block and that's okay.
And that's why we have Legacy which is the robot, the remainder of the model.
And I love you guys and I really mean that we started this business so that we get the maximum amount of people the maximal results as fast as possible which I think I think we've done a decent job of but we obviously can always work on a lot of things and we're always going to try and get better, but my single promise to you is that we will always try and get better.
16:34
Always and we will fail my last Legacy release.
I'll tell you something, my last Legacy release, which is this was his last Friday.
So I really stepped new stuff all the time I had been planning on this new sales method that we were doing combining one of the other place that we have in Legacy.
16:50
And after like, six weeks of trial and error in like 150 man-hours put on it, it didn't work, right?
Like we just couldn't get it to work but that's part of that's like that's part of progress.
You know what I mean?
Like if you know, it's going to work ahead of time.
It's not an experiment.
Like I think it could work and a lot of our experiments do.
17:09
And that's why the rate of progress in the gym.
Large group is so much faster than anything that I've seen on the market right now because like well willing to fail.
And for us right now we have the resources and the Manpower like to spend my money or my time or my people's time that I'm paying for indirectly to test this stuff out for you.
17:27
So you don't need to incur the cost of progress, we incur the cost of progress because now we have the Versus to do so and then ultimately sell it information at a margin.
So everyone here like we buy information through failure and failed attempts and man-hours.
17:42
And then we sell that information as a winning scratch off ticket that we already know works and then that is the secret of the Legacy business model.
That's all we do.
We go find stuff that works.
We try a whole bunch of times.
We incur that big cost that no individual could incur and then we sell that a margin.
17:59
That's it, that's how it works.
So anyways, guys, I know.
Where's my own searching jacket?
I appreciate you guys.
Giving me your attention all night on Wednesday halfway through the week.
Even though it's winter is really don't think off anyways but I love you all.
Genuinely how we create this company to serve you in a higher way and will always try to do that.
18:21
So that's my promise to you and we had some really huge plays coming up that I will not talk about but they're really huge and they're coming up soon and I'm beyond excited and for those of you who are not in our world, that was a lie.
I'll Taste of a rant that I did not intend, but it just get welled up inside of me.
18:38
So, I appreciate you.
And if any of this was useful for you, you know, she do like you to comment tag a gym owner and lots of love.
Have an amazing time and talk to you soon.
Alright.








0:00
When we're selecting for exceptional salespeople, if you Payless, you have to talk to more people to find them and then you have to have low tolerance in terms of how quickly they make a sale.
And I would say for us, if someone has done a full sale cycle and they haven't closed the deal, I already know that they're not a killer.
0:18
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk, and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I remember I was driving back home and I got this text and it said, hey, we closed two sales today and there had been four people who had walked into the business and I had to pull over to the side of the road because I was.
0:47
I got so emotional.
I got teary because it was the first time that someone else had ever sold something besides me.
And so that was the first moment when I realized that like this could become a business that did not require me.
I want to walk you through one of the most important steps, which is how do you hire excellent sales people and how do you recognize great sales people.
1:08
And so now I've built, I can't tell you the amount of team like sales teams that we've now now built up.
But I can tell you this is going to be specifically about recognizing talent.
And so a couple quick frameworks that I want to go through #1.
When I started in this business, I took every single sale.
1:24
And it's because I was so afraid that somebody would waste the opportunity.
So if you have that fear, I understand where you're coming from.
Second, when I had my first sale, that was not me.
I I just had this emotional breakdown because I was like, Oh my God, this could actually happen.
And I promise you, if you haven't had it happen yet, you will when it does because you realize that this business can actually work without you and other people can make it rain too, right.
1:46
And then I'll tell you a quick story that that illustrate the next point then we'll make.
So as I, you know, hired some sales people.
Now that first salesperson, were they exceptional?
No, but they were able to get the job done later on.
I had my first kind of like killer and his name was Mauro Negretti and he came in, I don't know a year or two into the business, a year into the business Ish, I guess maybe less than that.
2:08
He so quickly was able to assume the sales role and to to show you how laughable this is, he started.
And I was about to start training him and some lady walked in the door and I was like, hey man, like I can take you.
He's like, no, I'm good.
2:23
He's like go to your thing.
He's like fitness restriction, accountability, OK, I'll figure it out.
And he ended up closing this first lady who walked in the door for a paid in full.
And I remember walking in like completely dumb struck.
I was like he didn't even know what the pitch was.
But she walked out giggling happy, so excited to start.
2:40
And what that moment taught me was that it is good to train sales people, but it's better to take great sales people and then just point them in a direction.
And so this has informed a lot of the thinking that I have around talent in general.
2:56
And I'll tell you a couple of frameworks that have informed this, But like if you look at Harvard, Harvard doesn't produce the smartest people.
They select the smartest people and then they put smart professors in front of them.
But like, the base level of intelligence of everyone who's at Harvard is already exceptionally high.
3:15
And so, like, even if the teachers at Harvard were not exceptional, the students are and they would be successful independent of that because their selection is so ridiculous, right.
And so if we can think about our own companies that way and especially if you're in the service business, like look at the biggest service companies out there, like look at McKinsey, look at Bain, look at BCG, look at basically a lot of the finance world are service based businesses a lot of times, right.
3:39
And they're able to do that because they create such a pool to select from that they are able to skim for the best talent, right.
I heard this quote from Esther Kathy, who's the founder of Chick-fil-A.
His HR head said you win the championship in the draft.
3:55
And so it was such a belief that they had about picking the right people, even more so than training.
And I would say that I have moved in that direction of a little bit more nature than nurture.
When it comes to roles, specifically sales especially, there are certain characteristics about building rapport, about having certain, you know, dynamics or energy, whatever you want to say that like Maureen Degrady, when he walked in, he had all of these things and he didn't even know the pitch, but he won that sale off of just pure rapport.
4:26
And so if I'm going to allocate the same level of time to training somebody, I might as well start with somebody who has a much higher base, because I could spend 10 hours to take someone from A2 to a 4 1/2, or I could spend the same 10 hours taking someone from A6 to A9, right?
4:45
And The thing is, I'm also going to get more bang for my buck in terms of my hours of training with somebody who has a natural proclivity for selling compared to somebody who does not.
Real quick, guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
5:04
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do, that would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
5:23
What's interesting about this, and this is just like my observation, is that you just have to be willing to talk to more people in the recruiting process.
And I will say like from a recruiting standpoint, there's there's two kind of things to look out for if you cannot pay super handsomely based on your price points, which you need to maybe fix later.
5:40
But like if you can't pay super well for the sales person, then you need to look harder and you'll need to interview more people and you'll need to probably run ads and use your network.
If you can pay well, the best sales people are already employed And so it comes down to recruiting those sales people from other sales jobs, ideally from companies just like yours, so that they already know a lot of the things coming into it.
6:04
So it decreases the ramp up time for them because all we were really doing is swapping products and the actual sale cycle.
The type of sale is it a transactional sales at a long sales at a software sales at a coaching program.
So whatever it is, right, there's so few variables that were changing that they can immediately jump and go, which also allows you to make a judgement on their proficiency faster.
6:24
And so as a quick side note to this, because this is something that I've given a lot of thought.
If you look at the top sales people and sales trainers and this is going to drive home the point that I was making earlier about it being much of it being born, all right, is that if you look at the top people who are in the space, you look at Jordan Belfort, right?
6:42
You look at Bradley and some people would, would, would say me in term from a selling perspective.
All the guys that I know who have taught sales were exceptional salespeople.
Day one, Bradley started selling cars when he was 18 years old and was the top salesman at 18 years old when he started.
6:59
And he was like, I just found something I was really good at.
Jordan Belford talks about how he didn't know how to train anybody in his book.
And then all of a sudden he for the first time ever wrote out a framework to explain the straight line sale system, which became his book and all that kind of stuff.
But he up to that point, it was just what he naturally did, right?
7:15
And I can tell you in my instance as well, I'd already closed thousands of deals before I even consume my first sales training.
And so, like, I do think that if we are selecting sales people, I think it's much more about selection than it is about training.
The training is to remind them how good they are, not necessarily to make them good.
7:33
All right.
And this is something that has shifted over time for me specifically.
Now, if you're like, well, I suck at sales, you can absolutely put way more time into yourself than a business would reasonably put into an employee.
All right?
Like you have you all the time, so you can train you in all your off hours and you're spending your own time to invest in yourself.
7:49
But from a return on investment perspective, the cost of finding a good salesperson compared to the cost of training a bad or mediocre salesperson is significantly lower.
It's much easier to find the right people than it is to take somebody and then make such a crazy extensive training.
8:05
Unless your entire model is, we just take on every single person who walks in the door.
Like 24 Hour Fitness has this model.
They take on anybody who has a pulse and then they put them through a ridiculous culling process and then 10% of people make it in the 1st 90 days, right?
That's their process.
8:20
And then those people know how to sell, right?
And so they just make ridiculous requirements that almost no one can meet except for exceptional sales people.
And they they let that.
They have obviously training systems or not.
But for the most part, it's teaching them about their process and just having old sales people explain to new sales people some of the tips and tricks that have just like made them better rather than teaching the fundamentals of selling.
8:41
And so back to you.
If you're somebody who's not good at sales, that's OK.
You get there through practice and repetition.
But in terms of like, you have to get good at it because it is, it is core to to running a business, especially a small business, is learning how to close, right.
And so if you take time to learn it, it's OK.
8:58
It's a skill that you're going to add in your arsenal and then it'll allow you to recognize good sales people in the future.
But you can't spend a year trying to train somebody who's not good.
You can spend a year trying to train you, right.
And that's the difference.
And so when we're selecting for exceptional sales people, which is what I'm saying selecting for exceptional sales people, if you pay less, you have to talk to more people to find them and then you have to have low tolerance in terms of how quickly they make a sale.
9:25
And I would say for us, if somebody doesn't close a deal in the first sale cycle, meaning like depending on the the length of the transaction, like some people, you know, there's all transactional sales, some people might be a two week sale cycle or or a one month sale cycle depending on what you're selling.
If someone has done a full sail cycle and they haven't closed the deal, I already know that they're not a killer because every single killer I've ever had closes deals in their first cycle.
9:46
Just like Mario De Grady, like I said earlier, like the killers come in and start killing and then they just get better at killing with the tweaks and the trainings that we have, right.
The guys who don't do that are the ones that are like no, give me another shot.
I like, I just got to learn like you know, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And The thing is just like it just drags on an inevitable consequence.
10:05
And so right now, if you have somebody on your team and you've been in that dragging it on and they're like just barely good enough to stay on the team and every single quarter, you're like, are we going to let go with this guy?
I don't know.
He's not like a winner.
But like, I guess we kind of need him to keep putting some numbers up.
If you get rid of the people who are dragging the team down, the culture of the team will improve.
10:23
And I promise you, whenever you cut the bottom, the top moves up, right.
And then it also will set the new bar for the person who comes in.
It's like, this is how a world class team operates.
Are you up for this?
And The thing is, is the tighter and the higher that team is, the faster they'll point the person out.
10:40
If they don't fit, or they'll immediately accept and glob in the person, they'll become part of the unit.
So if you're looking for salespeople and you're looking to scale the sales team, the best sales people are born, in my opinion, not made.
We can select for those people either through recruiting them directly from people who have very similar businesses to us or we have to interview many more people.
11:01
And the feeling you get in that tingle when you're like, oh God, I really have to have this guy that's when you hire, not when you're like, I mean, I guess this guy could do the job, can't do that.
It's not going to work, right.
And then on the flip side, once that person is in, if they haven't closed the deal on that first cycle, like the longer I've been doing business, the shorter my tolerance for somebody not being exceptional is because every person that has been exceptional, I know immediately.
11:26
And so I just have less and less time where I think maybe they'll turn it around, maybe some more training.
We'll get them there when it's when a lot of times you win the draft on the pick.








0:00
What are you afraid of?
I'm scared that I'll fail at the goal.
Then you can judge how successful you were by how much you adhered to the actions that you committed to the wealthiest people in the world.
See Business as a Game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:19
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
So I run a writing company.
I write for celebrities and CEOs because I took your advice and I started writing for people that have more money and yeah, gosh.
0:40
Solve rich people problems.
They pay better.
Yes, but I also published my own books, and I've traditionally published with publishers and I have done really well.
But in the future, going forward, I want to publish my own book, self publish my own book.
0:56
But I have analysis paralysis because there's so many options to execute a strategy.
Sometimes I don't know which option to pick to just execute the strategy from my next book.
And my first goal is just to sell 1000 e-book copies, not nothing's even grand.
1:13
And then when I settle on a strategy, I get scared because I don't know if it's going to work.
So two questions real quick.
So when you say you have so many different strategy you can pick from, you're talking about different topics for the book.
Is that what you're?
Saying I know the book topic, but different options to execute a plan So I can use quick click funnels to execute a plan to sell 1000 copies.
1:32
Yeah, just selling it.
Yeah, just selling the 1000 copies.
That's that that That's my goal.
I want to be able to sell 1000 copies for my next self published book.
Have you read the book yet?
Have you written the book yet?
No, but the book will be your.
That's the easy part.
I'm a writer, so that's the easy part.
OK, OK, OK.
1:48
Yeah.
You're asking the universe for a guarantee that it will never give you, and you're waiting for a response in order to move forward from a view universe that stays silent.
And so you're just talking to dead people and waiting for a response.
So, like, The thing is, is the person you should be talking to is the marketplace.
2:05
Because they will always respond.
Like when you knock, they will open the door and they will tell you to fuck off.
Or they, you know, open the door and they'll tell you they'll let you in.
But either way, they'll open the door.
Right?
Let's play this out the other way.
What are you afraid of?
Because, like, you seem very upbeat and you see it.
Like, obviously you've written this.
You've written stuff before.
2:21
And so, like, I'm not worried about your writing skill given what you've said so far.
So, like, what are you afraid of?
OK, so let's.
So let's play it out.
So let's say you, you have your book and you pick path one.
It doesn't matter what it is.
Pick path one.
OK, So what?
So what happens?
So you put it on Amazon.
You're like, I'm just going to put it on Amazon and see what happens.
All right.
That's the easy path.
2:37
OK, then what?
Yeah, I'm I'm scared that I won't reach my number.
I'm scared that I'll fail at the goal.
And then then what happens?
But then I still won't know how to do it like and and I'm also scared because I have self published a couple books in the past that didn't reach my goal and I know that feels like I don't want to feel like that again.
2:58
Yeah.
So let me, So let me do this, then let's reframe this because I I have a lot of experience with setting goals, all right.
So I feel pretty confident.
Talk about the topic.
Make the big goals that you set, things that you can absolutely control.
Like you cannot control how many people buy your book, but you can control the amount of actions that you're willing to take that make it unreasonable that you don't sell 1000 copies.
3:17
And so then you can judge how successful you were by how much you adhered to the actions that you committed to.
And so if I were to say you have to sell 10,000 books, not 1000 books, 10,000 books, you have to or you lose your life in 12 months, you just die.
3:35
That's it.
You die.
What would you do?
Knock on every door.
OK.
You have the leads book, right?
You.
They're all that.
There's eight different ways to advertise, right?
And so you know that the more people find out about your stuff, the more people buy it.
And you know, there's only four things you can do, right?
You can talk to people one-on-one.
3:50
You can make content.
You can run ads, right?
Or you can get other affiliates.
You can get referrals once they read your book.
Or you can get agencies, or you can get employees to help you out.
That's what you got.
Yeah.
OK.
And so if you know that you have to take those actions, then wouldn't success be?
4:06
So let's play this out a year.
Let's say that you did absolutely everything on the plan like your plan of advertising of letting people know about it for a year and you did everything and you sold 999 bucks.
Would you consider it a a failure?
No, that would be a win.
4:22
OK.
Now if you sold 90 bucks, I just want to reframe this because the honestly, the thing that you're talking about is something that so many people deal with and it's because you want to control things, you want to control the outcome.
And you're saying I'm only willing to pay this price if there's this outcome.
But you're seeing the outcome as the outcome rather than the skills that you develop along the way is the outcome.
4:40
Because I can promise you this, this will not be the the last book you write.
And so if you get to 100 sales instead of 1000, then what's going to happen realistically is that you will figure out the one thing or two things that actually work to sell books and then I'll say do 100 times more of that.
4:59
And you can either choose to do that on this book or you can choose to do it on the next book.
But the idea of like I, I, I'm setting the stouts because you could have said a million books, it doesn't really matter.
You're just setting it.
You're making up a number and saying this I feel is reasonable for me.
But instead of making the number reasonable, make the actions that would lead to that the reasonable thing.
5:15
Like what can you commit to 4 hours a day of promotion?
Yeah.
OK.
Then make that the commitment and I will.
I'll promise you that if you do that every day, one at the end of the year, you will feel accomplished because you actually did what you said you were going to do.
5:31
And I will tell you that the marketplace will also always recognize someone who puts 4 hours of work every single day into one thing.
Just what I needed.
Thank you.
Just promise me that you'll actually just commit to doing the work.
If you do that, you do like I have to get sell 10,000 books.
What would I actually do to do that?
5:48
Yeah.
Find somebody who has an audience that is relative to the the topics that you're talking about and reach out to that.
Now it's OK if I got one person, they sold 20 books.
OK?
How do I reach out to 1000?
People do all have my audience.
If you do that, you'll probably sell more than 1000 books, but you just got to do it 4 hours every day.
6:06
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good luck with the book.
I know how much work goes into that.
So I have two topics that I kind of want to you know trade with you and you know you title this advice for hard days And it's been it's been tough lately.
About three months ago my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer.
6:25
Two months ago my girlfriend the, the girl that I told whether I was going to marry kind of left.
And then two weeks ago, I travelled to London to speak at Europe's biggest business event.
And on the first day of my arrival, my granddad passed away.
6:42
And so I had to basically speak in front of thousands of people and keep my smile and and then travel back and bury him.
So yesterday I did, I did, I did all of it.
And so the question is, well, you know, yesterday everything just kind of hit me because now I'm back in the office and I'm making the calls and I'm trying to deal with everything.
7:05
But the question is how do I maintain my composure and kind of stay strong, right?
Because it's it's a tough period.
Well, First off, I'm sorry that you're going through that.
That being said, honestly, you've got a lot of good stuff going for you.
So this is AI feel like almost a relatively easier one for me to take given what you just said.
7:23
Like you just asked a question, how do I do something I've already done before, which is you got in front of a thousands of people and gave a presentation and had a smile and you crushed it despite the fact that you had other circumstances, right?
And so you asked the question, how do I do something that I already have done?
7:39
You've already done it.
Like what you're saying is how do I, how do I keep living?
And you keep living by keeping living.
It's the same thing with breakups, right?
It's like I, I I've heard this quote and I, I I heard it from Layla.
I think the first time, like the amount of time it takes you to get over someone.
7:55
Do you know how long it is?
There's a math equation for it there.
There's a great math equation for it.
You'll love it.
It's exactly as long as you decide it takes.
And what I'm going to say is going to sound really dark right now.
So I want you to take this the right way.
Take it away.
I mean it.
All right.
Which is that you just had, you had three deaths, right?
8:12
You had death of a life that you thought you were going to have with a girlfriend and then you had the death of two different grandparents, right?
You had three deaths but.
Well, on the positive sides of my My grandmother is still battling with it.
Oh.
OK, she's still bad.
Well, there.
Wait, we're we're, we're, we're plus one.
All right, so, no, only two deaths now, but sure, we can even play it out.
8:30
All right, On a long enough time rise and she will eventually pass away.
Right.
It's going to happen.
Yeah.
And The thing is, is that you are already standing it like you're asking how do I stand it.
But you are standing here already like you are evidence to the fact you are you.
8:46
You talking to me today is evidence of the success that you're asking for.
You already wondered.
You're showing up and you're working every day.
You come in here to ask questions, actually still trying to grow yourself.
Like the the stuff that you go through become the stories that you will someday tell.
And no one likes epic heroes without epic monsters.
9:04
And so you have to go through the Rocky cutscene.
You have to have those periods of time where you doubt yourself, what everyone else doubts yourself, where the walls are crumbling around you.
Because have you ever read Shoe Dog film a story about Nike?
Even if you haven't, the entire story is just him getting kicked in the nuts for 30 years.
9:20
That's the whole story.
And then he's like, Oh, yeah.
And then I built Nike, right?
And now if he had just said, yeah, I started this company and everyone loved it.
And all my suppliers were on time and I just scaled straight.
And as the money came in, I just bought more inventory.
And then we just went public.
9:35
No one would care because it's not relatable.
And The thing is, is that when you die, the only thing that will remain is the story that people will tell of you.
And so wouldn't you want that to be an epic story?
And so the things that you're going through are required for the person you want to be and for the goals that you have And how you were acting in the present already proves the thing that you're claiming that you want tomorrow, you're going to wake up and you go to work, and the next day you're going to wake up and go to work, And then you're going to text, and it's going to say that your grandmother's cancer is getting worse.
10:04
And what are you going to do?
You're going to get back to work.
You're just going to keep doing the stuff.
Like there's no, there's no magic bullet.
You just keep going because either you keep going or you die, and if you don't die, you succeeded.
10:22
I would just say stop.
Just don't judge yourself on how you feel.
Judge yourself by what you do despite how you feel so you can feel shitty.
You can wake up and have a terrible day and still show up with a smile in front of the 1000 people.
And so if you can do it with 1000 people, you can do it with one.
10:38
And that first one is the person that looks at you in the mirror in the morning.
And and now when it comes to business, I just have a real quick question.
So I built an Instagram audience to over 100,000.
I speak about sales and marketing.
I've been doing it for the past two years.
10:54
I've been posting kind of like every day.
I know the content game.
But the one thing that I'm struggling to balance is you know how you say give, give, give until they ask.
And you know, I love it, but sometimes it it takes a while until they ask, right?
11:09
And cash flow still needs to come in and I run a service based business and so how do I balance it out without tiring my audience?
Because I also, my community is known for, you know, really being in the comments, chatting with me and being there for me.
11:25
So how do I do it?
So if you want to have a one step away from like just giving forever right?
Is that you you give them public selling private, which is when people respond to your stories, right.
When people DM you like those are conversations that they're usually asking or they're like they're basically asked.
11:42
When people ask questions, they're you can still define a scope and say, hey, like at at a certain point I have like, I've given you all this value.
Use all the free stuff if you want.
More than that I'd be happy to hop on a call and see if I can help you more.
Right.
So it's not, it's not like everyone buy this thing right now, right?
11:59
You're not you're not like getting super aggressive at you still publicly just keep pumping all the goodwill and the value that you are and that'll grow your audience and increase goodwill and all of those things.
That's what you want.
You're going to keep doing that.
It's just that you could still have a call to action that's just in the in the in the comment section or put a story up that says, hey, by the way if you need help with that thing, I'm I'm happy to help.
12:19
Like those are those are very light touch things because I understand you got to pay bills.
I understand that.
And so you can put those things out without necessarily damaging the goodwill that I think you're that you're that you're obviously building to hang in there.
You'll be fine.
You'll get through it, and then it'll be a story that you'll someday tell.
Yeah, and thank you for everything that you do, not just for me, but for everyone else, because I think you're marking a new part and that's that's kind of cool.
12:41
I appreciate you both.
Thank you.
What's the one question that you wish you would have asked yourself earlier in your entrepreneurial career when faced with a little bit of uncertainty and direction?
90% of my business is in person online.
12:58
That's the kind of the the direction of whether or not I really want to go towards more specifically, you know, creating almost like a waddify version of kettle bells.
Just trying to figure out what the next step is going to be.
So me asking myself a question is always going to be different than you asking something for you because we're different people, right?
13:16
And we have different goals.
And so everything usually ladders up to like what's the goal, what's the why?
And so like right now, do you have like a monetary goal?
Do you have an impact goal?
And believe me, I have no issues if you're like, I just want to make a certain amount of money.
Like I get that because any of the businesses that you just mentioned.
So whether it's the brick and mortar business or you want to start doing training for those people online or it's doing the WADA fi version, which is basically no service and just providing workouts and whatnot.
13:41
All of those are our potential businesses, but pursuing all of them at the same time will virtually guarantee that you don't succeed at any of them.
And so the biggest issue when you're starting out is just picking the path and being willing to commit to it with the uncertainty that comes with it.
Because like every entrepreneurial path has uncertainty, like, and that's what makes entrepreneurship hard.
14:00
It's literally the not knowing and the pain of suffering, consequences for ignorance, for things that you've learned now that you're like, if I had only known then what I know now, and that's every entrepreneur until the day they die, and it's just wishing that it were different that causes a lot of the struggle.
So which of these things, of the three that I just mentioned, like which of those is the one that like lights you up the most?
14:19
I mean in person training obviously.
Like we live in a small beach town community where everybody knows everybody and it's fun, it's family, it's convenient.
I will say there's that comfort factor that it almost in one scope is very beneficial because it is so comfortable.
But in reality you like comfort is the enemy of achievement and growth.
14:37
So it's like I know like the comfortable side is the in person and it's the community and it's fun, it's family friends whereas the uncomfortable more challenging but also very big picture wise would be the online going full tilt that side.
Now I've I've reached into the gap of like 3 day launches, 4 day launches of you know, small ticket, low ticket offers, but in terms of, you know, trying to scale and make an impact on the world.
15:03
The world's really big.
That's so that's always really hard because I remember I had a we had an event with gym owners and somebody stood up, I said, what's your mission?
They're like, I want to impact 1,000,000 lives.
I was like, did you have a brick and mortar location that has like 200 members?
Like, let's like if you really want to do that, then you would actually just you would you would you would, you'd approach it very differently or you'd have a time rise and that's the rest of your life, right?
15:22
It's like 1 or the other.
If you're like, I want to do that in three years, you wouldn't start with a brick and mortar location.
And so The thing is, is that what you said earlier is like you you feel comfortable and it sounds like you want to grow.
I just want to make sure that's correct before I, like keep going.
OK.
So there there was like an underlying assumption at least that was unspoken.
And I just want to draw attention to it, which was, you know, like the brick and mortar thing is comfortable, it's family, it's friendly, it's fun.
15:43
I'm assuming it's profitable.
I'm assuming you're making some money doing that.
The thing is is is like you could like just doing more of what you're currently doing and saying like how do I open a second location or how do I, you know, like how do I open like 5 locations over the next five years or whatever it is.
That would produce probably just as much of a challenge as going online would, except you already have two years of learnings on how to run that business where you have none in the online space.
16:07
You always just want to stack knowledge within a specific vertical so that you just go deeper and deeper on it because that's where the compounding returns happened.
Like the richest people that I know have been in the same space for 40 years.
They just know everything there is to know about the space and like that's how they've made their money.
You can either open a location that's not necessarily that you beach down and and test your mettle and see how good you are at actually scaling A-Team, you know, hiring somebody else, seeing if somebody else.
16:29
If you can actually incentivize people, build a culture so that people want to work for you, that you can recreate the success and that'll show you whether the success that you had was because of you or because of your ability as a as a businessman, right.
Because like you can be a charismatic razzle dazzle Dancing Bear in any brick and mortar business and it will work.
16:48
It'll work.
Surface of the smile always works right and it's just hard to scale because most people don't care as much as owners do.
But if you can create the model that has the incentives and the training in place and the and the procedures that can consistently create that five out of five experience that allow a second location to have the same amount of success as your first location, then you have something that absolutely can scale and create lots of enterprise value over time.
17:12
So I would say either scale that or basically dial down your in person to as little as humanly possible of your time and then go in on the online thing.
But trying to do both will be very hard because what will happen is you'll start to do some online stuff.
17:28
You'll start to subtraction, your gym will start going down, but that's your main source of income.
Then you'll hop back to the gym, the online will dip and you'll go back and forth.
And so that's why I'm so big on just committing to whatever thing is, because any of them would work, but you have to be all in on it.
The one pillar that I guess I failed to mention was the freedom and flexibility.
17:44
This being a seasonal town where I'm at, it's like being able to essentially create a life where it allows me to own and be at the brick and mortar for say four months out of a year.
And then from there being able to live elsewhere and then from there.
Because at the end of the day, I don't have much responsibility here aside from the just just the gym.
18:01
I don't have anything else really.
That's time me to home.
But that's where I guess my My North Star has been for a long period of.
Time.
Let me just give you step one here.
I own a ton of brick and mortar locations as is.
Like right now I've got 70 stores that I own between different companies that are brick and mortar locations.
18:17
I'm not in any of them.
And so, like, the idea that you need to go online in order to not be in person is a fallacy.
That's not true.
Like, you can own your gym because like if you were to open a second location, you wouldn't be there either, right?
And so the easiest way to test this one point O test is like if you can step out and just not go to the gym for a year, then maybe you can do the other thing.
18:38
And if you haven't gone to the gym for a year, then maybe you'll do the you'll do a second gym.
And so I think no matter what path you do, this is probably the perfect end for this, which is you either are going to do the online thing after you figure out how to outsource the gym, or delegate it and hire people who are awesome, or you decide you're going to do a second location.
18:56
Either way, you're going to have to start with outsourcing the 1st gym.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
19:14
You can check on my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into, and if not, keep enjoying the show.
Let's say I I want to start a business.
I can have a very grand vision of the business.
So like Apple or Microsoft, they they had this vision of like changing the whole world.
19:35
How do we keep working on this business for years when we're worried that it might get outdated because of a new AI or a technology?
Or in other words, what do we do when we think our project might not be useful in the long run?
19:52
I mean, what you're talking about is strategy.
Like these are strategic decisions that we have to make, like you make a big bet on where you think the market is going to be, not where it is today if you're going to go after something that's that big.
But do do you have investors right now?
I'm I'm A1 entrepreneur.
If you say that if you look at the companies that you just referenced, right, like you look at Bezos with Amazon, you look at, you know, Zuckerberg, you look at Microsoft, every one of those guys started well off and well capitalized.
20:19
OK.
So Bezos was a a investment banker from Wall Street.
Bill Gates parents were really well off and he was well off and what not.
Zuckerberg went to Harvard.
Same deal you if you want to really go after that, you would have to try and recreate the conditions.
And I think that right now the likelihood that that happens given your current situation is low.
20:37
And I'm not saying that to dissuade you.
I'm saying because I want to be realistic with you, which is that you need to get your own head above water.
Because like right now if you're if you don't have the ability to make money on your own, right from a entrepreneurial perspective like you need to get your head above water because the only way that you could stick with something for the required amount of time in order for it to become world changing, like we're not talking even a decade.
20:59
I mean those companies they're, you know, 20, Facebook's 20 something years old, right.
Just like context.
And so the only way to get there is be able to breathe while you're going.
And so I think that from a one-on-one perspective, starting starting a simple business that you can generate income on that you know you can, you can learn the basics of business before trying to take on the biggest competitors in the most well capitalized arena.
21:21
Absolutely on your own.
I see.
Not to say that that's impossible, it's just incredibly improbable given the the circumstances that you just laid out.
It would be really romantic for me to be like, dude, go chase your dreams, go do that.
But like, I also would rather have you in a year making money on your own so that you can breathe.
21:38
Because you might find out that if you actually start making money on your own, you might just like that.
Because right now it's just the idea of the status of the dream of that.
Like, it's an amorphous idea, but the amount of pain and suffering that you have to be able to put up with and not make money through that whole period of time really tough.
Wouldn't that cause another issue where because you you decide to choose a problem, choose to solve a problem that is small, like smaller than the grand vision, then you won't be able to scale much.
22:06
That's not necessarily true.
And also, every one of those companies starts small, like Facebook wasn't like we want to be the social media platform for the whole world.
He wanted to map colleges so they start with a niche and then they expand outwards.
And so you'd want to much more narrowly define your problem before you go attack it, because what you're going to try and do is build something that's going to be everything for everyone, and it's going to be nothing for nobody.
22:23
Strategy is prioritization.
It's allocating limited resources against unlimited options.
And so you have unlimited options, but you have very limited resources.
And so in order to be successful, you have to narrow the problem that you're trying to solve.
So you can allocate the small amount of resources you have to adequately solve that problem completely.
22:41
And then from adequately solving that problem completely.
Like Amazon started with books and Facebook started with colleges, right?
You've solved and then you can go adjacent, right?
So right now it just sounds exciting to say this, but like, it's not reality.
You have to pick one problem that you're going to get really good at solving and that's it.
22:56
And then you can have an idea that in the future, but real, real, so many things are going to change between now and then.
And there's so much luck that that that has to concur.
Because if you think about this zooming all the way out, the biggest companies in the world have super well capitalized people who are the best in the world made a good call and had luck.
23:14
Because if you're number one, you have all the things plus luck, Like if you're number one at like in the whole world, it's all of it plus luck.
The market moves in a direction that that you never know, right?
And so I would rather you just stick to a problem that you know you can absolutely solve given the resources you have, learn the skills, make income, and then from there you can go solve an adjacent problem.
23:34
Or you might decide, you know what?
I like this and I'm going to keep going.
With it.
Thank you very much.
That's that was really awesome.
Yeah, you're right.
Good luck, Brad.
Right.
So my question is basically I've been on my fitness coach for the last like three years now and like even progressing from like the 1st 10 KA month like three years ago, you know like 25 KA month a couple months ago.
23:53
And I kind of felt like I got Lonier the more successful I got, even though I do have a pretty big audience now like maybe you went through some of that, something like that or maybe you haven't in that sense.
I was just wondering like maybe how you got over that self removable because I feel like that's kind of holding me back.
24:09
I want to make sure that I'm.
I want to clearly understand your question.
So you're saying that being lonely is the thing that is holding you back?
As much lifestyle changes, obviously hearing on Louise from Lonely, The conversation's a lot different in that sense.
But just like, especially if I'm going in person and being a full time in person training and going in line on top of that, just like a lot more lonely.
24:30
Kind of a lot of different aspects of losing that kind of touch.
Did you see that you just have to join a community then?
Like just straight up like you just need to.
You just need to get around people who are doing the same thing as you.
And so that might mean physically moving to a different area because right now I'm assuming online pay like pays your bills, correct?
24:47
Yeah, right.
So if online pays your bills that you can literally be anywhere in the world.
And so if you where you live right now.
I'm Edmonton on Bird.
I'm planning to move to Kelowna.
It's more of like a fitness town in Canada, like two months time.
I would do that and I would also join a bunch of online communities of people who are like trying to make money in the fitness space because you'll find a ton of other people who are doing the same thing as you that are on the path that are ahead of you.
25:09
They're the same as you that are behind you And you, you can get a little bit of some some fulfillment from helping out some of the people behind you, but you can also get help from the people ahead of you who are, you know, because you show that you'll you'll execute and you'll do what they say and you'll and you'll grow.
But this is the nice news is that this problem is super solved.
25:27
You just got to get around people and you got to be willing to be rejected.
I mean, it's just like fitness sales.
It's just like friend sales.
It's the same thing.
You just go, you go, you go on a bunch of dates.
They're just friend dates, you know, go hang out, go get a lift in.
I mean, it's fitness.
So like, just go ask a bunch of people to get a lift in and you'll see who's cool and you'll see who isn't.
25:42
Worst case scenario, get a workout.
Yeah.
Have you ever just kind of experienced that I have to kind of leveled up and leveled up?
As long as you keep growing, this is not going to stop.
You're going to find new friends and if you keep growing, you'll pass them and then you'll find new friends that are above them and you'll pass them and you'll just keep going.
25:59
And so it just depends on how like what you see the role of friends as in your life.
And so you know, for me, I just want my requirement for friend isn't necessarily that they make the same or more money than me at all, is do they make me better?
Do they make me better?
Do they have my best intentions in heart?
26:15
Just already 2 incredibly difficult things to pass.
But if someone passes both those things, then they are a friend.
And so I would just use that as a limits test.
Like, is this person making me better and do they have my best, you know, incentive that hard?
Yeah.
And how is making friends I guess now because obviously you're a high level and things are different with the social status and all that.
26:37
I mean for four it's probably different.
So do you kind of have the same status now or kind of what is, what is the kind of?
Dude, it's harder for me than it is for you, right?
No, for real it is.
But The thing is, is that most of the my closest friends don't live here.
26:54
Like don't live in the same physical area that I do.
Most of the closest friends that I have live all over and so I see most of my friends once or twice a year and that's it.
And I work in the meantime.
The thing is, is that like the higher up you go here, like and I'll just tell you something like from my level, whatever you want to call that.
27:11
All the friends I have, everyone complete.
Like there is 0 social obligations for anything, like none.
And if I don't respond to a text for three days, there is zero drama.
It's not even acknowledged.
It's just we know that busy people understand that busy people are doing shit.
And so if everyone you have, everyone who's who's in your world understands that you're trying to take this hill, then if they're truly your friend then they want you to take the hill more than they want you to respond to their text or come out with them for the weekend.
27:39
Like I just got invited to a seven day thing that with a with a a couple friend that Leila and I both really, really adore.
But we'll probably not be able to do it because we have so much stuff that we were were that we're doing at that same time.
And I really want to go, but I also really want to do this other stuff.
27:55
And I know that I will feel worse about myself if I don't have this other stuff done.
And so we're going to say that I can't go and that's going to be it.
And they're not going to hold it against me.
And so until you find friends who are 100% aligned with you, achieving your goals, who are making you better and want you to hit your goals, then you just keep looking.
28:15
But The thing is, like, everybody goes through the period that you're at.
Like, I think, I I think I didn't made, I wrote a tweet about this, but like there was this lonely period that always happens when you start growing because what happens is that you're too big for the old friend group, but you're not quite big enough for the group that you want to get into, right.
28:32
So you kind of have this path in the middle where you just kind of like keep trudging along.
But like every single person who's accomplished anything material has been in your exact same shoes.
And you just keep going and you keep going.
You keep networking.
You enter, you go into the communities.
You see the people who are adding value to those communities, and you message them.
28:48
You find the givers, because givers recognize givers almost immediately.
You can see the people who are always giving more above and beyond, and you can understand they get the game.
And so, like, in that first meeting, if they're like, like, let me see if I can do this for you.
Let me, like, take care of this for you.
Let me help you in this way rather than like, hey, could you help me with this?
29:06
Like, wrong person.
But if you just start by giving the whole bunch of people who are where you want to be, you'll get more back.
Even if 9 out of 10 don't give you anything back, provide shit loads of value.
People will message you and they'd be like, hey, let's hop on a zoom, let's grab a zoom lunch, whatever.
And so, like you can have a ton of friend dates or whatever, that you meet people and see if they have game.
29:24
And if they have game, then you keep in touch because you're making them better too.
I appreciate everything.
You bet, brother.
Kill the content games.
After doing full time entrepreneurship for three years and you know raising the family, I got 4/4 small children all under the age of five.
29:44
I found myself in a very hard position where I had to go back to a nine to five.
I would say entrepreneurship is like, like you said, it's hard and and I know what hard feels like.
But after discussing it with my wife, like I felt like this was like the right decision after getting myself into business debt and other things like that.
30:04
And I didn't ever have a paycheck to live on, you know, So how do I know when it's like like how do I get back into entrepreneurship?
Like now I'm just running my stuff on the side.
So for example, right when I was laid off three years ago, I was doing taxes and I just doing like bookkeeping.
30:23
Then I worked my way up starting to offer accounting services and then I levelled up and I started look going after higher leverage like now I started doing CFO services and I went through that Valley of Despair thing and that's probably why I'm at where I'm at right now, you know, just being completely honest and.
30:44
I I appreciate you being candid and upfront about it, because otherwise this wouldn't be very valuable because you'd tell me a bunch of fake information and I'll give you a response to fake information.
It wouldn't matter for either of us.
So thank you for being honest.
That being said, you're not.
Honestly, you're in a pretty good spot and I'll tell you why.
So you have a valuable skill set that will always be in demand because a lot of people don't want to do money stuff.
31:05
So people don't do budgets, people don't do bookkeeping, people don't do CFO work.
You want to do financials, projections, forecasts, no one wants to do any of that stuff and you do and you're good at it.
So presumably you're good at because you keep doing it.
Right.
I'll just, I'll, I'll leave it at that.
I'm going to assume that for for the sake of our call, right.
So one, I think it was wise that you got a job because you have a wife, you have 4 kids.
31:24
I think that was a smart noggin move.
OK.
Now that being said, there is going to be a conversation you probably have to have with your wife about what?
Because your nights and weekends either are going to have to go to family or they're going to have to go to the new thing.
And so I think that you need to have a candid conversation with her and say listen my and I'm just, I'm, I'm putting words in your mouth here.
31:47
So this is, if I were in your shoes, I'd say as a man, my primary drive is to provide.
And right now, I feel like I'm failing you.
And I want to lead our children by example so that when they are 20 or 30 and they're thinking about making that jump, I can speak to it because I wasn't afraid to take the risk again.
32:11
Because in gymnastics, as soon as you fall off the pommel horse, even if you twist or break your ankle, you know what they do?
They try and get you right back on the horse again.
And they do that because if you don't and you take enough time off, you start developing these fears around getting back on.
You never get on again.
And so they want you to get back on the horse right now.
32:26
I think you got bucked by the entrepreneurial horse.
And that's OK.
It happens.
It's part of the game, right?
Like, it's the, it's the the scene in Rocky 17 or whatever fucking Rocky it is where he's like, it's not about how hard you can hit about, but it's about how hard you can get hit and keep going forward, right.
And so you got hit big, you know, big whoop.
32:44
Everybody gets hit.
Everyone fucking loses all the time.
I lost everything twice before this time, right?
And so like you've lost everything once.
You still, you still owe me one, right.
You tell your wife I said that and so let's get into tactics.
All right.
So right now the, in my opinion, the issue that you miss is you didn't know how to advertise, You didn't know how to promote.
33:04
And so you have the service.
You just got to let people know about it.
And so you were full time as an entrepreneur, but you probably weren't spending four hours a day promoting.
And so when you are right and so that's that's what you need to do.
So nights and weekends for you is you log out of work, go home, kiss the dog high, 5 the kids, and then you spend 4 hours promoting and promoting is you make content, you reach out to people or you run ads and given your financial situation, it's going to be making content and reaching out to people.
33:33
That's it.
Literally, if that's what you're You start your timer 4 hours, you make content, you reach out to people and you do that for four straight hours every day You do that, you're going to have more business in the next six months than you know what to do with.
That's it.
That's all you have to do.
Like you're The thing is that you're in a good spot because you have the skill that there's already demand.
33:49
Like I don't have to test your idea.
You're trying to provide bookkeeping services.
It's a commoditized service.
Like if you do a good job, you're on time.
Like you are responsive, you deliver things on the 1st of the month, people will want to do business with you and they'll stay with you.
And so you just got to let people know about it faster because I'm guessing that your rate was based on referrals.
34:06
You had one or two customers, maybe three.
And by the time you get one new referral every two or three months, one would drop and you stayed there until eventually you couldn't, right.
I'm guessing that was the story, right.
So you just need to increase your sales velocity, which means you got a lot more people know about it and you got to learn how to sell because it was just you, right?
Did you have any employees?
34:22
No, I had a virtual assistant during tax season.
But yeah, it was mainly just me.
Yeah.
Then you have the easiest business in the world because 100% of the revenue is profit, right?
It's just you for now.
And so you can absolutely get yourself to 1020 accounting clients and you're going to be working like a dog at this point, but you'll be making way more than you are now.
34:41
And then you'll have new problems because then your wife's like, I don't see you anymore.
You're like, yeah, but now we're making three times of money and I will find a way to use the money to buy back some time.
And you can do that.
But ideal, like you're you're like, you already have the hard shit done.
You're like 6 months away.
Seriously.
Like I don't normally say that like you're six months away.
34:56
You got to, you got to reach out to, let's call it, let's call it, 10,000 people.
You reach out to 10,000 people, you'll have the, you'll have the business you want.
Because I'm telling you right now, as a business owner, dude, the amount of crappy accountants and bookkeepers that are out there outnumber the good ones 100 to one.
35:14
Like, no one's stoked about their bookkeeper.
So like, like, it's not hard.
And like think about it.
Those guys don't, like, those guys suffer the same issue that you have because they don't know how to promote themselves.
They're not business people.
They're bean counters and so like you, you've been, you've been in bean counter mode and you got to get in, you got to get in promoter mode, especially as a as a solo entrepreneur.
35:32
It's all promotion in the beginning.
So would you suggest just mainly cold outreach or should I try to do content or just go straight cold outreach?
You can do both.
I mean do one post a day, one post a day, see who interacts with it, So who likes it, who comments on it.
You can message all those people and then you can reach out as well.
But The thing is, is with your profession, finding someone who has an adjacent audience.
35:52
So you know if someone who's an HR company or recruiting company, right?
Like if you can figure out a way to just work with them, they already have a whole engine of people coming in and just see if you can just get off the backside and give them a kickback just for intros.
Like that's a super productive way of of leveraging the amount of reach outs.
36:10
Like you can just reach out to 10,000 business owners and you'll you'll get your nut.
But you can probably reach out to 1000 B to B businesses and see if you can structure a partnership with them that they can refer you business and you refer it back to them.
Yes, content and outreach you and real talk the content is probably not in the beginning where you're going to get the majority of your business.
36:26
I just want to just prepare you for that.
But the reason that you're going to be making the content in the beginning is that.
So when you do reach out, people will go to your page and they will consume your content and then they will decide to respond based on the quality.
So think about that stuff as lead nurture more than lead Gen. in the beginning.
36:43
Over time you'll get better at it.
It'll start generating business, but it might take you a year or two like it takes time to get good at that.
You've inspired me and that's the reason why I took the jump in the beginning, so I appreciate you.
Well, I appreciate you for taking the jump and I will ask you to trust me one more time, which is that 4 hours a day.
Have the conversation with your wife, 10,000 reach outs and let me know in six months.
37:02
She's watching, so she knows, all right.
Let Celeste take his 10,000 reach outs.
That's it.
Like on the other side of 10,000 reach outs is you making the money that you want to make and having the skill of promotion and sales.
That's it.
I just want you to know, and I and I hope that mosination exists here for this one reason, which is that like you are not alone, there are other people going through it and so Despite that it may feel lonely.
37:23
You are not alone keeping one of 0.








0:00
A lot of literature and videos and blog posts talk about setting goals, and I hate almost all.
What I'm going to walk you through is our four step goal setting process.
And I promise you, it's probably not what you have seen in the past from basically another company.
0:17
Because I actually didn't take how we set goals from any business books.
I actually took it from a science book. #1 is what problem are we solving?
A lot of times you realize you're not solving a problem at all, which means you probably don't need to do it.
This is especially true the lower in the organization it goes, because people who are lower down in the org tend to not be as connected to the overarching picture of the company.
0:36
Simple example, most goals have to be chunked up to one of three things.
Number one, they're going to help us get more customers, #2 is that it's going to help us make customers worth more and #3 it's going to increase the enterprise value of the company.
If you can't articulate why the goal is going to do that, then you shouldn't do it.
0:54
So number one, pick what problem you're actually trying to solve.
Simple example, if it decreases the page load times on all of our sites, we will get more leads, we get more leads, we get more customers, etcetera.
If it improves the sign on process for customers to have access to something, that will mean we have fewer customers churn, which means we will make customers more valuable.
1:16
If you can't tie how your department and the function that you have either gets us more customers, makes them worth more, increase the enterprise value of the business means you don't understand your job.
And if you're the entrepreneur, the head of the department that you don't know how you're actually providing value of the business, breaking that down is the 1st and most important part of goal setting.
1:32
If this process actually makes you think that, it means you're doing it right.
Because if you can just knock out your goals really, really fast, it probably means you haven't thought through them well enough #2 We create a hypothesis.
And the reason for that is when you set a goal, usually it's like we want to do this thing right?
1:47
Well, you're not actually trying to do the thing, you're hoping that something's going to happen if you do the thing.
We like to define both of those variables in the hypothesis.
For example, if I wanted to have a sales goal, it might say something like If I decrease the time to call leads from 30 minutes to 5 minutes, we will get a higher percentage of leads to book calls.
2:05
That's literally the hardest part of this whole thing is what is the hypothesis that you're trying to test?
Because whenever we actually do something to business, we're not guaranteeing the outcome and we're not guaranteed from the business that it's going to create the result we want.
I'm sure you've tried plenty of things that have been goals and it didn't result in the thing that you wanted, which is why you shouldn't state it as a goal necessarily, but as a hypothesis, what you think will happen.
2:25
Once you have the what problem we solve in your hypothesis of how you're going to solve it, then you only have two variables that you have to determine.
One is what's the thing I'm going to do, which is the activity.
That's the input.
And then what do I think is going to happen, which is the output #3, what are we going to do?
We are going to call leads within 5 minutes, right?
2:42
That is the input.
We checked that box.
Great output is we will get a higher percentage of leads to schedule or show.
So you have your baseline of the input, which is today we're at 37 minutes and we want to be at 5.
That's the input change.
The output change is going to be, we go from 50% scheduled to 70% scheduled.
That's the output change.
2:59
That is a goal.
That is what we call the before phase.
The after phase only has two columns and that's what you review.
After the quarter is done or the year is over #4.
What do we think is going to happen?
You say, OK, did I do the thing?
Did I do the input?
Did we actually decrease the call time to 5 minutes?
3:16
If we did, then that's a green.
And here's where this is important.
We may have decreased the call time to under 5 minutes, but we may not have increased the scheduling at all.
That's why it's a hypothesis.
Now did what I wanted to have happen actually happened and then that is where you can put comments here.
And So what we ended up doing is we ended up getting it down to 7 minutes and it didn't improve it at all.
3:35
At this point we don't need to get it down to five because we didn't have any directional improvement.
It takes a lot of 0 to one, a lot of shiny objects, a lot of new things, a lot of trial and error, a lot of iterate, iterate, iterate until something clicks in the beginning.
But big businesses often grow by a series of 1% improvements, 1%, one percent, 1%.
3:53
Because you've seen the Excel math when you're like, well, if I only got 10% more people to opt in and I got 15% more people to schedule and I got 20% more people to show and I closed 1 from 25% to 35%.
You Add all this together and all of a sudden you tripled the business.
And The thing is, is that everyone gets so distracted with like the I'm going to reinvent the wheel rather than just making the wheel a little smoother.
4:13
So it runs fast.
And so a lot of times, especially in the 510 fifteen, $20 million top line range, that's some of the systems we have to put in place because that's how the big boys play.
They beat you because they actually can do 100 tiny increments.
I think Jim launch grew 40% last year and we did nothing new.
All we did was we did everything we were currently doing a little bit better.
4:30
If you do that year after year after year, you become very hard to beat because people will see your marketing on the outside.
They'll try and copy your pages, They'll try and copy your emails and one it won't be you, so it won't matter because it's not your story.
But they don't know all the internal standard operating procedures, the internal metrics that you guys are tracking that actually create the growth in the company.
4:49
And a lot of times in the early business, just measuring metrics may be the important goal for the quarter so that you can then improve it.
Let's say you're a videographer and a marketing department, right?
Each of these goals should start from the top down.
So if we say these are our five goals as a company, the department heads are going to probably have multiple activities to make the first hypothesis true or not.
5:09
I like to have everybody as far down in the organization do this because it actually causes you to think about why you do what you do.
A lot of times employees lose motivation because they don't know how.
What they do every day ties into the bigger picture of how the company grows and makes more money.
With a videographer example, they're like, well, what do I do?
5:26
Like what problem am I solving?
The problem is get more customers.
They might not think about it that way, but that's the goal.
Well, my hypothesis this is either we might say it's a volume thing, which is if I double the amount of shorts I make, then we will get more traffic to our website from our organic content.
5:41
And at the end of the quarter, did you make twice as many shorts?
OK, Green.
Fantastic.
Did that result in more link clicks on the site?
Oh, it did it, huh.
Interesting.
I wonder what would do it.
OK, we need to create more content that's more story based.
5:56
Great, go back to the beginning.
If we create more story based content, we will get more link clicks to website.
That's why goal setting, if done right, should take work because it makes you think why am I even doing what I'm doing?
And if you don't take like a day for a whole quarter to think, why am I even bothering to do this, then why are you bothering to do it without understanding what you're trying to improve?
6:15
And The thing is, is if you think this way, as a teammate or an entrepreneur, I promise you you will be so much more valuable to your company if you can Even they think like a business owner, and this is how a good business owner should think.
And if you can approach whoever runs your company with this model, you may find that they will see you differently because they're like, wow, Timmy, who's making these video clips, is actually thinking about what I care about, which is how I'm going to get more customers, Whatever.
6:39
The second part of the statement is if you know what you're actually trying to accomplish in the business, then it makes a lot easier what problem we're solving, What's our hypothesis?
What are we going to do?
What do we think is going to happen?
Did we do it?
Did it happen?
That's it.
And so that has been the simplest goal setting framework that we've used.
We use this across all portfolio companies.
That's what we do across everything.
6:55
And it's been the simplest thing that I've seen, I haven't seen anywhere else.
It's worked for us and maybe it'll work for you.








0:00
I will do enough work that there is nothing left to be done.
And that means that I can also do fewer things, which means I have to be more selective about the things that I choose to do.
But when I do them, they will be done well and they will be done.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:19
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Today we're going to go through as many of your lessons as we can in about 3 hours, and we're going to see what we can get through.
First one, a friendly reminder that in three generations, everyone who knew us will be dead, including the people whose opinions stopped you from doing what you wanted all along.
0:39
Imagine that someone you know achieves every dream and hits every goal they have.
Years later, they get old and die two years after that.
How much do you care about?
As much as everyone else will, If you accomplish your goals and dreams, do it for you.
So I think about death all the time because it's it's probably the central theme.
1:00
It's probably the thing that I think the most about.
And I think that influences how I see time and also how I think how it how it influences agency, like what actions I'm willing to take despite the judgement of others.
And so a lot of times, and it might be because I have more insecurity than everyone that I think, like, man, I want to do this thing.
1:17
And then I hear all these other voices of reasons why I shouldn't do it or why somebody else will say, like, that's bad or you're bad, or like, that's wrong, whatever.
And so I think I've had to come up with a lot of these devices to get around my own insecurities, to take action despite those insecurities.
And the biggest one that I think about is that it doesn't matter whether I achieve all of my goals or I don't achieve all of the goals, in three generations I'll be forgotten.
1:40
And the only people who were naysaying against me will also be dead.
And so then it's like, just do it for me.
And then when I wake up every day, there's only one voice I have to listen to.
But that means that you need to be able to work out what to do from first principles.
2:01
You now no longer have societal norms or assistants or role models or archetypes or expectations.
And that's also difficult in a different way.
I think that the more you flex whatever that muscle is of like independent thinking, the more it becomes the default way that you think.
2:19
And then everyone else's action is to start looking more and more insane to you.
What?
Like, what's an example of that that you can think of?
I mean, shoot, just the most basic ones of like, living the life that you don't want, not wearing what you want to wear, not dating who you want to date, not living where you want to live.
2:36
Like you're living at home and you want to move and your parents say no and you don't make the move.
Or you're dating a girl because she's socially accepted, you know, by your friend group.
She's safe, but like, there's always some distance in between you.
But you're like, I don't want to risk it, right?
Or like you're in the the job and every day you go there and you're like, I mean it's OK.
2:56
And the idea of just living an OK life just sounds so terrifying to me that the freedom to fail over and over again is still more fulfilling to me.
At least it feels like it's real then walking through kind of on autopilot.
And so I think that's a lot of the choices that other people make that seem insane to me now.
3:15
But didn't didn't seem insane to me a decade ago, you know what I mean?
I think it's just like as you practice taking more agency, taking more responsibility for the decisions, then you just get better and better at it.
And then it just seems more and more ridiculous.
You're like, you're like, I just can't quit my job.
And you're like, why?
Like, no, physically, why?
3:30
Like, why can't you quit your job?
Like, like, you know what I mean?
They start hyperventilating and it's like, you could, could you move in with your parents?
Could you move in with a friend?
Could you split rent?
I mean, I could, but I mean other people who are going to die in 100 years would think what.
3:47
And one of my favorite ones is, and I say this all the time to Layla, like whenever we're getting to some sort of, like mini complaint, it's like, you know, if you zoom out far enough, you can't see the Earth.
So we're talking about like, oh man, they're going to mess up this order on this vendor's duple.
But I was like, you know, if you zoom out far enough, you can't see the Earth.
4:03
It's just like, it just puts everything immediately into perspective of how ridiculous some of the things that we're concerned about are.
Sean Purry's got this thing where he says don't follow what most people do because you don't want the results that most people get.
The average person is obese, likely to be divorced, and has less than 1K in the bank.
4:20
It feels safe to do what everyone else is doing, but it's actually a terrible decision.
It's like the best way to guarantee to not have the life that you want is to do what everyone else is doing, unless you want what everyone else has with no one, which no one does.
Yeah, it's being able to think for yourself and and treating it like a muscle, I think is a smart way to consider it because in the beginning it's really, really hard.
4:45
You've been resting on societal norms and the way you've dealt with past trauma and your parents expectations and what all of your friends do and what's accepted and all of this stuff for so long that when it first comes to you needing to step on that muscle, it's like trying to move your ears.
5:00
Like all humans have got muscles that can move their ears, but because no one works it as a child, they just atrophy away.
And this is the ear muscle of personal growth.
I think I had a lot of practice with it because I had a so like a lot of people have many voices that they hear that they feel are judging them, right.
5:23
They have their friends, they have their uncle, they have their siblings, they have their cousins, Co workers, whatever.
I think I had just one voice that I heard really loudly.
And I was, I was talking to one of our one of our employees the other day.
And I was trying to put in perspective a younger guy.
And I was like, I imagine how much you care about your mother's opinion and your father's opinion and your and all of those other people.
5:45
I was like, and now imagine that there's literally only one because I had no siblings.
I basically had no mother.
I had just a father.
And so, like, his approval was literally everything and he disapproved of the path that I wanted to take in my life.
And so I think a lot of these mental faculties or these little frameworks or these isms just came from, like, how can I combat this incredibly booming voice in the background?
6:10
Because, like, when I look at what I was doing at the time, like I was a consultant, I, you know, I graduated in three years, I took the consulting job, I did all the things.
But the craziest thing was at the moment that my father was most proud of me and he approved of my life.
The most was when I was the saddest.
And so that's when I was like maybe his approval isn't the right way to feel good about life.
6:30
And so that that started basically the six month journey of from when I decided that I wanted to change my life till when I changed it.
And I think that like as you become more able or more potent or higher agency that timeline between when you decide you want to do something and when you actually do it just continues to compress, right?
6:48
Like now if I want to change something, I'm like let's change it.
Like done.
I like, I we walk out of the things like we're never going to do that podcast together.
I don't want to talk to this person again or whatever it is right.
Whereas before it's like, OK, I have to, I have to sleep on it.
I have to really think about it and like how am I going to, It's like why do I care about how I'm going to say it.
This is what it is done and it's just like that timeline is compressed.
7:05
But the hardest one for me, like the first one was by far the hardest and everyone since then.
The nice thing is that no matter how difficult your circumstance is, if you have like the bigger the wall that you have to get through is, as soon as you get past that one big wall, you then can use that wall.
Is the evidence for why you can jump over the next wall because that will be the biggest one.
7:23
And so like after I did quit my job and left my house and and left Baltimore and didn't tell my dad until I was across the country because I was so afraid.
Like people think of me as like some big alpha, whatever dude.
I was like I was such.
I was so afraid of my father's disapproval that I didn't tell him until I physically left the state.
7:39
Like like I'm not like think about that.
Like I wasn't even just one state over.
I was like 5 states over.
And then I was like, hey, by the way, I'm going to California.
And he was like, well, let's come over.
We'll talk about it.
And I was like, I'm in Ohio.
Yeah, Yeah.
Then obviously he had a different reaction, right.
7:55
But, like, but then after that, it was like, what do I have to do now?
It's like, oh, I gotta, I gotta sell strangers.
And I was like, I told my dad I didn't want to do what he wanted.
How hard could this be?
And so like it, it then becomes this one huge proof point.
So the bigger the the dragon is that you have to slay, the more evidence you have that you can slay the next dragon.
8:13
And I think that is if there's ever been a a good point for why getting over the one first hard one is so hard, is that it will then give you the reinforcement you can do whatever you need to do next.
Yeah, The life you want is on the other side of a few hard conversations, and you're living a life you hate because you're too afraid to have them.
8:32
I think about that a lot because like whenever I feel anxious or insecure or angry or sad, I'm like, what conversation do I need to have that I'm not having?
And so then and usually if I just think for not that long, I'm like, this is the conversation I've been putting off.
8:50
And then, you know, I'm not the the, the, the poster child of mental health.
And so I'll just call myself a Pansy for not having the conversation.
And then and then I just have it.
And so again, I think it's like I need to have this conversation and the time between when I have it versus or when I when I know I need to have it, when I actually have it, just cause continues to compress.
9:09
And if you've ever had like a a breakup or a employee firing one of the OR a quitting.
If you're an employee like these things that you dread.
I don't know if you noticed it, but like the day you do it, the moment after you do it, I'm like, how many other conversations can I have?
Like.
I'm going to be like, I'm like.
I'm like, yeah, totally, 'cause.
9:25
I'm a serial killer for awkward conversations.
When I so like the next series of hard conversations that I had after I I left home was actually like years later.
So I had I had multiple partners in what I said.
I had AI had a partner in one of my gyms.
I had a partner in four other gyms.
9:43
I had a partner in a Cairo and dental marketing agency, and all of them relied on me to make money.
And so all of their livelihoods were still dependent on me.
But I was splitting everything and it was just, it was, it was horrible for me at the time.
And so I remember when I I ended up getting in a DUI and you know, I talked to a a, a performance coach or whatever and he was like your stress and these conversations could literally kill you.
10:09
He's like they almost did.
So I I got in a head on collision at 60 miles an hour and I walked away.
No injuries, but it was like my wake up call but not to stop drinking.
It was my wake up call that I needed to have these conversations and that's what I was avoiding when I was drinking.
It wasn't the alcohol, it was what were the things that I'm avoiding that I'm using alcohol to get away from.
10:26
And so the next day I had the first conversation with the first partner.
And it was horrible.
The moment I was done, I was like, I got to call the other guy and I called the other one.
I was like, this is how it is.
And and The thing is, is I had this backstop of my death of like, you almost just died because you wouldn't have this conversation.
10:46
And so then it just gave me this courage to just be like, like, and whatever the reaction was, I was like, I'd rather be alive.
Like that was it.
And so it's it's weird though, because death has been this really recurring theme in my life that, like, the same thing happened when I was like, the only thing that gave me enough balls to stand up to my dad, To be fair, from a distance from the car, when I was driving halfway across the country, like, let's not make one, let's not make me into too big of a hero.
11:07
Here was the idea that, like, I started thinking like every day I was like, I hope I don't wake up, you know what I mean?
And that was the that was, that was the thing where I was like this is a big enough problem that like if you don't want to wake up then.
What have you got to lose?
11:23
Exactly.
And that was it.
And I was like, I have nothing to lose.
And that was when that was when I think in the last podcast we talked about this where it's like if everybody who who's like at the bottom and feels like they have nothing going for them reframe that as I have nothing going for me.
11:41
Which also means that I have nothing to lose by taking action, it makes you a much more dangerous person.
And I think that was the flip that I've had repeatedly shown to me in my life that allowed me to take the step that I was afraid to take.
Have I told you about the region?
11:57
Beta Paradox?
Have you seen that one?
OK, so this is interesting.
So imagine that you had to go a mile or less, and if you did a mile a mile, if you had to travel a mile or less, you would walk it.
And if you had to go more than a mile, you would drive it.
12:14
So paradoxically, you would go 2 miles quicker than you would go one mile if you follow that rule.
The important insight here is that if you only take action when things cross a certain threshold of Vadnais, sometimes better things can feel worse than worse things.
12:30
Oh yeah, So if you look around and you see that people are stuck in region beta, this zone of comfortable complacency, right, it's the guy that sticks in his just OK job because his boss isn't too much of a Dick.
But the pay isn't that good and he's not really that passionate.
But it's all right.
Whatever, whatever.
The person that stays in the acceptable relationship, they're not that fired up, but they're not really in love and their partner's not really got much alignment with their interests.
12:53
Or the person that stays in A happy apartment and there's a bit of mould in the ceiling, but it's cheap and it's in a good area of town or whatever.
All of these people would be better off if their situations were worse, because it would give them the activation energy to kick them out of the bottom, and that only regret would be not doing it sooner.
13:11
Did I love that When I.
So it's funny because if I look back on the instances that were the most painful in my life, every single one of them, without fail, has created a disproportionate gain, right?
13:27
Like the most painful thing early on was for me was quitting my job and leaving, you know, leaving my dad, basically.
And then that created the, you know, my first, my first business in the gyms and all of that stuff, you know, getting into the DUI, the head on collision and like that whole situation got me out of all of these failed partnerships that I wasn't willing to do.
13:48
But in the in the moment I was like, I'm such a failure.
Like I suck at everything.
But that gave me the springboard when I lost everything the first time after that.
That then gave me like the idea that I needed to change the business model around, right.
14:05
And that's what switched me into the licensing model, right?
And so like each of these and then that became, you know, the, the.
First fortune.
This is kind of like alchemy, like turning something which is worse than useless into something that's as precious and useful as possible.
14:21
You know, I'm, I'm sure you know, the parable of the, you know, the man in the sun and he like, buys the sun a horse and then it falls and he breaks the leg.
And then they're like, oh, it's so sad.
And then the army comes, then the sun doesn't die.
And then it's like, oh, it's how great, right.
And so it's one of those really interesting ones where like whatever negative situation and this is probably good for the audience, but like if you think back to all the negative situations you had like the really, really bad ones, when you expand the time horizon, most times they become net wins.
14:45
And so then it just means that, like, if you're in a really tough time right now, you just got to wait.
And then you get and then you get your reference point back on all the things that changed as a result.
Because most times when shit is bad, it can't get worse.
So then you feel like, well, it can't get worse than this.
15:03
And then your action threshold decreases and you take and you do all the things you know you should have done anyways.
And so it's like we have this big stack of should do's and we just wait until it's 2 miles.
Yep.
And then you just you're.
Like you just get in the car like.
The firing conversation and you're like, well, I just fired one person or like I just ended one partnership.
I just broke up with one girl or whatever it is.
15:19
And you're like, who else do I need to talk to today really like And then in like a like you have these rapid periods of growth that happen and then you have the next web of comfort because it's way better than you were before.
And I think it's.
I wonder this.
This is more just like an open thought, but like I wonder how long like more successful people stay in that next plateau.
15:40
Like I wonder if their threshold for?
Action stays low.
Yeah, they're like, like, I'm getting comfort.
Like how quickly they get comfortable into, like I need to change.
I need to get better.
Next one, the heaviest things in life aren't iron and gold, but unmade decisions.
15:56
The reason you are stressed is that you have decisions to make and you're not making them.
It's a good quote.
You said it.
You said it.
I think a lot of times the decisions that we make are predicated on the on the conversations we need to have because usually like that it and what's interesting is like you can define commitment by eliminating alternatives.
16:26
So if you're committed, you've eliminated alternative actions, right?
Like you can say I'm committed but until you eliminate other options you're not committed.
There's always a get out of jail frequently.
And so a lot of people make decisions to end relationships, to quit their job, to start the new thing, but they don't become committed to the decision until they remove the other options and then you're forced to take action on it.
16:48
And so I think actually defining those two two different things now you could define, you know, decision is to kill off like de cadere from Latin, but from a, from an, from a colloquial thing.
I think there are two different instances.
It's like I need to change this and then I do change it and the making the decision is when it becomes a commitment.
17:07
Why are unmade decisions so heavy?
I think at least for me, it's because I have this hamster wheel on the my back of my mind where I keep playing out different scenarios and so I keep thinking like, well, maybe maybe I need to change what I'm currently doing.
Maybe Maybe if I just rethought like 'cause I'm I'm a big frame guy, so I'm like, maybe I just need to be thinking about this differently, right?
17:25
Maybe if I zoom all the way out, the earth doesn't exist, so maybe this doesn't matter.
Or maybe I'm just making a problem that doesn't exist.
Maybe the best action I should take is nothing, right?
Like I, you know, I reframe all those things, but usually it's just because I'm afraid of something and then that's why I'm not making the decision.
And I think once I name and put a face and it's usually not even a thing that I'm afraid of, it's one person's judgement I'm afraid of.
17:46
And then when I name the person then it becomes then it becomes real.
Instead of being this amorphous like people, society, judgement, it's like Tom.
Like do I really care what Tom thinks?
I guess so.
It seems like I'm not making this big change in my life because of Tom.
Looks like Tom's more in control of my life than I am, dude.
18:03
So I remember this when I was 19 years old.
I was super angry.
Like all 19 year old men, right?
That's the the standard default, right?
I was angry at both my parents for because I was 19, right?
And I remember blaming them for everything, blaming them for my life, blaming them for not being a better person.
18:22
I literally blamed them for being a bad person.
And I remember realizing that when I blamed them that I gave them control over my life.
And then the idea that the people that I hated the most at the time were the ones who actually were controlling me was the thing that most sickened me to then actually flip my narrative to actually taking control.
18:42
Like that was the one thought process.
Like my mother, I'm giving her control over my romantic like, my mother controls this.
Fuck that.
I was like, no.
And so, like, just the idea that somebody who I was disgusted by at the time had that much power is what gave me the power to start taking action.
19:03
See this hamster wheel thing that continues to distract you?
I've got this concept called anxiety cost.
So kind of like opportunity cost when you have an unmade decision, every single second that you spend thinking about the unmade decision could have been gotten back had you just made the decision.
19:23
Oh yeah, And realizing that it's it's a justification for eating frogs earlier in the day, I need to answer that e-mail.
The longer that you wait until you answer that e-mail, the more times you will think the thought I need to answer that e-mail.
And if we assume that what truly, truly matters in life is the time and the attention that we spend within that time, your time is being captured and your attention is being captured by a thought that could have been gotten rid of had you have just done it.
19:52
Had you have just had the conversation, broken up with the relationship, left the job, told the father whatever, done your stretches, cleaned your teeth, had a shower, whatever it is that you needed to do, all of that anxiety cost could have been gotten rid of had you just gone and done it.
20:10
You can move through life at seven times the rate of other people by simply changing when you say you're going to make a decision from end of week to end of day.
So think about how that stacks up.
So it's like, let's say that there were four decisions that you needed to make.
If the normal person takes a week to make the decision and then their mind moves on to the next thing that they have anxiety for and start making that decision and decide another week, decide another week, decide another week, it's a month to make those four decisions.
20:36
Whereas the the Super, the Superman that takes one decision day one, one second decision day two, third decision day three, fourth decision day four.
They aren't even finished the week yet and they're where the other person is at the end of the month.
And like that speed of decision making, like not paying the attention cost, the opportunity cost of your time.
20:57
I think it's really profound in terms of how quickly people move through life, in terms of achieving the goals that they set out because people were like, how did the how is that guy so young and he's achieved XY and Z.
It's like, well, what takes you a month to make a decision we make in an hour, and then the next hour I make another decision that takes a year next month.
21:13
And so, like, that's how you can go 30 times or 100 times faster than than the quote average person who's overweight has $1000 in their bank account, you know, and is going to die at 70.
Can you just go back to before you made that first decision with your dad?
21:29
Because you've mentioned it, you know, people might look at your, I would say, ruthlessness, at least in some regards with decision making, you know, hiring and firing and making these business decisions.
And there's all of these great stories about and I had this thing and I realized that partner wasn't right.
So I got rid of that business.
And you know, that's the sort of thing that would tear most people up for six months, 18 months, maybe forever.
21:51
And to look at that degree of cutthroatness, or at least decisiveness, I think is almost unfathomable for a lot of people.
Are you a representative avatar?
Is Pre leaving Baltimore Alex a representative avatar for the average person?
22:10
I think so.
I mean, I was high achieving, you know, I said, I mean, like I did well in school, I tried hard, I did those things.
But in terms of my risk tolerance, in my fear of failure in my insecurities, yeah, absolutely.
I mean, if anything real talk, I'll bet you that I have more insecurities than most people.
22:26
Because those insecurities are what drove me to do well in those things.
Not because I cared about school, but because I cared about what other people thought about me.
Yeah, yeah, I I've spoken to hundreds, hundreds and hundreds of high performers.
On balance, people are driven way more by fear of insufficiency than they office with some well balanced, perfect desire to just maximize their greatness in life.
22:51
Like the activation energy for almost everybody is.
I'm scared I might be a piece of shit.
What?
Hang on.
Oh God.
I might be a piece of shit.
I genuinely might be a piece of shit.
I need to go and do something so outrageous that I I can't be a piece of shit.
23:08
There's no way that it could happen.
I might be a coward.
Oh my God.
What?
What can I do to stop myself from being a coward?
That's the activation energy.
It's funny, 'cause if you regress fear to its most basic form, it's death.
And death is the greatest motivator.
And like, you can prove it in a simple example, it's like if I all of a sudden go up to anybody on the street and I put a gun in their head and I say, you know, point a gun at their head and I say go do this thing, they'll go do it.
23:32
But if I say you can have anything you want if you do this, they're willing to go 10 times harder with a gun in their face to not die.
And so if you take fear and arrest it all the way down to its basis form, like that's what the insecurity is Like.
If they they think I won't be enough, and if they don't think I won't be enough, then this one happened.
23:49
If this one happened, this one happened, I'll be alone, I'll be dead.
But like, if you just regress it all the way down, like that's all it is.
And so, like, the biggest achievers in life I think have have most directly tied them not doing whatever it is that they want to do to death, whether they're consciously aware of it or not.
24:06
And then that's what motivates them harder.
You're not afraid of failing.
You're afraid of what other people will think of you if you fail.
But if you're afraid of that, imagine what they think of you when you aren't even trying.
Oh yeah, they aren't.
Such a Dick sometimes.
24:23
Does it?
Is it?
Is it strange to hear your, like, angry toilet tweets read back to you now in the cold, harsh light of day?
God, that was a particularly difficult poo.
I was cracking on that.
You know, real talk.
24:40
The the tweets that I have, people don't know this, but the tweets are notes to self, Yeah.
So they're just directed at me so that I can look back on them and like, be reminders of like, hey, don't, don't do that.
And so, like, I think to myself, man, I'm afraid of doing this.
And I'm like, no, I'm not.
I'm afraid of what this person's going to think about me.
24:55
Because if I were to be able to fail in quiet, in complete isolation, then I wouldn't care.
And then I think, well, what if I, what if I?
What if I don't succeed in public?
What do they think then?
Nothing, right?
They don't think about me at all.
25:10
And so obviously, that comes from the perspective of seeking to gain approval and attention from others anyway.
So it's like, listen, if you're insecure, which everybody is, let's be real, you might as well use the insecurity to get something out of it, right?
Like, one of my, one of my favorite things about entrepreneurship is like, use what you've got.
25:26
And so a lot of people think that they need to fix their conditions in in order to get, like, the perfect conditions before they start.
But the perfect condition is whatever one you're in because it gives you whatever assets you have, that's the cards that you're dealt.
And so you just play the hand.
And a lot of people have great cards.
It's like, man, I'm so afraid of.
It's like, use it.
It's like I have nothing.
25:43
What makes you very dangerous, 'cause you have nothing to lose, right?
Like, one of the really interesting things about I think about from a business perspective, but it probably applies to everything, is that there's always an advantage and a disadvantage from every position, right?
So like, I remember 1, I mean, gym Lynch is still a big company and still continues to grow.
But in the gym licensing space, there's not many people who can compete with us there, right?
26:01
And I would talk to guys who are in the space, you know, talk, you know, talking to conference whatever.
And you know, younger guys would be like, well, I want to, I want to be in the space too.
And it's not fair because, you know, you have this big advantage.
And I was like, you have a way bigger advantage than I do.
And I was like, 'cause if I were in your position, I would go to every single gym owner and be like, you don't want to be with Jim launch.
26:20
You want to be with Alex.
You're just a number to him.
Like, you're never going to talk to him.
Like, you're just a cog in the wheel there with me.
You're going to get my personalized attendant there.
He's just some employee down the chain that's following some process.
Right.
I was like, but on the flip side, if I'm talking to that same gym owner, then I'm going to say, you don't want to talk to Jimmy.
He lives in his mom basement.
26:35
He has no proof that he's good at what he's he's that the reason that we're number one in the space is because we've done it so many times.
And we have a system that we know that.
We know that if you go on this side, you will get this result on the outside.
I was like, there's always a position and there's always an advantage.
I was like there's always a post it vintages and don't think which one do I have.
26:51
When you're talking about it's not you that's afraid of failing, yeah, you're afraid of other people's opinions about why you're going to fail.
Like, the reason I think that cynicism is so popular on the Internet is that the upside of never trying is never having to feel the pain of failure.
27:09
That's fundamental.
It's sour grapes at an existential level, right?
It is a cynicism, safety blanket.
It is protecting you from ever having to feel the downside of anything.
I will assure my own failure in private so that I never have to face my failure in public.
27:30
It's kind of like investing.
Like everyone's afraid of losing money when they invest, but the only guaranteed investment that doesn't work is never investing to begin with.
And so it's like they take the long failure rather than the short one, right.
I mean it's what it is, right?
You just fail long and they're like I prefer that.
27:48
But that's.
I mean that's.
Yeah.
I it's it's like you and I are going back and forth on trying to figure out how many different ways can I say that either the people that you're worried about judgement are going to die or that you're going to die or that even if you do achieve the thing, they won't care anyways or if you don't do anything, they won't think about you to begin with.
28:09
And don't you want to be thought about to begin with Like don't you want some level of significance.
I just you're going to die.
And I think like I was I was very grateful that.
28:25
So one of my biggest inspirations or whatever, you know influences when I was in Baltimore was I would have lunch with my grandfather three times a week.
So he was 90 old guy.
So I'll go to the nursing home and we'd have lunch three days a week.
And listening to him talk about the regrets that you had in life, it's so much more painful to watch someone who has no options left.
28:51
Like he's going to die.
It means he'd die tomorrow and he died a couple years later.
I mean like and he lost all his mental faculties.
You know, almost sadly, basically when I stopped, when I left Baltimore, one of the sad parts is I was one of the only people that kind of, like, kept him lucid, you know what I mean?
And after that, no one, really, no one really visited him.
29:08
No one really did anything.
And so I think he, he just rolled downhill.
I think the lunches might have been the only thing that he looked forward to.
And seeing someone old with no options and nothing but regret, not, not that he had everything regret.
He had things that he did really well and I took those things from him.
29:29
He would, he would repeat the same lessons, you know, like every lunch, the spirit.
A lot of older people kind of repeat a few key lessons.
And everything that he had, he flew during and he fled during the during the World War 2.
You know he fled from the Germans and all that stuff because he had a Jewish sounding last name.
He wasn't.
29:45
But he it was enough that he was fleeing.
Right.
And he always just say he's like you have two hands and one brain.
I was like use them and there was always this thing that he said to me.
And I think just like when when I when think about the things that he was going up against compared to the things that we're going up against now, it just made me feel like all right, like this is not as big of a deal as I really think it is.
30:06
I don't have Germans at the at my door.
What were the regrets that he had?
Him.
Yeah, He would have spent.
I mean, again, there's deathbed regrets and then there's real life regrets.
But there's there's things that he would have done differently in terms of the business.
There's things he would have done differently with his wife.
He had, he got divorced that, you know, he would have done things very differently with his kids.
30:25
So my mother and her sisters, which actually talking to him about how he raised my mother, helped me in some way forgive her for some of the things that I felt were wrongdoings that she had done to me.
And so it's funny because you know, one of my favorite quotes from Blaise Pascal is to understand is to forgive.
30:48
And like when you when you.
I think there's another saying that I like a lot, which is it's really hard to hate close up.
It's like if you really see someone and you see all the things that they went through and the things that they that happened to them to become who they are, then you understand them.
And then you understand why they did XY and Z.
Because if we don't understand, we assume that it's because they're just evil people and most people aren't that way.
31:07
They're this way because they've been reinforced or punished for doing something like that in the past.
And especially for her, she was reinforced for acting a certain way over and over and over again to the point that it was, it was core to her character.
And so when that got put on me, I was like, I hate you.
You're terrible.
You're evil, like, blah.
But like, and when I looked at it on a much longer time horizon of, like, she was four years old when she came here.
31:25
She couldn't speak English.
She got beat up as a kid, like all these things.
I'm like, you know what?
Maybe give her a little grace, you know?
And I remember when when I came back and it was right around that same time where I realized I was giving this person all this power, she yelled at me for something when I came back home from college my freshman year.
And it was a standard fight.
31:41
You know, like, here's the button that I pressed to get into the normal fight that we get into.
I just remember she hit the button.
I just, like, wasn't that upset.
And I, it's like I felt nothing.
She, like, hit the button.
She, like, hit it again harder.
And I was like, and I just remember looking at her, me like, I get it.
I'm sorry.
Like you had a tough, tough life.
31:58
And then she just broke down and, you know, started crying because it was like she felt understood.
And I think I know that was a roundabout way of getting back to regrets.
But he regretted how he had raised her.
But his through his regrets, I got to see why she was the way she was.
32:16
And then it diffused the bomb that was between me and her.
Did I tell you that story Douglas Murray told me about regrets from Christopher Hitchens.
Brilliant.
So Christopher Hitchens, one of the New Atheists, was sat in some British pub with Douglas Murray.
32:33
When Douglas is young and you know, you can imagine it's some musty Chesterfield sofa, he's probably got a cigarette in his mouth and it's a glass of Scotch or something.
And Douglas is vacillating between these two different choices that he needs to make.
And he is complaining, lamenting the fact that I have this thing, but I have this thing and if I do this thing, I can't do this thing.
32:57
And and and what?
What do I do?
And apparently Hitch like, sat back and Douglas in life, we must choose our regrets.
And I was like, fuck, so I'm 3 Manhattans deep in Douglas Murray's apartment in Manhattan at 2:00 in the morning and he sneaks off to the toilet.
33:22
And I quickly write this down because I know that my, like, half cut alcohol brain isn't going to remember it.
So I'm noted down.
That was all the trigger that I needed.
Which is also a good argument for noting things down.
And I reflected, I must reflected on that for a year.
I must have thought about for a year in life.
We must choose our regrets.
33:38
What the fuck does that mean?
OK, First off, in an existence where opportunity cost is baked in because you don't get to split test life and by doing a thing, you can't do a different thing, I have the choice between going to the gym and going to the theme park.
If I go to the gym, therefore, I can't go to the theme park, even if the decision of going to the gym was the right call.
33:58
I will always have the open loop of yeah, but what if I'd gone to the theme park?
You can't ever know, Right.
OK, so that means that fundamentally, regrets are baked in to our existence.
And I'd always thought that the reason I had a regret was due to some suboptimal decision I'd made.
34:16
If only I'd made this decision better, I could have ameliorate the regret.
OK, so regrets are an unavoidable part of being a human, and they're a byproduct of opportunity cost, which you can't get away from.
But what does it mean that you have to choose your regrets?
34:31
OK, well, if regrets are inevitable, if they're going to happen no matter what, an easy way to look at the decision is, rather than which do I want to do, which regret could I live with?
Because there are certain regrets that you can't bear living with now, you can bear living with them, but they're going to be worse than other ones.
34:53
So what is the difference between I need to have a difficult decision, I need to have a difficult conversation with my boss about leaving to go and do this thing, or I need to.
That's the regret.
That's one regret of the sitting down and seeing them face to face and telling you're going to leave their small mom and pop business and you're the main salesperson and it's going to be terrible and they're going to cry and you're going to feel like a piece of shit.
35:12
That's one regret.
Another regret is looking back at a decade that you waste in a job that you fucking hate.
Yeah, so in life you have to choose your regrets.
I love that as a decision making frame because it also jump starts our fear engine because rather than saying like what do I want, it's what I what do I hate least and so we get to run it.
35:36
So then you get to use your runaway from engine rather than you go towards.
To it, Yeah, the mouse and the cheese again.
Yeah.
And was it you telling me that with the cat?
Yeah, I mean, yeah.
So I'm just going to butcher what you told me, but why don't you just assure the like, how much?
35:52
Yeah.
Yeah, this was on our last episode, so this is sequel for the people that were listening.
Jordan Peterson talks about the study where they starve a rat and they put it into a tube.
They what the smell of cheese in from the front and there's a spring attached to the rats tail so they can work out how hard it's pulling.
36:07
How hard it's pulling is a proxy for design, for how much it wants it.
You'd think this rat is starving.
It's going to pull as hard as it can.
So it they waft the smell of cheese in and it runs towards it and whatever they do another iteration of the study.
This time they waft the smell of cheese in from the front and the smell of a cat in from behind it pulls harder.
36:24
Why?
Because not only in life do you want to run towards something you want, but you want to run away from something that you fear.
And this ties into your the three most common traits of very successful people, superiority complex, massive crippling insufficiency, and impulse control.
36:40
So, superiority complex.
I can achieve this thing.
That's the cheese.
Crippling sense of insufficiency.
I fear.
The cat.
Impulse control.
I'm in a tube.
There's only One Direction I can go.
I don't need to make a choice.
Yep.
I love this a lot as a frame for for for decision making because that like think about the decision that we were just talking about right.
37:03
So it's like I'm, I'm the sales guy and I stay and like if you were to frame it in upsides, it's like upside is I keep these friends, right?
And but I want to leave so that I can start this business right.
Those are the upsides.
37:18
But when you think about it in terms of like I waste a decade of my life not living the life I want, to me, I mean, even when I say it, it sounds more motivating even though it's the exact same thing.
It's like losing $100 versus gaining $100.
People have three times higher loss aversion.
37:35
And so it's like, if you can't get yourself to do something, think about it from the perspective of what you have to lose rather than what you have to gain.
You've got a quote that I love.
My biggest fear is getting to the end of my life and thinking I wasn't good enough.
What's that mean?
And I'll define good enough as I could have tried harder, like I want to leave everything on the field.
37:57
And one of the things that has helped me a lot, I mean in the quote that went unbelievably viral.
Do you?
Want me to do it again?
Do I need to do it again?
You don't gain confidence by saying shouting affirmations in the mirror, but by stack and giving yourself a stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are Outwork yourself out.
38:19
And again, a lot of the tweets that I have are notes to self because like like I have a, you know, I have a big presentation coming up.
We got 500,000 people who are registered for this book launch that are coming out.
And I'm thinking to myself, it's like, how can I guarantee that when I step off stage, no matter what happens, I feel like I've accomplished that.
38:38
I've done a good job, that I can look at myself in the mirror and say good work.
And when I was younger, I used to have no way to do that.
That's because I measured everything on outcomes.
But I feel like I've got a little bit more experienced.
I do have a way to win now, but it's hard.
And the way that I win is when I finish and I say that there's nothing else I could have done.
38:57
And so that means that, like, the reason that I feel confident about this book that's coming out is I wrote 19 drafts of the book, 4 full rewrites end to end.
To make the book, I did 6 hours a day, my first six hours from 6:00 AM till noon every day for two years to get this book to where it is now.
And when I was done with the book, I was like, there's nothing else I can do to this.
39:15
Like, I this is it.
There's nothing else.
Like I can't make it simpler, I can't make it shorter.
I can't cut it.
I can't add a visual that I should have added.
It's done.
And so to the same degree with the presentation that I have, I gave myself this framework of like, OK, well, if I were to speak in front of 10,000 people, I would probably spend a good amount of time prepping the presentation to make sure it was good.
39:33
I was like, well, I'm gonna speak in front of 500,000.
I was like, so I can, I can rationalize spending fifty times the amount of work and effort and time to make this thing exceptional because, I mean, the numbers are hard to fathom, but that is the numbers.
Like if I had a 10,000, that's what I would do.
And so it allowed me to take a presentation and you know, I have 900 slides that I'm going to get through in 60 minutes.
39:56
And I have now every single day I do a full draft.
Of the, you know, I'd I I'd say the say the presentation in my head.
And then I do a second run where I say out loud and I record it.
And then after I record it, I play the recording with the slides up and I fix or add every slide where I stumble or there's something that should be there or visual and I keep going until now.
40:19
Right now I'm a we can change out and there's there's not much else I can do to it.
And so I'll still continue to do that from now until the day that it happens, but I probably won't have as many changes because I should just keep nailing it.
And then when I get up there, it doesn't matter if the tech doesn't work or if the, you know, the the book shopping page cart, you know doesn't, you know, doesn't work or whatever it is.
40:40
Because I'll be able to step off stage and look in the mirror and be like you did everything you could.
And The thing is just like no one else will know that because I know that, like, I could not do that.
And I like, you know, a lot of people were like, dude, you have so much goodwill.
You could probably just say like here's you know, here's the book.
But I would know.
40:56
And if I if I believe what I say I do, which is that I'm the ultimate judge, jury and executioner of my own self esteem, then I'm the only person who can say good job or not.
And unfortunately I have incredibly high standards.
And so I can either just always feel like a failure because I always fall short of my own standards, or I can create a standard that I I willingly and consciously accept, which is that I will do enough work that there is nothing left to be done.
41:23
And that means that I can also do fewer things, which means I have to be more selective about the things that I choose to do.
But when I do them, they will be done well and they will be done real quick wise.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the words.
41:41
We can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that has to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
41:57
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
They say the true hell is on the person that you are meets the person that you could have been.
And a lot of the time I think we look at sports stars.
42:13
I'm watching this quarterback on Netflix at the moment and is Patrick Mahomes is just this artist.
You know he's he's halfway between a warrior and a savant and and an artist and a musician and and an everything rolled together right.
The reason that we love seeing behind the scenes with stuff like that is it is somebody at the absolute zenith of their capacity and they are putting everything that they can into making this as good as possible.
42:40
And I think that I sometimes find myself getting I I I certainly did before I had the podcast.
I was wistful that I have the raw materials to work very hard at things, and I'd never had a pursuit that I could have applied it to.
There was nothing.
I remember the first time I ever heard Peterson say work as hard as you can at one thing for a year and see what happens.
43:00
And I'd never had a thing that I could work.
I'd I could work hard at business.
But the line between your inputs and your outcomes is so meandering and messy that I can always excuse away good or bad performances as not being on me.
And for the most part, I would take responsibility for the bad ones and not take responsibility for the good ones, because that's how I'm wide.
43:19
But I I never had something that was linear, close to linear.
I'm like, I put an hour in and I get an hour out or more than an hour out and it's direct.
And then about three years ago, I had this conversation with Dean, my video guy, as I want to turn pro, I read Steven Pressfield, War of Art.
43:36
And then I read turning pro.
I want to turn pro with the show.
What's that mean?
What would it mean if I treated this pursuit like an athlete does?
So an athlete, they review game tape and they do mindset work and they've got a sports psychologist and they look at what they eat and they look at what they drink and they go to bed on time and they're hanging around with people that are growth minded and they're getting the right coaches and they're all the rest.
43:58
Everything is done in order to facilitate performance in the thing that they say they care about.
But everybody has the opportunity to do that.
You just need to define what The thing is.
I'm never going to be Patrick Mahomes, right?
I I know.
But I managed to find my thing and then nearly kill myself in dedication toward it.
44:19
There's a a photo that I put up on my Instagram a little while ago, two weeks after I ruptured my Achilles.
Yeah, I saw that.
And I'm in a boot, and I've got the laptop on my lap, and we've created this arm that'll bring the mic to me because I didn't want to stop doing the podcast because I'd made this commitment.
44:37
I'm going to turn broke, and for three years we haven't missed a single episode, 3 * a week, 3 * a week, 3 * a week for three years now.
And before that, it was two a week for a year and before that it was one a week for a year.
And it just keeps on ramping up and the opportunity to commit yourself fully to something that you care about is beyond a blessing.
44:57
And when you do it the way that you feel, once you know that you've worked hard is great.
And we said before we started, you got this big thing coming up, which I'm super proud of you for managing to achieve, even though it hasn't happened yet.
The difference between being nervous and being excited before you do something is your level of preparation in advance of it.
45:14
If you step out on stage or in front of half a million people on a webinar, which is the craziest sentence I've ever said, if you step out on stage in front of half a million people and you've done absolutely everything, there's nothing to fear.
And that's why it's not about what everyone else will think.
45:30
Because when I'm on stage making that presentation, the only person whose voice I'll hear is mine, and I will know if I have done everything in my control to be prepared or not.
And what?
What's the best thing that comes out?
I didn't do everything that I could to prepare, and I managed to fluke my performance.
45:47
I managed to, like, close my eyes, throw the dot, and oh wow, it hit the bullseye.
You'll even know that they'll even be guilt.
You won't even be able to fully enjoy your success.
That's it, Because you'll have tarnished it with your lack of input.
And what's interesting is that when you start defining your own success that way, it actually starts to feel under your own control.
46:06
But the downside is you realize that you can do very few things and then all of a sudden life feels very short because you're like, shoot, there's like not that many things I can do before I die if I'm going to actually do my best.
And what was interesting is I was talking to a ACEO friend of mine.
He's a public CEO.
And he was like, I need to start making content, right?
46:22
I'm like managing a billion dollar company.
I was like, you're doing OK, man, But because of that type of person, he's like, I need to be doing better with my content, right?
He's got a few 100,000 followers anyways.
And so I was like, all right, well, how many pieces of content you put?
Not a week.
And he was like, well, I mean I put out one a day and I was like, dude, I was like, we put out three hundred a week.
46:43
And he just, he didn't even respond.
He just took, he just like pursed his lips and nodded.
He was like, thank you for resetting my minimum standard.
It's always like, thank you for like.
And I'm sure like when you talk to Phil Heath and he talks about the volume that is required in order to gain muscle and how much, how, how, how dialed in he is with food and all the other things.
47:02
Just the amount of sheer work like the biggest change in or I'll say biggest reason that I've had significantly larger returns or outcomes that have happened later on in my career and they continue to get bigger and bigger is because the minimum standard for how much work I know I can do on something has has multiplied a hundredfold like I look at the first presentation.
47:22
So I was telling Quinn this earlier, I look at the first presentations I ever gave and I remember thinking to myself when I had this, I was like, this is a good presentation.
It's like 25 slides with like a heading and like 3 bullets on each slide and being like, man, this is good.
I'm like, this is a, this is, this is a pins, this is like an afternoon.
47:40
But in my mind, if I spend a whole day on something, that was like a lot of work.
Now it's I, you know, I like using this term like measuring hundreds, which is like measuring hundreds of hours.
How many hundreds of hours have you put towards something?
If you do that, I promise you the thing that you're making will get a lot better, and you'll also see how much more you're capable of.
47:57
Which is what I think, like my undertone of listening to what you were just saying with the podcast is like the more you do, the more you realize you can do.
And So what happens is you're actually, even though you're you're going pro right now, you're like, dude, next year I'm going pro because this is now just a minimum standard.
48:12
Of course I work out three days a week.
Of course I do three podcasts a week.
But dude, once we have the, the reality TV show and we have the full crew and we have the headquarter like, 'cause then the path gets lit of where you're going to go because you're so singularly focused and you know you have no other distractions.
The attention cost isn't you're not paying that down anymore.
48:30
And you're just like, how many times can I repeat this effort?
And then that's when you start unlocking mastery, right?
Like I I have this process for creating presentations, and before we turned on the mics, we were talking about it.
But it's like, I've done a handful of presentations in my life and I've gotten decent at making them.
48:46
But the the process now is so refined, which is like, it is game tape.
It is.
I make the thing, I do the thing in my head.
I do it out loud.
I watch the recording, I edit the thing, I do it in my head, I do it out loud.
I watch the recording, I edit the thing, and I just keep doing it until it's glass.
49:03
Dude, I listened to.
I listened to every podcast that I did for probably the 1st 2 1/2 years.
I listened back every single, every single time.
But at the time, I didn't cringe because I thought you crushed it.
Anybody can go back and listen to episode one with Stuart Morton in my old office in new Newcastle upon Tyne and you'll notice every other sentence that he says.
49:21
I go, It's fucking infuriating.
It's absolutely catastrophic.
My accent's terrible.
The everything, everything, everything about it is is awful.
And yet, at the time, I thought it was great.
Here's another interesting thing I've been thinking about recently.
49:38
When you don't have anything to say no to, it's easy to focus on one thing.
As success begins to get you more opportunities, your ability to say no becomes increasingly important.
And that's something that I'm feeling now.
Yeah, just more attention.
49:54
There's, well, hockey sticking quite aggressively, and I'm not anywhere near like even middling Z List fame.
But it's enough for people to see what they think is a penny stock and decide that they're going to try and throw the hat in the ring.
Which means that there's like 20 things I need to say no to every single week from new people that want, that want to do a thing.
50:13
Why don't we try this thing?
And why don't we do that thing?
And why don't we do the other thing?
It was a piece of piss five years ago to say 03 years ago in the middle of COVID to go like, I'm going to go pro and I'm just going to focus on this one thing because what else am I going to do?
All of my nightclubs have been shut down.
I got nothing else to do with my life now.
50:30
Oh, you said you were going to go pro.
Interesting.
Let's see what happens when you have 30 other things every single week vying for your attention.
Now let's see how committed you are.
This is my favorite analogy for this, which is the woman in the red dress.
But you know every many people have seen the Matrix.
50:49
If you haven't seen The Matrix, you don't need to have seen it to understand the analogy.
So Neo is going through the training program.
The protagonist, Morpheus is his, his educator, his his teacher.
And the education program only has one objective.
And so he's walking through the city, people are going left and right.
He's he's bumping into people going through like crowded New York.
51:06
And then all of a sudden it's kind of a black and white palish look.
It's green, black and white, but it's still black and white.
And then all of a sudden, this woman in the in a red dress enters the frame and you can't help but stare at this woman in the red dress and she's a complete knockout.
And Morpheus is talking to Neo, trying to teach him something.
51:23
And as he's talking, he's like, Neo, will you look at me?
Or you're looking at the woman in the red dress?
And he says look again and he looks back and it's Agent Smith holding a gun to his head and he says freeze.
And then everything freezes in the frame and he's like, if you're not one of us, you're one of them.
And I see that as the opportunities that we have to say no to everyday.
51:43
It's like another woman in the red dress.
And it's become a term that we use internally.
Right.
It's like it's a woman in the red dress.
And The thing is, is that the the more successful you become, more the more able you become, the hotter the woman in the red dress is.
Right.
Like you got a homeless girl that you're walking that, you know, past on the on the street.
She's like all dirty, but she's got a red dress on.
51:59
You're like, The thing is, is that that homeless girl when you were in your apartment actually looks like.
Yeah, right.
She's like, you know, I'm not you know, I I could you know, Right.
But then the better you get the the bigger the opportunities and that's where you have not your hypothetical 10, but what about your hypothetical 100.
And I had a mentor say this to me right as we sold Jim launch, he said, Alex that you know now that if it's not a billion, it's not worth your time.
52:24
And that was such a single a great razor for all decisions.
And so people come, they're like, hey we should do this endorsement, hey, we should partner with this whatever.
I mean think about it like we're in the deal world.
So how many deal like we get.
We have 3000 companies a month that reach out to us to do a deal that's 100 a day currently and we've done 13 deals in two years.
52:45
And so like you think about from an acceptance rate, it's like you know and I'm not saying you shouldn't apply by all this go to acquisition at home and apply if you have an awesome business.
But but the point is, is that like you're no muscle isn't really a no muscle.
It's just a yes muscle for the one thing that matters most.
Heroes and villains always have the same back story.
53:03
Pain.
The difference is what they choose to do about it.
Villain says the world hurt me, I'll hurt it back, the hero says.
The world hurt me.
I'm not going to let it hurt anybody else.
Heroes use pain.
Villains are used by it.
And fukudos here.
53:21
This is a permutation of what Donald Miller said, who's a great writer and he has a a number of of books and he he, he talked about the first element.
The 2nd element of that quote is the part that I added to it about heroes using pain and villains being used by it.
And so one of the things for people who are not where they want to be is that they have pain, like oodles of pain.
53:44
And I remember when I was starting out, I was looking for passion, I was looking for purpose.
I was like, I just want to find something that I'm motivated by, but it's the it's the cat and the cheese.
It's like we're looking for cheese but we have all these cat behind us and all we have to do is look and remember that they're behind us and chasing us.
And so if you have the cat and you're staying in your current situation, you're being used by the cat, right.
54:08
You're being used by the business owner who, you know it doesn't treat you well and is, you know, and you're in this job they don't really want to be in, right?
Or you're being used by the situation or the context of the relationship that you're in with the girl that you're like, not that into, right versus saying like, this is terrible.
54:26
And because of this terribleness, I now have something that I can run away from and then and then and then like, rather than not looking at the knife or trying to take painkillers, to not feel the pain, It's like completely sobering up, taking the knife and twisting it in your own heart and being like, I'm gonna fucking do something about this.
54:44
And I think that that's that's what the heroes like.
If we're heroes in our own story, it's not avoiding pain.
It's choosing from the very beginning the alchemy, which is like you have these terrible situations, it's like and you have the opportunity to turn, turn them into magic and and and skip or shortcut all the growth you're going to have in a really short period of time simply by twisting the knife and being like I'm going to do something about it.
55:07
Yeah, I think because people presume in the beginning that passion and purpose and meaning and joy and and fulfilment are the things that get people going.
But as I've said, of all of the high performers that I've spoken to, the vast, vast, vast majority of them are driven by insufficiency and resentment and terrible parents or terrible upbringings or a chip on their shoulder about bullies in school.
55:32
Pick your poison.
They have decided to use that to create the activation energy, right?
You can lower your action threshold and increase how many points you have to prove.
It's like, oh, I want to live a better life.
55:48
Yeah, that sounds good.
It's like I want to prove the bullies that said I was a worthless piece of shit in school.
Wrong.
It's like that's some fucking potent fuel.
I do believe that scaled over a long enough time, it's toxic and I don't think that it's necessarily.
How long but?
That's the question.
56:04
Like a lifetime, right?
Like, but I mean it'll it'll fuel you for a decade pretty well.
And I think that I, I look at me, I look at you know I was bullied pretty badly in school and was an only child and had expectations from parents and and you know I combined all of those things together and I did have a chip on my shoulder and I did want to prove to the world that I was worthwhile and I did want people to to realize that they had doubted the wrong person.
56:33
Fuck yeah.
Yeah, damn right I do.
I think being really specific about your pain is helpful.
So like even being specific about the cheese, really specificity in general is helpful.
But like even more so like what is the twisting the what is twisting the knife?
56:50
Like what is how do you operationalize twisting the knife right.
Instead of being like, I hate my life, right?
It's I hate the way Andrew makes me feel when he says that I'm a piece of shit and I'm not going to amount to anything, comma, because he's right.
57:07
Like, why does it hurt me?
Like if someone says Alex, you're a piece of shit.
You're not going to amount to anything.
If someone accuses you of being poor or fat.
Right.
I I would have, I'd be like I have evidence to the contrary.
So this will probably not bother me.
But the things that bother us are the ones that you know have an element of truth, or sometimes not an element are comprised almost entirely of truth and we just don't want to look at it.
57:27
And so I think it's it's the the twisting, the knife is looking in the mirror and saying what if they're right?
Success is the only revenge.
As you expand, they shrink into irrelevance.
As you get louder, no one can hear them.
You don't beat them.
57:42
You cast a shadow so big no one can see them to begin with.
When people copy, they copy the wrong stuff because they don't know why it worked to begin with.
And when it breaks, they don't know how to fix it because they didn't build it.
So don't sweat it.
Copycats will always be behind.
58:00
Good shit.
But success is the only revenge.
It is such a lovely there's that let.
Me tell you the story behind it?
Damn right, Yeah.
So I was 15 years old, so this was really early in my life.
Still jacked.
58:16
Still jacked.
Always jacked.
Perma jacked.
And I this sounds so, so lame.
So I had this teacher.
So I'm a freshman in high school and I might have been 14, whatever the age is.
And I'm walking through the hallway and this this teacher's like an admin of some kind of walks out of his office and he's like, he's like son.
58:36
And I was like, I'm like, either she's in trouble, what am I going to do?
And he's like, you work out.
And I was like, no, he's like, why not?
I was like, I don't know how he's like, I'll show you, he's like, you got the genes.
And so that teacher, Mr. Gibbons, ended up working out with me every day in high school and showed me how to work out.
58:57
And he probably saw on some level that I was some angsty teenager that felt angry about whatever.
And I, during our workout sessions would be like, this guy said this to me like, you know, you know, or like this, whatever.
And I was like, man, I'm going to come back at our 10 year reunion and I was like, I'm going to show him.
59:15
I was like, he's going to be working for me, like, blah, blah, blah, right.
And he's like, no, he's not.
And I was like, what do you mean?
I was like, let me just have my moment.
He's like, no, he's not.
He's like, and you're not going to do that.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
When you come back for the 10 year reunion, I was like, what do you mean?
59:32
He's like because if you come back at a 10 year reunion and say, hey John, like everything I have, look at me now.
He's like the guy's going to laugh and be like, you did all of this to try and prove me wrong, man, I feel sorry for you.
And when he said that, when he actually played out what my, like, revenge fantasy was in real life, I realized it looked, it looked stupid.
59:55
Yeah.
I looked like the beta in the fucking situation, right.
And so he was like, the only thing that you can do is win so big that all of them constantly compare themselves to you and then you'll forget they exist.
And he's.
1:00:10
And that's when he said, he said success is the only revenge.
He's like, it's not the best revenge.
He's like it's the only one.
There's no other revenge.
Because everything else is petty.
Everything else does show that you were thinking about these people all day long, which means they win by default.
He's like all you can do is think about your goal and winning.
1:00:28
He's like in when you win, that's when you become so big that they shrink into irrelevance.
You cast a shadow that no one even can see them behind you.
This is the nuance I think on on the previous point when we were talking about the toxicity of that fuel long term you.
1:00:44
Can see me light up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well.
I think that when you think about the activation energy of using the things that you don't like, you have to be careful that you're using them and that they're not using you still.
And a lot of the time I get this, and in my more juvenile moments, I I see myself do this.
1:01:06
Where I'll know that there's a game that somebody else that I don't like cares about, and I'll imagine myself playing that game to beat them so that I can stick it to them purely for the reason of sticking it to them.
Let's say that there's someone that really cares about being in shape, and I'm not in as good shape as I have been in the past.
1:01:25
And I know that with muscle memory, if you give me 18 months and a good amount of testosterone, like the thing that they care about, I would be able to make them feel really bad about OK.
So I would hijack my own direction purely to try and prove somebody else wrong in a desperate and and somehow believe that that's me taking control of my life.
1:01:51
Are you kidding me?
I'm allowing them to ventriloquize me through pain that they didn't even mean to give me.
The woman in the black dress.
The black pill equivalent.
Right.
Well, like now it's like not even a distraction from your main goal.
1:02:07
It's like I'm going to make a new goal just to wrong this person and then somehow make make up the story that I'm in control of my life When I'm.
I'm really just acting in complete reaction to this person.
And so in so doing, in beating them at their own game, they've already won by default.
Yep, because they got me to change the game I was playing.
1:02:25
Forget about who won.
It's like, dude, you were over there and now you're over here.
I see this with a lot of people.
I I I think that it contributes to a lot more of why and how people adopt societal norms the the resentment that they have it's it's not just other people want this thing.
1:02:41
Therefore I memetically want to do this thing too.
It's I know that other people will respect me and that my resentment will feel justified and manifest if I win at it And that's really compelling.
That's like a motivational spit roasting, coming in from both ends and it's it's really, really powerful and you need to be careful.
1:03:02
I mean, I think, you know, one of the really early blessings, and I'll be on it, like, this is where I think I was fortunate, right?
Like I I realized when I was about 28, right, that I had been trying really hard to beat.
1:03:18
I mean, you'll notice a common theme with a lot of my stories, but I have one central person that I was trying to prove for a very long time, which is my father.
And we're on good terms, by the way, 'cause I always get that question.
But this was after I left and he disapproved of my whole thing.
1:03:34
And for five years we didn't talk very much.
And so he calls me up to, he says, hey, you're gonna want to sit down for this.
And I'm like, OK, what are you pregnant?
You know?
And so and so he says, I'm sorry.
And and I was like, for what?
1:03:50
And he was like, for everything right now, mind you, like, this is a Middle Eastern father born in Iran to a middle to a Middle Eastern father there who was even more legit, like where my father was born, Women weren't allowed to drive cars.
Cars came with drivers with them.
1:04:05
When you bought them, the driver came with the car.
Or like, he was born in a very different world, like, fathers don't apologize to sons.
It just, it was, it just wasn't that way.
And I have a little bit more, a little bit more awareness than I did then, and I can see that now.
But for me, I was like, now you apologize.
1:04:23
You know what I mean?
And so rather than take it for the olive branch that it was, I said I didn't care about your opinion five years ago when I left.
And I was like, and I don't Care now.
And he was like, well, we'll see how long your success lasts.
1:04:40
And So what could have been a really nice exchange in it becoming pretty, pretty ugly.
But the the main point there was that I wanted to, in the beginning, like make as much as my father.
Then it was make more than my father and then it was make more than my father had ever made in his entire life.
And once I had achieved that, I realized that as much as, like, it sounds terrible to say this, but like, I was trying to beat him at his game and and this is pretty alive in a lot of a lot of Asian culture, same thing.
1:05:05
Making money is a bit, you know, like when my dad would introduce somebody, he'd be like, this is so and so he makes this much a year like it was.
It was just really clear, like, this is how much status someone has.
And so, like, it was really deep for me.
But it was only when I realized that I had won at his game that I realized I'd never even asked the question of like, what game am I trying to win?
1:05:22
And I don't know how many people are actually trying to win at a game that they didn't even set the rules up for when they're in it.
And that's why I say like, I think I was fortunate that I, you know I hit a a really tough goal 'cause my dad was is is a successful man relatively early on.
1:05:41
But that that for that exchange.
And then think like, and then reflecting black and feeling terrible about myself from, like, saying what I said.
And then I was like, I'm, I did everything that I've done to this point to beat him, beat my father, the man who actually raised me, who tried to make me the best man I can.
1:05:56
And when I think, when I really start thinking about it, I'm like, I like who I am.
He raised me, so doesn't that mean that he might have been the perfect father?
And then that really messes with me.
And so yeah, so go.
Ahead.
Well, it's just it's hard to think that the people you used to have contempt for or distaste or hatred or whatever shaped you in a way that you couldn't have been.
1:06:22
And I often think about how the things I'm most proud of in myself are the light side of something that I was so embarrassed about, that's so ashamed about.
You know, being an outcast as a kid meant that I love or I'm capable of being on my own way beyond how anybody else is so far beyond it.
1:06:45
I I can work on my own in solitude for an endless amount of time.
I I can outwork anybody in solitude.
Why?
Because I spent almost all of my time between the ages of 6 and 16 in my bedroom listening to audio tapes, right?
1:07:04
Listening to audio box and like throwing like a tennis ball against the wall or like playing with my like fucking Mighty Mouse from Mars or whatever they were called.
What was it called?
Biker Mice from Mars.
That was it.
And that was what I did.
So, but all of that discomfort and all of the challenges that I went through there are the thing, one of the things that I'm so proud of myself on now.
1:07:26
OK, So what if I look back and I said, well, all of the the the bullying that I went through and the challenges of feeling alone and being on the outside of social groups meant that I developed such attenuation and attention and focus and inability to distil down what's happening socially.
1:07:47
Which is why I became one of the best club promoters in the UK for a decade and a half.
Because for all of my school life, I'd been obsessing over how Alex wears his tie.
Maybe that's why he has friends and I don't have friends, or the particular brand of shoes that he's wearing or the like.
1:08:03
He carries his bag on that shoulder, and I carry carry mine on this shoulder because I couldn't deconstruct why I didn't have friends and everybody else did.
OK, so looking back, would I have rather had the friends and had the brother or sister and not develop this skill?
1:08:20
I can't split test life, so I don't know, but my life's ended up pretty good and I'm happy with it, so I need to not only look back at that stuff as something not to hate, but something to genuinely be thankful for.
And that is frankly something I'm still working through.
1:08:43
Yeah, it goes, it goes back to the the first thing, which is like the most traumatic events that happened in our life.
You know, they happen for us, not to us.
But when you expand the time horizon like those things, and to be fair, there are people who do have really crappy things happen to them, and then it destroys them, and then that's it.
And then they're just done.
1:08:59
And that's all it is.
And everyone has like a moderate amount of childhood bullying and an only child with like parents that care about them or whatever like.
Because you were a child coping with the world with the coping skills of a child.
I'm still largely that as an adult, as an adult infantry.
1:09:15
And so but I think that I mean the key, the the at least for me you know my, my key take away from both both of these kind of stories is more that all of the, all of the the negative things that happen on the micro have the opportunity if double down on to be huge wins in the macro and sometimes in ways that just a micro win would never have the ability to be doubled down on and become a a capital W win in the macro.
1:09:44
This is probably one of the heaviest hammer blows.
I think for today, this next one, this is a real.
Anger.
Anger.
Tweeting.
No, it's not.
It's an existential one.
Have fun.
You've already achieved goals you said would make you happy.
You've already achieved goals you said would make you happy.
1:10:04
Alex's notes to self, right.
Because we all know the happiness formula which is when this happens, I'll be happy, right?
When X I'll be happy or if X I'll be happy.
1:10:22
And so we, you know, I I've set up that equation.
I'm sure, I I know you've never set up this equation for yourself in your life.
But you know I I've set that up and I think that just serves as as my my biggest reminder.
But it's also why I probably am a pretty existential nihilist overall because I I've had so much evidence that none of those things quote brought me joy.
1:10:41
But the things that we were talking earlier about anticipation being kind of the hot button on pleasure, I feel like the hot button on joy for me is what I'm doing right now.
So like I haven't done the event yet, right.
I haven't.
I haven't given the presentation but when I'm in the rocky cutscene of like of beating, I'm not going to say beating the cow carcass.
1:11:00
I'll say that I was like, I was trying to avoid certain words anyways, that when I'm, when I'm, when I'm, when I'm putting that work in and doing the reps, like that's when I'm actually my most in flow and enjoying myself the most.
And so it's actually a lie that I've been telling myself that like, once the presentation goes well, I'll feel good.
1:11:21
Because in some ways now I feel like when the presentation happens, I'll be disappointed because I won't get to do this anymore.
I'll have to find something else to pick as a target so that I can get back into my Rocky cutscene.
And so I think that that that has taken some time and I've gotten better at it.
I really do think I've gotten a lot better at it, at least recognizing because the more the more times I've I've had WS and then realized that right afterwards I felt nothing.
1:11:45
I had to think back of like, what are the things that I enjoyed most in my life?
And it's always in pursuit and I'm like, well then why don't I set something really big, really far, so I can be in pursuit for the longest period of time possible.
And that's where I think a lot of people from the outside, you know, they cast their expectations of life onto me and say I wouldn't live my life that way.
1:12:03
You're always, you're always working, you're always doing these things.
But it's like I'm actually always spending my time in pursuit, because in pursuit is my button for enjoyment.
Well, what about if it wasn't achieving the thing at the end?
If the reason that you set yourself goals is exclusively to motivate yourself to enjoy the route toward those goals.
1:12:25
And I know that it's not the destination, it's the journey.
It's kind of cliche.
And I think this is is slightly subtly different, which is that it's actually about setting the destination.
Without the destination you wouldn't do the journey.
1:12:41
Like the way that you set goals and then achieve them and the the dopamine and the the trigger that you get.
I often think about the balance between like serotonin Chris and dopamine Chris and I don't even know the difference between that.
Well.
It's like am I feeling sort of lovey and present and and and wanting to connect with people or am I driving toward a thing because I have a goal that's in front of me and I'm very sort of dopamine Chris a lot of the time.
1:13:05
But I genuinely think that if you remind yourself, these are the golden years like this right now, this when you look back, these will be the golden years, right?
When I had my health, I had my full mental capacity.
1:13:21
I had control of my bladder.
I had all of the money that I needed to do the things that I wanted to crush it with my friends, to fly around America and film these podcasts or to launch this book that I spend all of this time on.
And you can even see it in the micro.
You can even see it when you look back on stuff that you've done in your day-to-day business or when you what you did at university.
1:13:42
What were the times that you enjoyed?
Was it when success, success came to you easily or was it when you stayed up and ordered dominoes because you had that project that needed to be in at 6:00 in the morning and you ran an all nighter and and John slept under the the table and and everybody ordered monsters and then the next morning we got it done.
What was good about that?
1:13:59
Was it when you submitted it or was it the Domino's and the 3:00 AM sleep under the table?
Because I'm pretty sure it's that.
I love this as a side note, but one of the things that really motivates me, or one of my most powerful motivational frames, is thinking about the person that I want to become as the destination and thinking like I want to be bulletproof.
1:14:27
I want to be bulletproof in these ways.
I want to be bulletproof in my marriage, I want to be bulletproof in my business, etcetera.
And I think about that man, whoever I want him to be.
Like we said, hell is when you look at who you could have been and realize that you're not that person.
And then I think if I were to make that man, what would I put that man through to make him who he is?
1:14:49
Like?
It wouldn't be easy times.
It wouldn't be quick wins.
It wouldn't even be easy wins.
It would be the the toil and the struggle of achieving and reaching for things that are right out of grasp that are right above my threshold and continuing to do that to like, lift the weight, to build the muscle, to break it down and do it over and over again.
1:15:11
Because like that's what creates the character traits that are the man that I want to be.
And so when I'm going through those like really harder times, I like to think of like looking in my mental mirror of like I'm making you, I'm not there yet, but I'm making you.
And that has helped me get through some of the harder times.
1:15:30
And from a gratitude perspective, my my most powerful frame for gratitude has been thinking about my 85 year old self Waking up as my 30 year old self and all of a sudden looking at Leila and be like, man, I remember when we were this young and then looking out the window and be like, man, you know, Vegas wasn't even developed.
1:15:49
Like there's no flying cars yet.
Like man, they were still used.
Gas like this is so cool and I get out of bed and I'm like and my elbows don't hurt, my knees don't hurt right 'cause I'm thinking about what my 85 year old self would think.
And you know, we're talking about whatever in a way that I know that I would give everything that I had when I was 85 to enjoy again.
1:16:07
And it's just it's a, it's a trippy frame.
But like, if you can think like what would 8085 year old me would be like?
I'm just not.
My body doesn't hurt, you know what I mean?
Like I actually have energy.
Like I can think clearly I don't have brain fog because I'm 85, right.
And that has been probably my single most powerful frame on feeling grateful and allowed me to feel more present at times when I start.
1:16:27
Like when I start to feel like I'm going through the motions and just like clicking in the routine and just like day after day after day and they feel the same.
That's been my biggest slow down where I can pull the reins and be like just and and mind you it lasts a few minutes.
But when I think back on the days where I where I use that frame, the part of the day that I remember is just the few minutes that I use it.
1:16:45
So I did this episode with some Harris A.
Lot of people have problems with some Harris.
I found the time that I spend with him unbelievably enjoyable.
I sat opposite him and a couple of times caught myself thinking, I am having so much fun doing this and he said this thing and I really wished that I'd asked him another question.
1:17:04
I should e-mail him about it.
I was talking about presence and and the importance of presence and you could use it as a proxy for gratitude.
And he said that really what you're aiming to do is find small moments in the day when you just open up and realize what's happening, right?
1:17:24
Like, Conor McGregor won the featherweight title twice because he won the interim because Aldo was injured.
And then he won against Aldo.
And somebody asked him, what are you going to do differently this time again before the Aldo fight that you didn't do against the in the Mendez fight, he says This time I'm going to be present.
1:17:45
And there's this photo of him and he stood like this at the weigh in and you've got this entire stadium in front of him and he stood like that.
He said the first time he did it, he couldn't remember it because he was just drowning in the in in in what was next and what I really loved that, Sam said.
1:18:05
And I think that, you know, you look at somebody that's a master meditator, or you set yourself high bars for what it means to be mindful, and you realize that you can be present with a sip of a coffee.
OK.
It can be present with this one sip of a coffee.
And then it like sand in your hands or like trying to remember a dream, it just evaporates, Right.
1:18:23
OK, Well, what if your goal was just to try and get five of those a day?
What if that was it?
What if being mindful was just five moments when you allow yourself to be where your feet are, where your feet are underneath you?
1:18:39
And then what if you tried to just string like two of those together five times a day, like just this first sip and then as I put it down, the view out of the window, Oh my God, like that's two things in one.
And then I can do that five times.
And it it, if I'd asked him, I would have said really is the path to just increase the frequency of the times that you are where your feet are underneath you.
1:19:02
And one of the cue that I love that I got from an embodiment coach is the times when you see in your peripheral vision you're looking and the way that our vision actually works, your focus is so heavily on what's directly in front of you.
If there's ever a time when you see what's out here, you realize that you it's impossible to see all of that and not be in the present moment because you've naturally just opened yourself up.
1:19:24
And I love that cue.
So during the times when I'm doing things like that, some episode, I'm like the next question.
And it is millions of people watching in and all this stuff and there's this guy in front of me and he's super smart or whatever.
This is fucking cool.
Just that one moment and that when I look back on the episode, that's what I enjoyed.
1:19:42
That's what I enjoyed about it.
So I think that being where your feet are underneath you and allowing yourself to open up and stringing those together largely allows you to enjoy being whilst you're in the process of becoming.
It's also interesting.
1:19:59
Those moments.
You can capture a moment.
Independent from your surroundings.
Because a lot of times those moments you're not thinking about the goal that you have the meeting that you have, the the prep that you have to do for some talk or some podcast or whatever it is.
And I can't remember where I heard this, but they were talking.
1:20:16
About Gladiator the.
Movie and the film opens with this like little bird on a bow, right, with like the the leaves and whatnot.
And then they zoom out from that little bird on the on the on the bow and it's this disgusting war scene, right.
1:20:33
And so it's kind of like micro macro, micro of how no matter how tough, whatever, the moment that you're going through is, if you can just take a picture of the corner of the room and look at the beauty in that right, of being present in that moment.
1:20:51
Even if it's the suffering, right?
Like you get punched and you're spitting blood out, but it's like this moment that you capture, then all of a sudden like everything fades away and you are present.
And so it can take this, what would be a brutal war, scene of death and dismemberment?
And the thing that makes it memorable is the zooming in on a detail.
1:21:12
And so it's like, if you feel like you're going through life too fast, it's like just look for a detail.








0:00
Most things that most people make suck.
Most products suck.
Most marketing sucks.
Most businesses suck, and most people suck at the things that they think they're good at, right?
And it's because they don't even know how to work.
They don't even know how to do it.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:22
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.
Dot com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I'm.
Going to breakdown how I learned how to consistently generate leads independent of platforms and the key piece that I was missing in multiple different platforms.
0:40
I'm going to tell you five key stories throughout my life that massively impacted how affected my marketing was as a result of the exchange.
So a few high level observations before I dive into this.
The first thing is there's a sitting in our community called Do the Boring work.
0:55
And a lot of times we don't confront the work that we that must be done because it's not exciting or sexy and it feels somehow like it's beneath us.
You know, prospecting and doing $100 a day can feel tedious.
You know, posting and repurposing the same content across lots of different media sources can feel tedious.
1:12
You know, reaching out to people you know and asking them if they know someone who might be interested in your you know products and services might feel tedious.
Or creating, you know, 100 different ad variations with different hooks and headlines can seem tedious.
It's very easy to understand, very hard to do.
1:28
Mostly because people don't have the discipline and the work ethic to go through the boring work.
Which kind of leads to the second one here, which is that there's a saying between my my, my closest friend and I and Arthur Kashi.
Violence is the answer sometimes when you have this outcome that you must achieve in your life.
1:44
Because of the goals and insecurities that we have set upon ourselves, That just being violent with the level of activity that we are doing will ultimately get us much closer than you know.
The nuances and the skill that sometimes we like to project and pretend matter more than just physically doing a sheer higher volume of work. #3 is that if you do more than you were doing right now, you will get more than you currently have.
2:08
And that is a promise.
And you can take that to the bank.
And #4 is do what matters most first.
So right now you probably have lots of things that you know fill up your day in the morning, all that kind of stuff.
But the things, there are only four activities that will actually generate more business for you, period.
2:23
That is new.
All right?
Number one is reaching out to people you know, #2 is posting to an audience that you know, #3 is reaching out to people who you don't know one-on-one.
And #4 is is is advertising, right?
There's the four only four ways that you can get new clients, right?
2:40
And so if you're not doing one of those four things and you're struggling to get customers, you're not doing lots of those four things as your primary activities, then that is probably one of the reasons that you don't have the amount of customers that you wish you have.
All right?
And So what I want to do is take this quick moment to introduce an equation that I've thought a lot about, but it's V * S * D, So volume times scale times time.
3:01
And this is kind of a flywheel that feeds itself and which and I'll get to the actual like wording behind this.
But essentially, the more volume you do, the better you are at it.
The longer you do it, the more throughput you will ultimately have.
The more outcome, the more clients, the more sales, the more leads you will ultimately have from doing it.
3:21
All right.
So let's dive into this in a little bit more.
So in other words, and this is based on just like pure foundational principles of logic, right?
The more we do, the better we get, The better we debt, the more we do because we like it, because we're better at it, right?
And the longer we do something, the better we get, the better we get.
3:39
The longer we do it, the longer we do it, the more of what we did compounds on itself.
And this is the same reason why if you start doing cold outbounds or start building a pipeline, it starts to compound on itself.
And if you start doing business over a long enough period of time, there just becomes this, this larger and larger audience of people who know you for doing this thing right.
3:58
And I'll show you a couple examples in some of the stories and examples I have today that will show you how compounding massively affected my life.
And so in this way, each of these three variables, volume, skill and time feed each other.
But it all starts with doing.
4:14
And so these are the three we're going to focus just on volume today because I want to be mindful of your time.
And so I'll tell you a quick example of this.
So this is probably a decade ago.
I'm starting my gym.
First business I owned a real business I own.
And someone's like, oh, you should run Flyers.
4:30
And I was like, OK, cool.
So I went out, I did, you know, a bunch of Flyers and it, you know, it didn't really work for me.
And so, you know, a few months later, I was talking to a friend of mine who had, you know, multiple successful locations.
He was doing well.
And I was like, hey, you know, I did.
4:47
He's like, you should do Flyers.
So I was like, Nah, I did that.
It didn't work for me.
He's like, well, you know what, What was your, what was your test size?
And I was like, test size.
What do you mean?
He was like, well, how many did you test before you, you know, scale it up?
And I was like, well, I mean, I put 300 out and he was like 300, like total.
5:05
And I was like, well, yeah, he's like, I don't even test for less than 5000 Flyers.
And all of a sudden I was like, whoa, he's like, yeah, he's like, I'll put out 100,000 Flyers a month.
He's like, and I'll get a half a percent or a percent back.
He's like, who walked through the door?
5:22
He's like, yeah, but 100,000 Flyers a percent back.
I get 30 people a day walking in my store.
And I was like, holy cow, My understanding of the sheer volume for the activity that I thought wasn't working was just dramatically under what it really was supposed to be.
5:40
And in that moment, I had a belief broken about what volume really means.
This happens all the time, but I'll tell you a couple other examples in in in a second.
But, like, this happens all the time.
Even, like, fitness stuff.
People are like, man, why can't I get jacked?
And I'm like, you know, why can't I grow my arms?
5:56
It's like, all right, well, how many sets of arms are you doing every week?
And they're like, well, I train arms twice a week.
I'm like, what are you doing?
They're like, well, you know, like three sets of 10.
And I'm like, that's it.
Like per week, like, so 6 total sets.
They're like, yeah, I'm like, well, try 12 sets six days a week.
And I guarantee your arms will drop.
6:11
And they're like, seriously?
I'm like, yeah, imagine that the more you do, the more you look like you can do.
Mosination real quick, if you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
6:31
And if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
So I'll give you a different one that I had.
This isn't a in a in a paid ads example which is similar to Flyers, just a different platform had an agency owner who was walking who was talking to us in within our software company and he was like, hey, you know my leaf was stalling out.
6:55
I can't seem to scale above a certain amount.
And I was like OK, well you know how many pieces of creative are you putting out, you know per week.
And he was like he, I, he confidently answered, right.
So he was like, he was like oh, he's like that.
We have on point.
He's like we're putting out like 5 to 10 pieces of content a week.
7:10
And I was like, per week, he's like, yeah.
And I was like, dude.
And I scrolled over.
I shared my screen of my creative department.
And I was like, we're testing 30 pieces every three days.
He was like, what?
I was like, yeah, it's level of output, quantity of output.
7:30
The level most people dramatically underestimate how much work it takes to make money, right.
The thing is is once you understand and for most people, and this is the point that I'm hoping somebody who's like hasn't gotten their first customer or wants to start on a new channel, if you already have one working, is you usually need to do a lot more because you're S in that equation.
7:49
Your skill level is low and you have no time that has compounded for you.
So you must compensate with extraordinary volume so that you can learn the skill and then begin the compounding process that will give you the throughput or outcome that you desire.
And so a lot of times you got to do a lot more in the beginning to get the ball rolling.
8:09
I switched from one time a week to one times a day.
And here's what's crazy, my growth organically 40X from A7X increase in effort.
So there is a multiplicative effect here because sure, we did more, but we got better at the doing.
8:24
And then the more we did, the more each of those other pieces fed one another, right?
And so again, all of this starts with the doing and taking a lot more than most people anticipate to get the result and get going.
And so this is a different nuance on volume.
8:41
This is more level of effort.
But I think it it bears mentioning because for this concept to kind of sink in, I want to hit it from a couple different angles.
So this is the number one video or at this time is one of the number one videos on the channel.
And The thing is is like, and I and I, I realized that quality most times Trump's quantity, right.
9:02
And The thing is is but quality and quantity.
Trump's just quantity, right?
Or just quality.
And so this particular piece of content took me 20 hours to actually put the slide deck together.
And then two days of travel to go film and then go on, lo and behold, ends up being, you know, the number one thing on there.
9:19
And to me, I was like, well, that's not really surprising.
I spent a ton of time on this.
And so it was just and like, I'm just saying, I get reminded of this at all levels of the game, you know what I mean?
And so I'm making these because, like, as I'm learning it, I'm sharing it so that hopefully it provides some value to you.
9:34
Like, it just takes a lot more work than most people think.
Like, Leila, this is four or five years ago when we were refilming an entire content portal.
So she had probably recorded, God, I don't know, 70 or so videos with, you know, trainings and everything.
9:50
And she got done and she was like, I don't think these are that good.
And she was.
And I was like, I was like, she's like, I just, I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know if they're like, hitting the way I want them to to be.
They're like, just not as crisp.
And we sat there and and I was like, we'll do them again.
10:06
She looked at me and she was like, yeah, you're right.
Because The thing is, is like, and I've said this before and I'll keep saying it like, your work works on you more than you work on it.
The thing we're developing is our character because that's the ultimate prize that we get at the end of the race, right?
We can't keep the stuff that we have with us.
10:22
And so we're doing this work to become better people, right?
And so if you do it again, it's no, it's nothing bad about it.
You're just like, cool.
I get more practice at doing the thing and my S is going to get better in the throughput equation.
So even if you do the same in terms of volume of output, the skill on the equation, the S is going to be higher.
10:42
So you're still going to actually still get more throughput even if you do the same effort again, right?
And so that's why the level of effort and giving a shit for lack of return and really working like violence is the answer.
Doing the boring work and putting the the time under the bar in, to use a fitness analogy is, is what is required.
11:00
And most people dramatically underestimate the volume.
All right.
And so I'm going to tell you this last one to wrap this, wrap this little piece up, which is I wrote this book, right?
And it took me basically like a year to write it.
It took me two weeks to write it.
It took me a year to edit it and right now I I get DMS everyday.
11:18
But The thing is, is the difference between that level of effort is why many times I think things don't work out is that most people put like a 7 out of 10 effort or an 8 out of 10 effort and then look at somebody who put a 10 out of 10 effort in and think, well I didn't put that much less effort in.
11:34
But you don't realize the difference between AN-8 and A10 might be five times the work, but also the difference between AN-8 and A10 might be 100 times the outcome.
And so the actual net outcome on the incremental increase in work is still worth it.
That's what's crazy is that if it takes five times the effort to go from an 8 to A10, you might get 100 times, even though you only did five times more work.
11:58
And so this is one of these beliefs that I, that I've, I've ingrained in myself within how we do business.
But I'm sharing it with you because most things that most people make suck.
Most products suck.
Most marketing sucks.
Most businesses suck and most people suck at the things that they think they're good at, right.
12:15
And it's because they don't even know how to work.
They don't even know how to do it.
And I'll tell you this final story to wrap this up.
When I was a legal intern in a in a past lifetime at a chemical company called Arkema in France, believe it or not, I worked there in the legal department.
12:31
And this older, more experienced, you know, senior lawyer in the department kind of like tap.
I was like, oh, I'm going to go back to work.
And she like, tapped my shoulder And she was like, you don't even know how to work.
And I was like, what do you mean?
And she was like, you're so young.
She's like you don't even know what work really is.
12:48
And it.
And it just hit me and it struck me like to my core because I was like, how can she tell me that?
I don't know how to work.
But here I am, 10 years, 15 years later, and I think to myself, like, man, I had no idea what work even looked like because I don't even know how to focus the way I do know.
I didn't know how to eliminate distractions.
13:04
I didn't know what it looked like to just put Rep after Rep after Rep after Rep in to just get that thing just right.
And the beautiful thing, especially when it comes to marketing stuff, is that when you make those, each of those posts, each of those outreaches, each of those calls, each of those ads that you run make you better, they increase the S And so in that way, the V, the S and the T, the volume, the skill and the time work on each other and then yield you a higher throughput because they are multiplicative, not additive.
13:36
And that's like the one thing that if I can drive this home is that most people just do so much less volume than they think because.
And then they look at the the vehicle that they're using and think, why is this not working when the reality was that you were not working because you did not know how much work really was required to get to where you wanted to go.
13:53
And so with that, in other words, most times you just need to do more than what you're currently doing, and a lot more of it.








0:00
The amount of companies that start with a niche and then expand and expand and redefine their customer, redefine their avatar.
Most businesses have, especially the biggest ones.
Many huge examples start small because they want to narrowly define a problem for a specific avatar and they expand over time.
0:15
But the main point for this one is how much risk am I exposed to that is knowable that I think could potentially break this equation from working in the future.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:34
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
These are 7 investing concepts that'll make you money, starting with #1 Lifetime Gross Profit compared to Cost to acquire a customer, which basically means how much money you make in profit from every person who comes into a business compared to how much it costs to get them to buy to begin with.
1:03
This is the fundamental economic unit of the business.
You buy attention, you buy eyeballs to get customers, and then you sell those eyeballs something that you're gonna make a profit from.
All the profit that gets generated from the business comes from this one ratio.
1:19
And so if someone has, for example, a one to one ratio of LGBT to CAC, they spend a dollar and they make a dollar back.
And so that's it.
You know, let's say, let's say a 20 to 1 means for every dollar they put in, they get 20 back as profit.
This becomes a business that you can scale endlessly and becomes an incredibly attractive business.
1:37
Getting really clear on what your LGP to CAC ratio is, is core to growing anything.
So let's define these terms.
Lifetime gross profit has a couple of components.
There's lifetime and then there's the gross profit component.
So lifetime is like, OK, well, how many times is someone going to pay me within a products business?
1:56
How many times does someone buy on average over the life span Shopify stores?
Things like that will actually just give you this metric which is like the average customer buys 4.3 times.
If you have a services business or a membership based business, then it might be the average lifespan.
2:11
So how many months are they going to stick with you Now if you don't know this because you might be a small business that doesn't have a serum that reports on this kind of stuff, I'll give you the back of napkin way to actually calculate this.
How many customers did I have at the beginning of the month?
Now, of these people that I had at the beginning, 30 days later, what's the number of those people that I have at the end?
2:31
Not the number of customers in total, 'cause you might sell people in between, but I want to know of the people at the beginning of the month, how many of them are still there 30 days later.
So if I had 100 people here at the beginning and I had 90 people at the end, then I would have 10% churn.
2:46
And you're like, OK, what Is that the number?
No.
What we then do is we take one and we divide it by this number, which then means that our average lifespan in this example would be 10 months or 10 intervals, whatever interval you're measuring on.
3:02
Because if I did this quarterly, it would be the same thing.
Or annually it'd be the same thing.
Number of people at the beginning, 100 number below the end 90.
I lost 10, meaning I have a 10% churn, 1 / 10% = 10.
So the average number of months that someone's days is 10 months.
3:18
Everything that I'm going to show you today is stuff that you can do addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.
There's nothing else.
You don't have to be a genius to learn how to invest or build a business.
So now that we just covered Lifetime, now we need to figure out gross profit, which is how much extra cash do we have leftover from each customer after we do a transaction.
3:38
The simplest example I can give you is if this cost me a dollar and I sell it for $2.00, then I have a dollar of gross profit.
Now I still have to take that dollar and pay other costs.
I have to pay rent, I have to pay other fees that go along.
And then my margin is now squeezing from that 50% that was leftover until my Net margin becomes at the end of the day, with widgets or physical products, it's really that simple.
4:02
It's just price minus cost of goods sold.
And so cost of goods sold are going to be all the cost that you have to incur specifically related to delivering the product.
All you're trying to figure out is that the basic transaction, how much money you have leftover.
4:19
Now with physical products, it's typically much simpler than with service based businesses, but I'm going to give you a service based example so you can still understand it because you need to, you need to.
If I sell customers for $1000 a month and I have a an employee who cost me $4000 per month and each employee can handle 10 customers, that means each employee handles $10,000 per month for 10 customers.
4:46
So now all we have to do is say what is our gross margin?
We're going to take the $10,000, we're going to subtract $4000 from it and that gives us $6000 per month gross profit, which was sometimes here expressed as a percentage, which would be 60% gross margins.
5:08
Both of these are the same thing.
One is an absolute number, the other percentage you're seeing how $4000 is my cost.
This is how much I make.
Subtract the two.
That gives you the margin and that gives you the percentage.
Now remember we figured out what our lifetime was and we figure out how much we make per customer or how many months they stayed in that instance.
5:28
Now we combine those two metrics to get the one lifetime gross profit.
Earlier we did the 10% churn example and so let's say that these customers stay on average for 10 months.
Because this is for 10 customers, we can divide this by 10, which gets us $600.00 per month per customer.
5:45
So I just divided the $6000 by the 10 customers to get my how much do I make per customer per month?
So that's $600.00 per month per customer in gross profit.
Now we said earlier that they're staying for 10 months, which means that my lifetime gross profit per customer is $6000 of LTGP.
6:08
So now I know that customers are worth $6000.
So this is important because now this is all the money I have to go spend to acquire them and run the rest of the business.
This is probably one of the biggest mistakes that business owners make, because what they do is they look at their lifetime revenue per customer and say, oh, as long as it cost me less than that in advertising, I'm making money.
6:31
But I'll give you an extreme example to point out why that doesn't work.
Let's say I sell these for $10, this pen for $10.00, but it cost me $9 and the average person buys 10 pence, so it's $100 in revenue but it cost me $90.00 to sell the 100.
6:50
But if my team comes to me and says dude we're killing it, we're spending $50.00 to get $100 sale.
We should do this all day, but what's really happening?
I'm actually spending $50.00 to make $10 in gross profit lifetime.
7:06
Not a good equation and so you don't want revenue to confuse you.
And this is like one of the biggest misunderstandings I see business owners make.
Which is why sometimes, because they don't know this, they don't know why they can't grow.
The reason lifetime value and lifetime gross profit get conflated or confused is because many of the most formal businesses that are out there come from Silicon Valley, which almost exclusively is tech and software, and the gross profits on software are almost always close to 100%.
7:34
The two conflate.
But for everyday business owners who have people, we have manufacturing, we have inventory, we have to pay for stuff to happen that isn't 100%.
And so we're not doing it off revenue.
We have to calculate what our gross profit is because that's what we run our business off of.
7:50
So far we got our $6000 lifetime gross profit.
Cool.
So we've got one part of this equation.
This is incredibly in depth and tactical because I breakdown every concept to its absolute base units O.
My recommendation to get the most out of this is to understand them so you see how they all work together to ultimately help you invest better and then come back through and then do each of the concepts individually so that you can alley them.
8:16
So now we're going to talk about how to how much it costs to acquire a customer.
This is another one that people mess up.
So what a lot of people do is they just look at how much it costs them to advertise to figure out how much it costs them to get a customer.
That's partially true, but not completely for two reasons.
The advertising budget, if you're running paid ads, for example, is only one of the many costs that go into acquiring customer.
8:36
The other issue is that you're not including the labor.
So let's say that we have 5 employees that cost in total $50,000 a month.
That's the labor.
And then let's say we're spending $50,000 a month in software and advertising like Facebook ads or Instagram ads.
8:56
That means that our total cost for as a company is $100,000 per month for all the customers that we acquired that month.
And so then all we do is you look back and say OK how many do we acquire over the last 30 days?
Let's say this $100,000 bought us 83 customers.
9:17
So our cost to acquire a customer would be 100,000 / 83.
Survey says $12104.00.
So this divided by that equals $12104.00 cost to acquire a customer.
9:34
Let's look at our math.
If we have cost US $12104.00 to acquire a customer, and that customer makes us $6000 in lifetime gross profit, we're killing it.
So that means that we have a 5 to 1 LTGP to CAC ratio.
9:51
And if you're like, is that good or is that bad, five to one is great.
You want to make sure that you're always at least greater than 3 to 1 meanings.
Your lifetime gross profit compared to how much it cost you to make that money, is at least three times greater, Otherwise you'll be too constrained to scale.
10:09
If this is bad, I'm just not that I don't need to look at anything else.
I can just automatically toss the business out.
And if this is exceptional, I might be willing to overlook or forgive some other metrics that are coming down the line that aren't as strong.
But if you don't know these numbers in a business that you're buying or investing or business that you own, find them out.
10:29
So I told you earlier that I was going to give you 7.
Well, it turns out that that was three of them because the ratio is 1.
Gross profit is another, and CAC is another.
So we covered three.
We're already almost halfway there.
Real quick wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
10:49
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the.
Only way we do that.
Is if you can rate and review.
And share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb that means the absolute.
11:09
World to me.
And more importantly, it may.
Change the world for someone else.
So #4 is return on invested capital.
All right.
What we're looking at is how much money does it cost us to expand the business.
There are some businesses, like an accounting firm, for example, that the way that they expand the business is that they just hire more accountants.
11:30
There really isn't a lot of what they call capital expenses, which is why I tend to like service businesses.
Now on the flip side, if I was in manufacturing, I'd have to factor in all the machines, a new location, another build out that would go into expanding our capacity to make more stuff, whatever business you have and I do a lot of brick and mortar stuff.
11:51
I want to know first what's the LTGP to CAC ratio at the customer level, but then how much does it cost me to make a location and scale it.
So for example, let's say I have to put $100,000 in to open each new location.
12:06
Now underneath of that $100,000 is going to be the marketing budget to launch the location, the cost to do the build out, hiring staff, recruiters.
If we need that ads for Craigslist to, you know, get new people in, everything is included Because once you do this enough times, you do have a pretty good idea of what that number is.
12:22
And you say, cool, it cost us $100,000 to open each new location and a month, six, we're here at 12 months we're here and at X months we're at capacity.
The question is first, how quickly do I make my money back, which is the payback period?
12:38
Then what is my one year return?
And then what am I making once it's at capacity?
Because I want to know how much cash flow this thing kicks off.
And so in this example, I love to see at least three to 1, ideally 5 to 1, meaning if I put $100,000 in, once we're at capacity, we're at 500,000 per year in profit.
12:59
I put $1.00 in, I get $5 out.
And so this is the same concept is what we're doing here, but just it's scale.
So I'm not buying one customer, I'm buying a custom printing machine.
How much does it cost me to build another machine that creates profit every single year?
13:18
And so from a returns perspective, if I can pay my investment back, for example, in six months, after that everything's gravy.
The part that people don't want to talk about is that all of this stuff cost headspace, right, which is that you have an opportunity cost associated with any investment.
13:33
Meaning what could you have done with the same level of effort and money in the same period of time.
But if at month six I'm breaking even and at month 12 I'm at let's say pacing 250,000 a year and by the 2nd year I'm at 500,000 a year in profit.
13:50
I think great, this is now a node that just kicks off cash flow year after year after year.
And then I think, OK, well, I have $500,000, what am I going to do, open five more locations if something costs very little and makes me a lot good.
Now you might be like, well, the stock market gets 10% returns.
14:08
That would be putting $100,000 in and getting $10,000 back.
I actually really like to see at least, I mean really three to one, which means a 300% return per year kind of at minimum, which sounds ridiculous, but I'm putting time and effort in, so these are not passive investments.
14:25
For me.
It's different if I give someone cash and they do all the work and then I just get dividends, then that's different.
But if I'm actively working, then I have to account for all the time that I'm putting into this.
And so for me, I want to make sure that I have a really strong return profile to justify the cost of time.
14:41
So there's two big variables that come into faster, slow payback period.
One is how much is this build out.
But if you have a massive build out, sometimes it can be hard to pay that back quickly.
The 2nd is how good they are at launching.
Somebody might have five locations but not really have a new location strategy for a new city.
14:59
So this happens a lot in brick and mortar chains where they've got five locations in one city and there cannot they can drive to all of them, but then they really want to expand and going from 5, 20 is a totally different game.
Now mind you that's what we specialize in.
But you now have to go to a new market where no one knows you and actually have a launch strategy that ideally and this is what we like to do, fill up the facility.
15:23
So I want to get to this capacity as fast as humanly possible and sometimes that means, hey, you guys have a $10,000 budget for opening.
Let's put 40 into opening so that we're opening full and then we're already at 500,000 year run rate by month 6.
15:39
So if you're a brick and mortar business by the way and you would like to scale, go to acquisition.com.
And to be clear, this is for businesses that are doing at least $1,000,000 a year in profit, ideally 3:00 to 5:00.
So let's go through #5, which is payback period.
Simply put, how quickly are you paid back for getting a new customer.
15:59
So we talked about return on invested capital at the business level, but now I'm going all the way back down to the unit of how long does it take me to recover the cost to acquire a customer?
Remember the CAC was $600.00.
Well, I spent 600.
How quickly do I get it back?
And so if you had two scenarios, one scenario where it takes you three months to get your $600.00 back versus another scenario where you put $600 in and get $6000 in the 1st 30 days, which one would you rather have?
16:27
Well, if both of them have the same lifetime gross profit, you'd rather get the money sooner.
That number of how long it takes me to get paid back is you an indicator of how cash flow positive.
The businesses for the big fancy investors, they don't care about as much because they're working with this massive companies and long payback cycles and all this stuff.
16:43
But small business owners, that's how you live and that's how you expand.
What we try and do when we're looking at a business is OK, what is the payback period and are there some easy levers that we can do to drive it forward?
I'll give you a couple easy ones.
So #1 is, I could say, hey, with that example we gave it was $1000 a month.
17:02
Can we just get them to pay first and last month upfront?
That'd be an easy way to drive, drag some of that cash flow forward and I could break even and make my payback period one month.
A second way to do that would be some sort of fee, which is I say, hey, I have an onboarding fee, an enrollment fee and initiation fee, a setup fee.
17:21
But the point is that you charge a fee of some sort in addition to whatever the recurring revenue is.
Third way to do it is you could have an upsell of some sort.
This is structured as a fee.
The other is an upsell.
This one is optional.
This one is mandatory.
Functionally, they're the same thing.
We're trying to drag more revenue up front.
17:37
A fourth way you could do this is that you could get financing in place, right?
So you get a third party bank or financing partner who says, I would like to make interest on some of these payments that you have with your business.
I will front you the whole amount that this person owes you, but I'm going to take a piece for taking on the risk.
17:54
And so you basically give your risk away to somebody else, they take a fee for that and then you get cashed upfront. 4 easy ways that you can think about to try and decrease your payback period.
And in other words, get more cash faster.
If we're looking at this from a timeline perspective.
So $1200 is the cost to acquire.
18:11
If we spread that out, the first one, I get 600, so I'm still at -600.
And then I have another 600 that comes in month two.
So now I'm at 0, so it took me two months to break even.
In the second scenario, I add a fee, let's say another $600.00 and it's just processing fee.
18:30
I cost me nothing to do this, All right?
So now my first transaction, I make $1200 back and I'm already at breaking even at zero.
And then here I get my 600, but I'm +600 now.
And so this business is a healthier business that will be more adaptable, resilient in a downturn than this one.
18:48
Let's do number six.
Six and seven are real short and then I'll give you a bonus 1, #8.
So these are all about predictions.
So up to this point, we've gotten a steady state of, OK, this is what the business is 6-7 and eight are all about, what it can do in the future.
OK.
19:04
So number one that I love this one is sales velocity times lifetime gross profit, which means how many units are we selling per month times what are these people going to be worth to me over the lifetime that you can also do this as LTV as well because that's also a good metric to at least understand, especially if sometimes margins can improve with scale.
19:26
So that can be helpful to just know both.
Let's say that I sell 100 customers a month times $6000 in in lifetime gross profit and it was $10,000 in lifetime value, right, which is how much revenue they're going to generate, remember because we still had all the costs associated.
The nice thing with this is that we can see, especially with this one, where the revenue of the business is going to be at scale because especially if you have a recurring revenue business, it might take time for them for the business to actually get to its hypothetical Max.
19:58
And so the assumption here is that if nothing else changed in the business, they don't sell more customers and the customers don't become worth any more than they already are.
Where will this business even out?
And so in this example, $1 million a month.
Now This is why this is so important.
20:15
If someone comes to me and they're doing $500 a month and they have these metrics, then I know that the business is going to double without doing anything, which is great.
On the flip side, if a company comes to me and has these metrics, which it still could and it's doing $2,000,000 a month, then I know that it's going to shrink.
20:32
Means that they were either selling more units earlier on in the past and think something happened.
Their Facebook ads got shut down, they got a bad rap on their content.
Or and this is probably the more common one, their delivery started to drop and so their churn started to increase.
20:49
And so their lifetime values actually dropped per customer because they couldn't scale well.
And so I can say even though you're at 2 million a month right now, if things keep going the way they are, it's actually going to drop down to a million a month, all right.
And so this gives you a really good idea of a snapshot of where someone's going to be versus where they are.
21:08
So you might be wondering how can the lifetime value of a customer change for a business?
Well, a churn goes from 5% to 10%, then it means you cut your lifetime revenue in half tough, but that's why churn numbers and retaining customers are so important is if you go from 10% turn to 5%, you also double the lifetime revenue of a customer.
21:32
And so This is why the health of the business based on what it's hypothetical Max is, can change.
And so the longer period of time you take the average over realistically the more accurate will be if you did this on a daily basis, it would be really volatile in smaller businesses, small businesses are volatile.
And so it's good to have snapshots of, OK, well what was it trailing 90, trailing 6 months, trailing 12 months to get a much better idea.
21:54
And you can calculate this at each of those.
And then you can look at all three and say, OK, well, this is what I think it really is.
And all of this helps you ask better questions as an investor.
So I'm going to give you the next one, which is very similar to this one, which is sales velocity divided by churn.
22:09
So churn, remember, we defined this earlier at the beginning, number of customers and let's say it's 10% per month, OK.
It's the number of customers who leave.
And let's say again we've got 100 customers in terms of sales velocity.
This means that our hypothetical Max in terms of logos or number of customers that the that the business is going to have to sustain or maintain is going to be 1000 customers.
22:33
Now remember we have 1000 customers remember was paying $1000 a month, $1,000,000 a month.
These calculations work together.
This tells me how much money are we going to be making when we're at our hypothetical Max.
And this tells me how many customers are going to have to be servicing at our hypothetical Max.
22:50
We're coming down and I'd say we'll do right now you have the infrastructure to maintain 2000 customers, but we're going to be at 1000.
You're going to have to be looking at head count, which sucks.
On the flip side, if we've got 500 customers, we're doing 500,000 a month and I know we're going to get to 1000, I'm going to say, hey, how could we scale and make sure that we don't break on our way to 1000 because we're going to get there in X months, That's six and seven.
23:13
And now we'll go to bonus #8, the secret bonus, which wraps all of this stuff together.
This equation is really in relation to how big the opportunity is.
So Tam is just a fancy word for total addressable market, which is how many people could I potentially sell.
And So what I'm analyzing an opportunity is number of potential units times lifetime gross profit divided by risk.
23:34
And so this ultimately gets at how big of a company do I think this could ultimately be?
If we're servicing, you know, vegan moms with three kids who like powerlifting, then there might only be 50,000 of them and someone have 50,000 potential units old.
23:51
That's assuming we get 100% of the market to buy.
And that might not be true, but that would be here is what's what?
How many units could we potentially sell?
The lifetime gross profit is well, how much do we make on all of these people.
This would give us an idea of how big the opportunity is.
24:08
This is all the good stuff.
The big question is how likely is that going to happen.
Risk has a zillion categories.
So that's beyond the scope of this video.
But do I think that there is a trend?
Are there going to be more vegan powerlifting moms in the future or there may be less vegan powerlifting moms in the future?
So for example, right now I am looking at fertility stuff.
24:26
Tons of people are having fertility issues.
I think it's going to be a booming market in the future.
So something that services anything related to fertility, we'll probably have big tailwinds behind it.
You can apply risk to each of these.
So from selling potential units is OK.
24:41
Is the way that we're requiring customers something that's really risky?
Are there going to be platforms that are going to change?
Do we expect this method of getting customers to sustainable?
Is there a key man risk?
Is there somebody who's in charge of that department that if they left would be screwed right.
All of these are factors of risk of how likely it is to happen in the future from the lifetime gross PROSPER perspective, are there other competitors that could come in and undercut us?
25:02
How strong is our position in the marketplace?
Do we have a better product that can't sustain a premium?
Are there economies of scale that we can have or there is there shrinking margins?
So sometimes can happen at scale.
And so these are all risks that could affect our gross profit per customer over the long haul.
25:19
Some people might think, OK, well how, how important is Tam?
It is extremely important, but the ability to assess it is very limited.
This is one of those important and unknown which Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett talk about a lot, which is like you've got things that are knowable and unknowable and unimportant and important.
25:36
And we just want to focus on the knowable and important, the economy and interest rates, very important.
Is it knowable?
No.
So they don't try to predict it with Tam.
I see it kind of in that very important but not knowable and here's why.
The amount of companies that start with a niche and then expand and expand and redefine their customer, redefine their avatar.
25:57
Most businesses have, especially the biggest ones.
Amazon started as a bookstore, now it's an everything store.
Facebook started as a social network for college kids and then became the everything social network.
And so many huge examples start small because they want to narrowly define a problem for a specific avatar and they expand over time.
26:13
But the main point for this one is how much risk am I exposed to that is knowable that I think could potentially break this equation from working in the future.
When you take the first 7 and you plug that into this framework for assessing value or how big this could potentially be, then you have a very good framework to analyse a business yourself or others to potentially invest in or say I'm a no on this one dog.
26:40
And by the way, if you don't have something like this, I'd recommend just put one excel sheet together that tracks your numbers automatically every month because you'll get a much better idea of how your business is doing from a health perspective.
Again, if you're a brick and mortar chain doing $1,000,000 in profit per year or more and you've got a sound model and you want to expand, we're looking for you right now.
27:02
We've done super well with brick and mortar chains expanded really, really big and we're just looking for awesome businesses that we can get involved in.
So specifically service based businesses million plus ideally 3 to 5 million in profit.
So if that's you reach out to us, we can make it rain together.








0:00
I had two different businesses that approached me.
Both had franchises open.
I had almost an identical conversation with both and I'll tell you one of them, which is a whitening teeth whitening business and a breakdown is how I help them walk through this decision of should we go more franchises or should go more privately owned.
And it really comes down to 4 main variables, #1 is the cost versus the return of every dollar you invest in opening more locations.
0:21
The 2nd is the actual effort that it takes to open a location, which comes down to is it centralized or decentralized in terms of where the work is being done, Centralized.
Then it means that there's more operational drag at the franchise or level.
If it's decentralized, there's more work for the franchise.
0:36
The third thing was actually looking at this at scale.
If you have a number you solve for, which almost every entrepreneur that I know who is in a local chain wants to solve for some big exit, usually it's 50 or 100 million.
And if you want to own it forever, totally fine.
You still think about building it as an asset, even if you're never going to sell it just transparently.
0:51
Like we don't want to sell anything anymore.
We want to hold and grow, buy and build, baby.
That's what we do.
But we also understand this so much do want to sell and reversing your net worth goal into what you actually have to open at a location level between franchise and local privately owned ones that you own all of them is a good math number to know because it makes the decision much, much easier.
1:10
And then finally is a little bit of a personal thing, which is which type of entrepreneur are you?
Are you more of a promotional entrepreneur so you love the sales and the marketing and selling the franchise and selling the franchises or are you more of a product driven, operational leadership driven entrepreneur who's like who with a longer time rise and just loves investing in people and building kind of a big thing.
1:27
So breakdown all four of these here.
The business metrics that are top line per location is about 500,000 a year, bottom line per location is 250,000 a year.
The cost to open was 50, so I spend 50, I make 500, top line I keep 250 a year later.
Really good numbers.
If you have a business that gets like less than 100% return on capital, meaning it usually makes more sense to franchise right off the bat because the return on capital is too slow and not big enough.
1:52
If you look at a McDonald's for example, it cost 1.11 point, $2,000,000 to open to McDonald's.
They make 150,000 a year on average.
So you're looking at like a 15% rate of return, right, Versus spend 50, make 250, you're talking about 5X, right?
Very different.
2:07
And this happens all the time.
I've seen this with moving businesses that have crazy returns on capital, seen with gym business, doesn't really matter with the businesses.
But you have to switch from your business hat to your investor hat and start looking at your business investment.
Because once you start generating real money, you have to think where is the best place I can put my money.
2:23
And if opening another location 5X is your money, every year you go from 1,000,000 to 5,000,005 to 25 to 25 to 125.
That becomes a very attractive machine.
If you expand the time horizon, we have this business.
These individuals had decided to do the franchise.
So this is what their franchise economics looked like.
2:39
They would get 7 1/2% of top line.
It's a royalty on top line and it's usually some sort of marketing fund that everyone chips into so they can get national branding.
Some franchises do flat fees, some do royalties, doesn't really matter.
There's a certain percentage of revenue that you're going to collect.
Now these guys were charging 7 1/2 and so on 250, it was like $35,000 per year that they're making from the franchise.
2:59
OK, stay with me.
Now if the franchise runs at the same margins at the individual locations at 50%, so $20,000 of what they're going to make in net earnings at the franchisor level per location that they open.
Here's the kicker and this moves us on to our second kind of variable here.
3:16
You've moved past the first checkpoint and you're like, OK, our economics are pretty good, like we're over 100%.
We're in that line.
But now it's like, well, how hard is it if you have $20,000 in net earnings per franchise you open and you've got 250,000 per location that you open on your own.
The franchises get usually two times the multiple that a brick mortar local chain will get.
3:36
So they might get like 15 times earnings in terms of the enterprise value, what an investor might buy for it because franchises usually have a certain amount of open and usually more have yet to be open.
And so an investor is willing to pay 15 times today because they already really know they're paying.
3:52
If nothing else changes, a 5X multiple because they know the other 200 are going to open guaranteed.
It's legal.
It has to happen versus getting 8X on the individual locations, 8X on 250 would be $2,000,000 versus 15X on 20, which would be 300,000, which means that for every location you open at the franchise level, you add $300,000 to the franchise valuation.
4:14
For every location you open on the privately held side, you would add $2,000,000.
So that then informs how hard is it to open these locations, what is the constraint?
If we have a super decentralized model, meaning the franchisees do most of the work, then it might mean that we could open 10 times more franchises for the same effort as opening one.
4:32
At that point it might make more sense to open more franchise locations.
If it's super centralized and you're doing most of the work, then sometimes it makes a lot more sense to actually just keep opening locations on your own provided the return on capital is there.
You don't need to open spend $1,000,000 to open a facility to make 200 grand, right.
4:47
And the numbers pencil out where you just look dollars and cents.
If I want to have $100 million exit, which you can't have an exit or not, but you can still always build as though we're a sellable entity.
Like we will always build an asset so that it is sellable, not so that we sell it.
So 100 million means 50 locations open privately or 333 locations open with a franchise.
5:07
And so you have to look at that and think, OK, if I can open let's say one or two locations a month, which most franchise locations do, then it would only take me like 2, maybe three years to get to this number.
Now what's my rate of opening at the franchise level?
Often times, especially with when I talk to franchisors, they're usually limiting factors, internal not external.
5:25
The problem is internal.
Then it means maybe they can open like three or four locations for the franchise which means they would actually take them longer to get their ultimate outcome and that's assuming they can sell franchises like hotcakes, which is not always that easy.
That leads me to the 4th point on this checklist that I walk through mentally.
5:41
The final thing is just personality wise.
So if I look at an entrepreneur and they're super promotion driven, they love selling, they love, they love the sizzle, they love the the hunt right of selling franchises and franchising when I'm at 5050 might still be the right play.
On the flip side, if there's somebody who's a little more product driven, a little more leadership driven, like love the OPS, all that kind of stuff, then it might be more of a self sustained lower number, higher value play.
6:02
And here's the key difference.
If you have a really stark difference between franchise versus private, let's say a super promotion driven entrepreneur, but all the math says that you should own it privately, then if you phrase the thing that you don't like as a deficiency in the business then it becomes very solvable.
So for example, staffing each of these locations becomes hard.
6:19
You've got all these kind of low skill, low wage employees which can be difficult to manage, lots of churn etcetera.
So what do you do?
You hire somebody who's ran a staffing for a franchise that's gone from 50 to 250 multiple times.
That's what I would do.
And we invest, that's exactly what the move would be.
We can take somebody who's super promotion driven and then bring in one or two people to support them in the things that they don't like that are way better than them at it.
6:39
And then you get the outcome where the math and the personalities work together to build the ultimate enterprise value.
And on the flip side, if you're super like OPS product etcetera type entrepreneur, but all the metrics say that you should franchise this thing, then we bring a really hypey sales driven person into the business to go hunt for you to bring more franchises in so that you can scale faster because that's the way that your models been set up.
7:01
Either way, these are variables that you can play with and those are the four points that I look at as checklist of how I'm going to scale a local business that comes to us.
We made a checklist so that you can actually look through these four things for yourself, actually go through it and fill it out and look at both those things because you'll actually look at as an investor and it'll make you a Better Business owner.








0:00
I think that most things are actually significantly easier than people think they are.
They just don't know how to try hard because the harder that you try, the easier it gets.
And so it's like if you can just learn to love what trying hard feels like, then all of a sudden it becomes unreasonable that you can't win.
0:18
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Whenever I wanted to try and get myself back into the present, I used to have brain fog a lot in my 20s.
0:35
Oh really?
And maybe not brain fog.
Maybe just the clarity of my thoughts now is so much better than it used to.
But I don't fucking know.
Maybe that was a big thing.
Maybe it was just the drugs.
I don't know.
But one of the things I used to, I used to have this.
I still have this BMW sat on my drive with the perforated steering wheel, and I remember that if I ran my thumbs across the steering wheel and I really felt the perforation, really felt it, or I'd do it with a leaf, I'd pick a leaf up and I'd really feel the sensation of the leaf.
1:04
I couldn't think about anything.
You can only have one thought at one time.
You cannot think two things right.
You have a super computer inside of your head and it's got one MB of RAM.
So just think the one thought, OK, so this next one, me and you text each other pretty frequently about we've seen this cool thing and someone's repurposed like one of the things that we've done, which is cool, and it makes me feel good that things that we've said or that you've said largely get repurposed.
1:29
This is something that hadn't happened before, which is you misquoted me, but improve the quote.
So this was like the human centipede of content creation, and then I named it so this is fames seesaw.
When you're on your way up, everyone roots for you because you remind them of their dreams.
1:48
When you're at the top, everyone tears you down because you remind them that they gave up on them and you have one, which is for anyone who needs a reminder.
No one is going to hate on you for doing worse than them.
And this is interesting because kind of like the challenges you face in the beginning, you don't have anything to say no to.
2:09
Therefore the woman in the red dress is easy to say no to or there are fewer women.
This is a challenge that nobody is going to give you any sympathy for.
It's a very unique category of challenge because the total addressable market for sympathy is basically 0, because almost everybody is on their way up and very few people are at the top, and the people that are at the top are seen as having a degree of privilege that almost legitimates you twisting the knife or you poking the finger.
2:37
This is how public figures can have normal, everyday people on Twitter say unspeakable, like heinous things to them, dehumanizing things because they do not see them as human.
They don't see them as a person.
There is no person on the other side of this.
There is, it's they're a representation.
2:54
They're in a menagerie of of of ideas.
Therefore I can say whatever I want to them because they're not.
They're not really a person, but they are.
And the fact that before there is any status associated with tearing you down, no one is incentivized to tear you down and you haven't changed.
3:17
Fuck dude, the Lewis Capaldi documentary.
I've watched this twice now.
No, Lewis Capaldi is the singer.
Scottish singer.
Amazing dude, really fascinating story, suffering a lot with mental health that makes this first album and billions, billions of streams world tour phenomenal.
3:33
And he's playing songs that he wrote in 2017 and played in working men's pubs around Scotland.
The same songs go to #1.
So not just that he's become better, he's the same guy, the same guy.
And maybe his production's improved, maybe his recording quality has improved, he's got better mastering and his voices, voice coaching has got a bit better, but he's largely the same person.
3:53
He hasn't changed.
And he has this quote halfway through, and it really spoke to me.
And he said fame doesn't change you.
It just changes everybody around you.
Yeah.
And that's when you're on your way up.
Everyone roots for you because you remind them of their dreams.
4:10
When you're at the top, everyone tears you down because you remind them that they gave up on them.
That really?
Yeah, that spoke to me.
I wrote an essay on this because I'm a psychopath.
Yeah, when I was a gym owner.
So a lot of people don't know this, but I got, I got a writing scholarship in college.
4:25
Like, I was a vice president in the newspaper.
I was editor of the creative writing magazine.
So, like, I've been writing for a long time.
I enjoy writing.
And I wrote this essay.
I said, I think the title of it was Everyone believes in the American Dream until it comes true.
4:43
And I remember because what had happened was everybody when I, when I was sleeping on the gym floor, right.
Like, you know, I was the.
I was the underdog.
And everyone, you know, my clients were all like, oh good for you.
You know you're going after your dream.
They'd see my blanket and my pillow in the corner of the gym and they knew I was sleeping there and it was evident.
4:59
You know, I I, I lived there.
I didn't have a shower.
I didn't have a shower to go to the YMCA, to go shower and that everybody was like pro me.
And then people come in they sign up like I'm gonna, I'm gonna support you, right.
And then within nine months, I had hired people and I had a manager.
5:15
And I pulled up and I'm, I walked in the lobby.
And all the same, the same people.
We're like, ah, boss man's here.
Oh, you're you're not too good for us now, right?
And I remember being so Jarred by the experience, and I was like, you guys rooted for me.
5:34
And I was like, and now I I did what you said you were rooting for me to do.
And that was when I realized that people want you to do well but not better than them.
And I was like, I had gone from underdog to the man.
And I was like, when does that happen?
5:51
And the litmus test of when it happens is depends on who the person is.
Cause for the person who was working at my gym, who, you know, was was a janitor or a cleaner, it happened really quick, right?
For the people who were more successful, it took longer.
And then, you know, the only people at the end who would still work for me were the business owners who were doing way better than me, right, Who were still members of my gym.
6:11
And so that was a really interesting experience that happened when I was 23 and that was the first time I went from underdog to the person that someone would want to attack.
But I had a performance coach tell me this.
He said hatred isn't isn't something you avoid.
6:30
He said it is a requisite for success.
He said if you get no hate, you are not successful.
And for some reason that just like really stuck with me because then it just like rather than it being this thing that I was trying to avoid, it actually became a leading indicator or an indicator that I was on the right path in achieving things.
6:48
And so I think that's why, I mean, I, I I don't want, I don't want to toot horns or anything.
But in terms of like my ability to deal with the naysayers and things like that, I feel like I'm pretty good at it.
Like, it doesn't really bug me very much.
And I think in large part it was because of how it's framed, at least how you know in this discussion, how it was framed from here early on, which is that no one hates you from above.
7:14
And even, you know, even when I think back about like the bullies and whatnot that you had earlier, like even in middle school, like there were things that I had that were going for me that I couldn't recognize.
Because of course, everything that comes easy to you are things that they're easy to use.
7:30
So you don't think that they're, you know, new or interesting or or cool or cool and but like, at the same time, I was like and I'd advanced a grade in multiple, in multiple subjects.
I had, you know, straight as.
I worked really hard.
I was in shape, right?
And I but I had these people who would hate, but I, I, you know, you internalize it.
7:48
But like now I can look back and be like, it's kind of like the the parents were like it's because she's into you, right?
No, it might not be the same that way.
But but just thinking about it as an indicator that the hate is actually the light, that you're on the right path.
8:06
We spoke about this last time that nothing is going to be worthwhile that doesn't come with an associated amount of discomfort.
Therefore, when you start to feel friends around you and the people that you used to be able to speak a common language with, start to push back and start to make the quips of, oh, not drinking tonight.
8:33
Yeah, oh, you must be too cool for us now.
I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.
That is the lead indicator.
Not even the lagging indicator.
That is the lead indicator that you are doing the right thing.
And a lot of people listen to this podcast.
I get messages from people like hey man, I'm a 22 year old rugby player from the northwest of of the Uki live in Cumbria.
8:54
None of my friends understand me.
I want to do personal growth.
I don't want to live in the UK.
And when I listen to modern Wisdom I feel less alone and it fuck it, it makes me tear up because I'm like fuck like I see me in that person.
I see me in that and the it's so hard to reframe it.
9:14
The pushback you are getting is the indicator that you are doing the right thing.
It is.
And if you can reframe the distaste that you get from other people as the same as that.
9:31
Because they're projecting the things that they know they should be doing, that you are doing, that they're not doing.
And you remind them of that.
And so it's that it's even.
So even though the mountain that you're climbing is actually a smaller one than the one that you ultimately want to climb, you're actually at the top of their mountain.
9:47
And so they start tearing you down.
So like, that's where the the underdog story that we said the very beginning of this with the quote, which is like on the way up, they root for you.
And then when you're at the top, they try and tear you down because you remind them of the dreams that they couldn't accomplish, right.
And so you quitting drinking or you staying in to work on your side hustle or your project or the business that you want to launch the podcast that might be you might be at the top of their mountain.
10:09
And so they are tearing you down because now you remind them that they haven't done it and it's purely a projection of them onto you and has nothing to do with you.
And that I hope that that comforts someone because what you said, I think it's like if you're going through that right now and like and I promise you, every single person who wants to do something with their life and has done something with their life has gone through the exact chapter that you're going through.
10:33
And it's the lonely chapter.
It's the chapter where you you're you don't fit in with your own friends but you don't have the outcomes yet to fit into a new group of friends.
And you're doing this thing.
You're consuming content on the Internet.
You're you're doing these free tutorials online to try and figure out how to set up a podcast and where do I host this thing.
10:49
And then there and and and you're going through this and you're like, am I?
Is this even worth it?
Because you have no signs of success, Right.
But if there's anything that you can take away from what we're saying right now is that the sign of success is the hate that you get along the way.
And what you can't do is bend the knee to their hate and fit back into the conformity because it's comfortable and it's warm.
11:08
Because, like in the Matrix, when Trinity opens the door, when when Neo's about to go take the red pill and he wants to get out of the car, she says Neo, you've been down that road and you know exactly where it leads and I know that's not where you want to be.
And then he closes the door.
11:24
Like right now, this moment that you're going through is Trinity opening the door and being like you could go back, but then you'd have to remember exactly what the reason was that you decided not to go out to begin with.
Just because you listen to this podcast and you consume this content and you're like I can fucking do more than this.
Like because you are starting to live in some of that.
11:41
How?
Where you look in the mirror and you're like, I can do more and you start to see the person that you could be and you're like, this does start to feel like hell.
The reason that it's uncomfortable, and the reason that I do have sympathy for the people that see this is ignorance in some regards is bliss.
11:58
As soon as you begin to posit an ideal, you then begin to compare yourself to that ideal, and the gap in potential between you and the person that you could have been begins to get more stuck.
And even the slightest glimmer of wow, I can.
12:15
I can read a book or follow a course or listen to a podcast and then work really, really hard on one thing and change the thermodynamics of my mind, change the texture of my own existence day-to-day, because I worked at a thing and now I understand nutrition.
12:31
You know, I know Kung Fu like I I understand nutrition or I can I understand how to sleep.
Well, OK.
As soon as you know that sleep is important and what you need to do to do it.
Every single night of bad sleep that you have is on you.
Because before you had the excuse that you're ignorant.
12:48
And guess what?
Now you don't.
Every worthwhile goal is worthwhile because it has a cost associated with it.
And so the cost that you're going through is what makes the goal worthwhile to begin with.
Because if what you are were setting out to do were immediately available to you, then it would mean it would be immediately available to everyone, which means it wouldn't be worthwhile.
13:11
So the very fact that it's difficult is why it is worth doing.
And so, like, we can't resent the price tag of the shoes that we want to buy, we just have to make the decision of whether or not we want to pay it.
There's another real hammer blow you don't get very touchy feely with with like, you know, I live in Austin now, so I'm like in in the psychedelic Mecca of the United States and people talk a lot about like trauma and and and and improvement and stuff like that.
13:39
Self love is holding yourself to a higher standard than anyone else does.
That's really interesting to me.
I think it's believing in the 85 year old version of you who's exactly who you want to be, and then ruthlessly looking at the discrepancy between the the pittance of a human that you are now compared to that man or that woman.
14:06
And then step by step breaking down the many differences and starting on the first one and pulling the thread.
I love the idea that you know, truth, truth, self love a lot of the time is wrapped in acceptance and a degree of belonging.
14:23
I reject this entirely.
I just want to.
I just want to throw it out there.
That doesn't surprise me.
The idea that self love is holding yourself to a higher standard than anyone else does, you believing in you more than anybody else does is such a first principles way of looking at self love.
14:45
OK, so I'm supposed to love myself.
I'm supposed to support myself and be my biggest fan, but I don't have the most belief in me.
So I'm supposed to have self love, but I cap my own potential.
15:06
I have so many thoughts.
So right off the bat even the concept of fan was something that I I if I was if you're if I was talking to 2013, 2012, Alex, I would have rejected that notion.
Not like the the concept, even being a fan of myself was so far into me, it wouldn't been real to me.
15:23
And so I'll tell you what that Alex internalized, which was that I didn't need to deserve success, but I could still have it if I did the things that created success.
And so it felt like a cheat code where I was like, I can actually be a shitty person and horrible and suck at everything.
But if I still work out and I still eat this way, I can still look this way even though I don't deserve it.
15:43
And that was like the first, it actually felt like I was like, if for anybody who hates themselves, you can hear me, that was like my first big shade, my first solace, my first foothold that I started getting on success was that I didn't need to deserve it.
I could still have it anyways.
And that was like very empowering for me.
16:01
The other thing that you said about acceptance, so there's this big movement around self acceptance and I want to say that I wholeheartedly reject it.
I You accept outcomes and you accept circumstances.
16:17
You accept the fact that you were dealt whatever hand you were dealt.
You accept that you're 5/8.
You accept that you're black.
You accept that you're a woman that's accepting you trying to rebel against that is you trying to fight the universe, and the universe is gonna win every time.
But in terms of you framing acceptance as saying that I am comfortable with who I am and I cannot be better and I must be satisfied with that, is the biggest embodiment a failure that I can imagine is that it's almost, it's almost, it's almost egotistical to say that there's a difference between saying I am good enough and I am good.
16:54
So you could say I am good enough for my current state based on the work that I've put into it, but I could be better.
And so, like, you can accept that the work that you have done has created the outcome that you've created.
But you do not need to accept that the outcome that you've created is the end all be all and the last outcome that you need to need to have.
17:12
And so for me, like the only version of acceptance that I have is that I accept that the version of myself that I want to be is is so far from who I am that I have this massive discrepancy that I have to overcome.
And then just breaking that down one step at a time and thinking, I don't, I don't deserve to be that man, but I can still do the things that can create it.
17:36
And it also means that I have to go through the circumstances that that would create that man.
Which means that if I have unbelievable big dreams and big goals, then I have to go through hard times.
It's like hate.
The hard times are a requisite for success.
And so if you're going through hard times right now, it means that you're on the path to success.
17:54
And it's not that you're on the wrong path, it's the feeling of being on the right path.
And one of the things that I talk with with the CEOs in our portfolio company and I'm going to bring it back, one of our companies, they were struggling with growth big company.
And he was like I honestly the issue that I have right now, he's like I I don't know how many locations I can open every month.
18:14
He's like based on the cash flow that's coming in and out.
And I was like this is kind of like the Morpheus free frame and I was like I need you to freeze this moment.
I was like the feeling that you have right now is that you are missing a finance function is that they didn't have a good finance leader and you're like why is this relative to what we're talking about?
I'll bring it back, which is that if it's the first time you're going through it, you can't recognize the science because you don't have anything to compare it to.
18:36
And so hopefully listening to this podcast and listening to other people, not just, you know, not me and Chris, but like other people who are even even more successful, whatever, they can at least tell you what it tastes like.
They can tell you what the room looks like.
They can tell you what it, the temperature feels like.
They can tell you what it feels like in their bodies.
So that when you are going through it, you can say, OK, I haven't been here before, but this sounds like Albuquerque.
18:55
This sounds like a missing finance.
And that's why having like and if you're in the early on stages and and and and you're going through the like you're going, you're consuming the free content and stuff.
It's like use this because the most valuable thing you can get is the context of what the experience feels like when you're going through it.
So someone can describe to you their experience so that you can relate it to your present and be like, OK, OK, I'm on the right path.
19:15
Yeah, it's the feeling of loneliness and uncertainty.
Hang on, What if this?
What if this is a sign that I'm not supposed to be here?
What if this is a sign that I'm doing it wrong, Right.
And relinquishing that.
The if there was a big meta indicator that you're doing the right thing, doing what everyone isn't doing is already probably the big.
19:35
The single biggest indicator that you're doing the right thing like it's it's the if, if, if I could wish nothing else on my child whenever I choose to have them in the future is that they have high agency, which is that they are.
They make decisions independent from the opinions of other people.
And when we hear words like authentic and original and things like that, it's because the person starts at square one and says, well what do I want?
19:56
And then they start building from there.
I had a conversation with one of my one of my teammates who runs our our my LinkedIn, and he said, you know Alex, it's easy for you to.
Always.
Always a Really great start to a sentence.
Really good.
20:13
Please tell me more.
Why do you go on?
He said it's it's easy for you, Alex, to create this personal brand.
He's like, you have so many interesting things about you.
He's like you dress a certain way, you act a certain way.
And he said it's different than everyone else does, right?
20:30
And I said, I don't think that's true.
I think that everyone has a personal brand that is unique and different, but everyone doesn't look that way because they conform to what what they think everyone else wants them to look like.
And so the fact that they are boring and they resent the fact that they're boring is because they are living out reflections of what what they think everyone else wants them to do.
20:55
And so all you have to do is start at square zero and be like, what do I want?
Because I realized after I got out of Jim launch that, I mean, I dressed a certain way for Jim launch because I was the head of an entire community of gyms and it made sense for me to dress that way because I needed to.
I needed to look that part right.
But when I was at Ground Zero and I was like, OK, what do I want?
21:14
And I thought about it for a long time and I was like, well, what would 85 year old me wear?
I was like 85 year old me would wear probably the most functional thing he could wear because he's doesn't care what his shoes look like.
He doesn't care what his shirt looks like.
He just wants to be comfortable.
And so I just started trying all the things that I could possibly imagine for shoes, shorts, hats, whatever, to find the thing that I was like, you know what?
21:34
This is the most comfortable.
And this allows me to do the most things in the most rooms without changing.
And so people then are like, man, that's so unique.
But it it was actually just saying, if I were to or if everyone was gone from existence, what would I do?
What would my work be, right?
How would I dress?
21:50
Who would I date?
That's a real one.
Who would I date if no one else told me what they thought about it?
Maybe someone different than you're dating right now?
And if the person that you would want to date isn't the person you're dating right now, and the person that you'd want to date would never date you, then maybe rather than dating these mediocre mollies or mediocre mats, you take the period of time you go on the untrodden path you have people reject you and say hello.
22:14
You're not coming out tonight.
You're going to the gym again, right?
Oh, oh, can't eat with us, right?
She's on.
She's on a diet again.
How long you gonna stick with this one, right?
Because The thing is, is that the stick to it in muscle itself is something that you work on.
Because if you started diets and you failed and you start working out and you failed, if you just make it longer every time before you fail, you're still making progress and you're still doing something that everyone else isn't doing.
22:35
And that is the biggest meta indicator that you possibly can is if if because everyone sucks like so many people are mediocre, like half of the United States is in debt, they don't even have a dot like they they're they're negative net worth.
And so, like, just saying different than that, like the bar isn't high.
22:55
We talked about this dude.
Go for it.
I know, I know.
It's trying to go for.
It the bar has never been set lower to separate yourself out from the pack, never been set lower.
And this is for, you know, the black pill Internet with black.
Pill, by the way.
It is supposed to be one step beyond the red pill to see that life and dating largely for men is.
23:16
There's an uncomfortable reality that if you aren't blessed with the right physical attractiveness, status, or money, LSM looks LMS looks money status.
If you don't have the right prerequisites, you're you're basically doomed.
You're a genetic dead end and eat shit.
Is that a bad thing?
23:33
According to them.
So, OK, I'm going to, I'm going to zoom out real quick and then I, I I know, I know we're going to go on this.
So if we're looking at a species, right, let's look at deer, right.
A lot of people have deer in their backyard, right?
Well, what is natural is that $1.00 inseminates 50 doe and he competes with all the other deer.
23:56
And the reason for that is because then it actually allows the, quote, best genes to proliferate.
Now best is determined by what actually continues continues on, right?
Perilously close to eugenics here, Alex.
Well, I'm just talking about.
I'm just talking about deer.
I'm just talking about deer, if anyone.
24:12
I'm just talking about deer.
I'm not saying this is what it should be.
But the the, the, the point that that I wanted to make was not, I think where everyone thinks I'm going with this, which is that a lot of the, you know, the black whatever you just said, right.
Black pill, I would imagine are casting an expectation on the universe that it shouldn't be this way.
24:29
Why not?
And this is exactly like the hater who says you're not gonna amount to anything.
And the reason it hurts is because you're like, what if they're right?
And then you're like staring at the mirror with that question of, like, what if they're right?
What if I am out of shape?
What?
Like, 'cause The thing is, is that, like, in order to be the top quote 1% or even the top 10% shoot, or even just above average, right?
24:50
You just need to not be overweight.
To the bar.
You need not be overweight, right?
You need to be gainfully employed.
The bar is so low.
The bar is so unbelievably low.
I got this idea I got to I got to teach you about the alpha history fantasy.
25:07
Modern men who are angry at a world they feel has rejected them, mistakenly believe that they would have somehow done better in medieval times.
They are adamant that the chance of them being Genghis Khan is greater than the chance of them being Canon fodder peasant #1,373,000 whose favela was sacked and destroyed.
25:24
And it's this wistfulness for the past and dude, I get it.
Like if you feel lost and alone and like nobody understands you, and like you've been forgotten and and things shouldn't be this way, guess what?
They've always been this way, and right now the bar has never been set lower.
If you have the opportunity to sit down and listen to me and Alex waffle on for 3 1/2 hours, you have the capacity, the conscientiousness, the wherewithal to be able to go out tomorrow and take one thing that you've hit from today.
25:55
This is this is something that I want you to get on to which which I think is important which is oh sorry go on avoiding the mental masturbation.
You know we can do this thing and and like speed fuck quotes into the ether and like a like an Uzi.
26:12
Right.
Just unloading all of these different things and I think that a lot of people feel a general overwhelm of indexing of information and Oh my God, I'm learning all of this stuff and I don't feel like I'm making any progress.
And I really wanted to try and cut through this at some point in the conversation today as well, which is Tim Ferriss has an idea called The Good Shit Sticks All.
26:31
Right.
I, when I first started out on this journey of personal growth, felt guilty because I didn't have a perfectly curated Evernote external brain with nested folders and all of my book summaries and I was supposed to keep all of this thing and how am I going to remember it and blah blah blah.
26:48
Five and a bit years later, people come up to me and ask.
One of the most common questions to get asked is how the fuck do you remember all of the things that you remember?
Two things.
First off, I don't remember anything that I don't care about.
And the second thing, massive amounts of exposure.
Those are the only two things that are going on.
27:05
I've done 670 podcasts in five years for hours and all of the reading I had to do beforehand and all of the listening I had to do beforehand as well.
And I didn't stress myself about what I had to remember.
So if you listen to this three in a bit hour podcast and you go, they talk, dude, they said a lot of words there.
27:26
Alex said a lot of words.
Chris said a lot of words.
What's the one thing that you couldn't stop thinking about?
And then maybe nothing.
Fair play.
We failed.
If there's one thing that you can't stop thinking about, that story about the kid from Cumbria that time when Alex had to drive across the country, that's the thing.
27:44
That is the thing.
And allowing yourself to naturally select whatever the most important learning is from the content that you consume is the best way to work out what what is going to resonate.
And it's the best way to act on it as well.
If you can't stop thinking about it when you go to bed tonight and you can't stop telling your friends about it in the morning and you've clipped it from this podcast or any other podcast or any of the book or whatever, whatever.
28:08
The thing is that you keep sending photos of and you keep on reciting to people and you try and tell your mum about and she doesn't care.
That is the thing that you need to work on and you don't need to do.
If you take half a thing from this podcast or any of the podcast that, and you work on it for a month, you have made so much progress.
28:27
And do you understand how blessed you are to have this opportunity?
You could have been born in the Middle Ages before the Gutenberg printing press, when they wouldn't even give you the Bible in the common language so that you had to go through the priests to be able to have a relationship with God.
Right now, you can search for whatever it is that you're dealing with, find the greatest minds on the planet, listen to them, and then the next day, implement it and you move not only yourself, but you move the world around you.
28:53
You get to nudge yourself and the rest of the world in a direction that you want to go, and you get to feel proud about it, and it's within your control.
You have never been more.
Blessed there's a there's a quote that I want to that I want to hit here that I think would be relevant to.
29:11
We were just talking about with the people who are sad and alone.
And one of the one of the biggest breakthroughs that I had from a from a mental perspective was actually defining emotions for what they are operationally.
So sadness comes from a lack of options, or rather a lack of perceived options.
29:29
And that's why it feels like hopelessness, because you don't know what to do.
When I realized that sadness meant that I didn't know what to do, it meant that another way that I could define sadness was ignorance.
And that is solvable.
And so whenever I feel sad now, it's been my trigger to immediately think, what do I not know?
29:48
What option do I not see?
Because the opposite of that is anxiety, which is you have many options and you have few priorities.
Looks you you have many paths that you could presume, you just don't know which one.
And so being able to operationalize what these emotions felt like.
30:03
So if you feel sad, it just means that you need to go learn more and that you can do and then all of a sudden the learning more becomes the option and then you don't need to feel sad anymore.
And that was like one of the biggest breakthroughs from my like mental health or whatever you want to call it, mindset that set me free.
And I've taken a lot of effort to try and operationalize emotions so that I can either get out of them or lean into them.
30:26
So like patience, for example, right?
I'm only bringing this up because I think it might be relevant to some people is that most goals are attainable if you expand the time horizon, even enormous ones like you can do anything you could.
Walk to the moon, you could do.
There you go.
You can do anything.
And so for me, I am, I would say, a naturally impatient person.
30:43
Like I tend to want things immediately now.
And you know what?
You probably are too.
But once I defined patience as figuring out what to do in the meantime, it allowed me to control what I did.
Because now, like you and I are being patient for your stock investments.
31:02
Right now, as we're on this podcast, we're being patient for that because we're doing things in the meantime.
And so whenever I felt impatient and wanted to change course, I had to just redefine what do I need to do today?
And if you are sad and impatient, then it means that right now you need to learn what the option is that you need to go pursue.
31:19
And then that makes it very much under your control.
And so step by step, each of these emotions over time, I spent a lot of time trying to define them out so that they no longer control me.
And I know how to solve them.
And then and then now it just becomes a faster and faster muscle like, oh, I feel anxiety.
That means that I have many options that I don't have priorities.
31:35
OK, What's my priority?
And then all of a sudden, what used to take days of anxiety and feeling this, you know, frog in my throat was just, oh, I need to make a list of all the things that I'm looking at, which one's the most important?
Ignore the rest.
And then I'm good.
And what?
You just take days, takes minutes.
31:53
One of yours is Choosing the plan isn't hard.
Doing the plan isn't hard.
Sticking to the plan is hard.
Charlie Munger said the money isn't made in the buy and it's not made in the cell.
It's made in the weight and that that like, I just feel like that's such an elegant way of thinking about it.
32:13
It's like the hard part about the plan is sticking to the plan.
Like the plan wasn't bad.
Your first plan was good because it's easy to go, say I'm going to work out three days a week for the next year and it's a good plan.
It's a pretty good plan.
And the interesting thing is that like a mediocre plan that's stuck to always outperforms an amazing and perfect plan that you never stick with to begin with.
32:36
And I know this obviously from the fixed fitness world, but it applies to everything.
And so, like the stick to it, muscle is the one that you have to flex.
And that's why, like, if you're going through things, you have, especially in the earlier days, like I remember I used to start and stop and start and stop and I try this thing, I try that thing.
It's normal because you haven't, you haven't been reinforced enough of sticking with something, right?
32:55
But The thing is, is that you have to stick it out long enough that you get that first carrot, you get that first cookie and then all of a sudden everything that you did to get there, you're like oh more of that will get me more cookies and that's and and then and then it just becomes this self perpetuating cycle and then you get addicted to work.
Yes, and and and then you do a launch to 500,000 people and you lock yourself in a closet 6 hours a day for two years.
33:16
Yeah, that's exactly that.
Because I've been rewarded in the past because the first time I actually spent a lot of time on a presentation and I felt good when I walked on stage and didn't feel anxiety, I was like, oh, I want this every time.
Yeah.
And then I had this the second thought, which is the much scarier thought which is now I have to do this every time.
33:33
This is the new bomb.
This is the new bar.
I want to round out something on that sort of black pill side, which is if you listen to this and you think must be nice or easy for you to say I get it like I I get it.
33:50
And if you feel like there is something that you can't get over some genetic, societal, cultural defect, that means that you do not have the same ceiling that you think that you should or the other people appear to have, I get it.
34:09
And the question I would ask is, what do you want?
Like, do you want sympathy?
Because I will happily give you sympathy.
I know what it feels like to be someone that has no belief in themselves and that believes that you are fundamentally a loser and that nothing is going to come to you and that you deserve for nothing to come to you.
I understand what that feels like, but what does that mindset get you?
34:26
Like fundamentally, what does that mindset give you?
OK, so let's say, let's say that you have been dealt as difficult of a hand as possible and and to quote you to you, I can promise you that there is someone who has had it worse and has done it better.
34:47
I put this clip out a while ago.
This like just random talking about a morning routine thing.
And it was pretty basic, but it went fucking interstellar and the real Internet got a hold of it.
You know, like not your fans, but like the real Internet.
Like it.
It got the general public Internet, got a hold of it.
The most common comment was something along the lines of tell me you don't have kids without telling me that you don't have kids, which is must be easy for you to say.
35:09
I have a daughter to get in the get up in the morning.
I'm like, OK, tell me what that mindset gets you, Genuinely tell me what that mindset gets you.
It says I'm in a situation which I cannot get over.
And there are things in reality imposed on me which stopped me from doing something.
There is somebody out there who has three times as many kids as you, and they still do it.
35:28
So what is it that they've got?
Like, what is it that they're doing?
Have they got an unfair advantage?
What is it?
Tell me.
It's also if you take down, if you walk down, the natural logic of that statement, who do you blame if you're saying must be nicer?
35:45
Tell me, tell me that you don't have kids without telling me that you don't have kids.
Then does that mean that you blame your child for all the things that you don't have in life?
It's a tough, tough weight to put on a kid.
Because, I mean, I would hope that they don't see that comment because then they'd be like, wait, mom, dad, like you didn't live out your dreams because I exist.
36:07
Tough.
Another one here, A sequence, actually, that I love.
You don't have to feel good about it, You just have to keep going.
The feeling will pass, but you will remain.
You are greater than your feelings.
Going to bed late and waking up early to work for a few days won't kill you.
36:25
You're not going to burn out.
You're doing what it takes.
If you're one of those people that push work life balance, just remember the people who like working a lot don't care.
I've never regretted trying harder at anything ever.
Hard times last long, but an epic story feels like a lifetime.
36:46
Nailed it.
Fuck yeah.
I just think when I look at you in particular, and I I realize this during our second conversation at the start of this year, the reason that people get confused about your motivation and your workload is that they don't realize that the thing you do for work is the thing that you do for fun.
37:06
That's the fundamental misunderstanding that people have.
And because of that, you're prepared to work hard, and working hard doesn't feel like wasted time.
Lots of people associate working hard with not making progress.
37:22
Therefore working feels like wasting.
So the idea that working hard doesn't make progress is one of the biggest farces that exists in humanity.
Because at the end of the day, whatever you amount to isn't going to matter anyways, right?
37:37
And so if there is anything that's eternal for us, at least as individuals, it's going to be who we become in the process.
And so one of my favourite quotes is the work works on you more than you work on it.
And so if you want to be the best in the world at something, you do the work to become the best in the world and the work works on you.
37:55
And so, I mean there's a there's a biblical proverb.
I think it's just like there is, there is profit in all labor.
And that means that even if the thing that you're working on right now doesn't amount to the outcome that you expected that it would, it doesn't mean that you don't become better through doing it.
38:14
And so I'll give you a very real example.
So I spent five years building a chain of gyms.
So I had six locations, and after that I sold five of them.
I shut one down and then I transitioned to doing turnarounds.
38:31
In the transition between shutting my gyms down, I got a big payday because I sold my 5 gyms big for me relative.
I took all that money and I put it into the next thing.
The partner that I had in that next thing ended up taking the money and disappearing, filing bankruptcy and sending it to his girlfriend in Sweden.
38:48
I couldn't make this up.
So there's no way I could get the money back.
And he had filed bankruptcies.
There's no, there's no course of action for a lawsuit.
And so a lot of people would probably go through that mental situation and think, and I'd went through this, was thinking, I just wasted the last five years.
39:04
Like, I literally started to change, but like put everything into the second location, put everything in the third location, the 4th location.
It kept kept going, right?
I kept doubling down.
And then I get my big paid in.
I put it all all on black, and then it disappears with one spin of the roulette.
And so here I am, and I'm like, I have nothing to show for the last five years of work.
39:23
But then in the next 12 months, I made more money than I'd ever made in my entire life up to that point.
The five years I made, I made the I made more profit the next 12 months than I made in the last five years.
Times like 5.
And it was because, and this is only, I was only able to realize this in retrospect, which is why I'm sharing it, Which is that the thing that was the outcome of those five years was me and the skills and the experiences that I possessed through going through it.
39:49
And so whatever the next mountain that you're trying to climb is, of course it's going to be higher, but it's going to require you to go through the smaller mountains to get to that point.
So because the more able you are, the more able you realize you can become and you will get way bigger outcomes from the things that you had, like the path that led you here, then then you, then you think you can and so.
40:14
That's why, since that moment where I lost everything and then I was able to make more in the next 12 months, I realized that no work is wasted because I am the output of the work, not the outcome.
And that was one of the biggest frame shifts for me in never thinking that work is wasted.
40:29
Because the more I work, the bigger my work ethic, the more my work capacity increases.
And to give an exercise example, 'cause I think it's it's cool.
And interesting is that a lot of people talk about this concept of overtraining.
Don't worry, I'll bring it back.
All right.
They talk about this concept of overtraining.
I remember I was talking, I had this woman that Leila and I are friends with, very successful business owner, had a boy toy with her and he was like, aren't you concerned about overtraining?
40:53
And I was feeling a little pissy that day.
And I said, bro, once you start looking like you work out, you can worry about overtraining.
I was like, until that point, you don't need to worry about overtraining.
I was being a little bit mean, but I think he, he did remember it and he did change the way he trained and he did gain muscle afterwards.
41:09
So I felt OK about it.
Now the point of that little quip, right, was that what I explained to him is that your ability to recover from working out itself is trainable.
So when you do more volume, your ability to withstand volume, your work capacity increases.
41:27
And so to the same degree, people are like, I feel burnt out.
The thing is, is that you either die or you adapt.
That's it, right?
And in the fitness world, you either die, get injured or adapt, right?
And since you're probably not gonna die, you really just need to make sure that you don't get injured.
And if you don't get injured and you don't die, you get better.
41:43
And so that mental process in terms of how I see work has been like the most self fulfilling prophecy that I've had because the more I work, the better I get it working, the more productive I am per unit of time.
And so and then I get the outcomes that happen eventually.
But the point is, and you probably, I mean, I already know you know this, but the outcomes become so irrelevant compared to the reward that you get in the meantime.
42:06
Because the people who are experts, and this is from my my good friend Doctor Kashi, people who are experts at any skill become experts because they learn how to become rewarded from the work itself.
And so like, they don't actually have something that you don't.
It's just that they measure success differently.
42:25
Judge yourself by your actions, not by your thoughts.
I became significantly less disappointed in myself when I started judging myself only on the actions I took, not the thoughts I had.
So patience is a virtue that I feel like I haven't had and it's been something that I've spoken over myself for many years.
42:44
So it's like I'm an impatient person.
I want things fast, etcetera.
When I realized that I should use the same lens that I judge or the people on when I judge myself, which is someone might say I'm a really honest guy.
But if I have no evidence that you're an honest person or when I put you in a situation where you could be honest and you're not, I would say no, you're not.
43:01
Now that person probably thinks of themselves as honest or to the same degree.
I'm a really loyal guy.
But as soon as I put a A10 in front of you and you've got your your girl at home, you jump.
You're not that loyal.
You just haven't had the opportunity to show that you're loyal.
And so for me, my thoughts about what I thought I was were actually really negative.
43:19
But when I try to think, OK, well, I can be patient if I act patient, even if I don't feel patient.
And then that allowed me to start giving myself a stack of undeniable proof that I am who I wanted to be.
And I don't believe in binary traits meaning like he's patient or he's impatient or he's loyal or he's disloyal.
43:39
It's the question is, how loyal are you?
How honest are you?
How patient are you?
And by switching the character traits that I wanted to have into progressions or continuums allowed me to make progress on them simply by giving myself more proof or one more penny on the scale that says I'm a little bit more patient than I was.
43:57
I'm a little bit more patient.
I'm a little bit more patient to the point where I have so many pennies on the scale that I can say I think I am pretty patient.
Even though every time I put a penny on the scale, I don't want to put a penny on the scale.
I want to get the thing to happen today.
I want it to happen yesterday because why is it taking so long?
It didn't take that long for this person that feels like I feel like I work harder than them and I feel like I'm better than them.
44:14
Why am I not doing that?
But I put the penny on the scale.
Hey, mosination, quick break.
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, So send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
44:30
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with.
Tag them in one of my relayless posts, and I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Well, ultimately, what is patience?
Is patience feeling patient or is patient doing the thing that is patience?
44:46
So Sam Harrison, his first conversation with Jocko Willink about 10 years ago, they talk about how courage is an unfakeable emotion and it's such a good frame, you're going to love this.
So he said, if you do the thing in spite of being fearful of doing the thing, that is courage.
45:02
And if you don't do the thing even though you felt like doing the thing, that is cowardice.
And I think that motivation and patience are exactly the same.
If you're patient despite not feeling patient, that is patience.
That is how it works.
And that was that realisation that you just said was the reason for that quote, because it was me realising that I can actually have these traits even if I don't feel like I live those traits.
45:30
And so that's why probably at least for me, when people are like whatever the trait is like he's so humble, he's so whatever.
Like you probably will never feel like you have the trait, but you can still have the trait based on evidence rather than emotion.
45:45
And I think that frame of evidence has been, I mean if I had a A North star of personal development for myself it's been just give myself proof.
And I mean in so many ways like the reason that I I didn't.
I mean I'm going to go on a tangent, but again I'll bring it back.
46:01
I didn't talk about how to run gyms until I had six gyms because I didn't feel like I was qualified enough to talk about it.
And I only started talking about gyms when so many people were like, dude, how do you run your gyms?
How do you run your gyms?
And if I rewind, even before that, I didn't feel qualified to talk about fitness.
But I had a six pack for a decade, you know what I mean?
46:18
And I had multiple state state records, but I still didn't feel qualified to talk about fitness until everyone was like, dude, how do you, how do you do this?
How do you strengthen, how do you, how do you eat this way, whatever it is, right.
And so if you, if you can, give yourself evidence, the world around you like fame, like your evidence will change how people treat you, independent of how you feel about it.
46:40
Well This is why the must be easy must be nice is so flawed because what you're saying is I see the outcomes and I have no idea of the difficulty of the inputs.
I've absolutely no idea what barriers you need to get over.
You could be, you could find it 99 out of 100.
46:58
Difficult to be patient and yet you are.
It must be nice for you.
You've got that patience, Gene.
You go eat shit, eat shit.
You have no idea how hard it is for people to do the things that they do and the people that make it look easy in some regards contribute to this problem.
47:17
Like I, I and This is why I really love.
I'm a massive fan of of a lot of your work and I think that one of the reasons is that it's so honest and and self effacing about the challenges and about the steps that you have to get through.
And because the journey is relatively well narratized and you can you can track it step by step and you've created a kind of a cohesive timeline of how the all of this stuff worked.
47:40
There is a point along specifically your journey, but hopefully mine and other people's too where people can inject themselves and say oh I'm at that bit.
I'm the 15 year old that I'm at that bit.
I resent my parents.
I've just lost all my money.
I I feel like I need to you know, like you have every different problem that you can encounter in life is present in Alex's timeline and I think that that's really important.
48:04
I think this this is one of the I would say this is a criticism that I have about some of the personal development, self growth and a lot of the business advice as well.
Even the bad times are romanticized, and they're not fucking romantic like it feels like hell.
48:24
It feels like shit to do the thing, to fail, to not feel like anybody cares about you, to not even know that there's going to be glory.
In retrospect, yeah, it feels despondent and destitute and sad and alone.
48:42
And I get it.
And I think that the more visceral that we can make these stories, the better it is.
Because I know that that's what would have resonated with me, because I would have gone.
That's an undeniable stack of proof that you were where you said you were.
I'll tell you one that maybe will resonate with somebody in the audience.
49:00
So I remember when I decided to move, So I moved to California to start a gym or get into fitness.
And I got there and the guy who I said I was going to mentor under was like, where are you staying?
And I was like, I don't know, I just got here.
And he's like, what do you mean you don't know?
I was like, I don't know.
49:15
I just, I just showed up.
And so he went.
He said I could sleep at his place that night.
The next morning went to the gym and he got on the chair and said, hey, who here is going to house this kid?
And one guy came up to me.
He was like, I'll give you a room.
So I rented one room and a house for 400 bucks a month.
And then when I left that room to start sleeping at the gym, which was an hour away because I couldn't make the commute.
49:34
So I save 400 bucks a month.
I remember being actually kind of excited about it.
I remember being like, man, this is gonna be a bad story.
Yeah, this is me.
I'm gonna be.
This is my Rocky cutscene, right?
But The thing is that the Rocky cutscene lasts 30 seconds in the movie, but it can last five years in your life.
49:50
And when I was sleeping on the gym floor, I'll give you a detail that that'll tell you that the stack of a deniable roof was that I my first gym was underneath of a parking garage.
And so there's these metal dividers in the ceiling.
And so cars would drive over this and it's a concrete box.
50:07
And so it sounded like a gunshot, like, and it would happen at all hours of the night.
And probably the most painful from an emotional perspective experience that I would have on a regular basis was that it was also abandoned enough parking lot that college kids, kids my age would go up and party on the roof.
50:24
And so, like, while they were partying literally above my head and making noise that would prevent me from sleeping, I would be down below in an in a dark warehouse in a city that I knew no one like I was from Baltimore.
I drove across the country.
I went to Huntington Beach.
50:40
I literally knew no one and no one knew me.
And so I'm sleeping there.
And then I realized that I can't really sleep at night.
And so I'm I'm taking basically, I'm living on naps for the first six months of the gym and like homeless people are sleeping in my parking lot and I have to like go out and tell them to like go away.
50:57
And then I get back, lock the door, and I go back on the Astroturf, which is where I slept with a blanket and a pillow.
And I I bring this up because like the visceral feeling that you go through when you're going through the mound of shit period, or the shit eating what feels like a marathon is that it's it becomes a 32nd sound bite in my story.
51:22
But it was years.
And so like, even to the same degree, we're like, man, you're such a natural salesman.
The first job I ever got offered out of college was a sales job.
And I said, I'm not a salesman, I'm an academic.
And then as soon as I opened my gym, I was like, oh shit, how do I pay rent?
And someone walked in the door and I was like, please give me money, I promise.
51:40
And I I had no equipment in my gym, 'cause I I couldn't afford any.
So it's an empty gym with just turf.
And I was like, I promise you I will get you amazing results.
And they were like, are you going to be here tomorrow?
And I was like, I I sleep here.
I have to be here.
I promise I'll be here.
It's impossible for me to not be.
51:56
Here, I can't live.
I can't leave, right?
And so the early people took pity on me when they literally paid the the 1st 29 members I signed up in the first two weeks before the gym opened was from pity.
It wasn't from charisma.
It was pure pity.
I'll be real with you.
And it was the exact amount that I needed to pay rent.
And I remember the first month of rent that I paid with This is actually Wild.
52:14
I only I only looked at this in retrospect.
I made exactly $4972 in my first month of my gym.
My rent was $4972 and I remember working like a dog to get that.
I'd never made money in my life, like I'd never, like really asked anyone for money and all of a sudden I'd come up $5000 in a month.
52:34
And then at the end of the month I watched it go to zero.
And then I was like, I have to do it again.
And that was when, like, the reality of the situation of, like, there was no escape.
There was no one who was going to come to save me.
And there was.
I couldn't blame my dad.
I couldn't blame my mom.
I was the one who had chosen this life.
52:50
But the alternative was that I had to go back to my father, a failure, and have him look in, look me in the eyes and say, I told you and come here, come here.
Don't worry about it.
You know, I told you this, this gym stuff, this fitness stuff, this starting room, it's it's for later.
It's fine.
Just go back.
You've, you've got this, you've got this great degree.
53:06
You've got just go to the go to the Business School to do the thing.
And I knew exactly what had happened.
But what would have happened after that is that for the rest of my life, he would have had absolute authority over everything that I did.
And that felt like death.
And so that was what I ran away from when I was in that moment.
53:21
Like, whenever I felt like my back was against the wall and I didn't know what to do.
And it felt like the Instagram reels of, like, the motivation weren't going to get me through what I was going through because no one cared that I was sleeping alone.
I'd let them know I'm sleeping on the floor.
And a month later, when you're still sleeping on the floor, when everyone's like, I don't care, like, great, you're pursuing your dream, right?
53:39
Early days.
But Despite that, the must be easy mantra is the easiest indicator that you have a victim mindset.
Because what it means is, I can't achieve this thing because on some level you say it must be easy.
53:55
There's some level of desire that's there.
You're like, I'd like to achieve some aspect of this.
And then rather than feel the pain of saying that I'm inadequate or I'm not taking action, we we cast our our inadequacy on some outside object or some outside circumstance.
And by doing that we remove all agency and all power that we have over our lives.
54:12
And for me, I would rather be somebody who has absolute power and have nothing to show for it than somebody who has all the all the the things to show for it.
But know that I'm life's bitch.
Life being one protracted training montage is a really important lesson to learn.
54:32
The fact that in the Rocky movie it is 90 seconds and then everything is fixed and that can last for decades, that can last for years.
And I think that the lack of glory, the lack of certainty, it it it makes it it it turns it from worthwhile majesty into it's it's not even sufficiently triumphant to be called sad.
55:06
Like it's just like weak and pissy and you have no idea if anything's going to work, but what's the alternative?
Entropy is going to come and fucking get you.
So what's the alternative?
Like?
My Twitter bio says locally reversing entropy.
And I I I think that that really is what you should try and do, because it's going to fucking come for you.
55:26
The lack of certainty is what actually makes it worth it.
And so here's my point.
Let's think, Let's consider the alternative, which is that you are on the path and you are guaranteed to know that you're going to get the outcome.
All of the mystery is gone.
There is no excitement, which is why they said, you know, in the ancient Romans, actually ancient Greeks would say that the gods always envy the mortals because their life was so ephemeral, they had so much chance that could happen to them, right?
55:51
Where the gods always knew that they weren't going to die and it was completely guaranteed.
And So what we do is we basically have this wish that if it actually came true, we would hate it even more than our current circumstance.
If you knew that you were going to succeed, it wouldn't be worth doing to begin with.
The fact that you are uncertain when you start is what makes it worthwhile, and the fallacy of being in the pursuit is the worry or the concern that it won't amount to anything because who you are becoming is the thing that you are amounting to in real time everyday.
56:23
This was something that Mark Manson tweeted.
He put it in his newsletter, actually, and it made me think of a lesson that I learned a long time ago.
Stop complaining about the results you didn't get from the work you didn't put in.
The only way to become more successful than most people is to be willing to do something most people aren't willing to do, And this is that Lean In mentality again.
56:47
Take luck.
It sucks.
It's shitty.
You're tired.
Everybody says that you're leaving your friends behind, leaving your family behind, betraying your culture, betraying whatever expectation it is that they have on you.
You need to do something that most people aren't willing to do because as we've said, the average American is obese, in debt and divorced.
57:06
Like, is that really?
Oh, brilliant, Fantastic.
I'm in the fucking centre of the bell curve distribution here.
That's really congratulations.
And then the other side stopped complaining about the results you didn't get from the work you didn't put in.
OK, so you didn't lose weight this month.
Did you follow your diet?
Well, I did for half the month.
57:23
OK.
So is it any surprise that you didn't lose any weight?
How's your content creation game going?
Well, I I, you know, I spent a lot of time planning for the podcast that I'm going to release or for the Instagram that I'm going to start or from the sub stack that I'm going to begin writing on.
OK.
57:39
And what did you actually do?
It comes back to like the work doesn't care.
Yeah, Charlie Monger.
In one of his Seminole speeches, he talks about how to guarantee failure, how to make sure that you were a failure.
And he inverts the the concept of success.
57:55
It's like, what could you do to make sure that you were a failure?
It's like, well, you would definitely get involved in drugs, drinking, he says.
Was it leverage liquor in women?
That's, you know, the Charlie's, Charlie's big one, right?
But one of the ones that he has, I think he has seven in his in his in his speech is consistency.
58:13
He's like, you have to make sure that you're inconsistent.
He's like because if you are consistent and you have none of the other attributes, he's like it's, you still might be successful.
He's like, it's it's very tough for people who are consistent to not be successful.
And he makes an especially pointed point about consistency because in my opinion, it's one of the most difficult of the virtues for humans to do because we're so attracted to novelty.
58:36
And so, like, I mean, I used to deal with this with, you know, people on their diets all the time.
I remember I ran gyms.
And so someone would come in and I would always ask the question, so have you been following the meal plan?
And then they would say yes.
And so then I started changing the way I asked the question.
So I'd say out of the 21 meals that you were supposed to eat, how many of the 21 did you have exactly the way it was on the meal plan?
58:56
And then they would be like, oh, I mean at least half.
And they would say it as though that was a mark of success.
And right now, the meal plan could be your content plan, it could be your, it could be your showing up to work on time plan, it could be the time that you want to put towards your side.
Hustle doesn't really matter.
59:12
But if there's one muscle that you can flex, it's learning to do the same thing over and over again.
Like one of the one of the values that we had at gym launches, do the boring work.
Because boring is what makes you rich, right?
It's it's it's it's writing the follow up sequence to your to the purchase page that you don't feel like doing but you know you should do.
59:32
It's running the split test for the 10th time.
It's it's actually going through and prepping for 20 minutes before you have the meeting because it's amazing how much smarter you can appear with 20 minutes of preparation.
Like you can appear 50 IQ points smarter if you just prepare for meetings for 20 minutes.
59:49
I remember I did a consulting day, which I've only done three in my entire life.
And when I showed up to the day, 'cause I always want to make sure that everyone always gets more for me than I than they give me.
I had taken, I don't know, 4 hours, not a long time, but a long time for I think some people.
1:00:06
But for me 4 hours is nothing.
I count in hundreds, so this is irrelevant.
And so I put like 4 hours and actually.
Took the time and put it in to do research on the individual.
So I looked at every single page they had, every landing page, every offer, every, everything.
And I had 7 pages of things that I thought would make them more money.
1:00:23
And so when I started, I was like, this is what we're going to go through today.
And I'll walk you through line by line and you'll have this as a take behind so you can execute it with your team as a bigger company.
And the guy was shocked.
He was like never in my entire life has anyone had this preparation and that's when it goes back to like you need 20 podcasts to be in the top 1% the the bar for excellence.
1:00:45
Like I have this timer that I have on my desk, which it's it's the easiest purchase you can make.
I think it was like 7 bucks on Amazon.
It's a little twist kitchen timer.
It's very easy and it's been probably my biggest focus act you know to date which is I turn it when I want to start working and part of it allows me to think how long I I get better at predicting how long it's going to take me to do something.
1:01:04
So I think I think this will take me 35 minutes.
So I turn the clock to 35 and I click on and then I start working on the thing and the moment my phone rings or I look at Slack or whatever, I stop the timer.
And so you actually see that your time on task is usually significantly less than you think it is.
And I think that in my early days, I would spend a very long time in front of a computer telling myself that I was working with very few minutes actually on task.
1:01:28
And that's why I think that most things are actually significantly easier than people think they are.
They just don't know how to try hard because the harder that you try, the easier it gets.
And so it's like, if you can just learn to love what trying hard feels like, then all of a sudden it becomes unreasonable that you can't win.
1:01:44
So like, for the presentation that I'm giving, I explained a little bit earlier about what my process looks like.
If you were to say what would it take for somebody to be unreasonably good, that it would be impossible for them to not be a top 1% salesman or a top 1% content creator, and you said, what would that person need to do?
Irrelevant for Malcolm.
1:02:01
What would be the actions or evidence that they would have to do prior to that thing that would make it unreasonable that they couldn't succeed?
And then you do those things.
What happens is you realize that it's actually not that hard because you put so much work into it and the bar from other people working is so embarrassingly low that they then ask you how you did it and it must be easy.
1:02:21
Consistency doesn't guarantee that you'll be successful, but not being consistent will guarantee that you won't reach success.
You have a productivity hack.
An easy productivity hack.
Instead of spending time getting in the mood to work, just stop working.
1:02:39
Confront the work people think they need.
Perfect conditions to start when in reality starting is the perfect condition.
I'm married to that.
I love that because if you think like I, you know, I obviously am somebody who always wants to optimize how much work I do per unit of time.
1:02:59
And so I I was, you know, there was definitely times earlier in my life I was really romanticized by these like very extensive morning routines and supplement rituals and like all this stuff of mental masturbation around the work that need to be done.
But when I looked at 2 hours later and nothing had actually gotten done, the moment you begin working is when your output per unit of time goes up.
1:03:20
And so that makes beginning the single greatest hack that you can have for everything else that you do and work.
Because The thing is, when you start working, you start getting in the mood to work right, like everything else is procrastinating around the work that you think you should do.
But like I have noticed, for me at least, I have these, I have some big mental tasks, you know what I mean?
1:03:39
Like big content piece or big thing that you need.
Like you know it's going to take real mental effort.
It takes me like 5 minutes of actually being in it to then get a little bit of a lay of the land to then get into it.
But I used to take hours to delay to start the 1st 5 minutes.
1:03:54
And so my time compression of when I thought I should start doing something and when I started doing it over time it's just compressed to the point where it's like the moment I think that I need to start doing it.
Sometimes I just start it because then what happens?
I get this open loop and so rather than complete work at like cause a lot of people are like, I want to complete it at this really nice clean point.
1:04:10
Stop halfway through the sentence because it'll drive you mad.
That's the Zygonic effect in full work.
Do you know this story?
Zygonic.
Oh wow, this is way.
More than I do.
That's what you shut up.
That's what you're leveraging here.
So the Zygonic Effect was a study originally done on servers in restaurants, and they realized you've ever been at a restaurant and a server comes up and stands with the hands behind the back.
1:04:33
Go what would you like tonight, Sir?
And you say I'll have the lobster roll and a glass of red wine and a blah blah and you're like this mother fuck is not.
He hasn't got a pen or a pad of paper.
He's crazy.
And then they go off and what they realised was servers in restaurants were unbelievably good at being able to recall exactly what a table's order was while that table's order was still open.
1:04:54
So guys in table 16, they want to swap the peas out for a little bit of extra rice, and they're doing this thing as soon as the table was closed, they couldn't remember anything.
So this is an open loop, closed loop system, and it's built into the brain.
The brain abhors an open loop.
1:05:12
It's the same reason why Netflix cliffhangers at the end of every episode guarantee that you'll watch the next one, because you can't bear the fact there's even novels in the dark romance genre that make guarantees that there won't be cliffhangers they make.
They put it on the front or the back of the book and they say no.
1:05:28
Cliffhangers guaranteed.
Which is, people have so much distaste for it that it's a selling point, that you get the closure at the end of it, and finishing halfway through a sentence reduces the activation energy required to begin that sentence the next day.
1:05:45
And it keeps it in your mind too overnight.
So I think, yeah, whether you've stumbled on it or whether you knew about it, you've managed to leverage a pretty powerful piece of psychology that.
Sick.
Going back to the work thing, another one from you that I absolutely adore.
1:06:01
It just takes work.
Shit loads and shit.
Loads of work.
Every time I try and dress it up or cut a corner, I get brutally reminded the work just needs doing.
The work doesn't care who you are, it just cares that it gets done.
I'm actually going to reverse quote David Goggins on this one, but I love this quote that he has, which he says there's no shortcuts for you, David, or there's no shortcuts for you.
1:06:26
Goggins.
I heard him say that, and I just love that as a refrain, which is that a lot of people look for a shortcut, but the idea that you say like, they're not for you, you don't get to use them, You are immune to shortcuts.
I just love it because then it it just further shortcuts the path to the work that needs to get done.
1:06:45
And I wrote that tweet on my, I don't know, 11th run of this presentation that I'm doing because that's a recent one.
And so I was, it was like 11:00 at night.
And so right now I'm working triple shifts, which is not common for me.
I usually do 2, not 3.
1:07:02
So for me, in normal work days, like I wake up, I start working at, you know, six or seven and then I go until about 6:00-ish.
So it's like 10 to 12 really concentrated hours work and that I can do 6 1/2 days a week.
I usually take Saturday afternoons off and it's really just because at that point I I can't work anymore and my brain Stew and then I I get my 1/2 day and then I'm good to go and I'm rearing to kick on you know to work on Sundays.
1:07:25
My triple shift is I get I go to dinner and I come back at 7:30, then I work from 7:30 until 11:30 or 1:00 or whatever, right.
And when I'm putting in triple shifts is when I know I'm like really gassing it.
And that's that's when I'm like repeatedly doing 1617 a day of actual productive work.
1:07:43
And I I hear the same thoughts that everyone does, which is like, it's not going to matter.
Like it's fine.
You've like, it's good enough.
Like I hate that.
Like it it it makes me sick to even say that, right.
Because the thing that I like David Goggins, right, He's got like, there's no shortcuts for you.
1:07:59
I would say the one that I have, two that are like my internal ones, one that is probably the most common is I will do what is required and this work needs doing and there's just no way around it.
And it's just it's just looking at the face of the work and it's like smiling back at me like no one else is going to do it.
1:08:23
And like I love that one.
Like when we're recording content in the early days, we're doing like 100 shorts every time we did it and it was direct to camera and it was the only time I could fit it in with all the portfolio stuff that we're doing.
And so I was, it was always like, I will do what's required.
And that's been a really helpful refrain for me when I'm confronted with, especially when you know what needs to get done.
1:08:45
And the second one is, but I'll know.
And so like, even if it does go well and even if everyone else says it's great, but I'll know.
And it'll then rob me of all of the joy of all of those moments in that experience, because I'll know that I could have done better.
1:09:05
And The thing is, is like to to quote myself from earlier, like I've never regretted working harder ever, not once.
And some people were like, on your deathbed, you're gonna like, no, 'cause I lived every moment of my day doing what I wanted to do.
And I remember I had a boss when I my first boss after college.
1:09:24
She said this thing I had had a a particularly good weekend and she said, I'm pretty sure happiness is stringing as many of those days in a row as you possibly can.
And although I hated the job, that piece of advice has actually been probably what I has been my blueprint for how to live, which is like my birthday looks the same as my Tuesdays, which looks the same as my Sundays.
1:09:50
You know what the original name pool for this podcast was?
It's the only time in history I've done branding my entire adult life.
And with club nights, all you're doing is coming up with Brands Paradiso.
Oh, it's, it's tropical.
There'll be a Flamingo, A skint.
1:10:06
Oh, it's a cheap night.
It's for people to get fingered in the corner.
Like is we?
All I did was branding, right?
I was a branding guy.
I'm pretty good at copywriting.
All I did was branding.
The one time I've had divine Inspiration. 3:00 in the morning, wake up with the name was Modern Wisdom.
The one time out of every business, every night, every brand I've ever come up with.
1:10:25
That was the one time.
But on the list of the others Mind, mind and matter was one of them.
The other one was a quote from Tim Ferriss.
It's called crushing a Tuesday and he said that what you should aim for in life is for your average Tuesday, not the spectacular one time private jet with the friends to go for the whatever, whatever.
1:10:46
Not the UFC power slap launch party staring at the back of Dan Bilzerian's dirty mullet.
Like, not that you want your average Tuesday to look the way that you want most of your life to do.
And when I think about the days that I look back on at the end of my day and think like today was a good day, invariably it's the same few things.
1:11:08
It's I worked very hard on something that I felt was worth doing.
I worked out and I spent time with people that I enjoy being around.
If I do those three things, I had a good day.
And so that's been my, you know, Alex's simple blueprint for doing things.
1:11:26
And I think the point that you were making earlier, I think it's worth hitting on again, which is just that, like most people's definition of work is a -1, which is why they abhor it, which is also why they misunderstand.
So many people who quote, I'll say, quote here, are successful or ahead of them or whatever, is that both people.
One person says the word work and the other person hears the word pain.
1:11:45
And so the first step to like becoming more successful is understanding the language that the people who are successful are using.
They're actually defining the word differently.
And so whatever that thing is that you actually enjoy doing, where you lose track of time when you're in it, even if it's challenging.
1:12:02
But usually it is challenging, right?
Like, it's not easy because then it's boring, right?
Which is also why the uncertainty thing is so key, right, to not knowing if it's going to, if it's going to work or not.
You are going to work though, either way is that the people who are quote addicted to work make it easy to be addicted to work because they do things worth doing.
1:12:21
And I think a lot of it is coming down to making sure that you take the few precious seconds that we have to do the few things that are worth doing for the rest of your life.
The more I listen to this, the better my life gets.
If they don't have what you want, don't listen to what they say.
1:12:38
There's no greater waste of time than justifying your actions to people who have a life you don't want.
That was a message to my younger self, but I remember I got in and well, I won't.
1:12:53
I won't call it out.
Let me see how I can say this the right way.
You know what?
I'll just say it.
I'll whitewash the names.
So I was with a family member and we're all around the kitchen table and it's during the holidays because I don't go home very much.
1:13:12
And they kind of started attacking me.
And they're like, I would never live your life.
You're so unbalanced, like attacking.
And I was like, what are you saying?
And she said, I I, I just would never do that.
1:13:35
And I was like, all right, well, what part of my life is unbalanced?
I was like, do you feel like my health is unbalanced?
I was like, do you feel like my marriage is unbalanced?
I was like, do you feel like my finances are unbalanced?
I was like what part of my life do you feel like is out of whack.
She was like you know I'm I'm not as good as with words as you are and that was the and I was like OK, so the fact that you can't make a logical argument I'm not going to continue how how that conversation went.
1:14:00
But the the TLDR of that was I really thought a lot about it and it came down to I wouldn't live your life and my response to that is good.
1:14:16
Don't.
It's not your life.
It's mine.
Live yours the way you want.
And I wouldn't live your life either.
And So what ends up happening is they become these statements, these projections that are not actually real.
Now on some level, maybe they were saying that because there was envy in that aspect of like wishing that was that, you know, that they were living that life.
1:14:36
But in this particular instance, I don't think it was.
I think they genuinely were trying to help.
It was a family member and they thought they were that.
I was being misguided, but this?
Is an This is an intervention.
Let me hold the talking pillow.
Alex, we've all come together because we care about you.
We really feel like we need to have a conversation here.
1:14:52
It's.
It's exactly what it was.
And I got so angry.
You so angry and you know you can hear Layla like patting my back.
Like it's I'm like see you can feel the heat coming off of me.
It's like I'd go upstairs and look how how dare she, you know.
1:15:10
But it really just came down to like her just saying I don't want to live your life.
And I think the answer to that question is good don't.
And I think that has been one of the things that has diffused so many of these like hateful comments where people dehumanize you or whatever and make you into this ideal that they reject.
1:15:27
It's like, you're right.
One of the things that I had a mentor tell me to say is like when you're in an art, if somebody's like, it's like you're you're a terrible person, blah blah, blah, blah blah.
You just say you're right and and then they have, they have, they have nothing to say and then you just move on with your life.
1:15:43
And so like, in that way it's acceptance.
But of like your your idea of who I am that you hate so much, I accept it.
I can live with that, even be like we don't want to think what if I am AI don't believe that, but I can do that and I can end the conversation.
1:16:00
So I'm taking improv classes at the moment because I'm doing my first live shows in the UK and Ireland.
So this live talk, thank you.
Yeah, everything's no solo stood on stage for 90 minutes.
1:16:16
Comedy.
No, Just lessons, insights and stuff.
Probably some shit that I've learned today.
Anyway, we we released it and every show sold out and then got venue upgraded and then sold out again in less than 45 minutes across all of the dates.
Which was great, but then scary because I now had to speak to like three times as many people per night for additional nights on top of what I thought.
1:16:37
Anyway, I'm doing improv.
In improv, there is one rule, and the rule is don't punk the game.
So we're doing some exercise where we need to make silly noises as we pass this imaginary energy around and I need to go like Boeing and send it back and you need to go whoosh and pass it on and all this sort of shit.
1:16:57
The one thing that you're not allowed to do is not make one of the noises that's allowed.
And I really think about punking the game an awful lot and you see it happen in podcasts, you see it happen on TV, you see it happen and and it can be both destructive and constructive, but it's always destructive to the people that are trying to play the game and it can sometimes be constructive to the person who is punking it.
1:17:22
So what you did is you punked the game that we are playing a game of tennis, we are hitting the ball back and forth.
Here I go.
I hit the ball across the net and where is it?
Is it hit it back?
Hit it, Hit it back.
To me like this is the game that we're playing.
And you didn't move reciprocally back and forth.
1:17:39
You went orthogonally.
You went across on a different axis and you're like, I'm not playing this anymore.
This is a different game.
I'm not bothered.
There's not even words to describe what that means now.
The way that it can be destructive is especially if you're having, let's say, a meaningful conversation.
1:17:59
Sometimes people who are uncomfortable with getting into their emotions can use a variety of different things.
They can be scathing, they can be mocking, they can laugh, you know, because they don't want to sit with the discomfort of this particular part of the conversation.
That's punking the game in a way that I think is destructive both externally and internally.
1:18:17
That was one that was destructive externally.
It broke the game, but it was constructive internally, and it is a way refusing to play by the rules that somebody else has set in a game that you didn't agree to is the best prophylactic against stepping into a situation that you do not want.
1:18:35
And it's one of the things that wealth affords, and it's one of the things that freedom affords.
And freedom is often downstream from wealth.
Remember George, one of my really good friends.
Been on the show like five times.
George Mack, you'll follow him on 20.
It's fucking phenomenal.
He was on.
He was on Fox and Friends yesterday talking about his cocaine phone and his kale phone.
1:18:53
Like, what the fuck?
What world is this?
I remember before the first time that I moved away to work.
I've been, I've travelled a lot, but it was always in between work.
I never travelled to work.
COVID happens.
World gets shut down Just after Halloween, Boris tells all of the UK we're going back into lockdown in three days time and all flights are cancelled.
1:19:17
So I messaged George and I was like, I'm not doing this, I'm, I let's go somewhere he wanted to go to.
I can't, I can't even remember some island that has 300,000 people on it.
And I was like, why don't we do Dubai?
It's a 5 hour flight, the weather's great, I know people, it'll be fun.
1:19:37
It's not got 300,000 people on it, It'll be this Uber.
And I'll never fucking forget what he replied to me with.
I got up and I paid 350 for my COVID fit to fly test before he was awake.
But he'd sent me a message the night before, and this is what compelled me to do it, he said.
1:19:54
What's the point in having fuck you freedom if you never say fuck you?
And I was like, I was so fired up reading that message and I was like, yeah, why have I put all of this work in?
Why have I done all of these things if I don't ever punk a game that I didn't agree to be a part of?
1:20:11
I think this is really big.
If we go all the way back to the earlier part of this podcast, when you have the friends who are telling you, oh must be nice or you think you're better than us or oh so we can't drink anymore, that's when you can be like, yeah, then what?
1:20:31
Well then we wouldn't be friends.
You're not going to be friends with them eventually anyways, I promise you, anyone who says that.
So you're not going to be friends with, if you want to ultimately become the person you want to become, they're only going to reject you harder and harder until eventually you have nothing to share about and the only thing that you'll talk about is the past.
Which by the way, one of the great leading indicators of, at least in my opinion, of a great way to know when to cut a friend is when they only talk about your past.
1:20:51
And so punking the game and it's it's one of those really uncomfortable things the first time you do it.
But then you get more and more comfortable with it because they're like, I would never live your life and you're like, I know.
This relates to another one of yours.
1:21:09
Don't trade yourself respect for someone else's.
It's easy to lose theirs and hard to get yours back.
Yeah, but I would know.
But you would know, yeah, related to the sort of cynicism thing that we were talking about earlier, and I call it the cynicism safety blanket, that sour grapes at an existential level.
1:21:29
I had Sean Puri on the show.
You know, Sean, you've been on his.
You've been on my first million.
He casually dropped this.
I don't think this.
I don't think his episode's going to be out before this goes, but it's money.
And he said the cynics get to be right and the optimists get to be rich.
1:21:48
And from you, I think the winners mindset sits in the uncomfortable place between two surface level contradictions, extreme paranoia in the present and unshakable faith in the future.
The tension between the two makes someone hard to beat today and hard to outlast tomorrow.
The cynics get to be right, and the optimists get to be rich.
1:22:08
One of the biggest fallacies of the advice from people who are in your current situation is that they are right most of the time.
When you bring a home, a girl home 99 times out of 100, when your parents say she's not the girl, I don't like her.
She won't last.
They're right every single time except for the one time it matters.
1:22:26
And you end up marrying the person, right?
Like when they say, like, you're not going to succeed, like this idea of yours, it's not going to last.
And they're right every single time, except for the one time that matters when you hit it big.
And so it's one of those things where they are right more times, but they are not more right.
1:22:45
So good.
Yeah, I am.
I wonder whether it's a function of all of our opinions being permanently etched in stone on social media that it's very easy to seem smart to have a heterodox idea if you go against the mainstream because it's romantic.
1:23:07
Oh, I, I, I I had this alternative.
I I had this negative.
I'm not.
I'm not like one of those sheep.
I'll I'll I'll believe that things are going to be worse than they are And then if it turns out better, guess what I say, your expectation's super low.
1:23:24
Congratulations, You can thank me later.
You're like that is distilled down.
British culture at its worst, is low expectations.
Low expectations delivered through satirical cynicism.
1:23:45
Yeah, Why are you doing that?
That's lame.
That's for losers.
That's something that we wouldn't do.
You should stop doing the different thing.
Tall poppy, you're the one that gets cut down.
And it's all that.
It's like all that it shows to me now is a kind of groupthink.
1:24:07
Almost like the worst kind of mental telepathy, where everybody believes the most unuseful thoughts that everybody else has at scale and all it does is lower the bar that you need to get up.
1:24:27
I think it's that that you're right thing, which is someone says that's lame, that sucks blah blah blah and you say like you're right, it does.
You just keep punking the game.
Like when anyone comes to try and like like they're they're playing a different game than you.
1:24:42
So you shouldn't try and play by their rules because they're going to try and get you to play their game so that they can beat you at the game, which is the status game of that little circle.
But you're playing a much wider game that includes more players.
And so even though locally you have these, your your incoming information that you're taking in is disproportionate with your people that you're not actually playing against.
1:25:03
And so it's basically just noise.
It's irrelevant because if you look on a long enough time horizon, the likely that you're like, I mean, again, I think about death a lot, but the the idea that when I die, people will be dividing up my assets, arguing over who gets what.
1:25:20
There's going to be a caterer at my funeral.
Some people won't make it because something came up and they got busy.
And then the few people that are, there are probably no one that I have in my life right now.
And the fact that every single person that I have in my life might not even make it to the funeral to speak over me while I'm dead, it's like, why on earth would I listen to them while I'm alive?
1:25:44
Like, they can't even make it to.
Probably the single most important in, you know, personal day of someone's life is someone's funeral, right?
The one time you can pay your last respect and they don't even do that.
And so it's like, why would I give any weight?
So what these people are doing when they're not even going to be there on the day that matters most, and six months later, they're not even remember who I was.
1:26:02
And anybody who's had a death in their family recently knows that in the moment it's terrible for you.
And then six months later, life moves on.
But The thing is, is that we just never paint ourselves as the person who dies.
But to me that's incredibly freeing, because then it's like if six months after I'm dead, no one is going to say my name, no one is going to remember what I did then, no one's going to then it doesn't matter what I do today.
1:26:23
And I think that some people see it as really hopeless, but I see it as very hopeful because it means we have absolute freedom and we can do crazy shit.
Like, why have fuck you money if you can't say fuck you?
Yeah, learning isn't a spectator sport.
It comes from doing.
Which means if you're not doing the stuff you consume every day, you're not learning, you're just procrastinating.
1:26:43
Oh, this is fun.
All right, so I'm going to define some terms.
Learning.
Let me say this way, intelligence means rate of learning.
Like that's what that's how I remember I talked about operationalizing words.
1:27:00
So rate of learning is intelligence.
So then you, which means it's a rate, not a not an attribute as an aside.
Which then means you have to define learning.
Learning means same condition, new behaviour.
So if I hold up a red card and then I slap you, and then I'll hold a red card again, and then you duck, you've learnt.
1:27:18
If you wake up every day and life shows you a red card and then you don't duck and you don't change, then you have learned nothing.
And so if you go to a weekend and you go to a workshop and then the next day you go back and you do the exact same activities in the same conditions and you have no new behavior, it means you learned nothing.
1:27:37
It also means you're stupid because it means your rate of learning is slow.
So if someone is intelligent, I can show them the red card and on the first go they change their behaviour.
And so by defining intelligence that way and defining learning that way, it allowed me to start thinking, well, I want to be smart.
1:27:55
And this circumstance had this outcome last time.
And so the next time I see this circumstance, this red card, I'm going to change my behaviour.
And so when we consume the information that you have on this podcast or whatever it is, there's probably a circumstance, whether it's a conversation that you're supposed to have but you aren't having.
1:28:11
It's a decision that you need to make, what you're putting off, that's the red card.
It comes up again.
And the question is whether you're going to get slapped or you're going to duck.
And that's whether you know whether you learned or not.
And every time you get shown the red card and you do the same exact thing, you just prove to yourself that your rate of learning is slower.
1:28:29
And so for me, I want to have that evidence that I learned quickly.
And for me, that's why, like people see me as ruthless, as you said, because I'm willing to cut relationships, Because if I think that I'm going to eventually cut the relationship, then why would I not cut it today?
Because I might, as I might as well start enjoying the benefits of cutting that relationship as soon as humanly possible.
1:28:49
Alex Omosi, ladies and gentlemen, Dude, I love you to bits.
I I genuinely do.
I I think the work that you put out, the messages that you put out are very, very needed.
And yeah, I could do this for days.
We could run this back literally for days and days and days.
1:29:06
So this is going to go out after your big event.
Where should people go to support you to learn more about the shit that you do and and what have you got coming up?
Well, I've got my my next book, $100 million leads.
The first book is $100 million offers, which answers the question, what should I sell?
1:29:21
So a lot of people are like, what should I sell?
It tells you step by step everything you do, like worksheets.
I have a free course that goes with it.
You don't even have to opt in.
It's on my site acquisition.com.
You can just start watching it.
I think the Kindle for offers is $1.99 cents like try to make.
I mean our mission is to make real business education accessible for everyone. $100 million leads has been six hours a day, 6:00 AM to 12:12 PM every day for the last two years.
1:29:45
So the first six hours of every day has been dedicated to writing that book.
Which is why I have 19 drafts, 444 full rewrites.
There's 106 hand drawn images that went in the book that I put in there, and I'm going to be releasing it at this event that Chris and I were talking about.
So you're going to be listening to this after that event.
1:30:02
And so you can go on Amazon, it'll be available there or you can look at acquisition.com because they'll be a course and things that you can go through free materials And that the, the $100 million leads answers the question, who do I sell it to?
And so you need leads, right?
So you're like, OK, great, I have the thing I'm going to sell who how do I go get people to find out about it?
1:30:21
And so a lot of the things that I have in the book are defining some of the terms that people hear a lot, which is like, what is the lead, What is advertising, right?
Advertising is the process of making known.
And so if no one knows about your stuff, no one can buy it.
And so the reverse of that is everyone knows about your stuff, and that book will show you how to get everyone to know about your stuff.
And the reason I made the event as big as I did was because I used every advertising method in the book to advertise the book itself.
1:30:41
So offers was an example of grand slime offers.
How do you make something so good?
Everyone feels stupid saying no, which is the sub headline of the book.
And so offers in and of itself was a grand slime offer, which is what I argue that everyone should have.
It was a $2.00 book that it comes with a course, comes with worksheets, all these things and $100 billion leads.
The way that I wanted to exemplify and meta show demonstrate that the concept of the book work today and will work tomorrow and will work in 100 years is because humans haven't changed and so the process of making known remains the same because our hardwiring is the same.
1:31:10
So you don't need to know the Instagram hack because my first ever advertisement was on Facebook and I don't do anything on Facebook now and it doesn't matter.
And as soon as YouTube and podcasts and all those things die, the principles remain the same despite the platforms changing.
And so that is what I wrote each of these books because I want them to be around in 100 years and that's why I spent so long on them.
1:31:30
But I'm very proud of the book and I think it's my best work to date.
Alex, I appreciate you.
Thank you, man.
Thank you.








0:00
And so I think that if you can make that piece a a foundation, a cornerstone of how you live, then you will always have as much energy and clear, you know, clarity, and you will be able to make better judgement and better decisions.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:22
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk, and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I wanted to bring up a habit that I think is central to being successful and it's really, really, really, really, really not sexy.
0:43
And I like the more I think about it.
There's so many other pieces that flow into this single habit.
And when I observe people who, you know, are doing better than I am and what not, they usually have this really dialed in.
And the reason that no one does it is just because it's so freaking hard, all right?
1:00
And it all revolves around energy.
And So what I mean by that is how to maximize your output as an entrepreneur because at the end of the day, like, all we have is ourselves.
And so that's why so many entrepreneurs are obsessed with increasing their, their personal throughput, like how much they can produce, right?
1:19
You know, myself included.
And probably you and a lot of us started on this path and wanted to increase our, our output by, you know, getting in shape.
And so when we were younger or whatever, you know, whatever, we had that moment in our lives, we're like, you know what?
I'm going to start taking control of my life.
I'm going to start controlling what I eat.
I'm going to start working out drinking water, all that kind of stuff, right?
1:37
And I think that there are levels to creating clear output.
And so an easy example of this is like, if you've, if you've been on a, you know, workout kick, right for a while or you've been training for a long time, if you ever stop training and stop eating the way that you've now grown accustomed, all of a sudden you feel sluggish and foggy and unclear, right.
1:58
And you're like, man, I feel terrible, right.
And I also think that as we get older, and I'm not saying I'm old, but just as I've I personally have gotten older, my margin for error continues to shrink, right?
Like the amount of my wiggle room on fucking this up has gotten smaller and smaller and smaller.
2:15
Which is why I think very genuinely, the reason people many times drink less and less as they get older is because they simply can't recover from it.
I think that people would drink as much as they could, as much as they did in college as adults, if they could bounce back from it like they did when they were 18, right?
2:32
That's just a pure theory of mine.
But I don't think that humans fundamentally change.
I think that the equation of cost and benefit changes, and that is what changes their behavior, right.
And so the the single habit or the single routine, and I'm going to get to it, it changes and effects everything in your life, which is why it's so hard, right?
2:50
It's one singular habit that affects how you eat, who you see, where you go, all of that into one thing.
And that habit is sleep.
All right?
And I'm and I know that's like, man, is that anti climactic?
Is Alex going to talk about sleep?
I am.
3:06
And I think it's because as entrepreneurs we need to be able to monitor our energy levels in order to succeed.
And I know this sounds like a really boring topic, but I'm telling you every single person who makes a ton of money that I know has a super dialed in sleep system.
3:24
So it's not about like everybody talks about daily routines and all this shit.
I've seen a zillion routines.
I personally don't really have one.
Like I've seen all you know some people attribute their success to the fact that they do XY and Z.
Like I just think it comes down to being able to have energy and be maximal in your output.
3:40
Now the reason this trickles to everything is because if you always like to sleep, well, you have to pretty much go to sleep at the same time every day, and you have to wake up at pretty much the same time every day.
And you also can't do things to impair your sleep.
And so here's the trickle down effects of that.
It means that when you travel, you change time zones.
3:57
It fucks with you, right?
If you drink and go out, it fucks with you.
If you normally go to sleep during the week at 9 and go to sleep on the weekends at 11:30, it fucks with you.
Your body doesn't know about weekends or weekdays.
It just knows about how your body's supposed to feel, right?
4:14
And so I think what a single thing that we can like.
For me, that has helped because I'm not.
I'm really bad at doing things on a, like, repeatedly.
I'm really bad at it.
But one thing that has helped me is, is having a bedtime more than a wake up time.
4:31
Right?
When I screenshot my wake up's at 4:00 in the morning, it's not because I have an alarm that goes off, It's just because I wake up, right?
And so I think it's much better.
Like, it's not, it's not worth trying to cut your sleep to five hours so that you can wake up at 4.
Like, that's not the game.
It's not sustainable.
4:46
And you're also going to be stupider.
Like there's all the data in the world shows that when you don't sleep much, you are Dumber, right?
You get fatter, you're hungrier, you're Dumber, you're slower, you have lower processing power, you have worse short term memory.
All of those things are affected.
And as entrepreneurs of the only thing that we have is our brains and the decisions we make, like it stacks all the chips against you, right?
5:07
You're also more emotionally reactive, right?
You're you have less control in that your prefrontal cortex because you don't have enough sleep, right?
I'm sure there are sometimes that you've woken up, or me at least where I've woken up and I'm like, man, there's literally nothing that could bother me today.
Like, I feel awesome, right?
And I think it's really about how can we recreate that environment, that mental soup of feeling on a consistent basis and what are the prerequisites for that?
5:31
And This is why it's hard, and This is why it's so hard, because there are so many things that I do not do simply because of my sleep, right?
People invite me out all the time for dinner at 7:00.
Well, I'm in bed by 8:30 or not, so it's not going to work.
5:48
And if it's a 30 minute drive there, you know, that means that I have to leave the dinner at pretty much 8, right?
So I can go there and my drive 30 minutes to get there for a one hour dinner, drive 30.
Like, I'm not going to do that, right?
And so there's a lot of social occasions that I can't go to or I have to leave early from, right.
6:05
And it seems lame and it's hard, right?
It's hard to do that.
It's hard to do to not go out on the weekends and change my schedule because everyone else does, right, and even a lot of entrepreneurs do.
Doesn't mean that they're bad.
It's just they're different, right?
Real.
Quick guys, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
6:25
And so the only ask that I can ever have or you guys that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you.
Can rate and.
Review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
6:42
It'll take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
And so a couple of takeaways around this, at least for me, is that every entrepreneur that I know that is super successful has dedicated time where they're uninterrupted every day.
6:59
And that to me means you're either staying up really late or you're waking up really early.
I actually, if you think about it from a lifestyle standpoint, I think it might be easier to stay up really late because you it allows you to have a little bit more of a social life and then you can still have your work time afterwards if you're disciplined enough to do that.
7:18
I wish I could do that.
Even in college, I never worked past 9:00 PM like I I did and I'm just like, I'm shocked.
Like I just that's how I function personally.
And so I always, I was always the guy who'd be like, you know, I'd be stopped working at 9:00 and then I would wake up at 3:00 or 4:00 and then I would start working in because I just knew I was useless, right.
7:36
And so for me, because of how my body works, it's kind of less convenient for me, which has been it's taken a toll on a lot of things in my life.
And that's why it's a big trade off and most people aren't willing to make it with their actions, right?
Like, the trade off of not drinking, right.
Because it impairs my sleep most of the time is hard.
7:53
Right Now there's trade-offs.
You know, if you go to a wedding or it's your wedding or, you know, whatever it's like, then then just understand the trade off.
But The thing is, is the lower the barrier is for when you make that trade-offs, the more likely it is to happen all the time, right?
And then all of a sudden you're drinking because it's Taco Tuesday, right?
And so, you know, it's kind of like the weight loss client is like, well, it was a special occasion.
8:11
Donuts are on Wednesdays.
Like, you know, at some point you have to draw a line.
And for most people, they don't have the discipline.
And so they have to go all or nothing.
And myself included, I spent 2 1/2 years where I didn't drink anything, Right?
We've started to drink a little bit more now, try and try and balance things.
I think that the ultimate goal is to be able to have things and not be to use things and not be used by them, right?
8:31
And so to bring this all to to to a head, right, the weekends, right?
Not changing your schedule on the weekends.
Huge, incredibly difficult, not going out during the weekdays at all on social events that I know are going to get me jacked up emotionally or adrenaline or whatever, so that when I get home I have to spend another hour unwinding to get to bed at a later time, right?
8:55
And so I think the single habit, at least for me, that's been game changing, has been always allowing myself to sleep as much as necessary or as much as my body needs, but focusing more on my bedtime, right?
And by doing that, it does rule out a lot of activities in my life.
9:12
And that is hard.
Like, it's really hard for me.
Like, I'm a sofa person.
I like seeing people, but I can't a lot of times.
And it also means that I can't travel as much as I would normally like to because when I go across time zones, it really messes with me.
And so a lot of times when I go across time zones, I try and keep the same sleep schedule.
9:30
So when I was in Southern California, I was waking up at like two or two o'clock 2:30 in the morning because it was 2 hours behind or sorry, two hours.
Yes, two hours behind my Austin time.
So I tried to change as little as I could, which means that I was, like, going to sleep at like 7 or 730.
9:46
It was nuts, right?
And that means all the people that were in Southern California were like, well, dude, let's hang out.
And I'm like, I'm in bed and they're like, seriously, it's seven And I'm like, I don't study, you know?
And that's hard.
It's shitty.
And I'm not saying it's the best way.
I'm just saying, I think that when I look at a lot of people who are who are really successful, they have this one aspect dialed in and it has so many ramifications to the rest of their lives because you can't have any kind of habitual habits or output if the one thing that starts or ends your day is is variable, right?
10:19
And so I think that if you can make that piece a a foundation, a cornerstone of how you live, then you will always have as much energy and clear, you know, clarity and you will be able to make better judgement and better decisions.
And I know this is definitely not like a, hey, here's how to close your credit card over the phone in 3 minutes type of tactic.
10:39
But I I can't tell you how important I really, truly think it is and how I can witness this character trait or rather you know, human habit and the people who are successful and people who don't.
And I think it's because it it requires other character traits.
You have to have discipline.
You have to have be able to to to make trade-offs.
10:55
You have to really be able to prioritize the things that are important in your life and those are all skills that some people don't have.
And so if you can do that, then you have to ask yourself, is this thing worth the trade off of me being at 100% tomorrow versus 80%.
And I think that that 20% extra is what compounds over time and what separates Kobe Bryant from the rest of the NBA, because he always took that 20% again and again and again and again and then within five years.
11:20
The difference is it that the the gap is so wide that no one can catch up with you.
So I know this was less of a tactical one.
I just it it's so important to me because I've it's changed the way I live my life.
And when people who do know me are like, Oh yeah, all my friends are like, oh, past your bedtime, right.
11:37
And I take those, you know, I take those slags and you know, I take those body punches because it's true.
You know what I mean?
And it's a trade off and it hurts because I don't, you know, I'd like to see people and they're like, well, I I can't do anything before that.
And I'm like, well then I guess we can't hang out And so and like I have those real conversations honestly all the time.
11:54
And so I guess I'm saying this to say if you have been struggling with maintaining, you know, the a routine or a specific habit because everyone around you is not in support of it, I think it's welcome to the club.
And I think it's just are you willing to make that trade off for what you want?
12:10
And I just never want to look back on my life and be like, well, I'm glad I went to Taco Tuesdays rather than getting what I wanted out of life.
So anyways, I thought I'd share that with you so that if you are struggling with it, I don't think it gets easier.
I think it's still just as hard for me now as it was before, but I think I'm just more used to it.
12:26
And I've I've kind of trained my surroundings.
The people who are around me in my life, they just know that this is a trade off I'm not willing to make when 99% of humanity is willing to make that trade.
And I think that separates the 1% from everyone else.

When you own your flaws, it's the thing that you're most afraid to say out loud.
It's the things that you suck at because you're ashamed of it.
But when you take the things that you're ashamed of and you bring them to the light, all of a sudden what used to be perceived as shame is perceived as strength.

The wealthiest people in the world.
See Business as a game.
This podcast the Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar.
Portfolio.
I hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I'm calling this the three dimensions of leadership.
0:41
And so I'm making this because I think so many times I've been asked by people in our company, people who know me from from before the gyms, just all different times of my life.
People have asked like, how how do you, how do you gain respect, right.
0:58
And they're like, I feel like, I feel like your employees respect you.
I feel like, I feel like people respect you, you know, like, how do you, how do I get that?
And it was, it's a really hard question for me.
And so I wanted to give you a little bit of back story.
I think of how this kind of came to be.
So First off, just just some interesting backlog.
1:16
I I was raised by a single dad and I had no siblings.
And so all, like my home life was just men, right?
And it was a Middle Eastern thought.
I went to an all guy school, which is again, all men.
As soon as I went to college, I immediately joined a fraternity and surrounded myself by all men.
1:38
And I think it's because just like on some level, like I'm, I was more comfortable there.
And my audience, if I look at Instagram and I look at Facebook and all that stuff, is 80% male.
And the 20% of females that I think that come in tend to be entrepreneurs.
1:56
And there's a lot of sort of traditionally male characteristics that go along with that.
Now, I'm not saying that in any way that's that's bad or good in terms of like male catch tricks being bad or female, like whatever.
I'm just saying like that's what is right.
And so I think that I've attracted that mix and that, like, my life has been that way because my primary driver in life has been Respect.
2:18
And so there's there's an amazing series called Love and Respect.
It's for marriages.
But I think it's one of the most profound understandings of how to deal with people besides like how to make friends and influence people.
I'd say the second thing that I would ever watch is that it's a marriage series, but it's really just about men and women and the differences and the drivers of how how to get people to do what you want them to do, right.
2:39
And how to have better relationships.
And that that book and that series changed my life as well.
And it reinforced it, put words to a lot of the things that I did that I didn't know why.
And so respect.
I called this the three dimensions of leadership because I was trying to trying to think through what is it right.
2:57
And if you look it up, it's just an admiration of someone due to qualities, achievements, etcetera.
But I was like, how does that what, what, what's, where's the teeth to respect, right.
And so I was thinking I was like, I think maybe it's the, it's the middle point between fear and love.
3:15
And then I thought more about that.
And I was like, I don't know if it's the midpoint because, like, you know, I think Layla respects me.
I don't know if she fears me.
Well, maybe she does fear me.
You know what I mean?
So I was playing with this and I think it looks more like a triangle.
And so I think it's more fear, love and respect that sit on a triangle.
3:33
And we aim as leaders to be in the middle of that dot, right.
And if you think about the, the midpoints between each of those three, let's say, if you have respect and love, the midpoint there I would say is like loyalty, right?
And if you look at the midpoint between between fear and love, you have sacrifice, right.
3:53
And so if you look at like each of those dimensions, you have like different characteristics that kind of that kind of come out of them.
And so to go back to the initial question, like how do you gain respect, right.
And because it's been the only goal I've had in most of my life.
I didn't.
I never really sought to be loved.
4:08
That was not, it's not a primary driver.
If it did happen, it was not my not my goal, it was, it was a secondary thing.
And I think that because I've lived in all male dominated organizations, sorry, like my whole life has been predominantly male.
And then even when I had my gyms, I really, I think I only hired total three women ever between all the locations.
4:30
Like I mean I it's just I was more it's not like it was the sexist thing.
It's just like I was more comfortable with guys and so it just ended up naturally happening that way and so and I never had I never had trainers leave and steal clients like I never had any of those things happen because the entire organization ran off respect right.
4:46
And the things that I've learned about respect is that it has to be given before it's before it's received.
And and and and you have to set that tone in the initial conversation.
And so like, if if someone's first day or first interaction with you, they come in and it's 2 minutes late.
5:04
If you're just like, please don't be late again, I won't be late for you.
Like, it automatically sets a tone because they're like, wow, like it's.
But I respected them by being on time and they didn't respect me by not being on time.
And so it's like you set this tone immediately and you make these minor corrections and you don't tolerate times where there's minor points of disrespect.
5:25
And you point it out to the person so that they understand where you're coming from.
And what ends up happening is that you raise the expectations, you raise the bar of the relationship.
And then as a result, respect follows.
And so this has been something I'm probably going to dive more even deeper on because it's like it's really messing with my head because I want to be able to impart this to, you know, the leaders of the company and then the managers in our company and everything is like, how do we, how do we gain that?
5:51
And so a lot of times, respect is also earned from sacrifice.
And so if you want, especially like in in the world of men, at least in my belief, is that if you want someone's respect, you have to do things for them that they wouldn't expect you to do, right?
6:09
And so for example, I'm, I'm, I'm just giving you an example from like the world of pledging, right.
And the reason I'm using that is because it's, it was a short period of time where you rapidly, you're introduced into a new environment and you want to rapidly gain respect, right?
That was kind of the environment.
So deconstructing like what the actions were in order to gain that right.
6:28
And the way to do that in that environment was do more than anyone else would offer to give more far past what was average or what was the most, but just give everything to the 'cause that benefited the whole group.
And so if you sacrifice yourself and say you know what guys like, I know you all have some tests tomorrow, like I'll work late tonight.
6:48
Like, don't worry about it, like it's fine.
And consistently putting the group first is what gains you respect, right.
And so I feel like there's so many little micro points and so many, like, micro experiences that I've had that have like, I, like put that in my, like, respect playbook of like, oh, OK like, whenever there's a little issue that that comes up, that's that's either disrespectful for me or them like, announce it, right.
7:14
Or if I ever disrespect someone else, for example.
And by being 2 minutes late, the first thing I'll say is like, First off, I want, I'm at no disrespect by being 2 minutes late.
I didn't want to disrespect your time.
I totally lost track and I apologize.
And I can't tell you how many times I've had like, just things happen, right?
7:30
And I mean, I try to always be on time, but even if you're 2 minutes late or a minute late, right, if you start a conversation like that with a vendor or a new employee or anything, I can't tell you the amount of times that people are taking it back.
And they're like, oh, thanks.
Like, no, but I appreciate that.
7:46
But no.
And so there's immediate level of respect of, like, this person's respecting my time.
I'm going to respect his time back.
And so that was like 1 little note in the Respect playbook.
You know what I mean?
Like try and see if there's ways that I can sacrifice for the group.
So if I'm on a sales team, right, like, I'll be like, guys, I'll work the weekends, I'll take the late shifts.
8:05
Like, don't worry about it.
I got this.
And then, like, I'll wake up earlier.
And then The thing is, is that people see that effort and they're like, man, like, I respect that guy.
Like I respect his hustle, right.
And so there's probably different elements of things that people respect about you, right?
Like maybe you're like that in work, but you're a horrible husband and people know that.
8:23
But like, you're like, I don't respect that about him.
And so there's even more, you know, facets, which is kind of bringing in what Layla says, where you have to lead, what you live or live with you, whatever, that leave what you live or live what you leave.
But if people see through like people want, people want to respect someone and they just are waiting for reasons not to.
8:42
And I think that if you, if you try and live the same life in secret or in private as you do in public, then there's no, there's no inconsistencies between the two.
And people can see that because at the end of the day, like everything always comes out.
Like the truth always comes out.
8:58
And so if you try and live that truth and when you know you, you mess up, you own that, People respect you for it.
Because like I've, I mean 1,000,000 people said this.
But like, like Eminem, if you can own your flaws and know that and then continue to work on them and people see you work on them, they respect you more for it than trying to posture and say like, I don't have them because we all have flaws, right.
9:19
And so like these are just some of the things that have come up like and in in trying to reverse engineer this because I want, I want my entire company to be, you know run based off of respect.
And I probably leaned too much in that direction because that's what I was raised in.
You know what I mean?
9:34
Middle Eastern family like it's all on respect, right?
Like I I the the test that they took in the love and respect which is really, really interesting is they have one question that they ask men and women and they do.
This is kind of like the onset of the entire seminar, which is if you could, like, I'm butchering the question, but if you could be loved by everyone, right?
9:59
But but no one respected you for the rest of your life, would you prefer that?
Or everyone respects you but have no love?
Which would you prefer, right?
And it's like 80% of men say they would prefer to be respected and not loved.
10:15
And like 80% of women are like, I would prefer to be loved and not respected.
And so it's just an interesting dichotomy between, like, how men and women in general tend to respond to things.
And so I've, like, I, I consistently obsessed about this because it's probably been the primary driver of, like, how I want all my relationships in my life.
10:31
To work is based on respect, and respect is mutual.
It's two ways, right?
And it's just like most things, you have to give it before you get it.
And the way to consistently get it and keep it is to consistently sacrifice for the good of the whole.
And I think that's probably the biggest piece is, is is sacrificing and putting the whole before yourself.
10:49
And I think when and and doing that not just in front of people but especially behind closed doors.
Because I think when I was younger and I wanted to gain respect I always was trying to do it in places where people would see it.
And then I realized much later on that I got so much more respect when people would, would notice things that they knew I didn't, that they would notice things that I had done that they knew that wasn't visual or wasn't public.
11:22
And then they would tell other people about it, right.
And so it's kind of like coming into the party and saying like we've got a business that does XY and Z and blah, blah, blah, blah versus you coming into a conversation with someone and having them posture against you and say like we've got a 7 figure business, right?
11:41
Whatever.
And you're like, that's amazing, dude.
Good for you.
Like, you know, what are you doing and just being interested in them and whatnot and letting them just like, beat their chest.
And then what happens is they leave and then someone else comes up just like, dude, you know who that is?
And they're like, no.
And they're like, oh, that guy does XY and Z.
11:58
And then all of a sudden in that that dynamic, that first person who was bragging feels like a fool, right?
And so immediately, it's the things that other people say that are going to give you far more than anything you can say.
And so it's like, if you want other people to say the things that you want them to say, what do we have to do in order to get them to say those things?
12:17
And so, like, making that realization for me was a huge kind of breakthrough for me because then it stopped being like about posturing publicly but about posturing privately.
And then what happens is, and this is like kind of the funny part is if you start doing the things almost from an external standpoint because you selfishly want to be respected, but you're doing the things in private in order to do that, then all of a sudden you start to change your identity because what you're doing in private is respectable.
12:44
And so in a weird way, you kind of push out the things that are not respectable that you do in your life.
And so like, and one of the biggest things when I was like, really, like, dealing with the demons that I had earlier on in life was understanding the concept of shame, right.
So if it like the respect is, is what the goal is.
13:01
The opposite of that is shame and embarrassment.
And so a lot of times I think that the people were like, man, Alex is so real.
I mean, I just see this in the comments and whatnot.
I like the podcast and like, I appreciate it, but I think it was, it was really hard for me to like.
13:16
When you own your flaws, it's the thing that you're most afraid to say out loud.
It's the things that you suck at because you're ashamed of it.
But when you take the things that you're ashamed of and you bring them to the light, all of a sudden what used to be perceived as shame is perceived as strength.
13:34
And it's really interesting just understanding that.
Like the things that I was ashamed of, that I've done and that I've said and how I've acted when brought into the light.
Like they only give you shame.
They only take up your attention in your headspace when you try and hide it.
But when you bring into the light and you talk about it, then people respect you for it.
13:54
And it's just this really interesting thing because I think on some level all are like that but then you respect the person who had the courage to do it.
And so like in the in the respect playbook it's like set the tone always don't disrespect people.
Sacrifice for the good of the whole lead what you live like do the things in the backgrounds and in the shadows that people would think respectable and would talk about you.
14:16
And then the one that I just said that and then like own, own your flaws and bring them out publicly so that the things that you're ashamed of actually become the things that people perceive as your strengths.
And so, like going through this and like, like, you know what I mean?
14:32
Like and and this playbook as like lengthened over time.
But there's this, like this.
I didn't, I didn't know what direction this was going to go in.
But trying to understand that triangle of fear, love and respect and sitting in the dot in the middle because like, there is an element of fear when it comes to leadership, right?
14:50
Like, if you think about and so even if you're not religious or whatever, if you think about the relationship that most people would have with their creator, whatever the omnipotent, like being in their life is, there's three elements.
It's not just love, it's not just fear, it's not just respect.
15:07
It's all three, right?
And it's just kind of like this melting pot of those three emotions.
And then the the actions that happen as a result of that are the things that happen in between.
If you have the respect and the love, that's where you're loyal.
You have the fear and the love that's where you sacrifice.
15:25
And when you have fear and respect, you're obedient, right?
And so you see these three triangles and the actions that exist between each of those, those binaries of the emotion on that triangle plane.
And that's how you can get those behaviors is by having all three of those things.
15:41
And so if you're like, I feel like I have no loyalty in my organization, right, then it means that they don't, that you probably don't have the balance of respect and love, right.
And so I think you get loyalty because people see that you're making the decisions not only out of out of respect for the company, but also out of love for the individual.
16:02
Like people like, sometimes I don't attract women, I think, because I can be perceived as abrasive, right?
Very direct.
And so sometimes that doesn't sit well with people who kind of like just walk into our environment like it's a wall, right.
But I think that that loyalty lives there because we're always trying to think like if I'm making the decision, like, is this loving this person?
16:23
Is this actually in this person's best interest?
And that's why parenting is so different than being someone's friend, right?
Like we have to do these things.
And like, I'm saying this not as a parent, but I feel like when you run an organization, like in some ways the the relationship's very similar is like, I need to, I need to foster this person and balance the the, the stick and the carrot.
16:45
You know what I mean?
Of of love and fear and balance.
This because I truly want the best for the individual.
Now if you don't have that in mind, if people don't think you have their best interest in mind.
And the secret to having people think you have their best interest in mind is to actually have the best interest in mind, right?
17:01
And so if they don't feel like you have that, then you may have their respect but not their love.
And so then you don't have loyalty, right?
And so if you have people constantly leaving your organization, that's what it is, right?
And if you, if you, if you have people who like, don't respect you, right and like talk shit behind your back and when you make, when you make statements in one another, like they roll their eyes or whatever, then it means you might not have fear, right.
17:27
And so like it's it's it's constantly balancing between these three forces in order to get, you know, the behavior that's desired.
And obviously we're human and we're flawed.
And sometimes I lean too much towards fear.
I'll be real with you.
Like, I I.
There's probably a lot of people in my company that on some level fear me.
17:43
And I know that.
You know what I mean?
I understand that.
And I'm not going to say that I don't sometimes foster that a little bit because it's good to make sure everyone knows you still have teeth, that, like, expectations are still expected to be met.
Because if you don't have the fear that it means you don't have accountability, there's no consequences, right.
18:00
And so there has to be that balance of, like, I love you, I need you, like I want to foster you, I want to grow you.
But there are expectations.
And after a certain point, it goes from love to fear, right?
There are going to be teeth that come out as a result of this relationship.
18:18
And if you can't do that, then that's when you lose respect, right, from that team or that employee, etcetera.
And so it's it's this, it's this triad and there may be even more dimensions to it.
I don't know.
This is just like as I'm.
I'm articulating it because I know that I've had a lot of people ask me about it, and it's just such a complex emotion to be able to get from people.
18:40
And I don't think it's one trick because if it were, everyone would do it.
But I think it it's like kind of the embodiment of all of the way that you treat other people and the things that you do in in in in the dark, how you articulate those things and honestly, how you live your life.
And so when people want to have, like, I think the combination of perfect leadership and have the loyalty and the obedience and the sacrifice and the love and the fear and the respect from their team so that they can ultimately lead and influence an organization, it's it's because they lack some of those things, right?
19:09
Like you, you won't have fear if you never hold people accountable or enforce rules for real, right?
If you don't enforce, then you have No Fear, which is important because that's what moves people right.
If you don't care for the individuals, right, You'll lose loyalty because they think that you don't actually care about them and it's only about you or it's only about the business, which means that the first chance and they're going to go care about themselves and not you or the business because they're just going to mirror back what what you're showing them, right?
19:39
And then the same thing with respect, which I think a lot of times comes from sacrifice, right, is that if they feel like you're not willing to do things for the organization that you're asking them to do, then they're not going to do it for the organization either, right?
And I think that to a certain degree, a lot of people like, I've always felt like it was easier to ask someone to do something that they know beyond a shadow of a doubt.
20:03
I would do five times more, right?
And then it just, it just gives you a high ground from that conversation.
And maybe there's other ways to do it like, I mean, I I don't know.
But at least for me, from my like up to this point in my life, I know that I can speak confidently in saying that most people in the organization don't think that I slack right.
20:23
They don't think that I hope that I that I would hold myself to a lower standard than I would hold them.
And so I think that that's one of the keys is like, if you want to hold people to a high standard, a really high standard, then you in honest or in earnest have to hold yourself to an even higher standard.
20:41
And that has to be real.
And that means that, like that video that I made about trade-offs of, like, what if you're going to hold some of this standard and you want to hold yourself to a higher standard, Are you being real about that?
Is that actually the standard you're holding yourself to?
And if you're not, then that's where they lose respect.
Because the moment you ask more from someone else than you ask from yourself, you lose respect, right.
21:01
And so if it's like, man, it seems so hard to balance all these things.
I think it's true.
That's right.
That is hard.
And that's why most people can't do it.
And that's why most people don't lead, right.
And the degree to which you lead and the size of the organization that you're able to lead or the size of the movement that you're able to lead, I think it's directly proportional to how deep each of those three roots of the triangle run, right?
21:22
How how hard do people think you can go from a fear side?
Like how much judgment day do they think that you can you can dish out?
If it came to it, how much sacrifice from the respect side do they think that you would give to to better the entire community, to better the entire organization?
21:41
What would you give up for not your own self-interest but for the good of the whole right?
Like when we talked to our our gym list community and I, I say like we haven't taken a paycheck and we're putting everything into building what we think is going to be the future of the gym industry.
Like it's not semantics.
21:57
Like we're doing that and it's not doing it to to gain respect.
It's doing it because I think that's what's right and I think that we've been given a lot and to be stewards of that I want, I want to.
Too much has been given much as expected and I think we've been given a shit load so that there's a lot of expectation, right.
22:15
Real quick, guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
22:34
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And if you feel like someone else above you is always expecting more from you than anyone else, right?
And you think about all the things that were given.
I think it shifts your perspective in terms of what is expected of yourself.
22:52
And so that allows you to raise the bar beyond what most humans will be able to be capable of, because it's not from here, right, if that makes sense.
And so the last piece is, is the love piece.
And so how deep does your love run right, for the individuals that are in your organization?
And I think that comes from, like, truly loving people.
23:09
But truly loving people isn't being soft.
You know what I mean?
It's knowing the difference of, like, is this the type of purse?
Because everyone here who has kids, and I don't have kids, but I know that I'm probably going to bother them this way, is like, there's like, I have some, I like the sales team responds very differently than than, you know, than marketing very different, you know, very.
23:31
I've got a bunch of, you know, more creative people there and like, like, they're not the type of people that need, like, fear, you know what I mean?
Because they're like sales people in general tend to be more alpha, more pushed in the envelope always.
And that's good because that's what they need.
23:47
They need that characteristic in order to succeed, right?
But in order to run that team, it needs a very different leader and leadership style than running a marketing team, right?
Which you have to like.
You can't have a lot of creativity in an environment of fear, right?
And so it's balancing the needs of the individual and deeply caring about them in reality because you want what's best for them.
24:09
And sometimes what's best for them is not working for your company and being honest about that with them.
So it's like I care about you.
And in this point in your life, you may or may not believe me, but I know that later on you may gain the perspective to see what I'm doing right now and you'll thank me for it.
24:25
And I can't tell you how many times I've had that conversation with people and then later had them come back and be like you were done on.
Like, I wasn't ready for that at that point.
And I just want to say thanks and and and I think as the leader you have to be willing to not be liked in the moment to do what's right in the larger sense for the individual.
24:44
And sometimes it's doing things that they don't even understand themselves.
And I sometimes I think I I zoom out and I think in context of like the things that I've suffered through in my life and thought in this moment or in that moment I was I struggled a ton with it but then it made me stronger.
Right.
Was it like it it either either like struggles either beat the strength out of you or beat it into you.
25:05
I kind of like that saying.
And so I think that when when you think about those in context, they make us, you know, those experiences make us who we are.
And if we're going to be the person who's delivering those experiences to someone else, you have to do it from a position of love, of truly loving the person and what you what you hope that they can become, whether it's with you, without you.
25:23
And so that's it's like that's the, that's the triad, right.
That's the triad between those three things.
So that you can have the love, the respect and the fear of all of the people in your organization.
So that you can have the loyalty and the sacrifice.
And you and I don't like the word obedience because I think it has a very negative connotation.
25:40
But like in a lot of ways, like the word is obedience.
Like it's, you know, when you, if you have a directive, like, it needs to be followed, right?
And so maybe a better word would be like buy in, you know what I mean?
That would probably be like the socially accepted word.
But like, I like the word obedience because I think I think it carries.
25:58
It's real.
You know what I mean?
It's real.
And a lot of, a lot of obedience also comes from like, I respect you enough, I admire you enough, I admire your achievements.
I admire what you're willing to give up, that I will take what you see and understand that.
26:13
I don't see the whole playing field.
Right, which is why I was really drawn to the military.
And it was a really hard decision.
And ultimately both my parents, like were you know, like we don't want you to go there.
Like they had all their fears and and all that stuff.
But I think I really would have loved the military to be honest with you.
But I just ended up not doing that direction of mind if I have a tremendous amount of respect for it and in those organizations that it's it's it's it's so indoctrinated and so clear to everyone that like, you don't see the greater good, you don't see the whole battlefield, right.
26:43
You see your piece and you need to execute.
And then when that happens, the whole is better.
And that's why military organizations are run off respect right and loyalty because and sacrifice and and and so that like those those characteristics are are more alive because it's mostly a male organization and they understand it better than anyone is that respect is what runs that then right that whole organization is run off respect And so anyways to circle this whole thing back.
27:11
If if you were trying to lead and you're struggling to lead and you're struggling to get the respect and ultimately the obedience and the execution and the buy in from your team.
When you need to make the hard calls about the business or about changes that happen.
Look at those three and think which of these am I lacking.
27:30
Am I lacking the enforcement from the fear side.
Have I set expectations and said this is where we need to go and then not followed through and not had repercussions when we didn't hit it?
Did Have I?
Have I?
Have I been asking.
So from a respect standpoint, have I been asking things of other people that I wouldn't do myself or that they don't believe that I would do myself?
27:49
Am I?
Am I like, am I willing to sacrifice or asking them to sacrifice things that I'm not sacrificing for respect for love?
Do the people that are in my organization feel like I genuinely care about them in a deep sense, not on a peripheral coddling sense, but like really, truly care about the individual, which sometimes means doing things that aren't fun for them because you care about their greater good and not just the moment?
28:11
And so I think that if you look at those three things, you'll be able to dissect your leadership style and be able to see where the deficiencies are in where you have and then kind of go through that respect playbook to get to where you want to go.
So anyways, I hope this is valuable for you.
This was just like I this melting pot of all these different concepts in my head that that kind of came together to this.
28:30
You know, if you found this valuable through a like through a comment, I'd love to have your opinion if you if you like some of the stuff or you like, like more of this kind of direction.
I don't talk about leadership a ton.
I talk way more about like, you know, business and money stuff.
But I think that it's important and I think that it underlies being able to execute anything is because after it's not you anymore and you have a team, then you have an entire team of people that you have to get to do what is best for the business.
28:54
And the way to do that is through leading.

Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
Hey guys, what's going on?
Happy Thursday, thought I would make four days in a row of content.
I know I've been been going cray cray on the content train but I think I don't know idea.
Why I It's just because my calories or up in like I have more juice in my brain.
0:35
But anyways, this thoughts came to me today and it was, I'm always in conversations with our sales, team and whatnot.
And I thought that and I was reading through our gym lunch group, and I thought that it would be really useful for some of you guys to kind of hear, one of the lessons that took me a really long time to learn.
0:53
And so, I totaled this, what separates the best from the rest and what the best salespeople and best baseball players have in common and so A lot of times people think that in getting, and this is something that I used to think for a long time was that, like, the best salespeople knew something that I did that I didn't know or had some like secret technique that I wasn't aware of.
1:14
And that if I only learned the secret words of the secret questions that I needed to ask, then I would get more people to buy my stuff, right?
And the further up, we've gone and it's weird.
When when I I've always considered myself a student of sales to then have people like, you know, Russell Brunson who's considered a very good salesperson to say like this is his words that I was the best salesperson you'd ever seen and that like a whole bunch of other nice things.
1:45
And so like, it makes you really introspective and I don't think that I know anything that's fundamentally different than most people.
And so I had to like, think like what is it that separates the best at a certain skill even owning a business from the rest, right?
And so, if you look at like baseball players and salespeople, what's interesting is that the best salespeople and the best baseball players.
2:07
It's not that they really do anything different than mediocre salespeople or mediocre baseball players.
It's just that they consistently do really well.
And so like they have these routines that they get themselves in so that they can get consistent.
2:25
That's why they have the same dance.
The same approach.
They were the same socks, right?
When you're in sales.
You have the same and like if you're going through our sales training like it should just it should be just like a foul shot for basketball players.
Should be just like when you're approaching the plate, every single conversation, your setup should be the same because you want to have the perfect swing, right?
2:44
You know how to have the swing.
And so all you want to do is maximize your chances of having the outcome that you're looking for, which for baseball would be, you know, connecting and getting a hit and for a salesperson it might be closing the sale.
Now, how does that concept apply to running your business, right?
2:59
Right.
What is one of the most successful businesses out there that's been brick-and-mortar, right, McDonald's.
Okay.
I'm just throwing it out there because they are and a lot of people would argue that McDonald's food is really, not that spectacular, but what it is is consistent.
3:15
And so, if you don't think that consistency consistency in and of itself is a valuable thing than, like, look at the landscape of competition that's out there.
Being consistent is one of the most highly value things in the marketplace.
Well from your customers to you.
And then also from you to your employees.
3:32
So if you are a trainer right now, who works at one of the gyms that's in this group, like you're the person who employs you values consistency over hot streets, I'm just telling you like if I knew that every day I could always count on someone to be on time, it always show up and do an 8 out of 10 class.
3:49
That's what you call someone who is Dependable break.
That becomes a rock in your business.
They become one of the cornerstones that you can build your business off of no one likes the prima donna, that's hot for a week and then code for a week and then hot for a week and then cold for a week like it takes tons of attention.
4:04
You know, that that's the entrepreneurial golden resource, right?
So now this person is taking tons of your attention.
And if you were that person in anybody's business use in here, then understand that that is you are, you are taking value from the business by not being consistent.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world kidding.
4:30
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
4:47
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
Right?
And so a lot of that now, like how do you get consistent?
What's the how to, in terms of getting consistent?
We were quoted at one of the events that we said, because someone said, I just don't like you speak with such conviction.
5:03
I want to be able to speak with that same level of conviction, when I'm talking to prospects and I didn't really think much about it.
I just, I looked at the lady and I was just like, you have to outwork yourself doubt and like everyone.
Like just like started, like, writing it down and I thought about it later, but like, Conviction.
5:21
Just comes from repetition, it's time under the bar, right?
Like you get better at squatting by squatting more, you can talk about how great your form is.
You can do all your mental practice, but at the end of the day, you got to get under the bar.
And if you want to get good at sales, you got to do repetitions, right?
Like and you got to get better.
5:36
And then what happens is if like it's just like chess players when they're looking at the board, the best chess players, it's not like, they necessarily have better skills.
They just recognize patterns faster.
They're like I've had this conversation before.
I know what to say, right here.
And then It becomes subconscious confidence like you don't need like a lot of times making that sale for most people especially like the All-Star salespeople in the beginning.
5:59
You have to try really hard to just remember what questions to ask, right?
And and then later like it starts having a little bit more naturally and then it starts to the point where like you're not even there, you're zoning out and your mouth is, is asking the question that would naturally lead to the next pain point because you've done this so many times.
6:17
You've seen the situation so many times you.
In this pitch so many times, you've outworked that you've outworked your level of shittiness, right?
So, like, there is no shortcut to it, but the only way to get consistent is to be able to recognize patterns and when you recognize patterns, and you can do so quickly, you become really good and by being really good.
6:38
It's not that you're exceptional in any way.
You just really good on a regular basis and you never suck, right?
You just don't have cold streaks.
The best people just know how to always be on.
That's all it is.
It is right, like Michael drip, like, Michael Jordan's games was not like, like, sure.
6:54
He had a couple of, like, big games that are memorable.
But there were guys who like consistently score more points, they just consistently score more.
So what it like their averages are not brought up by the one or two, or three games that everyone remembers is the fact that they just do a little bit better all the time, right?
7:10
They know how to like everyone else.
Like when the mediocre players have a hot streak, that's what the best players do every day.
And the only thing they do is they know how to Get that hot streak on a consistent basis, and so if you don't have process around what you do, right?
7:26
Or what you practice, like, we live the same day every single day.
Like I'm not, like I'm not joking.
Like we have this thing, like boring makes you money, boring makes you rich boring makes you money.
Boarding makes you money because boring makes you consistent.
And when born in each, you consistent, you have a consistent outcomes.
7:44
And when you can control the variables right, then you can, then you can tweak things to get Actly.
What you want on the outside, right?
Like we always go to bed no matter what weekends Friday, Saturday, Sunday days, whatever.
Always at 9:30, we are always up F by six.
8:00
Sometimes we wake up early just because but like, we're always up by six, we're always done training by 9 a.m.
And then after that, we eat for the next 30 minutes, and then Layla goes and showers and then I muddled around and then either decide to shower, or I get on here and I make some pots thing, right?
8:17
Like that's like that's the day.
Hop on The Daily huddle like the things are repetitive, it's the same thing every day.
And so if you want to get better, you just got to.
You have to, you don't need to get better.
You need to do the good things consistently.
And so, tag, your team members who were like, man, I really wish I could be good at sales.
8:35
Like you probably already know what you need to do.
You just need to do it more times and so that also can look at like if you look at sales training, right?
Like the people who do the who are the best at sales in all of the gym, Lords tend to be the people who went through the training the most times.
It's not an acquisition of information thing.
8:52
It's how readily accessible is that same fundamental information to you, Pause.
It's not about getting more information, it's about having the information that is useful.
Readily accessible to you when you recognize patterns, right?
9:10
That's how it is.
Then to, if you go through sales training every single morning, you will get better at sales faster because you will be able to recognize patterns faster, right?
When you can recognize patterns faster, you go from conscious competence to unconscious competence.
You don't even have to think about it in your good.
9:26
And then that is when you go from having Spotty where you're consciously competent and then obviously, you don't Focus one day and then it means you're not confident, and then you're focusing again.
And then you're confident, then you're not competent, right?
To the point where you don't need to focus on it and you're really good.
And then, at that point, you can consistently great.
9:44
That's how you get good.
That's the best baseball players do it.
And what do they do?
They put time under the bar.
They see more pitches.
They see more swings.
They play more chess matches right?
Don't they do there's no secret but it's consistency that the outcome, that's what people mistake.
It's like, oh it's because you some Superstar, it's never that it's just that you can consistently elicit, the outcome that you're looking for, whatever skill it is.
10:06
So anyways, I thought this might be useful for you or some of your teammates.
Are you have a sales manager who's hot and Old maybe tagged him in here because it's not about learning what things to say, or what to recognize it's about.
Seeing how you can consistently execute the same thing over and over and over again.
10:23
And if you don't have a pre foul shot, you know, dance and if you don't have a little pre, you know, you step up to the plate routine then you're leaving your outcomes up to more chance than they should be go.
Anyways, dudes.
10:39
And dudettes.
Sorry, have an amazing week.
I have to Upon my daily call with all my team.
So I gotta jump literally right now.
That's a lot of.
I'll catch you guys soon.
Tag on your sales managers out.
All right.









0:00
What do we really want to do?
Like, what's the actual impact?
If at the end of our lives we have something that is a shining beacon of a different way to do business, that to me is something worth fighting for.
What's on deck for today?
I am working on the book.
0:21
You know what's going to happen when everyone sees this moment?
Right, what they're going to be.
Like when's the?
Book coming out.
What?
What do you have to say?
Oh.
What are we?
Talking oh, I don't know what is it?
We can mention it.
We can just like, insert it casually in this blog.
0:39
That's a pretty big deal, honestly.
They just found out for the first time.
That's right.
I get some messages that are, like, offended.
They're like, yo, what the fuck?
Where's the like I need some leads, bro.
Give me real.
Quick this is really the first time we're kind of seeing you in the morning and you're not meditating, you're not journaling, you're not doing the red lights on it.
1:00
Oh, I mean I should normally I have like a three hour routine just so that I'm capable to function as a human being.
I have a long affirmation routine that I do.
There's a wall mirror over there that I just, that's where I just say them to myself.
You're amazing.
1:16
You're fantastic.
People love you.
Comments don't mean anything.
Like is it decaf is.
It this is decaf.
All decaf.
Yeah.
Wow.
So you drink it just because you like.
The flavor, actually, I drink whatever Leila usually drinks because it's easier for me to just be like too.
1:38
If someone gets plastic surgery right of any kind, the real reel is that like either say nothing or be positive about it because they can't change it.
Like you wouldn't say that to somebody who didn't have their nose changed, but the the the feature is still permanent.
1:56
I had one guy message me and he started commenting on all my posts and he was like evil, horrible, all this shit.
And then I like, looked in my inbox and he was like messaging.
And he was like, you don't want what's best for us, because if you really did, you would give us the name of your plastic surgeon.
He's like, you want us all to be poor and ugly.
2:13
He was.
Like you just don't want us.
There are days where like Layla would be not in as good of a mood and I would try and be like, hey, what can I do?
Like, let me do these things and she would still stay in a kind of a bad mood.
And so then what would happen is I would then get stern and be like, all right, do your own thing.
2:29
And what would happen is that she would then step out of it as soon as I got mean.
And so then what she taught me is that if I am mean, she will stop being in a bad mood, whatever, right?
As soon as you start having punishment and reward as as things in your in your dialect and thinking what happens afterwards.
2:48
Kids cry, parent gives them a cookie and you now teach them to cry, to get cookies.
Like it's just like so simple.
And the other piece is if you reward too long afterwards, you still teach them something but not what you intended.
A parent, for example, Fast forward has a teenager who sneaks out of the house, right?
3:06
And then they come back in the middle of the night, and then as soon as they walk in the door, they punish them.
And So what happens?
You punish a kid for coming home and then they're surprised the kid doesn't want to come home.
Well, what's your day looking like?
What?
3:22
What's?
What's on the agenda?
Leadership meeting, pipeline review book meeting and I have a biweekly with two of our teammates that I try and do with some of the non executive team.
And you do that every day you try and block up until like noon or one.
3:38
Yeah, and then Layla's been doing such a good job though, that there are more days where I just have nothing on my calendar at all, which is awesome and amazing.
Why do you?
Like having nothing on your.
Calendar.
I just.
I just have more time to work.
Farewell.
3:56
Farewell, my love.
Sweet queen.
Little guy for a guy, you want a little, you want a little guy, right?
Where to start the day?
You can see my little, my little workstation.
I've got my iPad, which is where I draw my stuff.
I've got earplugs, I've got my Nicorat, my work timer going.
4:16
So I actually don't use it all the time.
It's more during the week because people ping me.
I'll just set my timer for really how long I think something's going to take and then I'll hit it and I just keep it right, like in plain sight.
And that works really well.
So interesting combo is if you go headphones, earmuffs, nicotine, caffeine and like work and a timer.
4:36
I've yet to find like a better combination of productivity use.
If useful, I.
Really realized I would love to do with acquisition.com is be able to build acquisition.com to whatever, a billion, 10 billion reading with praise, not punishment.
4:59
If we could really do this and then teach other CEOs how to do this, that's something worthwhile doing.
And it's not like anybody else.
But on the same side, we have our mission, which is to make real business education available to everybody.
There's often 2 visions in a company.
5:15
There's the internal vision, which is much more relevant to the team and the employees and the vendors and everyone that you touch and even the customers.
And then there's the external vision, which is like how are we affecting the greater community that is affected by acquisition.com?
And I think that we actually really have.
5:32
As we've clarified, this conversation has been an ongoing dialogue between Leila and I of like, what do we really want to do?
Like, what's the actual impact at the end of our lives?
We have something that is a shining beacon of a different way to do business that is more profitable by building something bigger and better, but do it our way, which is praise over punishment.
5:50
That, to me, is something worth fighting for.
It just takes more skill because when someone messes up, all you want to do is punish them.
How can I not do that and then get the desired result?
We will define somebody who is motivated by reward or reinforcement as someone who is, who utilizes all of their discretionary effort.
6:10
So if there's the level of effort that is required to not get fired and then all the effort above that is discretionary effort In a business that is based on punishment, people will go to the law of least effort, which is as little as they can do to not get fired.
So if you have a business that's based on that, then how do you get higher performance?
6:27
Well, look at McKinsey, look at Goldman Sachs.
They'll get a lot of the PE industry.
You raise the bar.
And So what happens is you get really high performers who are the only ones who can perform in that in that place.
And they are driven by anxiety.
They're stressed out of their minds.
They drink, they do drugs, they get hooked on porn, whatever it is right to, to deal with the stressors in their life.
6:45
But you just move the bar.
And so the alternative is a world where everybody is working even harder than that because the law of of least effort, there's still people that are so talented that they can work medium and not get fired, but you lose out on all of the discretionary effort that they would be putting in if they felt that they were being reinforced in a safe place.
7:06
And so that's the kind of environment that we're trying to build.
I'm not saying we're perfect, we will mess up.
But that's that's I think something that's worth fighting for.
I really.
Think that we have a shot at like fully embodying these principles.
I mean, that could change so many good people.
'S lives So fun story.
7:22
One of our team mates went to an event and was rocking an acquisition.com trip.
Now, they're not for sale, obviously, and many people came up to him, asked him to take pictures with him, invited him out for drinks, invited him out for food to portions of it that he wasn't allowed to go into, but he was able to because he was wearing that shirt.
7:41
So how does that happen?
They read a book that gives them value.
They're reinforced and rewarded for that thing.
And then when they do the stuff from the book, they associate the rewards they get from that with the book, the book they associate with me.
And then they see me in all the videos and all the content with this thing.
7:59
And so eventually you remove me and you just keep the thing and you associate that thing with all these good feelings, all this reward.
And so then someone else wears the shirt and then they feel the same way towards that person simply because they have associated so many good things with that and that is branding.
8:19
And yes, let's switch the pipeline that would allow us to do that kind of vision of the 49 or 51 for new companies, just adding them straight to kind of like our top line, bottom line, that would be a huge move.
What?
Was that what was that?
Meeting that.
We were just.
8:35
In those are pipeline review.
So it's looking at the companies at different stages in the deal process and you know mind you of people who even get to this level, 95% of deals we don't do.
It's just because we're looking for a lot of very specific things and it's not just necessarily like is the company valuable, but like can we add value to the company.
8:52
Fundamentally there's two schools of investing, there's bettors and builders.
So bettors are like, can I find a mispriced company that I will Simply put money in at less than its intrinsic value and then hope that it will grow over time.
That's kind of like the Warren Buffett style.
Probably the vast majority of investors are that way.
9:08
And then there are builders to have like a unique set of skills in their hold code that they could try and templatize those kind of like SOPS, those playbooks and just deploy them into the companies knowing that they're going to triple 5X10X the companies that they have.
9:23
Private equity is usually a combination of both those things.
I would say that we lean towards the building side of like we're not trying to be like amazing pickers.
We just try and find companies that we know our playbooks will immediately 10X and then try and work with them.
Who's who's texting my wife?
9:39
Gosh, I'm pumped because in the in the new place I will be able to fit my entire wardrobe in my bedside table.
Oh yeah, we'll show Leila's entire closet and then I'll pull out my 2 drawers with beaters and shorts.
It'll be great.
Why are you so obsessed about that stuff?
Well, I will say this.
9:57
I don't know why I know that I am.
I have become more that way because it's probably been reinforced.
The more obsessive I am about, like iterating things until they're like just right, the more rewarded I get.
Trevor's saying that, like, he's alarmed by the number of people that he has worked with who do not read well.
10:15
He said we need to teach them to read.
He got a kid who was struggling to stay focused and so he came to train the kid with a bag of Skittles.
The kid would read 3 words and he would give him a skittle.
But if he read 4 words, because if his previous best was three, he would give him two Skittles.
So we reinforced him doing it every time.
10:33
He had a bigger reinforcement for when every time he hit a new record.
So if he read a full line, he would give him more.
By the end of the first session, he had them reading entire pages.
Hello.
Hey, who are we talking to?
So we're doing this whole vlog thing.
So we're we're capturing day in the life, the very, you know, the high energy life of the CEO who lives in a closet.
10:57
Yeah, I mean like I don't see an issue with translating into more languages like that doesn't bother me.
Then we just have more people who get the book.
Can they do Mandarin or Japanese or Portuguese?
Portuguese would be big German.
I got a lot of DMS after I showed the French one.
So that was a meeting with my book manager who also happens to be my father-in-law.
11:16
So we have massively improved our relationship since the first time I stole his daughter, told her to quit everything to join me to gallivant across the country, living in motels six weeks after we met.
But yeah, he runs everything with the book, so we have a French and a Spanish version out and then looking at other languages that we want to translate it into and looking at publishing and printing firms in Germany and Italy.
11:37
So that's kind of what that that meeting was about.
We got different versions of the books as they progressed over time from different printers that I could see the the print quality.
Just so you guys know, I don't go to 1 printer, I go to a bunch of them and make sure that the book quality is good.
And if you're like, well, why are you even dealing with this rather than going on publisher?
11:55
Because publishers don't want you to give away your book for free.
And so I, you know, Uncle Alex puts the bill, I'll have probably a million, I'll add it up probably like a million too, into this book negative.
I mean that's why most publishing companies will front the money.
12:12
And I would have done that with this book, just so you guys know, except if I had done it with this book, it wouldn't be out until spring of 24.
Like it has to be 100% done nine months before you actually get it.
I finished this and then it I'm releasing it 16 weeks after it was done and that's because 12 weeks is printing.
12:33
If I wanted to just do like drop ship real time printing and then wanted everyone to wait forever, I would do it that way.
But it's also way more expensive to print that way.
And you know the books fund Mozi Media, which is really So you guys know where did the dollars go from the, from my $2.99 books that I get a dollar from that goes to goes to the team so we can put out more stuff for you guys.
12:55
Tobias, what's up man?
Tell me your most painful moment painful stuff act.
I mean like cutting my eyeball.
That sucked.
I took sales calls still.
So, yeah, there you go.
Yeah, perfect.
13:11
I would just get your opinion on facing the sales issue.
Here's what's crazy is that if the other guy gets up to 40 a double sales.
I think that if I had a two prong approach, get a good salesman in there and then double the throughput on the webinar, I'd say like that's a 4X if we double double.
Sometimes people ask why don't you make videos like you used to?
13:29
Why?
Why the change?
Why all the editing?
The new thumbnails?
All that shit?
More people see it.
I mean, it's just that we see the comments.
This actually reminds me of a story that you told me.
But like whenever a band goes from like a small town to like they go, they go bigger audience, they go more mass market.
13:47
People are like the band selling out or whatever it is.
But the reality is that like the band morphs into the thing that reaches the most people.
And so if you believe in the message that you have, then packaging it in a way that allows the most people to consume it, if you believe in what you want to get out there, as long as it doesn't dilute the the core message, which I don't think us editing more heavily and having higher produced videos does, just gets more people to see it.
14:12
And so here's The thing is that everyone in Mosey Nation votes with their clicks and their eyeballs about the things they find most interesting.
And so you train me to make the content that I have.
So if y'all in general like the webcam only thing more than I would be making more of that.
14:35
But you train me with your clicks and your watches of the things that you care the most about and so we make more of those things.
So in many ways you guys control the content and to all the day one home is appreciate.
Y'all.
And many of you guys were like at 5K, we're like, dude, this guy's going to be in a million.
And it's true, I got there.
14:51
But it was just because you guys appreciate you guys sharing, commenting, send it to your friends, all that kind of stuff.
I feel really confident in saying that.
Like in two years you will laugh at what we are putting out right now.
I know, I certainly will.
There are some things that are going to get released that are going to blow what we are doing out of the water.
15:10
We like to say we think in decades, not days, but I think you can just watch and see if if we're full of it or not.








0:00
People overthink a lot.
They use overthinking as a proxy for action, and it just isn't.
They think that they're being productive by thinking more about the business they want to start rather than just starting it.
You can boil all of this down to fear of rejection.
People are OK with failing.
They're just not OK with other people seeing them fail.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:23
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
How often?
And I want a serious answer to this question, OK, how often do you look at yourself in the mirror and you flex both biceps?
How often do you do it?
Probably a few times an hour a.
Few times an hour.
I think you need to increase those numbers.
0:40
Might have to.
That's ridiculous.
Is your workout split?
I'm guessing it's the same thing as it was last time.
Haven't changed.
It's been a decade.
So can you just walk us through real quick?
If I want a body like you, what is the split?
Yeah.
Give me 30 days.
You know we should split.
Do I?
We should.
Preface it by saying this.
How much do you charge for your time?
0:57
Really, What is one hour of your time worth?
I don't.
Know I would probably wouldn't do anything for less than 50 grand. 50 grand for like just like hanging out for advice. 50 grand an hour, probably.
About right so if this is a 2 hour podcast.
Just being is like 202 Fifty.
Let's just say for if someone wants your advice, 50 grand an hour if this podcast is 2 hours long.
1:18
Yeah.
Whoever's watching this is theoretically getting $100,000 of value just by listening to this.
So I just want to preface it by saying stick around for the episode.
You're getting a lot of value from this.
Wow, that was fantastic.
1:33
Now, how often do you go in the mirror and just flex?
I mean really, when there's a reflective surface, I'll definitely give it a whatever's convenient.
It might be a calf, might be a calf flex.
It could be a tricep flex.
Sometimes it might be a double front, right?
I would say mostly to other people.
It's one of these.
1:48
I'll throw one of those up all the time that.
Would be intimidating, like if you want to thwart off an enemy, it's just.
Just like a bear.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, like at the gym for sure.
Like I'll I'll flex on Layla all the time.
That's good.
I want to know because I've heard from other people, people that are like larger, bigger, muscular, tall, like they other people will feel threatened by these people.
2:09
So they'll try to instigate some sort of fight, 'cause it's like an alpha mentality.
You feel like you've been threatened by some massive dude.
Do people come up to you and do you feel like you've been instigated in something?
Not really, never.
So that that's just a farce.
I think I don't give off a lot of like, let's fight energy.
2:25
You don't think so?
No, 'cause, I mean, it'd be really hard because if someone's like you, man, I'd be like, you're right.
Yeah, you just don't.
Care.
Maybe.
Like you're a piece of shit.
I'm like, probably like, I agree.
This is where I wanna be at that level of undeniable Just confidence.
2:42
Just raw confidence, OK?
And I didn't even think it's.
Confidence.
Yeah.
I appreciate it translated that way, but I it's.
Just not having anything that that.
Bothers you, but comfort with oneself, right?
Well, it's like if someone comments on a post and they're like, Alex, you're an asshole.
I'm like, you're right, OK?
2:59
Cause a lot of it's like I wanna put a lot of effort in to try and like, make them wrong.
Like, why?
Hey, I'm not gonna change their mind at all anyways.
But like, the flip side is, why is that such a bad thing?
Like why is that not?
OK, Someone's like, you're an asshole.
I've been in it many times in my life.
I'm sure.
3:14
I'm sure I have.
And so, like, they're right, OK?
It's just like there's just not like, oh, I've noticed that I've, I can end a lot of these things.
Like there's no endless loop when someone's like, you should have done this, this and this.
I'm like you're right.
So what personality traits do you think are negative 'cause you're saying being an asshole necessarily is not a negative thing, where I would say by definition it kind of is.
3:34
It could be, yeah.
I mean, it's just, it's all because we think that's somehow good or bad, you know what I mean?
And I think there's just like all of us have lots of different aspects to who we are.
And I think at different times in our lives we've been really impatient.
We've been really patient.
We've been really nice.
We've been really mean.
Like, I've had many of those things.
And then if we're really gonna say I have a character trait, it's like, to what degree do I have that trait?
3:51
Like, it's not a binary.
It's not like are you patient or not patients?
How patient are you?
And so for me, it's just like a lot of people get really upset around someone calling them a name because they think that having that label ascribed to them by this one individual somehow means something.
And it's like I just don't think it means anything.
4:09
I think that's because you have this security.
Now, I could be projecting, but I would say most people, if they are insulted, if the insult is valid to some capacity and picks at their insecurity, then they respond and they react and they deny and they.
Take it personally.
4:25
Exactly.
That's all it is.
It's having that affect them, yeah, but I think that's just being affected by outside influence.
Like for you, you're very just self assured.
It's just like your reality is your reality.
Someone else tells you otherwise.
It doesn't matter to you.
It's like someone telling you you have blue hair and you're like, no, I don't, right?
4:41
To your point, this is a really fun little Side Story.
So I was walking with Layla on the strip and some guy bumped into her or something and he was like, watch yourself, skinny bitch.
Like you said that to her and she was like, you think I'm skinny.
4:57
And so it's like she said it like half jokingly to me afterwards.
Not anything, she just we just obviously kept walking.
But I thought it was such an interesting things that he meant it as an insult.
She chose to take it as a compliment, which then meant that, like, all of the, like, these things that we toss at one another, it's like, it's only because we choose to accept that it's an insult that it becomes insulting.
5:19
Like, I'm sure someone at some point in your life has said something that they intended to insult you with and you're like, oh, well, it's not that's not that bad.
I'm actually kind of OK with that.
It's like, well, if I'm if I can make that thing OK one time, then I can do that every time because it's literally just a choice on how I want to perceive it.
So you can obscure the intentions of other people to, even if it's not necessarily the way that they intended it.
5:38
I have no idea what their intention is.
None.
I don't know what their psychology is.
I don't know what their affirmations are.
I don't know what they say anymore.
Like I don't think they wanted to hurt me.
I don't know if they wanted to help me.
Just doesn't.
Like all I can know is like I can observe fact, which is they said this OK now what?
Like they said these words to me, OK?
5:54
You know what?
For people that aren't familiar with you, because I bet there's a subset of the audience right now is like, who is this guy?
Is he a personal trainer?
Yes.
Tell people why.
Why they should listen to you.
You definitely, absolutely should not listen to me.
First and foremost got into the fitness industry.
6:10
I started a gym, opened a chain of gyms, had six, Sold those six locations in Southern California when I was 26 years old.
Started my first time when I was 23, took the IP from that, started doing gym turnarounds, flew around the country, did 30 something turnarounds.
From there, I really got the system dialed and then I started licensing it out and over the next five or six years, we got up to 5000 locations license our model and our company called Gym Launch.
6:30
I started a supplement company called Prestige Labs, which sold through that distribution base of gyms.
They sold our supplements kind of specifically made for gym owners.
There's a lot of benefits we made specifically for gyms.
And then I started a software company called Allen in 2020 that was also to work brick and mortar leads because that's one of the big issues that a lot of brick and mortar business owners do is they like they get a phone call or they get a text and no one responds.
6:48
And so they just lose business for no reason.
So we want to solve that problem too.
All three of those businesses we chose to exit in 2021.
Two of them we sold together to American Pacific Group for 46.2 million in an all cash deal SL 2/3 of excuse me and then the software company.
We did an entirely stock sale SL 275% of that company.
7:07
And then starting into 2022 we started our family office formally.
Up to that point, my wife and I had made private investments into three companies that had done really, really well.
And we done well enough with that that we said, you know, we'll take all the dividends and distributions we've taken up to that point plus the liquidation event that we had from American Pacific Group.
7:24
And we said let's start our family office, which is acquisition.com.
And so we start with three companies and now over the last, you know, however long that portfolio in total does over $200 million a year.
And I started making content on the Internet with the intention to help as many people get into business as humanly possible, because I don't have a lot of faith in the larger institutions.
7:43
And so I think that if we're going to solve our problems, we need to do it for ourselves.
And I think entrepreneurship is one of those paths in order to do that.
Don't necessarily need to be an entrepreneur, but just getting involved in businesses and private enterprise in general, I think is the most efficient way that we can allocate the resources of humanity to solve humanity's problems.
And what do you say acquisition.com does exactly?
8:01
We buy companies usually 49% or more of a business and then we basically inject our expertise and capital into the business to grow it.
And so we have to have a combination of do we like this business on its own, Do we think that we are a really good unique partner that can add a huge amount of like basically do we have an unfair advantage with this deal in terms of value creation, Not just like that, we have proprietary deal flow because that's why I make the content I do.
8:27
But do we actually have a real way of like do we see a 10X that we can like implement and execute on.
And so that's a lot of our kind of our front end diligence is OK.
This might be a good business, but it's not our perfect business to work on.
And so we try and find those deals where it's just like there's no way we can lose and we try to do those.
Deals.
How do you tell if there's a 10X?
8:43
What do you look for?
What sort of qualities do you see?
So it's actually just looking the business like a pipeline.
So it's like basically you just have to understand everything from Click to close to renewal.
And so every business more or less is like you have eyeballs that at some point get converted into leads or they can convert it into customers.
So if it's leads and they have eventually have to get a scheduled appointment, they have to show, they have to close and then on the back end once they are closed, they have to get a product delivered or service delivered and then they have to buy again and again or get up sold into other things, right.
9:09
So if we look at that, we can see breakages along that line because that would be something that would get in diligence just like OK, what are the click through rates on the ads?
What are the CPMS on the ads?
What are the conversion rates on the pages?
What percentage are scheduling, what percentage are showing, what percentage are closing, What's the average offer rate, What percentage are we collecting cash upfront, What's the average close rate on the back end?
9:25
Like, how many dropouts do we have in the first 48 hours after that?
What does it look like over the next 12 months or 24 months for those customers?
What percentage are ascending to the next level of service?
And so if we look at that and we have our benchmarks for what we think we can do with the processes that we have already tested, then we're like, OK, well, these guys are getting 30% of their appointments to show up and we know that we can get that to 80.
9:44
It's OK.
Well, there's a 2 1/2 X, OK, boom, there's one.
And we're like, OK, I think they're mispriced on this offer.
And I think we can at least double this.
It's like, OK, well, there's 5X.
You got 2 1/2 and two.
They're like, OK.
And right now they're not doing anything to reduce their churn.
They're at 10%.
And I think we can get them to three.
10:00
So there's a triple.
And so we're like, OK, so that's 15X.
What's our confidence score in terms of like our likelihood that we'll be able to implement these changes?
Is it like a super big overhaul or is it just like there's a handful of things that we can implement immediately see that the easier it is, the more likely we'll want to do it.
And so, like, I just bought a chain of teeth whitening students with 32 locations who just bought.
10:19
And I just got so excited because I saw their sales process and I was like.
I'm going to.
It's a very interesting business.
Oh, very interesting.
I've seen a lot of this direct to consumer products though that you see that you get on the subscription and they just send you.
I actually I have a whole bunch from Ollie from I think that was an Alpha M product.
10:37
Alpha M yeah.
Well, I saw their sales process and was like, I could make this like we literally could just change a handful of things around here, switch it from one time to membership, make these packages based on these price points, have an intake questionnaire, you know, like do some of the things that we already know, work over and over and over again.
10:54
And we 5X the LTV of the customer, So 5X how much people were worth to the business.
And so it's like, great, well, there's a 5X, then all I have to do is just double the locations over the next five years.
I got to 10X.
Great.
And then what do you do once you do that?
Is it just collecting cash or is it to eventually then sell that business?
It depends on the the next one it.
11:10
Depends on the business, I would say.
There definitely aren't like I used to give, probably like I always wanted to hold everything forever.
But I think there are times where businesses get to a point where the next like increment of growth requires like an order of magnitude in terms of effort that it's not worth.
Or we might determine, you know what, we're good cashing out on this one.
11:27
Like we might not be the right partners or like we might not be the right owners to take it from here to there.
It also just depends on what's on the horizon.
If it's like, you know, interest rates are super.
I mean, I sold literally everything I owned in 2021 because money was free.
And so I was like, I sold my house, I sold my cars, I sold all three of my companies, I sold everything.
I was just completely cash because it just it just seemed ridiculous what people were willing to pay.
11:46
So I was like OK and so if like something like that comes along, but I would be considered someone wants to.
If someone wants to buy it more than I want to own it, then I always I always entertain offers.
So in hindsight, it seems like you made a pretty good deal by selling everything somewhat at the peak of the market.
I think you cashed out the market, kept going up a little bit and then it's, yeah, amazing time.
12:02
And then I think you were in contract to buy a house, weren't you?
And then you backed out of it and also fantastic time.
Yeah.
So things have worked out pretty OK on the timing of that and I would not like.
So it wasn't like, I think I'm timing the market.
It was just more like this makes sense.
Like this is a deal that I will accept.
12:18
And on the flip side, when you're buying it, like I don't know if this is a deal I want to do.
And this is more like that unless you have like an absolute need, which I would say on the flip side, like if you need a house, buy a house.
You know what I mean?
Like if you like, whatever.
If you need an office for your company, like buy an office, because you're going to make more than trying to time the market perfectly, at least in my opinion.
12:34
Yeah.
So, So what are you doing now strategically, do you think that things are going to be getting better?
What What are you holding on to like?
Where do you place your importance today?
I focus all my stuff on the things I can control honestly like I actually spend a laughably small amount of time on like the economy and interest rates and things that are happening right now.
12:51
Like I spend almost no time on it.
Like the only time that I will think about that stuff is just to what degree will that affect our businesses.
And like the only way that those things have affected our business is just that some of our businesses require financing or like use financing for consumer purchases.
Like you're buying a car, you sometimes you use financing and so the the interest rates on the loans that they're getting are higher.
13:10
So their actual payments are higher.
And so that affects sales and the average ticket that you can sell for those those businesses.
But then to what degree do I control that?
It's more that I'm aware of it and we do our best to mitigate those things.
One thing I do want to talk about before we go into a lot of the other subjects is $100 million leads.
Yeah, I watched that and was blown away at that presentation.
13:28
Thanks.
How many people did you have watching at that time?
We.
Had 188,000 people Click to go live.
How much work went into that presentation?
A lot to me this was, it was structured in such a way where I'm listening to you and I'm thinking, how could I use this in my own life?
Because it was that incredible.
13:45
Every slide and every way you framed it was like you're getting this positive feedback loop by saying because you're here, it worked.
And because it works, you should listen to me because all these people are here because it works.
14:00
And it was incredible how you pitch this.
So walk us through exactly what $100 million leads is.
Yeah.
So it's the sequel to the first book, $100 million offers, which was the purpose of that book was to answer the question, what should I sell?
So like the first thing, people were trying to get an entrepreneurship.
14:16
They're like, what should I sell?
Like I'm trying to figure out like what I'm They asked the question, what business should I start with.
The question they really should ask is what should I be selling or who should I be selling it to?
And so offers answered that question is what I'm going to sell.
Leads answers the second question, which I almost just gave away, which is who do I sell it to?
Do you need leads?
And so once you figure out what to sell, you have to go find those people and you can force people to find you through advertising.
14:36
And so I split test the name six or seven different times.
And so the book is about advertising, but leads beat advertising in the split test.
So it's $100 leads, but it's basically how do you let other people know about your stuff?
And so there are eight ways that you can let people know about stuff for that you can do on your own for that you need other people for.
And so the book basically details step by step how to do each of the 8.
14:55
And fundamentally, if you're getting into business, you only need to do one of them and do them well.
And if you do more than one, then awesome.
Now I specifically have used all eight in my life for a variety of businesses.
And for the book launch, I purposely like the Offers book, wanted it to be a meta concept, meaning the Offers book was $0.99 and it came with a course and all of that.
15:15
And it was, it was all basically free, but it was an offer so good, people feel stupid saying no.
And so, like the book itself was an example of what it taught leads, was about getting leads and advertising.
And so I wanted to demonstrate all the things in the book to advertise the book.
Like there was a book on Amazon, I think I used in the presentation that said how to market a book.
15:32
It was like 4 years old and had fourteen reviews.
I'm like, I don't need to read this book to know that you have no idea how to market a book.
I have proof in front of me that you have no idea how to market a book because if you did know how to market a book, this wouldn't have 14 reviews.
And so if I was going to have a book about how to advertise, like, I better be good at advertising.
And so I thought that the event would be a great demonstration of that.
15:50
To show that these stuff I purposely because I wanted because I knew people would come back later to it, I purposely used literally step by step what like I didn't go outside of the book.
So like the ads that I wrote for the book, I used the templates in the book to write the ads for the book.
Like the content that I made for the book, I used the templates that I showed people to use on how to make content.
16:08
The emails that we wrote were emails that we used from the outbound part of the book.
And so just like every single part of this was using the book itself to market itself.
And so that was what the book was about.
So like if you want, if you have something to sell, you need people to sell it to.
And in order to have people to sell it to, they've got to find out about you.
16:25
In order to do that, you need to advertise, and that book teaches you how to do it.
How important was social Proof?
Was it just a random coincidence you had all the people in the background 'cause I'm looking at this and I'm thinking this is so strategic to have everyone in the back versus you with just like a a Gray wall with nothing going on in the background?
16:42
I obviously want to show that there's lots of people there and I think the live, you know, indicator with however many people are alive also helps for that stuff.
But I actually think the the, the biggest weakness, honestly of that presentation was that there wasn't enough social proof, social proof for like the stuff in the book.
So most times if I'm going to like markets, if I were to like start a business around this, I would probably have had a beta group have them go through it, show their results or their changes, and then I would have used those stories and reviews and testimonials throughout the presentation.
17:09
But because it was so important to me to keep this, like just this Mondo secret until the day I released it, I didn't have that luxury.
And so a lot of the stories that I told were actually basically borrowing from success stories, from offers being like, these books work in general, and if this worked for offers, it'll work even better for leads.
17:24
I kind of had to transfer it that way.
But yeah, there's always the implied.
And I tried to use to your point, I couldn't show people yet because the book had just come out that people could use the book to grow their businesses.
So I had to go 1 separated from that which is I used the book to market the book look.
17:41
The one thing I also noticed throughout that is that you kept putting a price on what this was worth.
Like this is worth $3000 and this is worth this.
And then I think at the very end you're like you're getting $8000 worth of value.
And it was interesting for me to see the, the immediate switch when people thought you were going to sell them something.
18:00
And for me that makes makes me upset in a way because I'm like, here's someone providing so much value, offering nothing but free content this entire time and you're there learning from something and it's like, oh gosh, now maybe you have to spend some money for something else that you're not even forcing on.
18:18
Like seeing this switch up in people of going from like these avid supporters to all of a sudden just like Alex sucks, like, hey, sell out, this is horrible.
I can't believe it wasted my time.
But you hung through that to the very end when you said it was free and then you had the book.
18:33
What was going through your mind at that point?
They don't know everything yet, so like, I understand why some people would be upset we have.
The last chapter hasn't been written yet, so it's like leaving a book halfway through.
It's like, OK, well, you haven't heard the whole story.
And so I was willing to bet that the only loss that I would have would be the people who would already have made it 60 minutes in.
18:53
So I was willing to bet that the people who made it 60 minutes in, we're going to make it another 15 minutes.
And the only loss was the people who made it 60 dipped and then didn't make it the last 15.
And that's a like, you know, from video retention stuff.
Like it's a tiny, tiny and then live it's even less.
19:09
It's like it's the retention curve on the video is like flat.
It actually goes up during the entirety of that process, cuz everyone wants to see a train wreck.
Like everyone wants to see what's gonna happen.
It's the ultimate open loop the whole way through.
And so yeah, I mean I saw the comments, I knew that they didn't know.
And if anything, it just kind of got me cuz I went into it knowing or at least expecting that was going to happen.
19:31
And so I knew that it would just like be even crazier rubber band like Snap when I flipped it.
Yeah, for me, it's sad.
To think that so many people would switch.
Oh yeah, after two years.
Of giving value.
Yeah, it's like 2 years.
And they get upset at something that fast without even knowing anything.
19:48
What do you think that says about people that are watching in general?
I would say if you were.
One of those people who got upset for like a brief moment, I would look internally because if you get upset when people sell, good luck trying to sell, but people are people.
They're gonna be them.
I'm gonna do my best to serve the audience.
And there are people who, even though I gave everything away for free, we're like, what the hell, now it's hard for us to compete.
20:09
He's giving all the stuff away for free.
Like there was a there was my news feed was just all these people who were upset that I had given away stuff for free because it made it harder for them to sell stuff.
So, like, there's no way to to please everyone.
And so, like, I kind of just went into it saying like, I will do what is right by me.
And what I have said, I I will meet expectations.
20:27
And like that is what I will commit to.
If I say I will do something, I will do it.
And I said I was going to do this thing and that's what I'm going to do.
And the next book is gonna be cool.
And I'll have a whole new bag of tricks for that one.
I'm just.
Why do all of that for free?
Yeah, wondering.
Just like, why would you not try to make money?
Why would you not try to get more of something?
20:43
I saw so many Twitter.
Threads that we're analyzing how much you would have made had you charged at different price points I would have made about. 50 million, yeah.
So why turn down $50 million?
Because I have.
I'm not trying to make $50 million.
I'm trying to make a billion dollars and that's me making 50 is not gonna is not really gonna make a big dent in that.
21:02
And so I believe it would though.
No.
Is that 5?
Percent or something.
Yeah, you know, it's but like.
Substantial, I think it.
So we're gonna take a segue and I think you'll like it.
You'll find this interesting.
So I have my next book coming out, but the book after that is the one that I'm thinking about because I've already written the next book and I wasn't going to write this next one, but it's the one that's been like on my mind the most, which is on branding.
21:23
And I think it is one of the most misunderstood concepts.
And I think it's why so few people can build big things.
And I think brand is the single most valuable thing that you can build in a business because brand is basically persuasion or suggestion or influence at scale.
It's if you're to go to, like, the etymology of brand, like what does branding come from?
21:41
Branding comes from cattle, right?
You sear a cattle with your brand on, you literally brand them.
And what is the point of that?
The point of that is to change someone else's behavior.
So if you have two cows, one that has a brand and one doesn't, the one that doesn't have a brand you will treat differently than the one that does have a brand.
The one that does have a brand, You might return to its owner, you might steal it, you might kill it, depending on your relationship with the owner, which then depending on the brand, you'll behave differently.
22:01
But at the end of the day, it will change your behavior.
And so the point of a brand is to actually teach a change in behavior.
And so if you have a white shirt that's playing in a white shirt with a check mark, you train a behavior that you want people to do something when they see that and then and behave accordingly.
And so the idea of branding is basically teaching, it's pairing.
22:18
It's making associations between things people know, things people don't know.
And then you do that enough time.
Like if I wear this hat out of times, people will eventually just want to wear the hat.
If they like what I've associated the hat with.
If they like me like fitness, they like, they like free value.
They like the the values in general that I stand for.
They will start associating that if they want to be more patient, they want to be more ambitious, they want to be more fit, want to be more driven, Whatever it is, whatever they associate me with, they might put this hat on because it stands for that for them.
22:43
They've made that association and so they'd be willing to pay more for this hat than just a generic hat.
And like that is branding.
And so to the point that it's like why not make 50 million.
I think that I want my brand to stand for something more than that.
And so I made it the mission to make real business education accessible for everyone.
23:01
And that is what I have been.
I have not wavered from that since I started doing this.
And I have two aspects to that.
One is the distribution of how do I get this to everybody and how to make it accessible and that has multiple levels to it which is one is like is it easy to understand but also like is it fun and entertaining and I'm getting better at that.
23:17
I think I'm I'm I'm better at the easy to understand part I'm still working on how do I make this more entertaining so that like a stay at home mom will actually click and maybe get interested in something like this and maybe recommend her son or her daughter to like watch something like that.
I'm not there yet, like, but that's like in order for me to get that level of accessibility, like, I need to get better.
23:37
But on the flip side, the context that the content is consumed within is basically my background.
So like at the very beginning you're like, hey, just for everybody who doesn't know, here's this guy, right?
If I had said, hey, I make $100,000 a year, listen to me, I think fewer people would listen to me.
I mean, maybe some would but like far fewer would listen to me as a quote authority on on making money.
23:56
In general.
We had to provide the context upfront because the context is in my opinion, a larger percentage of the message than the message itself.
Like Elon Musk can tweet on the toilet and say like I'm shitting right now and everyone will like think it's hilarious and whatever.
If I tweet that or you tweet that, we probably wouldn't have the same response because we are not the richest man in the world.
24:16
And so like that message is consumed within the context of Elon Musk.
And So what I'm building with my personal brand is the context to deliver a message at scale that I want to deliver and we're not there yet.
And so this is much more of like a 10 year, 1520 year plan that I'm that I'm trying to outline and I'm showing pages one at a time like the book, just one piece.
24:36
There's gonna be another piece next year and people will see that as it unveils.
So it's more about the.
Perception of you rather than potentially optimizing for impact.
Because there is an argument I feel to be had if you were to charge some money for the book, I do think people would pay more attention and potentially it would make more of an impact on those who do read it then just giving it out universally for free.
24:53
I'll give you the argument for.
It, but I do think that.
Perception overall, people like, oh, this is the guy that gives all of this value for free.
Whether or not it impacts them, who's to say?
So I've been on both sides of this.
I have charged lots of money for things and so you make a greater impact giving away things for free.
That's just objective, you'd say?
Yes.
25:09
Because you get 100 times more people to consume it, but the percentage of people who consume it who are impacted is smaller.
So if I charge for something, a higher percentage of people who consume the thing, if they paid for it, will be likely to to follow through with it.
If it's free, 100 * 1000 times more people will consume it, but a smaller percentage, but a larger absolute amount of people would be impacted.
25:30
I respect the.
Objectivity on that or the objective answer I had to because I.
Had to do that because I had to deal with that myself.
I was like well if I claim this like now if you have like for example a really in depth like if I were if I were flying out to people's houses and trying to like do huge interventions with people and like re cook their shit like no you can't do that for free.
25:48
So like there are certain things that you can give away for free information, give away for free media in general.
Like you can give away for free software.
If you're really good at coding, give away for free.
Like there are elements, there are things you can give away for free tools sometimes and I think that this is from a business perspective, you'll ultimately make more money serving a huge amount of people and then having some bar that people can jump over.
26:06
Now I purposely put my bar really high because I know that like I only need one Facebook.
Like people would be surprised by how few deals we do.
Like I get 2000, I get 2400 companies a month that reach out to me to do a deal every month inbound.
Like can we do a deal with you?
And in two years I've done 22 deals in total.
26:24
So like you look at that over you know whatever 20 like a 50,060 thousand deals that I've looked at and I've done 22.
It's a very small percentage part of me thinks.
What's the message that you want to share that you can't already share with your platform?
It seems like the platform is big enough that whatever you say will have an impact.
26:40
What can you not already do?
Right now?
I don't think it's what I.
Can do.
I think it's who it will reach.
So like, I think right now, sure, I've got whatever, 67 million whatever followers across, different social medias and whatnot, but there's a different level of impact there compared to if I had 70 across that.
26:55
And I'm still learning this game.
I'm like, I'm like super new to this.
I came from the business side and was like, I see the value in this.
And part of it is because just my general world view is like, I believe in education over everything.
And I think that if you die and you die with any knowledge left in your brain that you haven't shared with other people, it's just a waste of a life.
Like the idea that you could learn something and then share it with no one and then die.
27:15
It's just such a waste.
It'd be like the guy inventing the wheel and be like, Nah, not sharing it.
Like why do you have firm?
Long term goals on why you focus so much on branding, what you're optimizing for, Is it for the next Facebook or is it for something?
So I mean.
I've built this brand on the idea of faith, which is that, like I believe that opportunities present themselves when they're right.
27:35
And I like I.
It's not like and I'm sure with you like there's no shortage of opportunities, the amount of things that come my way.
But it's like it has to be the right one, and I'll know it when I see it.
Oh yeah, I'm pretty patient about it, 'cause I also enjoy doing it like that.
The only reason I can still do this, 'cause I enjoy doing it.
And I also have other means of income.
I think it's worth saving the context that I can deliver the message in, to give away some of the short term money to have the trust of a much larger audience later.
27:57
How much did?
You end up making from that.
I think it was like 5.
Million.
Still impressive, I think.
Objective in $30 bucks, yeah.
I mean, the books probably in general right now make about 1,000,000 bucks a month.
But like, it's not an efficient business, you know, I mean, like books are not a great business to get into.
28:17
Like there's cost, there's no price control on a book.
Like you can't charge $50.00 for a book.
Like you're stuck at what books go for which is 29 bucks.
Like that's what books go for, right?
It's an actual physical product that you have to mail to everyone.
So you've got logistics, you've got shipping, you have to print the books.
Like there's a lot of costs that go into just like 29 bucks and then you, you make the margin on that.
28:34
So on a million.
A month?
What's your net profit on something like that, 360?
I think it seems like.
That's still incredible for a book.
Yeah.
No, I mean.
Don't be wrong.
It's a top.
Like there's whatever.
It's 60 million titles on Amazon.
Both books are top 200.
28:51
Like it's point.
It's like not a 1% book.
It's like a .00001% book.
Yeah, we were talking to.
Mark Manson recently and he told us that I think it was like twenty $30 million when you really did the math and reverse engineered how much one successful book made net profit.
29:06
Yeah, which is incredible.
I mean, it's.
Why?
Ingram built like owns Vanderbilt University like Ingram is.
Publishers, like you literally print money.
Well, the thing that's interesting with books is that they're the oldest form of media, right?
And so you print a book and if the book is good enough that when people read the book more than like on average each book creates at least more than one other book buyer from, like word of mouth, then it just becomes a perennial, like how think about how to make friends and influence people.
29:33
You know, habits of successful people.
Stephen Covey, like rich dad, poor dad, Dave Ramsey, his millionaire makeover, those ones, right.
Like those books.
And when he sells 5 million copies of the book, it's $30.
That's $150 million and so.
And now that might be spent over a decade, but The thing is like, Stephen King still collects checks for carry, like still.
29:55
And so from a leverage perspective, it's kind of interesting like now that I'm in the publishing business, which is kind of ironic cuz I guess I'm a top super high percentage author.
But like, I don't consider myself on that way.
It is a really interesting business because it requires almost, almost no employees, if any.
Like I employ my father-in-law, it's my only direct report and he I just like just manage the book stuff just in general like the Amazon listings in the in the warehouse and the printer and making sure we order more but like just manage all that.
30:18
And so he does that.
But like, we could probably do it, or I could take a few hours and do that.
I just don't.
What's the difference?
Between putting that in a book and making like a YouTube video that's 10 hours long, I do.
I mean, I.
Did that too.
Yeah, so I just did it in every format.
So it's like if you want a physical copy of the book, then you can pay for a physical copy of the book, but you can literally get an audio version of the book for free on my podcast and not pay for it.
30:40
You can get the video version for free on my website, not even opt in for it.
It's free on the site.
You can watch the entire book just with a visual presentation.
Because if I'm going to try to make it accessible for everyone, then I need to make it for whatever learning format.
A lot of people don't read.
A lot of people only watch video.
A lot of people only listen.
Everyone's very different in terms of how they consume.
30:56
And so I just wanted to make it for everyone.
You might find this interesting.
It's like an almost perfect split of how people consume it.
So it's almost, I think it's 25% hard copy, 25% ebook, 25% audio, and then 25% like video.
What do you think?
The biggest?
Problem people have right now is when it comes to business.
31:15
Just from your.
Observation because of 200,000 people watching it.
You have to notice these 200,000 people have a problem that they're trying to solve.
There's got to be some solution that you have that they want that I.
Have no, honestly, I think.
I think a lot of it is people overthink a lot and they they use overthinking as a proxy for action and it just isn't.
31:34
They think that they're being productive by thinking more about the business they want to start rather than just starting it.
And it's just it's fear.
You can boil all of this down to fear of rejection.
People are OK with failing, They're just not OK with other people seeing them fail for.
Success, let's say a recipe for success.
What percentage would you say should be thinking about action versus action?
31:52
Like premeditating what you're gonna do versus action?
Yeah, in the beginning.
You need to think a lot less and do a lot more.
And the more advanced you are, the more you need to think and less you need to do.
It just flips over time and you just know automatically that.
I think it happens.
Naturally.
Like, I don't think, you know, think about Warren Buffett, he makes like one move a year and it's like he he spends basically the rest of the time trying to make the right decision.
32:11
And so like you move, the speed with which you move through business is directly proportional amount of leverage you have with the actions you take.
And so leverage being defined as the difference in what you put in and what you get out.
Like if you have a lot of leverage, then like with this podcast we have a lot of leverage.
Like there's a lot of people that will listen to this even though we might only take us a couple hours, right, to do this.
32:27
So there's we put a little bit in, but we get hundreds of thousands of people who who will see and listen to this lot you know later.
But when you start you don't have leverage and so you need to make out for that with just shit loads and shit loads of effort and basically do like you can see output as volume of of repetitions times leverage equals output.
32:44
And if you have no leverage then you just need to crank on volume until you can create leverage.
And one of the things that creates leverage is skill.
So like Graham can make a video and someone else can make a video, it might take Graham and the other person the same amount of time to make the video and Graham's video will have 100 times more people who see it.
That's leverage, Skill created, that leverage.
33:01
But how do you get the skill, the volume that he did beforehand?
You can work smarter, not harder, but you have to work hard in order to work smarter.
So you have to do that first.
So we just had on.
Doctor K or Healthy Gamer?
On the podcast I wanted to know how people start taking action in the 1st place and he gave me a very interesting answer.
33:21
I want to know what your answer is.
Like if they can't find motivation to just start taking action in the 1st place, where do they start if not just action?
I think motivation can be measured by its equal opposite, which is deprivation.
So you want water.
33:37
You're motivated to drink water to directly, proportional to how thirsty you are.
You're horny in the direct proportion to how long it's been.
I'll just leave it at that.
And so those are physiological needs that most people kind of understand.
Like, hunger works the same way.
Like, you're really hungry if you haven't eaten well, so you're more deprived, you're more motivated.
33:52
So money is kind of interesting because you then think, OK, well, poor people should be the most motivated, but that we can see with our eyes that that's not the case.
So then, like, what's different there is that the deprivation has to be perceived.
So like you feel when you're hungry, like you have a you have physiological need to eat or you'll die.
But I see more motivation among rich people to make money, which by that context would mean that they feel more deprived of money than poor people do.
34:16
And I would say to me personally, like I'm talking about how I want to get to a billion dollars.
Plus I'm extremely money motivated.
And the difference between my current level of wealth and a billion dollars is greater than the person who is at $5000 a month who wants to make $10,000 a month, both in relative and absolute amounts.
I'm more deprived of my goal than they are, and so I'm more motivated.
34:34
And so from a tactical perspective, if you want to change your behavior, you need to change your environment.
It's the fastest way to change behavior.
Like if you want to get good at swimming, you join a great swim team the fastest way, like you wanted to get great at ping pong.
You join a great ping pong team and you play on the team.
34:49
You surround yourself with other people who then you can compare yourself to and get fast feedback loops going to get better.
And so, like, if you're like at home in your mom's basement and that environment consistently does not help you change the behavior you want, then you need to move.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
35:08
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check on my YouTube channel, It's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
And if not, keep enjoying the show.
35:25
What if the?
Person knows what's good for them to move and change their environment, yet they still don't do it.
They won't do it.
There has to be some level of something that they're deprived from.
So they're probably comfortable.
They're actually not that deprived.
So they're like, I'm really motivated, like you're not, you're not.
If you don't be that successful, that's fine.
35:41
Like, it's only like, you thinking that there's a problem with it is why there's a problem.
Like, you're going to die.
I'm going to die.
Both of us will be forgotten in a long enough period of time.
So, like, it doesn't really matter.
I find this interesting and so that's the game I play.
If I if I love video games, as much as I love business, I'd play more video games.
I just love business more.
So you're.
35:57
Pursuing business, pursuing a billion dollars because it interests you, it amuses you.
Or do you have a certain like North Star?
Like we talked to Tom, Bill, you done something with him twice.
I think now he says his North Star is increased human flourishing and decreased human suffering.
Do you have a true North that you kind of like always base all decisions off of, or are you in pursuit of this billion dollars just because it amuses you?
36:15
It's not.
Yeah no I mean billion dollars is is just an objective measure and when I hit that it'll be 10 it'll you mean I'll just move the the goal post.
It's more I want to die with nothing left.
And So what I would love to have be true on my tombs, not not just have it there, but what I would love to be true.
36:30
Or at least that people say is that like that man died with nothing left to give and that would be a life well lived for me.
And so like I deem that why do you need a?
Billion to be able to do, I just think.
That, that having that contrast will force me to be a better version of me.
Like I'll have to level up.
And so I wanna be the like.
36:47
For me to have nothing left to give means that I've used up every ounce of my potential.
And so do I think I can be a billionaire?
Absolutely.
And so that's what I'm gonna measure You're.
Giving in a billion dollars or how does no I?
Think.
I mean, I think the stuff that I do with my content, my books is far, my opinion, far more impactful.
37:02
Now to be fair, a billion dollars, 5 billion dollars, $10 million can do a lot of good.
And like if I'm thinking about this in a long term, which I try to, if I spend 1020 more years building this amazing audience of people that I can help, and then I over that same period of time, I'm able to aggregate a tremendous amount of wealth.
37:19
One, it gives me credibility with the things that I'm trying to talk about.
But also like there will be a merging of those two things that can create something really magical.
And that's what I look forward to.
And who I am today doesn't necessarily have all of the details yet.
And I'm like, I'm fine with that.
Like future me is pretty smart too.
He'll figure it out.
I wanna talk about.
Solomon, OK, you said this during a couple of podcasts, which is like your 85 year old self.
37:38
You name them Solomon and that's the counselor that you use to base decision making off of in this day.
Can you talk us through the last thing that you consulted with Solomon?
And maybe if I didn't properly describe who Solomon is, I'll give, I'll give.
Some context.
So Solomon was named after something called the Solomon Paradox.
37:55
And for those who don't know who Solomon was in the Bible, he was a very wealthy ruler who many other kingdoms came to to seek counsel or advice.
The reason it's called Solomon's Paradox is that he was amazing at giving advice, but his actual life was in shambles.
So he cheated on his wife and his son was, you know, he had a bad, bad relationship with his son.
38:13
And so the idea is that as humans, we are better at giving advice than we are at following it.
And so that's why it's called Solomon's Paradox.
And so in in an effort to try and get better answers the higher up, and I'll use quotes here that you get in business or whatever endeavor you're going after, the harder it is to find people who can actually help you out.
38:33
And part of having or getting help from people is that I want someone who has aligned incentives.
I want someone who is competent and I want someone there's a third piece.
I want them to have complete context.
So like they have to have complete context.
They have to be competent with that context to give advice, and they have to be aligned.
38:49
Because if someone's super competent and has complete context and not aligned, they just know how to ruin my life.
You know what I mean?
If they're really aligned and they're competent, if they have no context, they might have good advice in general, but it won't be specific to me, right?
If they're aligned and have context but they're incompetent, it's your mother.
She got completely understands you and she loves you, but she has no idea how to tell you how to invest.
39:09
And so I wanted someone who would have all three.
And so in trying to think through this, I had, you know, multiple experiences with, you know, executive coaches, counselors, therapists, whatever you want to call it.
And I've, I've always had very short lived experience with those, those people.
And I think part of my experience was that I felt like they're a lot, their incentive was not aligned.
39:25
It was that their goal from a financial perspective was that I just continue to pay.
And I was like, well, that doesn't really solve problems for me.
Like you just want me to keep staying no matter what you say, that's how you get paid, right.
The other piece was that from a context perspective, I would notice that I would spend 60 minutes trying to to just give color to the decision that I was trying to make or that I was faced with, just so that they could give me some valuable feedback on it.
39:48
And the third piece is, if I'm talking to a therapist, I'm probably better at business than them.
And the vast majority of the problems that I face on a daily basis have to do with business.
And so like I'm asking somebody who is basically a solopreneur or self-employed on how I'm trying to manage a $200 million portfolio and how I'm going to like allocate resources and like they're probably not going to have a good answer for me in terms of their competence level.
40:07
And so in trying to tackle that, I came upon the Solomon paradox.
I was like, what if I could give myself advice?
Because I'm sure everybody who's listening to this has given somebody advice on a relationship or on fitness or whatever.
And you're like, man, if I follow that advice, I'd be in better shape too.
And so I was like, well, maybe maybe I have the answers and I just need to package it differently.
40:28
And so I started having these sessions with what I call, you know, my 85 year old self, who I call Solomon for whatever purpose.
That seems to separate my personal self and my older self.
Because that man is the only person who has absolutely aligned incentives with me, has complete context to my situation and is as competent as I am.
40:43
And I'm trusting the fact that I give better advice than I heed.
And so I have basically chat forum messages with Solomon.
It's an ongoing document.
It's the first hour of every Monday for me.
It's like what's top of mind for me?
And the nice thing is that it also can last 7 minutes, and sometimes it can last 45 minutes.
I don't need to like stay for 60 or drive somewhere or take a zoom call.
41:00
Like if I get to the bottom of what I wanted to get to, it's done and I don't need to waste all this time giving context.
And so I usually keep going with Solomon literally back and forth.
Like it's Chad, I just hit enter and I just keep going back and forth until I get to the root of the issue.
And I usually have some sort of thing that Solomon will tell me that will kind of like close the loop and I know it when I get it.
41:20
And then at that point it's like I don't think about that thing anymore, like the decisions made or like I know I've resolved the inconsistency.
And so an example of that was I had a a big snafu that happened.
I'd worked for a while on a project and ended up falling through because of a vendor.
And it cost me about $15 million of actual money.
41:37
It really sucked.
And so I was really upset.
I won't go into the details, but like basically think about this way.
Like I paid a big chunk of money for insurance against a $15 million loss.
And the person that I had paid that was literally their only job, that I paid a good chunk of money, a fraction of that, but a good chunk of money, several $100,000 to ensure that didn't happen.
41:57
And then after paying, it did happen.
And I was like, this was the only job you had.
This is the only thing I hired you for.
It was this one thing that you said you specialized in.
I was really upset about it.
And so I'm having this conversation.
It's almost.
And The thing is, is the more I talk to the person, the more I realized that they were just truly incompetent.
42:14
It wasn't malicious.
They were just stupid and they made the promises just because they're stupid.
And so it's almost like if you have a Babe Ruth Ricky card and your toddler pours paint on it, what do you do?
You hit the kid like they don't understand, like you just have to take it.
You just get kicked in the nuts.
Just is what it is.
42:30
And so I was going through this process with Solomon and he said I am the asset you are building and I am satisfied with the effort you put in and that is enough.
And that was kind of it for me.
I was like I put all this work two years into this thing in this project and it was because of the person that I ultimately wanna be cuz I'm gonna die, it's not gonna matter anyways.
42:54
And so the person I'm becoming is the ultimate asset that I'm trying to build.
To answer the billion dollar question, building it's just a reflection of the asset I'm trying to build and that's the person who I want to impress.
And the the interesting thing with Solomon is that like you especially the higher performing you are because I'm sure you get this question a lot like how do you stay motivated, whatever if you've achieved a certain amount, it's by not comparing yourself to other people, it's by comparing yourself to the person you want to be.
43:15
And so the tough part about that, if you're really real about it is that like Solomon knows if I could have tried harder.
So like with a presentation for the the leads book, I couldn't put more effort in.
I put 200 hours in over 28 days.
It's basically every hour, every day.
I'd review the slides.
In the morning I would do a live recording and then I would watch the recording afterwards, and I would edit the slides in real time as I watched the recording.
43:36
And I did that every day for the entire month leading up to it.
I had no.
Idea.
Yeah, Wow.
I thought maybe it was like a teleprompter or something.
I know you're kind of going based on the slides, but yeah, and.
So it was funny because, like, right before I got on stage, I'm gonna loop back to Solomon.
Like the lady who was the one who ran the venue with the screens and whatnot was like, I've literally never seen anyone so chill about something like this and this is like the biggest event we've ever even had here.
44:00
I was like, I've done this before.
I've done this before.
Like this isn't my first time.
Like I know this presentation.
Like there's nothing more I could have done to prepare for this.
And so in that instance, Salman in that mini setting would be like, I am proud of the effort.
I know you put in because at that time whether the the all the cameras cut off and the, you know, a storm came through and everything blew up, there's nothing more I could do.
44:22
And so for that I try to make that man proud of me.
But the tough part is, is that he knows how hard I can try.
And then a lot of times if you are a high achiever, if you compare yourself to other people, you're going to beat them anyways.
And so like you can't compare yourself to them.
And it's like well who's the one person who always knows how much more I could have tried.
44:38
And that's future me.
And I also think that hopefully a future me has an even higher work capacity and more focus and better skills than I do to work.
And so that's the man I ultimately try to impress.
And if I'm brutally honest with myself, I think he gives me ruthless honesty in terms of my deficiencies and the things that I can work on.
44:54
And I am good enough at giving that advice.
I can take it.
So for the 15.
Million loss, though.
What was the take away for you?
It's just like, I know you did everything you could, but then wouldn't that also say that you should have done a better job vetting people to make sure they're more confident?
45:10
Yeah, I'm gonna.
Always do that, but I would say this, which is that when you play with bigger stakes your chips were are worth more.
If you're playing a poker game and your buy in's 1,000,000 bucks every hand, you're betting 50 grand.
As the game gets bigger, you just add zeros to the stakes.
45:25
And so if you want to make a billion dollars, you have to be willing to lose 100 million.
I mean you've lost money now right after this I'm sure you've lost money on things and be like fuck, I learned from that.
Given the information that I had at the time about the vendor and their experience and how they came recommended, I think that the decision that I made was reasonable.
I could always go and 100% quadruple check every single thing, but at what point do I become micromanaging and then blow that blows up in my face?
45:45
So it's like Ray Daly talked about this with I think crypto in the early days.
But he basically said I don't feel bad about missing out on opportunities because if I were to make the decision to prove that opportunity, I'd have to also apply that same decision making process to all the other opportunities that I would have bought and then lost all my money on.
46:04
And so sometimes you just get kicked in the nuts and I think that you do the best you can.
There's always gonna be things that are uncontrollable and it is what it is when.
Is the last time you've fallen short of Sullivan's standards every day?
Every single day.
Yeah, of course.
Be for real.
Like there's there's always things I could do better on.
46:20
I could have been kinder to Layla.
I could have put more effort into, like what I was gonna say to her this morning.
Like there's always things I can do better.
But I will say that my talks with Solomon are typically about one specific thing.
So when we ask you questions, it sounds like you place a lot of value and fulfillment in who you eventually will be at some point, right, which is like the, the guy providing the most amount of value, the billion dollar guy etcetera, Solomon.
46:40
Yeah, yes.
Yet at the same time you do say things like I do not wanna place my value in some sort of future event That could happen, right?
Because then you're creating a distance between who you are right now and who you need to be.
How do you maintain that balance of putting so much value in this future self, yet at the same time being fulfilled and happy in a present moment?
47:00
I think it's just the.
Process of becoming If you ask me truthfully, I enjoyed every minute of the suffering of doing that presentation 5-6 hours every single day for the entire month leading up to that.
Like I I enjoyed it because I knew I felt like I was becoming the first of me I was living through.
47:15
The values that I choose to believe matter to me.
How do you?
Find something, or how does someone that's watching this find something that they can set as their true north, that every single action will make them fulfilled on their way to that.
I don't think you're going to.
Figure it out on the first shot.
I think an easier North Star is learning to work.
47:33
I'll give you a different example.
So I had a buddy who was in the fitness industry and he had a pretty successful fitness business and then he quit that to start cookies, a cookie store completely.
He's getting people skinny and he's making a fat.
He's like, yeah, I've got a complete system, right?
He's joking, right?
He wasn't passionate about cookies.
47:49
He was passionate about being excellent at whatever he did.
And I really like that as the frame, which is like First off, you're not going to find your passion because anything that you start doing that you haven't done before, you're going to suck at.
Because that's what you do when you do something for the first time.
And you tend to only like things that you are good at.
48:07
And so sucking is a prerequisite for liking most of the time And so you just to be willing to suck in order to quote, find your passion, which all you ended up doing is creating a passion, but whatever.
And so anyways, he had his, his cookie store and it wasn't like he woke everyone.
And me, Like, I just want to feed cookies to the world.
Like, I just want everyone to understand how butter and chocolate and salt work.
48:24
Well, he didn't think that way.
He was like, I want to run an excellent business.
And so whether he was doing a dry cleaning business or a tractor supply store business or he was wholesaling real estate, it was his dedication to excellence, that single value which then permeated everything else.
And so I think that for somebody who's starting out, like simply dedicating yourself to understanding what hard work feels like and the commitment to the repetitive actions that you have to do day in, day out without reward making that the West gets you there.
48:53
And I think the long term is that you just make that the West period.
You're not thinking about getting there.
You just win every day and you think that.
Will serve most people is absolutely to strive for excellence in a given field.
Million percent and then creating.
You said creating interesting rather than finding a passion no one finds.
49:09
Passion.
I mean, some people do, sure.
Some, I think the vast majority of people, the vast majority of people, find themselves in careers because they think about the first job you ever got.
It's probably just like on a whim, somebody told you there was a thing and then you find yourself 10 years later, like off a tree branch from this first path of career that you got into, right?
49:27
I.
Would disagree.
Not for me.
Yeah, the aquarium.
Stuff.
I wanted to do that, but you still do.
You're still off a tree branch.
I mean, we blogged on this to family about your aquarium and stuff like that.
Oh yeah, but.
I feel like I have control of that, like that was just something I would love to do.
Yeah, My.
Point here was just that dedicating yourself to being excellent and doing the repetitive tasks, you get better at the thing and then you tend to like the things when you get better at them.
49:48
And then external reinforcers start kicking over, like you just need to have enough in the beginning to get you going, and then after that like being good at playing ping pong takes over for playing ping pong do you like?
Anything you're bad at.
What are some of the things that you're bad at?
Maybe Layla is like, oh, let's go axe throwing.
You're like, I hate axe throwing, but I will do it.
50:05
You do it and you suck, but you like it.
There's not.
Many things.
I don't do many things that I like.
To be fair, I don't do a lot of stuff.
I recently picked up ping pong, which is you actually.
Yeah, I recently picked.
Up ping pong I can.
Coach, you.
I did.
Are you guys?
I'm.
Disgusting at ping pong.
I'm very good at.
That's like, that's my Did you compete?
50:21
No, I've never.
Competed Have you been to Las Vegas table tennis?
No.
OK, it's like a club.
On a strip, it's the the people there are incredible.
Oh sweet.
Yeah, I might.
I might partake, yeah.
No, I've just like I used to play at home when I was a kid, 'cause I didn't have siblings for a while.
And so I just played against the wall for fucking hours.
Ever.
What do you like about?
50:37
Ping pong.
What's the appeal of it?
Low.
State baby Yeah, it's 100.
Percent that do you find a?
Way to zone out is that just like.
Cats like I am not there.
It's like racing.
If you've ever done like race cars, it's the same thing like you.
Not just like rallying, but like if you're really playing.
You can't focus on anything besides the ball.
50:55
And so, like everything else, disappears and what do you get out?
Of that, I just enjoy that.
It's like unplugging, like that's just truly like a recreation.
Like, I just enjoy it.
I would say the same thing is true for lifting for me.
When you have a huge amount of weight on your back, you can't think about anything else.
You just have to be there.
An old time lifter, Dave Tate used to talk about the real.
51:11
This kind of like epic blog post on it called Going Into the Void.
He said when his father died, the thing that he would look forward to most was like getting under the bar because like during those few seconds where he had like his life literally like on his back, if you fuck it up with 1000 lbs back, like you'll just break your back.
He's like, it was like the world went quiet and I think that's that's what I like the most.
51:29
But I lift I now recently picked up ping pong back up again and I do business and that's what I do just since you're here and.
You're like such a strong guy.
OK, I'm wondering because because I've been thinking about, like, I did get on creatine and I kind of slowed it down.
I picked it back up.
But I heard from somewhere that it can build muscle like 33% faster.
51:46
As someone who's just absolutely shredded, you probably do creatine.
Like don't Well a way to make assumptions.
Yeah, I mean.
I just thought everyone was.
Taking it to be honest, everyone's on it.
Everyone's on.
It is it not.
You don't take creatine, no.
If you eat a lot of meat, you already have a ton of creatine in it if you look up the.
52:02
Data like creatine, you should be taking 5 milligrams per day that you have to eat so much meat in order to get that much.
So have you.
Have you ever?
Seen like the mid wit memes where it's like the IQ where it's like the the dummy and then like the middle guy and then like the guy at the end.
Yeah, at the very end.
A lot of stuff in fitness is like that.
52:18
That makes a lot of.
Sense.
So it's like.
Pick the right parents, eat protein, lift progressively heavier weight, and then you're like set schemes, red schemes, blah blah blah.
And it's like pick the right parents, like eat protein, lift more weight overtime have you ever gotten?
Your testosterone checked?
Of course you have.
Yeah, actually.
52:33
Recently What's your testosterone?
It was 120.
Four 120.
Four.
Yeah, Superman. 124.
I thought it goes up to like 1000.
Yeah, isn't. 500 like 300 to 1000.
Is the like recommended range?
I'm below the recommended range.
How?
How is that?
Even physically possible, I've always been.
Low.
The highest reading I've ever had is 270.
52:50
Could be lots of soy that.
Makes no sense, 'cause I see that like the beard and the muscle.
Don't you have to have the deep voice?
Like you have to have more testosterone.
You can be androgen.
Sensitive that can be very sensitive to androgen.
Some people are not sensitive at all.
So it's like if you add testosterone to your system like you, somebody will get a significantly higher response than other people.
53:09
And so you have you know, genetic potential from parents, but you also have just like how responsive you are to anabolic hormones in general, like some of the big because we, the Olympia just happened for bodybuilding like this last week.
A lot of those guys, some of them, some of the the genetic factors that they have are just that their body is just more responsive to anabolics than other people.
53:26
And so like you can just be more androgen sensitive, you need less testosterone to make the same muscle.
And so like those ranges are they're arbitrary.
They're completely arbitrary.
Now if you were below that, you know, 300 and I'm not gonna get into science stuff, everyone don't listen to me.
So I put that as my disclaimer.
53:43
But if you're below 300, but you're not suffering from low testosterone issues like you don't have erectile dysfunction.
You don't have, like, issues getting out of bed in the morning, You're not depressed, you're not Moody.
You're like, you're pretty much just like you don't have, like, supremely low muscle mass compared to normal men, then you're probably just Android sensitive and it's fine.
54:00
Wow.
So I noticed this theme in you of like, I don't care what anything's happening, I'm controlling what I'm controlling, and I'm being exactly who I want to be.
Were you always like this as a kid, or is this something that you have developed over time?
Yeah, I think it's a skill has.
Developed over time.
I mean, I think there's definitely, like when we talked about deprivation earlier, I definitely felt deprived of money.
54:19
I've always wanted to make a lot of money.
That's like been a very big desire of mine and I just have gotten better and better at pursuing that goal.
You know, like in the beginning I just had general motivation, but I had no skill.
So it's like, I heard this works.
I heard that you wander and you just have lots of activity to try and burn through things to figure out like what starts to give you some feedback and then you start moving in that direction.
54:38
I've always been motivated.
I've always been pretty high achieving.
I don't have the, like, I failed school and like, I was great at school.
You know, I I think I had 13 AP credits going into college.
I've been in College in three years.
Maddie cum Laude.
I was vice president of the powerlifting team.
I was president of fraternity.
I always try to fuck life, you know what I mean?
Everyone's different, but like at the same time, there's plenty of people who didn't have any of that stuff and then crush it later.
54:58
But you, I think you can just always make the decision to do whatever you wanna do whenever you wanna do it.
The idea that you haven't been successful for your entirety of your life has absolutely no impact on why you can't be successful right now.
The work that needs to be done for someone to succeed remains unchanged, and so, like whenever you choose to start that, you choose to start that, and everything before that moment doesn't really matter.
55:16
Well, I think it's easier.
When you have momentum behind you, sure.
Yeah, I'm.
I'm just saying like objectively, if you have 0 momentum and you still do the thing, it still works.
My thought is that.
It might be harder if you don't have that previous success to draw from.
Might hold you back in in ways of maybe being more cautious, self doubt, things like that.
55:34
Yeah, I think.
I use the term chunking up or chunking down.
But like the biggest predictor of future success is past success regardless.
And so the idea is like, OK, well, you might be like, well, I want to take this big jump, but I've never done that before.
Like, how do I take this job?
How do I take this risk?
Right.
Well, it's like can you generalize some of the other things you've done in the past that would give you some level of confidence that this is not unreasonable.
55:54
And so it's like if I've been really disciplined at school and exercise, then it might be it might follow that I'll be relatively disciplined with my job is a guaranteed no.
But I could still make a generalization that that's it's plausible.
And so I think it's like stacking those wins as low as a common denominator as you can.
56:10
I mean, you know, for somebody who's absolutely just like sucking a life right now that it's like if you got out of bed today, then cool, call it AW, you know what I mean?
Like just regress it back and then you start just like you'd add weight to a bar, you add weight to the goals.
So is it as?
Simple as just waking up in the morning.
Great.
Then it would be take a walk for 10 minutes.
56:25
Great.
And then just building on that, yeah.
And I think your bar.
Always moves.
Like when a toddler in the beginning begins speaking, they approximate the word mom.
They're like and you're like, yeah, you're so excited, but like you know, a 10 year old says mom and you tell him to screw off, right?
Like the bar moves.
I'm not.
56:42
Your mom, right?
Yeah, sure.
I'm not your well.
No, but the bar moves because, like, your standards for excellence continue to improve.
So it's like if you're like, don't use someone else's standards, use your own.
And once you can say mom really consistently, then like, start saying sentences.
I want to know.
Because we talked, I think it was the first or second time you came in the podcast about trauma.
56:58
You have very interesting takes on Okay and recently not to be that guy, but I feel like I have gotten more similar to your beliefs with regard to trauma.
Everyone goes through traumatic experiences in their life.
It's their response to that trauma that actually ends up making the difference.
Now I saw this video.
57:14
I don't know if you've seen this before, but it was someone holding the baby.
Yeah.
And then they, like, knock on a doorway nearby or a door nearby.
And they're like, oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I hit your head.
And the baby's like, and it starts crying as though it's in pain.
Right.
And that could be a traumatic experience for that baby.
And then I saw another video of a baby that took a tumble, like, a pretty bad spill.
57:32
Yeah.
And the mom's like, oh, look, we just had a happy spill.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
This is so funny.
And the baby starts laughing.
Yeah.
And, like, one actually went through something and one did not.
Yet the responses were completely different.
So I think now my opinion from these two baby tik toks is that, like, it really has to do with the way that other people respond to your trauma and then your perception of how you should be feeling after a specified event occurs.
57:57
I agree.
Which is?
Crazy.
I'll add 1.
Piece to what?
You said, yes, which is that you said people experience trauma.
I'll just erase that.
Things happen.
Things happen.
No need to label good or bad.
Things happen to people.
That's really just a very hard switch, though.
58:13
Totally.
That's a whole different level to this.
Sure, Like was I.
Traumatized by the $15 million loss?
No.
Was it unfortunate?
Yes.
Did I deal with it?
Yes.
OK, I'm not traumatized.
I'm not like I can never make a bet again.
No, it is what it is.
Things happen.
The toddler can spill paint on your baby with card.
58:30
What do you do now?
Are you traumatized?
You blame your baby?
Like, man, I've got all these issues 'cause my baby.
But you know what?
But but there?
But there could be.
But you know what?
There could be instances that happen that definitely change your entire mindset.
Like let's say you are driving fast on the freeway all the time and then you get in a horrible car accident.
58:46
You could be terrified of driving, especially at that speed for good reason.
Maybe your entire perception is is changed after that trauma is.
Just accelerated learning.
It's all in US.
It's accelerated learning.
And the question is just is the behavior that I learned something that I want?
Does it serve me now, if you were driving really fast and then you drive slower, does that serve you well for getting places on time?
59:08
You might have to leave a couple minutes earlier.
Besides that, like, does it serve you and the likely that you died in a car accident?
Yeah, probably.
So is that is that traumatic or is that like you just learned?
I think just calling it trauma makes it this really heavy thing.
Well, here's.
Maybe a better example there is that video of a car on the freeway where all of a sudden the car is just driving along going the speed limit and a tire at the no fault of that car, the tire comes out, the car flips.
59:30
I would be terrified of driving just because you never realize how dangerous it is until you're in an experience like that.
Yeah, and then the.
Question would be, is that the lesson that you want to learn from that?
Or is it that there was a baby and he'd ruined your Babe Ruth car like you were driving and something happened?
It's just like, is the adaptation, Is the learning useful?
59:48
If it isn't, then maybe we don't call it trauma.
Maybe we call it bad luck.
But trauma?
To a certain degree is a thing, isn't it?
Because.
Well, if you look at all available data and people that go through certain things, I don't know what that means.
But like, if you look at all available data, but if you're saying like, do people have emotional disturbances, I would agree with you.
1:00:06
I think if you tell people that they have trauma, they will absolutely be affected by whatever The thing is.
I'm saying that things happen.
So I gave the extreme example last time, but it's probably worth repeating.
So you're a 14 year old girl and you all of a sudden have this man you don't know and he has sex with you.
1:00:21
He's 35 years old.
Traumatic.
I think most people would be like, oh, that's a traumatic experience.
It was also just the Middle Ages and you might actually be a wonderful daughter doing her duty because that's when they got married and they would be married to men who are significantly older for alliances for their family.
1:00:37
Were they traumatized or was that just like actually the they were actually being a good daughter doing their duty as a as a daughter of their family.
So there's literally things that we can state with facts.
This happened.
A 35 year old man had sex with someone that he had never seen before and that she had never seen him and she was 14 years old.
1:00:58
That happened.
Everything else we do is the narrative we create around it.
And I use that extreme example which everyone like, you know pulls away when I say that, but it's like you have to use the extremes to make the point.
And so, like, if that can be both duty in one setting and horribly traumatic in another, that it means that the narrative's the thing that gives all the power, the.
1:01:17
Context has changed in society.
There's a lot of things that are different today that were normalized back then.
It doesn't make it necessarily OK, but well, but it's the surrounding.
Context.
Yes, my exact point is that if you have something bad that happens, another human at a different time period might have experienced that same thing.
1:01:35
And so the only reason that you choose to get upset about it and then get into a hyper learning phase about something good or bad is because you were told to.
Yeah, it could also.
Be in in context of what's happening around you, where if it's like if everyone else is doing it around you, if you're you now today, you're the outlier.
Or as maybe back then you were fitting in with everyone else who's also.
1:01:53
But that's just narrative.
Like I'm saying as a tool.
So for everybody who's listening to this, yeah, if you have something bad happen, you can think I will subscribe to the traumatic experience that my counselor has told me that I have gone through and they've labeled this thing.
And then I get to have, I just get to keep this problem with me forever.
1:02:08
Whenever I go in a new relationship, say, oh, I I had, I was traumatized earlier.
Like I have a hard time trusting people because of this reason that I'm making up right now.
OK, cool.
Or something happened.
OK, moving on.
It just doesn't matter.
1:02:24
It just doesn't matter.
Creating the label that you are now this way because is the problem, not the thing that's the problem, is the label that people ascribe to whatever circumstance.
Like.
And the more you, you'll start to note it, like the more attuned to this you get you, the more you see it all the time.
1:02:40
People are like, I'm the type of person who I am a right.
I'm a neat freak.
OK.
So you have this label you've described to yourself.
Now does that serve you in some way?
And like, in the beginning of every relationship, like, you're single.
Now you're dating.
Right.
So girls like you know or you'll probably come in and be like, I'm the type of person who does this, this and this.
And I am this way.
1:02:56
Like, you just give.
You're like, here are all my labels.
But like, what if you didn't do any of that?
You're like, I do things like sometimes I do these things, other times I don't.
I mean in a practical.
Sense.
I feel like it it is important to have some of those belief statements, right?
Would you agree with that if they serve you?
1:03:12
If they serve.
So you're saying belief statements like I am somebody who likes to keep my room clean?
Sure, that is a fine beliefs statement if it serves you.
If it's a good.
Thing.
But if it's like I am lazy, I am worthless.
I am unmotivated, I'm not funny, people don't like me, stuff like that.
1:03:27
I'm not confident.
Because my mom didn't tell me enough when I was a kid.
One, eliminate the because part because you don't know that there's a hundred other things that have that made you not motivated.
You just pick that one out of thin air.
Like, here's the reason, like you don't know.
So you really.
Do not believe in psychotherapy?
No.
Then well, my understanding is like you are who you are today because of these.
1:03:47
Well, you do what you've been rewarded for doing in the past, and you avoid things been punished for in the past.
That I absolutely agree with today.
But don't you believe?
Even as a child, let's say you could be shaped by your parents.
So let's just say you're told by your parents you are worthless.
You can never do anything like that's hard to break.
I think as an adult, I don't disagree.
1:04:03
With it, the fact that they're hard to break, I'm just saying you choose to believe it.
There's a choice.
Could it also be?
That your brain is wired in such a way that the neural pathways all point to you being worthless, and you're told that you will amount to nothing.
1:04:19
And it's so ingrained that when you become an adult, it's just like these are patterns that are really difficult to break, 'cause you've been told your entire life and you believe one thing, and shattering all of that takes a lot of work.
So to.
Anyone who has that that paradigm, you're right.
1:04:37
It's not your fault.
You're never gonna be successful.
Now what?
OK, well, maybe I can do something about it.
OK, great.
There's no benefit.
I get Q&A S every once in a while, and someone's like, can't grow my business because of my kids, right?
Like, they take up all my time and it's just impossible for me to do the things.
1:04:52
So what would you tell me?
They say you're right, you're never going to be successful and it's not your fault.
And then you can just watch the person just writhe.
They're just like, well, I mean, and I'm like, what?
You're going to fight me on the fact that you're going to be successful?
Great.
The fighter showed up.
So why are we?
1:05:07
What are we talking about?
Do you want my permission to not be successful?
Or do you want to accept that you're not gonna be like, what do you want?
And they're like, well, OK, it's like, well, yeah, there's your answer.
Like, whatever reason you're giving yourself is the very reason you should do the thing.
Like if your mom was mean as shit to your entire life and she told you were worthless, that's a great reason to be successful.
1:05:25
There's just as many people who've had terrible upbreaking who became successful.
See.
Why wouldn't you tell that?
Person who says I have kids, I can't be.
Give the business the time it needs.
Why wouldn't you tell that person practically?
Well, you're gonna have to structure your day better.
You're gonna have to sacrifice some time with your kids.
You're gonna have to wake up a little earlier.
It's gonna suck in the beginning.
1:05:40
You'll get used to it.
Why not go in with that approach 'cause I think that person.
'S looking for permission.
I think they're looking for an excuse that's reasonable that protects their ego.
I don't think so.
I think sometimes people just need to be told what to do.
They they might know what the answer is, but if you tell them what the answer is, they'll do it and they'll believe it because you're the one telling him, well, this person.
1:05:59
Was saying I'm not going to be like in the premise that I'm saying this person's saying I'm not going to be successful, here's my excuse, tell me it's OK that I have this excuse.
Then I say you're right, it's not your fault.
You're never going to win.
And then all of a sudden their whole psyche changes, 'cause they want to contrast, They want to rebel against that.
And they're like, what do you mean?
I mean, I I'm totally going to be like, right, cool.
1:06:15
So you agree, So you are going to win.
So what are we talking about, right.
It's like it's it's just this back and forth that people always rebel.
I just find that that context interesting because a lot of times if you actually just like put a knife in and just twist and say, sure, let's take it to the natural end, you'll never win, OK, How do you feel now?
Right.
So then you making all of that fanfare about all these reasons why it's justified that you won't win, how does that serve you?
1:06:36
It does it.
So you might as well act as though it didn't matter anyways and do the stuff that is required.
Just to be clear for everybody, like, I share the stuff that worked for me.
If what you're doing is working for you, then I love you keep crushing it.
You know what I mean?
Like, I I just share this stuff because people ask they're like, how did you do this by this time or whatever?
And I share my worldviews and they're relatively contrary.
1:06:53
A lot of, a lot of people believe as little as I believe about anything really.
There are a few things that I absolutely believe through and through.
And then the everything else for the most part, I feel is noise.
And that has helped me a lot because it has gotten me out of like, you know, 99% of the No 99, who knows?
But like a a vast majority of the content that I see on the Internet is there's a lot of fluff.
1:07:11
There's a lot of just like it's just BSA lot of people giving advice that have never done the thing that they're trying to give advice on.
And so it's like when people talk about like the you know energy and manifesting and you know psychology and affirmations and all these things.
It's like even this the statement like have you heard B do have have you heard that it's like A pretty big in like the personal development safe.
1:07:29
It's like B the certain way So you do the things to get what you want or have the thing right and it has to you have to be the person first then you can to do the things to have the thing right.
That's like being everyone's like B do have.
I think it's complete bullshit because being is a function of doing.
If we were to say who is this person, we would describe their identity by the things they do.
1:07:49
Like he is a Carpenter, he's into these things, he does, he takes these actions.
That is what creates his identity, how we describe it.
So if being is a function of doing, then we can just cut being out, right?
So it's just doing and then have.
But if the having comes from the doing, then that's an after effect.
1:08:07
That's an outcome, not the thing that created it.
And so the doing creates the having and so you can cut out the have.
And so it just comes down to doing.
And so we don't need to like, obsess about like am IA good person, am IA bad person, am IA villain, am I an asshole.
That's to the point that we're making the very beginning of this.
1:08:22
It's like, maybe you are an asshole, maybe you are a loser.
You can still do the stuff to win and win anyways.
If Graham identified as a loser tomorrow, like truly through his being identified as a loser and still made the same video and posted it, it would still crush.
And for me, that's actually given me a lot of shelter in hard times, which is like, I don't need to be the best whatever, and I don't even need to be in a great mood.
1:08:47
I don't need to identify as like some shiny night hero.
But I can still run these ads or make these calls or do these outreach attempts or make this partnership deal and I will still get the end result.
And to me that is very reassuring because it puts a lot more into my control.
Do you think that you?
1:09:03
Would do better in that case if you're feeling bad, if you were feeling better about yourself that you would have a better result if the exact.
Same activity was done, yes.
If I send the same 100 emails to the same exact people, whether I'm in bad mood or good mood, the same response rates would come back if you feel.
1:09:19
Like, you're in a really great mood.
Don't you feel like you could craft those emails in such a way that's maybe 1% and I'm talking?
About if we just stick to what the doing is, cuz then at that point it's like shake, great, we shifted the doing, but like the doing itself can just be done.
And I like that a lot because for people who are in hard times, it's like you don't have to feel confident to do shit.
1:09:39
You can still get the result for it.
Like you don't need to be confident to go up to the girl, you just go up to the girl and not be confident and still ask her out.
Basically what I'm trying to prevent against is the person who's waiting to be in a good mood to work, because that sometimes that good mood never comes, but the work still needs doing.








0:00
The best thing that I ever did was not listen to other people's opinions about my life.
They don't want the best version of you, they want the version of you who best serves them.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:16
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk, and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
People obsessed with their morning routines make less money than people obsessed with making money.
People work sacrifice and then they get rich.
0:34
Then they fill their time with weird routines.
Then they forget how they got rich in the 1st place and then they tell other people the weird routines made them rich rather than what they actually did, which is whatever it took, not some three hour morning routine.
There was a kid who DM me who said, hey, I've been working with this business coach and he has me doing morning routine.
0:56
Could not make this up.
After I do my grounded walking, I do my gratitude journal.
I do my list for the day.
I do my ice plunge.
It's like after I do that, it takes me about 3 hours in the morning to get all that done.
He's like I barely have any energy to like actually get work done.
I just said I'm going to give you the biggest hack in the world.
1:11
Cut the three hour morning routine, replace it with three hours of work and I promise you'll get more done.
And he messaged me back a week later.
He was like, dude, it changed my whole life.
I'm getting so much done now.
I was like, what a fucking concept.
If you work more, more gets done.
And I love just looking at this as like what actions do I have to take to get what I want?
Anything that is not that is a distraction from it.
1:29
Period.
If it takes you 5 minutes to feel 20% better and you can actually measure that your output goes up by 20%, then cool, That makes sense.
So I'm not.
I'm not against doing things.
I'm against doing things for the sake of doing them.
And so one of the biggest issues with learning and education as humans do it is that we make correlations to things that are approximate.
1:49
They're close to one another.
Tall people play basketball.
I should play basketball to get tall.
We make these very mistaking correlations.
But we should look at is what it took to get there, not what they're doing now.
So the better advice is to look at what someone was doing on their way up in the grind mirror that more than what they're currently doing at the top of the mountain.
2:05
So it would be like assuming Warren Buffett is rich because he drinks Coke, All you have to do.
Also on the corollaries, are there other people who drink Coke who aren't aren't rich?
I've had probably 10 different podcasts cede the premise.
You think that the fact that you had a hard childhood has created the success today.
And I would say no.
2:23
I would say the work that I did created the success.
And all we have to do is look at all the other people who had bad childhoods who aren't successful.
And I think there are way more of those than there are that are to prove that it actually has nothing to do with who's successful.
There's also people who didn't have bad childhoods who are successful too.
2:39
And so it's just that many people have bad childhoods.
Some of them become successful.
And so that's why trying to figure out why something happened.
I have spent less and less of my effort trying to do that and only look at what actions created the result, rather than looking at intention or anything else that's amorphous that can't be measured. 30 isn't the new 20.
3:02
It's an excuse to take 10 years longer to accomplish the same thing.
You can die when you're done.
Until then, keep going in your 20s.
You're young, you can fuck around.
It doesn't matter because life is long.
Number one, that assumes that you're not going to die.
If you're in your 30s, you know someone in your high school class who died.
3:18
And it's not just the drug overdose people, it's the people who got shot, got in a car accident, had a weird brain cancer.
I've had all of those things happened to people that I went to high school with.
In one way, I think it's a little bit arrogant to assume that you're just going to live because it means you can waste your life.
And I'd.
I'd wholeheartedly stand against that.
The second translation around that that I think has hurt a lot of people is that they can do what I would consider dead end jobs.
3:40
And that means jobs that don't have any direct correlation to your personal growth has nothing to do with pay.
You can work for free and grow more than anyone else.
This is not saying that you need to go into a season of earning in your 20s, but you do need to be setting yourself up for growth in my opinion if you want the big ultimate outcome.
3:58
And so most people that at least consume my stuff, they want to be better.
They want to grow, They want to get in better shape.
They want to have better relationships.
They want to have a Better Business, They want to be bigger in every way.
They want to expand.
If you spend the decade of your 20s not growing and not investing in your skills and your education, if you do that in your 30s, you're going to be further behind than somebody starts in their 20s, you're going to be a decade behind.
4:21
You know, nowadays there's kids who are starting out their entrepreneurial journey when they're like 13, and so when they're 23, they're Mr. Beast.
He's young, but he's actually pretty old in business terms because a lot of people start their business journey in their mid 40s.
And so if they're 50 years old and started their business five years ago, Mr. Beast says twice the amount of time in the ring under the bar that they do for me, I want to start my time clock on paying down my ignorance debt as fascinatingly possible because the debt is a constant for everyone.
4:47
All of us are trying to pay down that debt as fast as we can and taking a decade, arguably one of the most productive decades of your life, and not paying down that debt.
You just sit in such a deficit compared to your peer group.
Some people might watch this and be 30 or 40 or 50 and be like, well, shit, I took the wrong advice from the wrong guy.
5:04
Guess what?
You're going to die.
It's not going to matter anyways.
Big deal.
Whatever the best time to do this was, start when you were 10 and get born to an entrepreneurial parent who got you in their small business business and invested in all of your education as a home schooled student and taught you all the ways of the of the Jedi.
But you probably didn't have that.
5:20
And so the second best time just to start now because let's play out the alternative.
How much does it serve you to just say, I guess I have no chance, OK, die.
There's nothing left for me to do.
I will relinquish the remainder of my living days and years because I choose to lose.
5:36
And that's a choice.
And if you want that, that's cool.
The idea of quitting simply because you're older because you didn't do something, everybody doesn't do things that they know they should be doing now.
And that's because you're always going to know more in the future than you do in the past.
5:52
And so it's a faulty premise to say that I'm not going to take action today because I didn't know something in the past.
Everyone doesn't know anything in the past, but all you can do is take action with what you know today.
And by taking action you have learned.
And so you actually take one step to making your first payment on ignorance, debt through actions, not words.
6:10
I mean, I think a lot of people know the story of the 30 year old barista.
If you love that, then and do it.
I mean, like I have no judgment on what you do.
If you don't love that and you wish you were doing something else, that's what I would say I have a problem with, which is why are you not doing it.
And I think diving into that, which is usually some sort of fear, some sort of anxiety, some sort of label that they believe that isn't true from someone else and just trying to zone in on like, why am I not doing it and taking two steps closer to it, not just like, because I don't know what I'm doing.
6:38
Well, duh, OK, neither does anyone.
What are you doing about that?
Just defining it to what actions am I going to take as a result just makes life a lot easier.
Let's figure it out, man.
It means that I'm going to read 2 hours a night on a specific subject until I feel like I can make a decision within 30 days on what I'm going to do.
Great.
That is something I can do and I can measure whether I did it or not.
6:57
You have seasons of earning and you have seasons of learning.
I had this kid who reached out.
He was 18 years old, said he was going to edit videos for us When he came in, he said I want $100,000 a year as an editor, as a starting job.
His reasoning was that somebody else had offered him that amount of money.
7:15
I want to make the statement because I think it's logical and also stupid.
If you're optimizing for your earning potential in your 20s, you're missing the fucking point.
This individual had the potential to be on a team that has a massively globally recognized brand in terms of media and from there learn how to be way better than they currently are and then become a creative director at another company or at one of My Portfolio.
7:39
Companies like that is the career path and instead was comparing that to something that you would make $100,000 a year and be the only person in the department and no one there knew anything about media.
And so he wasn't going to learn, he was going to earn.
Whereas somebody who got into the big leagues and learned 10 times the skill set then ten years later is either starting a multi $1,000,000 company or hitting up a multi million dollar division in a billion dollar company.
8:05
And the potential is so much wider because 10 years from now someone says what's your experience?
It's like, well I I worked at a real estate firm and I made their social media content.
Who gives a shit?
Whereas if you're like I work for one of the biggest media companies out there, everyone will give you the job offer and that is when you can choose to earn over learn.
8:22
But people make the trade too soon because they compare themselves to people on social media and think that the .0001% is the norm.
Whenever you choose to earn rather than learn, you're right.
Hooking life and saying I'm no longer going to develop and this is good enough.
And so if 100,000 a year is actually good enough for your long term goals then do it.
8:40
But I would imagine that it probably isn't for what you really want to do long term.
I'm using 100, you know, six figures as a as a placeholder it can be whatever number you want.
When you make that decision that you're no longer going to learn, that's when you stop growing your potential to learn more.
I say this because that's what I did.
I had a white collar consulting job for defense contracting at a top secret clearance.
8:58
I had everything that looked good on paper, space, IBER and intelligence.
I had a two to three-year path clearly for for getting an NBA at an Ivy League school and then decided to drop all of that and start working for $13.00 an hour at a gym after I graduated Maggie Cum Laude in three years from Vanderbilt.
I know what I'm asking people to do and I'm not asking them to do something that I wasn't willing to do.
9:17
And I think that I might have even a more extreme version that most people are having to live with.
Trying to say like, well, I can't figure out what I want, is a really paralyzing place to be that I think a lot of young people are in.
It's like, I want to find my passion.
But the big misnomer is actually a language issue, which is that people say they want to find their passion around it.
9:34
They want to build it or create it or learn it.
And so, like, I can promise you that if you're good at something, you'll like doing it.
And the only way that you get good at something is by doing things that you suck at and doing a lot of it.
So let's say you make $50,000 a year.
It cost you $950,000 a year not to know how to make $1,000,000 a year.
9:51
So how much is that education worth?
Answer the difference, the difference between $1 million and $50,000, which is 950 grand.
If you learn how to make $1,000,000, the education is worth the difference.
It's why education and information are the most valuable things that we can know.
10:09
Elon has like lost everything and then gained it back.
So many of the best off runners have stories where they lost it all and then gained it back.
And so how is it that they can go to 0, back to a billion where somebody starting at 0 can't get there?
Because they didn't lose the education, they didn't lose the learning.
They had a bad role.
10:24
And sometimes in business you do make bets on markets and sometimes they don't shape up.
But you didn't lose.
And a lot of times you actually gain in experience so that the next bet pays off even bigger.
Everyone gets this wrong.
The most expensive thing you ever pay for isn't your car, isn't your house, isn't your insurance.
10:42
It's the information that you don't know but should.
I mean, how many things can you think of right now that if you knew 10 years ago would have materially changed your financial outcome, your relational outcome, your physical outcomes?
Probably a lot.
What is the value of that information?
Borderline priceless.
10:57
And so the idea that we wouldn't invest in paying down that debt of ignorance that we owe the universe, It's just because we don't know who we're paying the check to every month for the things that we don't know, that we don't value it appropriately.
The cost of success is the years of feeling like an idiot for things that you should have known by now.
11:14
All the the decisions that I made-up to this point led me to here.
And I don't regret my life.
So I don't regret not knowing.
I mean, if I started over, I'd be wealthier than I am now.
You know what I mean?
I can't go back in time.
But if I could go back in time to talk to my 20 year old self and it wouldn't change the outcome of my life now because I would never roll that dice, I would say there's two things that you don't understand that will massively change your life.
11:35
You don't understand brand and you don't understand product.
Because I was obsessive in my 20s on sales and and marketing and what I would consider fast money, I had fast feedback loops.
So I would, I'd get better at sales and then I'd immediately make more sales.
I get better marketing, immediately make more money.
And so I had this very fast feedback loop that gave me the misinformation or the false belief that this was the right path, but I was actually just playing the wrong game because it's kind of like in the Matrix when Neo system Morpheus.
12:02
So you're saying when I'm fast enough, I'll be able to dodge bullets.
And he said, no, I'm saying when you're ready, you won't have to.
Me being obsessive about sales and marketing was me trying to get fast, faster and faster in the Matrix and not being the one and seeing the code for what it is, which is that if you make a product that's good enough, people will do the marketing and sales for you.
12:22
If your brand is strong enough, people will make the association that they want to buy your stuff, regardless of how good your copy and your headline and your landing pages and your conversion rate optimization and your media buying are.
I kept getting really good at a game that, if I knew how to master the big things that mattered, would make those skills almost irrelevant.
12:40
When $100 million offers came out, the book, I didn't make it for anything.
I made it for me, and it was originally intended to be an internal document.
And so I just wanted to make it exceptional.
And what happened once I released it is what shocked me the most was that I posted once and I just said, hey, I wrote this book, I hope you guys like it.
12:55
And then we sold out in minutes and I was like, that's weird.
The next month more copies sold, and then the next month more copies sold.
And then the next month more copies sold.
And it's continued to sell more copies month after month after month for two years, and it's still number one in its category on Amazon.
And that was with zero paid marketing purely off of people telling people about the book.
13:13
And so when I saw how much leverage that was, that that book sells thousands a day, not dollars, thousands of copies a day.
I have never marketed anything well enough to sell 1000 customers a day.
Now mind you, I've always had more expensive stuff that I've sold.
But like I'd never seen that kind of transaction volume.
13:30
And the only way to get that kind of transaction volume is to have a huge amount of leverage, The leverage that product unlocked from here.
That understanding was that if you make it good enough and I love this saying which is there's too big to fail and I love the other one which is too good to fail, Mosey Nation real quick.
13:47
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
And if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
14:06
My headline for $100 offers makes no sense.
No one knows $100 offers is and it's just like a picture of $100 bill.
It's a big purple book.
Like, it actually makes no sense.
But the contents of the book were valuable enough that people were like just just read it.
And they said it so many times to so many people And most people who when I see the comments and I see the reviews, they say I had four different people in the same month tell me in different groups that I should read this book.
14:30
So I decided to do it even though it looked hokey and Oh my God, this thing is unbelievable.
And then they tell 20 people or 100 people.
That was when I realized how much leverage spending more time up front on building a better product would unlock for me.
What I used to do was spend two months building a good product and spent two years marketing that product with great marketing rather than and spending two years on a great product.
14:52
And then for the rest of my life not having to spend any dollars or effort on marketing so that it would sell again and again and again because of the quality of the product itself.
And so that was the first lesson that my younger self needed to understand about business and the level of detail that it takes to go from good to great is so much wider than people think it is.
15:11
The difference between an 8 and a nine is 10 times the work.
The difference between 9:00 and 9:00 and 1/2 is 10 times the work difference between 9 and a half. 9.75 is another 10 times the work.
It's so much more effort.
And honestly, when I was younger, I couldn't even comprehend the amount of work that I can do now.
And for me, that amount of work is the amount of unbroken focus time that I can stick with one task.
15:29
I did not have that level of focus.
I didn't have a strong enough no muscle, I didn't know how to turn down other things that would distract me for long enough.
If you can count in terms of hundreds, like I can promise you if you put 1000 hours into something, it'll probably be pretty good.
And most people spend like 100 hours on something.
15:44
Or I mean, that's shit.
Most people spend even less time than that.
You start a clock when you start working.
You stop a clock when you stop working.
You spend 1000 hours or 2000 hours on something.
There's a level of detail because of the number of exposures you'll get to it, the crispy details of the product or the service.
16:00
That can only come from looking at that thing when it's cold, looking at things when it's hot, looking at it when you're angry, looking at it when you're sad, looking at it when you're inspired, looking at it when you're bored.
You see it with different lenses.
And then what happens is it just gives you so much more depth and context to whatever you're trying to build that that's the the difference between mediocre products and excellent products.
16:18
And it just takes time.
In an ocean of volume, which there's more commoditized products and services today than ever before, there's outsize returns to being number one.
It is an even bigger winner take all market now than ever has been because of social media and the ease of letting other people know about stuff.
16:35
If you are truly the best, everyone will know.
And if everyone knows you are the best, you will have more demand than you can possibly deal with.
People think that word of mouth is dead when there's literally never been an easier way to go viral in a literal sense from people telling other people about stuff.
I said the second lesson was brand.
16:51
And so I had to look at a company or brand as a learning tool, as what are people going to learn to associate my brand with the tangible and the intangible ideas?
There are many people that I associated with when I was younger that I would never associate with today, even though I would say, well, I don't act that way, I don't live my life the way they live their lives.
17:12
People would still make that association.
If I did nothing but talk with porn stars on my show, people would still make a very different association with me.
And so I want to embody certain values that I want my brain to associate with.
And anything that is not those things, by default detracts from it because it dilutes the association.
17:32
Branding is like trading a garden.
We're pretty much anything.
But the flower that you're trying to grow there is a weed.
Even if it's a daffodil, even if it's a sunflower, even if the flower itself is fine.
Like I said, I have no issues with porn.
I think it's a sunflower, whatever.
But if I'm trying to grow roses, then anything that's not a rose doesn't belong.
17:48
Being so vigilant about defending that garden of association and reputation gives you so much leverage because the reason Warren Buffett now can just do deals that no one else can do is because his handshake means more than the US government.
If he says he will pay, we know he will pay.
18:04
If he says he will be there to insure your entire city, we know he will.
He can do a deal on a one page agreement for billions of dollars because people trust and they know that his reputation matters more than anything to him.
And so trust is leverage for deals.
It's leverage for sales.
18:20
The first experience I had with having a strong brand was when we were probably a year, year and a half into gym launch.
I launched what would become Alan, my software project.
And when people heard I had launched a new thing, the clients that I had were sending screenshots of their credit cards to my customer support team saying, I don't know what it was, but if Alex made it, I'll buy it.
18:41
And so all of the ideas and the obsessions around how I was going to market it and how I was going to position it, the thing that mattered most was what they had already received from me and how much I delivered on my first promise.
And so when I realized that, I was like all of the sales and marketing stuff gets you one sale, delivering exceptional product, exceptional reputation around your products.
19:02
It gets you every other sale after that.
And you could always be able to sell the next thing provided you delivered on the first day.
And that's where there's this obsession with marketing because there's always more people to sell to.
It's a very, in my opinion, tiring life.
You always have to go get new customers.
If you make sales to get customers rather than get customers to make sales, you make the customer the goal and then you get to keep that relationship.
19:25
And then next year, you still have that customer.
If you've got a customer just to make a sale, you have to go get another customer to make another sale next year.
But if you make a sale to create the relationship of the customer, then next year that customer will buy again and the new customer will buy.
And the third year you'll get the first two years and the third customer.
19:41
And then that is how you create a compounding vehicle.
And so both of those things, brand and product, are actually underlying 1 concept now that I'm saying it out loud, which is I didn't understand compounding.
I thought that it was normal to have to go out, bang doors, call phones, DM run ads to get customers every single month.
19:57
And that next month I'm gonna have to get another 20 just to keep the lights on, rather than having spent more time on my reputation and the quality of my product.
So that when I sold the first hundred, they would never leave again.
And then they would send me the next 100 and I wouldn't have to do anything.
And then I would be able to fend people off.
20:13
And then I'd be able to raise my prices and be able to take people on my terms.
But I didn't understand any of that.
And part of that is because I wanted money so fast.
And building a great product takes longer.
Building a great reputation literally never stops until the day you die.
Leaning into that lesson, you know the first book I launched and I think it did 2 or 4000 copies sold its first month, something like that.
20:33
You know, the second book that launched 2 years later sold 250,000 copies in its first month, which for context, the average New York Times best seller sells between 10 and 100,000 in its first 12 months and we sold 250 in the first month.
The only way that that could happen is if the people who bought the first book buy the second book and everybody, they tell all so much and that book still continues to sell at twice the rate of my first book today.
20:57
Here's how to spot friends that are worth cutting.
They only talk about your past, not your future.
So if you go and you hang out with your buddies and all they can really reminisce with you on is the things that you did together, but none of them are talking about what they're going to do or what you're going to do.
For me, that's a telltale sign that they're living in the past.
21:14
They're not even living in the present.
Their best years are behind them.
And for most of us, we want our best years to be ahead of us.
And we want somebody who's also looking at the same goal as us, which is growth, which is moving forward, just making progress.
If you are growth oriented individual and you feel like you're not sure about your environment or if it's conducive, the easiest limit test is who talks about the future and who talks about the past.
21:36
Keep the ones who only talk about the future.
Cut the ones talking about the past.
The best thing that I ever did was not listen to other people's opinions about my life.
They don't want the best version of you.
They want the version of you who best serves them.
Now, when I first said this, I got Flack from a bunch of parents.
21:52
They're like, I really want the best for my kids.
I was like, that's not true.
You want a version of your children who serves what you think will make you look the best.
Family, I would say more often than not has a closer alignment with your long term goals than strangers do, and so it makes sense that family would have more aligned interests but not completely aligned interests with you because the only person who has a completely aligned interest with you is future you.
22:17
Keeping that is the litmus test of whose opinion I'm going to listen to, although it's more difficult, has ultimately been very fruitful for me.
Because if you're looking at 2, even 2 parents, you can just prove that concept by saying, OK, well, both parents want different things.
For me, of the things that both parents want, which of the things help each of the parents individually out?
22:34
Because I can promise you that the thing that one parent wants doesn't hurt them and help the other parent if they disagree.
It's usually something that's more aligned with their worldview, their beliefs, or what they will get status from in their community for you doing.
And so all of the things I just described have nothing to do with you.
So why consider it?
22:51
I'll say this up front.
I hate why questions, because who knows why.
But I would say that I if if I had to make a guess on why we care about other people's opinions, it's because we've learned to care about other people's opinions.
And when we're children, we learn to Orient ourselves to the world through other people telling us what is what.
23:06
Literally, when you're a kid, you point and then you say, what's that?
And then they say this.
And so you have to listen to other people on the way up.
The problem is at some point you have to turn it off and say, you know, some of the people I was listening to had no idea what they were saying, but you don't know.
They have no idea because you have a context.
23:22
You make a judgement.
You have to learn to become human, and then you have to learn to become yourself.
And I think that at that turning point, you then have to analyze the beliefs that you've been given and then keep the ones that you choose.
Most parents are risk averse rather than risk taking for their children.
23:37
So like, we're willing to take more risk for ourselves often times that our parents are willing to take on our behalf.
And I think that's normal.
They want to, like, keep you alive.
There's a lot of evolutionary Dr. behind that.
And so they're playing not to lose.
But if you want to play to win, you have to take it from bets.
I think a lot of younger people get really confused because they spend a lot of time talking about ideas and very little talking about doing actions.
23:55
And so if you're just defined the world by only things that occur in it and not things that occur in your mind, there's a lot less noise.
And so it becomes easier to see the forest with trees.
Let's say I have an employee and I want to hop on a one-on-one and they said something in a meeting before.
And I say I think the intention behind your statement was that you wanted me to do this.
24:14
And this is how I was feeling about your statement.
And this is probably where you were feeling.
Everything I just said is a complete waste of time because all I know is that they said this.
And so just focus on the facts.
And if you can do that, it actually makes living life a lot easier or navigating life a lot easier.
24:29
At least it has for me, because those are the only objective truths.
An easy frame for that is like, would it be admitted to a court as evidence?
You saying you were offended is not evidence.
John said this to Sally.
These words, That's evidence indisputable.
And so just look at the things that are beyond reproach.
24:45
Look at the things that are indisputable.
Look at the things that are facts that are observable, and the world gets a lot quieter.
And you also realize that most people are full of shit and don't know what they're talking about.
I mean, if someone was like, hey, Alex, why did you get into business?
I could make up an answer.
It just how do we know it's true?
Trying to figure out someone's intention is bullshit.
25:02
If someone asks me why did you get into business?
I can make U an answer.
Anyone can make U an answer.
Why do you like making money?
Why do you like sales?
Why do you like marketing?
Why are you good at this?
I can make U any answer.
All I know is that these things have occurred and so we can look at my actions and we can look at the results, the rest of it of which which had what influence on what?
25:21
Like I can't relive my life and I can't run the experiment And so trying to determine why like was it because my mom didn't hug me?
Was it because my dad hugged me too hard.
Who knows?
I can give anyone and someone will nod and say great because we've trained ourselves to say to answer when someone says why do you do that, you give them words and they nod and say though that's interesting but like it doesn't mean it's true.
25:37
And so I just try and skirt the whole conversation because there's no point.
So when someone's like, well, I'm the type of person who I'm like, just stop.
Then they start using this label to decide whether or why they can or can't do something.
I wouldn't be successful with that because I'm a knee freak.
Why?
25:53
Because you take trash out of your car regularly.
Why does that have anything to do with whether you could do this or not?
I used to think and told people I was bad at math until I was 25, post college, post, consulting job, all of it.
And then I decided that I was not going to be bad at math.
And so I was like, okay, well, I'm not gonna use a calculator.
26:10
And so then I started getting better and better at doing math problem.
And then lo and behold, when I took the GMAT, I was like, okay.
I have to study twice as hard for the math section, and I did just as well in the math section as I did on my verbal.
But my whole life I had said I was bad at math, and so I didn't study as hard because I was bad at it.
26:26
Everyone who's listening to this has something they say about themselves.
They're like, I'm not organized, I'm an early bird, right?
Like, we have these labels we give ourselves, But like, why do we have these labels?
Like, if you needed to wake up early, fucking wake up early.
If you need to stay up late, you stay up late.
The labels change our behavior more than we change the labels.
I really abhor labels overall because I feel like it limits my action.
26:45
When I get on podcast and I have talks and people try and label me, you'll probably actively see me break the label almost every time because I'm really aware of it and a lot of people aren't.
And I don't think people do it on purpose in a bad way.
I just think that they will speak things over you, which is why I hate going home because no one speaks shit over you more than your family and the people who knew you in high school.
27:03
Alex has always had a short temper.
You you're a hot head, literally.
People from home describe me that way.
I was like, I don't think I'm a hot head.
They will say that.
And then I feel like I have to really put up my mental, like defenses to be like, this is not true.
Here is the evidence that this is not true.
What would a hot head do in these scenarios?
27:19
That is not the way I behaved, therefore, right?
And I have to, I have to basically unwind that shit whenever I go there.
And so that is why I've been an advocate of, like, if you want to change your behavior, change your environment.
Because they're not going to reinforce labels that you then also perpetuate in your own mind by the actions you take as a result.
And the only reason they want to label is because it's shorthand for other people to understand, not because it's true.
27:38
They just want to say he had a bad child.
And so they take, oh, your whole life and they say bad.
That's not true.
There's more nuance to it.
I prefer to think of ideals and think of taking steps towards those ideals.
And since ideals are not binary, of like he is courageous or he is not courageous, but how courageous is he, Or how patient is he?
27:53
Not impatient or patient, but how much?
Then I know the values that I want to embody.
And then I just take steps towards those every day with the actions I take.
And so if I'm deciding do I want to take this action, I'll say which action aligns most of the values that I want to embody, And then I try to do that.
28:09
So rather than being like Alex is patient, be like Alex attempts to act in accordance with the value of patience and sometimes fall short, but it tries as dark.








0:00
And if you cannot quiet your emotions, there's no way that you're going to be able to move to the next level.
And so it does require this sort of deadening of your emotional reactions.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:20
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
One of the fun quotes that I love about businesses business is simply mathematical decisions made within the context of human psychology, which essentially means that you need to do arithmetic and division and algebra in order to make business decisions and then overlay that on the people that they're going to affect, right?
0:50
And so one of the fun things is that, and if you look at really, really high up CE OS, like you look at, you know, Elon Musk or you look at Mark Zuckerberg and you listen or Warren Buffett and you listen to them speak, right.
They sound like computers, like Bill Gates.
They sound like, like robots.
1:06
They sound devoid of inhuman, any human emotion.
And I think that there's the nature and nurture part of it, which is that there's some people who are, you know, CE OS who are, I don't want to say like sociopaths, but like basically who have a little bit less human affect than others.
And they're able to make mathematical decisions despite some of the emotions that may be around them, which actually make Better Business sense, even though they may be difficult.
1:28
The thing is, is that once you get up to that level, that billionaire status.
And I'm not there.
But I'm just saying if you observe the people who are there, it's a very common trend.
And I think this is my you know, position is that the reason that they're able to achieve that is because they're able to make decisions to void of human emotion.
1:46
And so the the human within the context of human psychology, the second part of that sentence a lot of times comes into play when you're talking about sales and marketing and positioning because all of that is soft skills.
But when it comes to the business model, monetization and then in some in some instances making the difficult decisions around personnel, a lot of times your emotions are really only things that are going to get in your way.
2:11
There are a lot of decisions right now that you may or may not be making because you have emotional charge around them.
So you may have a firing decision or a hiring like somebody who you know is not best for that position and it is up to you as the business owner to be able to make the decision without the emotion.
2:31
And So what happens is, and this is something that I've noticed is that I've become less and less reactive as we have gone higher up, higher and higher up in business because you have to be and if you aren't, then you won't keep moving up.
And so it's like if you see these people all the way up here and some part of you might say like I don't know if I want to be that.
2:49
And that's fair.
But in order to get all the way up here, you basically in some ways have to become like a robot and and and be able to show up neutral in all situations so that you can't get hot headed.
So that you can show up consistently to your team and make decisions that they can have faith in.
3:08
That they are logical, that they are based on math, They are based on reason and not based on like swings of emotion, of feeling like we're doing great, Oh no, we suck.
Because the reality is that usually it's in the middle.
But like one of the lessons that I've learned has been that nothing is ever as good as you think it's going to be or as bad as you think it's going to be.
3:26
The only things that are above those things are things that you don't think about.
So the only things that will be worse than you ever imagined are things that you didn't expect to come, Anything that like nothing is going to be better than you imagined except for things that you didn't expect to have happen, right.
I did not expect Jim wants to take off the way that it did because the original model that we had was not the model that we switched to.
3:45
I did not have a huge anticipation for because I was actually getting out of the business when I made the decision to switch into a done with you model instead of a done for you model.
And that's when everything took off.
And so it's the things that we don't expect often times that that do, the things that are beyond that.
And the reason I'm saying this is because we have so much emotion that's charged around the future, charged around our anxieties or our or our hopes.
4:07
And a lot of times that impairs our ability to function today.
And a lot of times, whether it's good or bad, how you show up to the team in a positive way or negative way, like if you're somebody who's like really cold or really hot, like if you're like I always want to be positive, like that also is not good because it just shows that you're not stable.
4:24
And so the goal in my belief, and what I observe with people who are doing much better than me, is that I talk about this all the time, that it's quiet.
They keep their surroundings quiet, They always show up the same.
That's why consistency is so key, so that you have these routines in place that you can show up the same every single day, independent of the circumstances around you, so that you can make the decisions using the same frameworks and using logic and the feelings.
4:50
And so one of the goals that Leo always has is as a leader and she puts this post it on her on her computer, is be neutral.
And so it's, it's the reason it's so hard is that the middle path is so difficult, right?
It's the dichotomy of leadership.
5:05
Like you want to be really high when it's high and you want to be really low when it's low.
And entrepreneurs by nature tend to be more emotional.
That's what creates the creative spark, that's creates the desire to innovate.
It's what is the initial thing that allows you to get that emotion going, to take the risk to leave your job, to start the business to to to do all these things.
5:24
And then the moment you start it, you have to be the opposite of who you are in order to succeed.
And so it's very counterintuitive that you're like, wait, I have to be devoid of emotion.
And So what happens is you have to start these things with practice.
It's like, well, how do I do that?
5:40
How to make emotions without feelings?
And the best way, at least in my experience, is to always break it down to math, right, is to break it down to math and put as many decisions as I can through data and actually extrapolate out what this decision means data wise.
5:57
And so a lot of times, if you're lucky at OK, how much it will it cost me to keep someone in a position that they are not suited for?
And then I start breaking down, OK, well, I have the cost that I'm actually paying and that's the hard cost, right?
And then I have the soft cost of the job that they're actually not doing.
6:14
So it's like there's money that's going out for them, right?
And then there's the value that they're not added, which is actually a double burn.
And then if there's someone who's in leadership, then it's all of the downstream effects of the decreased effectiveness of the entire team.
And then you have the hard cost for those members.
6:31
And so you can see how these things extrapolate out.
And so breaking it down to the numbers like that sometimes can give you the confidence to make the decisions that sometimes are difficult to make.
And I think that what happens over time is that you just get used to it.
6:50
Mozi Nation real quick, if you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
And if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
7:10
And so your skin gets thicker.
And a lot of times if you look at some of these interviews like I was referencing, if you, if you watch these CE OS, these super high level entrepreneurs, they're very deliberate with how they speak and what they say because they've done it so many times.
7:29
It becomes second nature.
And it's difficult to develop that type of thick skin without going through the fire pit and the gauntlet of having, you know, employees that you loved start trying to sue you and having it.
But I'm saying that these things happen to you.
7:46
Elon Musk was on a podcast the other day, and he's like, he has, like 25 lawsuits ongoing at any time.
Like, people suing him because the car didn't drive them to work every day, like ridiculous things because he's elevated to that position.
And if you cannot quiet your emotions, there's no way that you're going to be able to move to the next level.
8:05
And so it does require this sort of deadening of your emotional reactions.
And so it's that's my current chapter that I'm on right now of this little entrepreneurship journey, is looking at all the things that create emotion in my life, both positive and negative, and seeing how it affects me and how I show up on a daily basis.
8:24
And then more importantly, how it affects the decisions that I'm able to make with Claire.
And so my, my urgent to you is right now there probably are some decisions that you are not making because they're emotionally charged.
And what you need to do is look at it within the context of math and say does this make sense and do it like and you have to make the hard choice.
8:45
And a lot of times the hard choice is not the popular, it's not the one that makes you everyone's best friend.
But The thing is, is that it will either be you who makes the hard choice to to in the moment today or the hard choice would be made for you by the marketplace because your business will not work.
9:02
And so it's it's a constant, like I feel like life a lot of times, man, this is a big broad statement, but life a lot of times is, is sacrificing your short term comfort for your long term benefit.
And so when it comes to fitness, sacrificing your short term comfort of eating what you want to eat for your long term benefit, sleep for sacrificing your short term benefit of like, well, I want to watch one more episode.
9:23
I want to stay up a little bit later.
I want to, I want to waste time on my phone rather than going to sleep.
Right.
But the long term benefit is clear.
I want to keep this person on because maybe they'll turn around, but they probably won't.
You already know that if you had to bet on it, you probably wouldn't bet on, right?
I'm just using that as an example.
9:38
There's a million other things that you have to do.
Same thing with clients.
If you have a client who is just consistently granting your attention, just get them out, you know what I mean?
But it's hard.
And the reason it's hard is the reason that most is why most people don't succeed.
That's it.
So like, the advanced people don't do anything advanced.

They just never don't do the basics.
And so like, this is something that I'm continuing to go back to, at least in the season that we're in entrepreneur Rayleigh is, it's consistently revisiting the basics of like how can I do the basics better rather than how can I find advanced things.
And I think that a lot of us, you know, and I say this a lot, but like we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
10:17
Like if you've ever, like Bruce Lee said, I don't fear a man who's done 1000 kicks one time, but the man who's done one kick 1000 times, right?
Like, we get better by doing the same things over and over again.
And that's like and it's boring.
10:32
And that's what makes it hard.
And that's why most people don't succeed, is that they want something that's fun and exciting because that's what entrepreneurs want.
But business requires consistency, and the business requires you to be everything that you weren't born to be.
10:48
And that is why most people don't make it.
So just food for thought.
If you have some things that you need to do, just do them.
Take out, take the math outlook at it from pure numbers and make the decision as though it were someone else's company.
And then you'll be surprised at how, how easy and how clear some of those decisions can be.
11:08
One other context or frame that I like to make some decisions on is if I were significantly smarter than myself, what would I tell myself to do?
And or if I were the smartest man in the world, what would that guy do?
And if you think about things, I know it's silly, but a lot of times you think that guy would be a super genius and he would look at it.
11:26
It's purely like this, dollars and cents.
And then you'd be amazed at the quality of the decisions that come out of that type of thought process.

I'm going to solve 3 massive business problems that are going to take you from 10 to $100 million.
And at the end, I'm going to walk you through the framework so that you can apply this to your business, your work or your personal brand.
I recently spoke an event and had AQ and a section and there were three different business owners that presented with different problems.
0:16
One was an appointment setting business and they knew how to set appointments and build outbound teams for agencies, coaches, consultants, whatever.
The second business was a marketing agency for HVAC business owners.
The third was actually a very big influencer, 30 to 40 million subscribers across office platforms with the objective of making more money.
0:32
So each of them had very differently phrased questions, but they were all suffering from the same constraint and it wasn't what they thought it was.
So the first business that asked a question was an employment setting business and he was saying that his problem was that he needed to get more customers, which by the way, most of the time that's not the problem.
It's usually because the customers you have keep leaving and that's the real problem.
0:49
And when we look at businesses to invest in, at acquisition.com, we operate off of a singular concept, which is the theory of constraints.
A business will grow up to its constraint and then it will grow no longer.
Most entrepreneurs continue to work on the things that they enjoy rather than the things that the business needs, usually because they haven't actually identified the correct constraint.
1:07
For example, if you have a three-step sales process and you get 50% to go through step one, 5% to go through Step 2 and then 50% to go through step three, you could improve each of them by 10%.
But which of them makes the biggest difference in your business?
Going from 5 to 15 triples the business, whereas the other ones only incrementally improve it by 20%.
1:28
He had a very low quality of customers.
The vast majority of customers didn't make enough money, they didn't stay long enough, they didn't have enough skills, etcetera.
That was what he thought he had to solve.
He said, OK, of all of the companies that you've ever worked with, which of them made the most money off of the appointments that you set?
1:44
Right?
And he had a very specific answer of what type of avatar he did best with.
And so there's two directions for that business.
One is you niche down on your service delivery and say these are the only types of businesses I'm going to take because they're going to be worth more, stay longer, refer, etc.
That is probably the easiest next step for that business.
2:02
I were going to own this business and I transplanted my brain and my experience in his body that she could own half of a 50 to $100 million business that he grows over the next 5 to 10 years, picking the most valuable business that he sets appointments for.
What would the marketing spend be of a business that's doing $50 million a year?
2:20
Realistically, probably somewhere in the neighbor of five to $10 million a year.
So he could either partner with that business or spend a year or two learning how that business works so that then he owns both sides of it.
If you partner, you can usually go faster, but you give up some of the upside because you slice the pie.
2:35
It's up to you because most business owners, the reason they don't create valuable businesses because they have to keep doing the same work over and over again and they don't get credit for it.
We're basically sentenced to this terrible Atlas like existence of rolling the boulder up the hill and then rolling it back down every every month.
If the team that he built was 50 outbound guys this month and then next month he starts at 50 because it's all within the same company, and then does another 50 and then another 50-6 months later, he's got 300 outbound guys that are all still working for him, all generating revenue that he is owning a slice of all of it.
3:08
This is #2 was the HVAC agency.
This is a business that markets for HVAC companies.
They had 50 or so clients in that niche and they're running campaigns across 50 different local markets.
If he's able to generate leads and fill up 50 different HVAC services pipelines because of his marketing prowess, he probably has the marketing skill of a 50 to $100 million HVAC business.
3:33
If you have a $5,000,000 marketing agency, then it's reasonable that some of the clients that you serve are making $50 million in revenue off the services you're generating and you're getting none of that.
You're only capturing the service fee.
The more steps you take towards owning the the result, the more you're basically just doing the business for them.
3:51
But at a certain point, you are the business and so it makes sense for you to own the economics of the business.
And either you've got to learn the HVAC business or you partner with someone who already knows it, or you could buy one and with your marketing prowess, you juice the hell out of it.
Most people will try and buy it, but then also try and keep this agency thing going.
4:08
But sometimes you got to take a half step back so you can take 20 steps forward the fastest way.
Build a $10 million business is often not the fastest way to build $100 million business.
If you wanted to build a building that was 10 stories tall, you would start with a very different foundation.
Now imagine you built A10 story building and then said, OK, I want to build 100 story building using the same foundation.
4:28
You wouldn't be able to, but that's exactly what most entrepreneurs do when they're trying to scale and they wonder why they're stuck is because they built it wrong to begin with.
Because they were in the wrong opportunity vehicle.
One of the big things that took me too long to learn, it's the size of the slice of the pie that matters, not the shape of the slice of the pie.
4:44
They obsess about the shape of the slice rather than having a slice that's like this of a much bigger pie.
The average IPO founder when a company IPOs 12, 1/2% of the company they founded because the more people you make money the more money you ultimately make.
5:00
The third business was the big influencer business, 30 or 40 million subscribers across all the platforms and they were focusing all of their attention on how do we get more high quality videos out.
And when I asked them what problem are you trying to solve, they said we want to make more money.
You're seeing your business as this box of media and trying to make more better videos which if you want to do brand and just continue to build the brand before making ask that would be the right problem to solve.
5:22
But they were at 97 out of 100, they're a .000001% creator.
So do we really think that their constraint of their business is that they aren't good enough at marketing?
No, probably not.
You guys are trying to take your 97 out of 100 media company to a 99 out of 100 media company when the objective you said was to make more money and you have no product that you sell.
5:45
So all of your monetization relies on sponsorships and AD an ad revenue which is typically the least efficient way to monetize because anyone who pays you for a sponsorship is making a huge arbitrage on your brand and your value given the amount of impressions that these guys were getting, which when they don't make videos, we're getting 100 million views a month when they don't post anything new.
6:07
That kind of thing is a company that's 100 million plus in revenue.
They have the marketing department, but what they don't have is a sales department, they don't have a product department, they don't have customer success, they have none of these other departments.
There's zero out of 100 on all these.
And so the constraint isn't going 97 to 99, it's going from zero to 20 on these ones.
6:26
What are the choices I have here?
Version one is if I've got an advertiser consistently comes to me, I may be able to negotiate some sort of equity, getting even 10% of a company that's worth $100 million and then you put all of your effort behind it and make it a 2 or 300 million company.
That's a significantly better outcome for many of them than what they're currently getting paid, just video to paycheck, right.
6:45
The second option is to say, OK, is there a category of products that continue to pay me the most out of all the advertisers?
Just do what Amazon does, see what's already selling, and then clone it and make it your own and put your name on it and make your version yours and better.
If you do that, then you own the entirety of that thing.
7:02
But in order to do that, you probably, if it were me, I would go snipe some of the top execs at some of those companies and say, hey, you're currently an executive here, would you like to own a slice of my thing?
I'm happy to own 70% and get three of the best guys over, have them build their boxes behind my thing.
7:21
That's the fastest and easiest way.
The longer, maybe bigger money way is if you do it all yourself, but that's always the trade that you have to make as an entrepreneurs.
How many new skills do I have to have in order to pursue this new opportunity versus the ones I currently have?
The third opportunity for them is probably the least operational risk, accepting the fact that they just like doing media and that's what they jam on and they don't want to touch either of these other business components.
7:42
Ending themselves as a creative shop that knows how to make viral videos that they can transform into ads.
And that's where you we go from being a really good creator to being a Madison Ave. agency that makes ads that crush.
Most influencers are getting paid based on the impressions that they are getting the brand for free based on their audience.
8:02
But where the real money is made is where you take that TikTok video, that YouTube toward that Instagram video that ever it is, and then they put $1,000,000 of ad spend behind it when it's already shown as a winner.
And then it goes from being shown to 5 million people in your audience to 100 million people that it converts from cold that's been has no limit on reach as long as it's profitable.
8:22
So they can always expand beyond your existing audience, which means that you get to capture all of the upside based on how skilled you are as an advertiser.
So those would be the three paths for that particular type of business.
It's not like, OK, well I'm not one of these three businesses now what I should do, but it's actually the framework that we approach the problem with, which is 1.
8:40
What problem are we trying to solve in each of these businesses?
They wanted to make more money.
The next one is over what time horizon.
If you want to make more money tomorrow, the number of things you can do is very limited.
If you want to make more money in 10 years, you take a very different play.
If the amount of time it might take to build 100 story buildings, Foundation might take the same time it takes to build the entirety of a ten floor building above the surface.
9:02
Somebody else building a 10th floor building might happen way faster than you can as yours is just continuing to build this base before you start building up.
The next question, which problem would we prefer solving or which problem do we feel like we're more equipped to solve?
Or which problem is easier?
Because if you start framing it in terms of the problem that you're going to have to solve to be successful, it actually makes it much more controllable for you.
9:23
I would say, well, which of these do we feel more equipped to do Now at quizzes.com, we are really good at recruiting, which is how we scale all the companies we have as you recruit talent.
We've already been there, done that.
And so we probably say, hey, we feel really confident that we could recruit somebody in and put seed capital in to get it going.
9:38
Then we'd own the whole pie.
So for us, that would be a problem that we feel very confident in solving and gives us the most upside.
You have to answer that for you, given your skill set, your resources and your experience.








0:00
I usually play with time and space in terms of trying to reframe whatever the issue is that I'm upset about and think like what?
What is the expectation that I have and how is it unmet and how can I shift that expectation?
And what if the expectation went completely different?
Using those things on a regular basis, I think have allowed me to make better decisions and be a little bit less emotional or reactive to bad news.
0:17
And I think if you compound that like small amount of space that you can create for yourself for an extended period of time, you can make better decisions.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:33
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
For people who are looking to get started, what do you think is the best business for people to get into right now?
I think the best business for someone to start if they've never started a business before is something that they already have tangential experience with.
And so usually you have parents, friends, family, first jobs that you have some industry knowledge.
0:51
So if you look at like Y Combinator for example, they look for founders who have lived with the problem and or have industry experience.
And so if you have both of those things like the likelihood that you will be successful with the endeavor that you're going in is significantly higher because there's a huge learning curve to entering any new industry.
And if you can just pay down some of that ignorance tax, even if the opportunity vehicle isn't the perfect one, you will still have a significantly higher likelihood of winning.
1:14
And one of the big fallacies of your first business is that it's going to be your last business, and it almost never is.
And so the idea is like, it's much more valuable to get started on something that you have a higher likely to success on so that you can get some faster rewards for the behavior of getting into business.
And then from there, get some resources, get some skills.
1:29
And then you can have a better perspective from which to make a jump or a decision on what to do next.
And at least that's my $0.02 on it.
We were at the gym, Jack and I the other day actually two people came up to us and they said that they love the podcast that we did together.
The first one, I think that's how they found the podcast, but that was there.
1:48
Both people separate referenced that podcast like when and one person said when you going to have Hermosi back on, I said well coincidence.
You know he's coming like the next week.
They had a question for you.
Then I told them I would ask you.
So if you ever see me in person, you want to have me ask Alex or Mosey something, you just ask.
2:06
He was AW2 employee and he says he really likes your content and wants to know your advice to people who aren't selling anything.
True, but they're an employee and they wanna make more money.
They wanna get better at what they're doing.
How could they apply your advice to them?
You have to figure out how your job directly ties to revenue in the business.
2:24
And if you don't know, ask like fundamentally, like if you don't know how your job makes the business money, then ask.
And then once you understand how you directly tie to money, then drive towards that.
Because fundamentally, every position in the business makes the business more money if the job is well designed.
2:40
Otherwise, why are you there, right?
I mean, even if you're like I'm a frontline customer, service reps, it's like, OK, well how do you like if I had to ask that person, like, how do you make the business money?
The answer is if I do a good job, people will come back and buy again.
If I do a good job, we'll have a lower percentage of people who will refund.
If I do a good job, the business will be able to command higher prices off of word of mouth in the future.
2:59
Like these are the things that you can explain and say like, OK, well then if those are the things that drive revenue, then I'm going to try and focus on those things and then you can ask your boss and this is a great question, is what would it take for me to make this.
It's not saying I need to make that, it's just asking them to solve the problem.
Like what would it take for me to earn that?
3:16
And then they can give you an objective metric.
Now your boss might not be high enough and then you say cool, can you ask the person above you?
And by doing it that way you're also being clear, like I want to make the business more money.
And in doing so I would like a small percentage of the increase that I'm able to bring, like what would it take?
And I think that's a great way to have that conversation.
3:33
Layla, my wife, also makes tons of content for like how to ask for races, how to negotiate that stuff on her channel as a side note, when she's more knowledgeable than I am.
I do think though, a lot of careers out there will never give you that opportunity.
You say I want to make more money or I want to do more.
3:48
They're gonna you get back to your desk.
Just focus.
You just focus on that and there aren't really those opportunities out there.
In those situations, would you recommend looking for work elsewhere?
I think small businesses are a good opportunity for that stuff.
So if you're like in a massive corporation, you can and quickly cap out and get like lost in the shuffle if it's this massive org.
4:08
And so I think it makes sense to go get basically a stamp of approval from maybe a name brand company that you can then leverage into a smaller business that you'll have a lot more impact, a lot more opportunity for growth.
Most entrepreneurs are far more receptive to anyone who says I will help you make more money.
So again, if you can change your environment, you'll often be able to change your behavior.
4:26
By the way, I meant to ask this earlier.
I noticed we had a bit of a problem.
Actually, it was on Instagram.
And I noticed you're not following me back on Instagram.
Oh shit, yeah, so following a lot.
He's.
Labeling this as something that's bad.
Yeah, yeah.
And what do you have?
4:41
To say about that, I think it's terrible.
I only follow comedy and philosophy accounts for the most part.
Comedy and philosophy accounts, yeah.
The only two truth tellers.
And what do you get from those accounts by watching?
I enjoy it, yeah.
OK, Both give me context on life.
Some make me laugh, some make me think.
Who are your favorite comedians?
4:57
Oh man, I have so many.
I mean, I follow a lot of comedians.
Like, I basically follow any comedian I see on my news feed who makes comedy regular.
Like if I click over their page and they've got like one comedy video and a bunch of like, not videos, then I I won't follow them.
But if they make regular comedy clips, I will almost guaranteed to follow them no matter how big they are.
5:17
I like Andrew Schultz, Whitney Cummings, Sam Moral, Mark Normand.
I like Neeman, Oz.
Matt Rife has obviously been, yeah, he's great.
There's so many.
Bill Burr, Nate Park at sea.
There's so many.
I'm just like naming names off the top.
I like a lot of I mean, if this comedy, I like it.
5:34
Yeah.
Do you like Norm McDonald's comedy?
Yeah.
I love it.
I mean, I'm a cheap date when it comes to comedy, basically.
The only thing I don't like is like lazy comedy.
Just like crude comedy for the sake of being crude like that stuff.
I'm not like I don't think Zach like Theo Von.
That's great a great example not.
5:49
Not of that.
He's also another great comedian.
And yeah, that's like, that's I, yeah, I love, I really like comedy a lot.
And do you like?
Live shows or do you Do you listen to comedy podcasts ever I.
Don't listen to comedy podcasts.
I watch their routines and I go to shows and I watch their clips.
Yeah, the comedy podcasts are hilarious, I think.
6:06
The podcasts are 20 times better than.
Oh, and Tom Segura, Berkreischer.
Like, I mean, there's a ton of this.
I mean, there's so many.
I think Big Jo Christian's small, but I actually really love his stuff.
There's so many.
Yeah, I prefer the podcast.
I prefer the podcast.
Interesting.
Good to know.
I don't see.
I actually just don't listen to podcasts in general.
I'm not a podcaster.
6:21
I think like the the candid comedy in a podcast is 10 times better than we heard.
Super contextual.
Yeah.
Yeah, 'cause they have to, like, the bit has to be funny every time, in every single place with a cold audience.
But like, if you're warmed up with, like, things that got said earlier and it's, like, relevant to the moment, like they can absolutely be, you know, hilarious.
6:40
But no, I don't listen to podcasts ever.
I listen to Elon Musk every time he goes on.
Joe Rogan OK, but I watched it.
Really.
I watched.
It So what sort of media do you consume?
Twitter or X, whatever I can.
That's my most active platform.
That's the one that I'm on.
Like by far the.
Most.
Is it you that tweets?
Yeah, I understand.
It's me on every Twitter.
6:55
It's you.
Everything.
Everything's me, I manage everything.
And what philosophy content do you like to consume?
Are there certain people that are practicing all the ancients?
So it's the Ancients.
Anybody who's dead, if you're dead, I like it.
That's the way that you get validity for.
Well, I mean, I mean, you know, Epictetus, Seneca, like some of the Stoics.
7:11
I mean I like those guys and if some of the darker you've got Dostoyevsky and some of the some of the.
Other dudes If they're dead though, how do they post?
Great.
Good question.
What?
I think it's like excerpts from let's.
Try to make a joke.
This is stupid.
7:28
Fair enough.
Good, good.
Graham.
That's.
True you.
Make media.
Maybe he'll follow you there.
Is it classic?
Shrewd.
Classic.
Shrewd.
You know, just.
Don't.
Don't call me.
Shrewd man.
White.
For context, guys, I got this haircut this morning and Graham said I look like white shrut off the rip, off the rip.
7:45
He didn't even say like, nice haircut.
It's like, you know, it's not like a compliment sandwich.
It was just like a.
Straight for shrewd do.
You have any glasses?
I am not putting on glasses.
It would actually be, dude, if you had a if you had a tie on in like a slightly brown suit, you'd slay it.
Oh.
Thank you.
You'd think I'd just walk around on the strip.
8:01
I'd just get approached by women.
People would, well, people would be trying to take pictures with you.
They'd be like, Oh my God, I just.
Really don't think I look like white suit that much, but maybe I could be, maybe I could be wrong, you know, maybe I should put throw on a hat or something, I guess.
I think you should change your Tinder profile to this.
Put the suit on, put the glasses on and just say like.
8:17
You think if you own it, it's attractive.
And I learned this from you.
You said that one time you were in the car with some frat brother and the frat brother was like, making out with some girl in the back of the car, and he was like, what was it, chewing tobacco or something at the same time?
And you're like, dude, how is she not disgusted by you right now?
8:35
And he was just like, 'cause I don't care which for me, like, I still think about that to this.
You could be owning the wrong thing.
Well, I don't I I will counter the fact I I think you can own whatever you want.
Yeah, I I think you can own whatever you.
Want There's some some things that shouldn't be worth.
Owning.
I think it's the confidence, but like if you do that then then chances are you're probably not gonna be able to get like Imagine.
8:53
You owning being an incel.
You know like I'm I'm owning it.
Like that's not probably.
Attractive if you owned it.
That's a good point.
That's a really good point.
Yeah, so I think Coco Chanel said fashion is whatever you can get away with.
And I kind of just like that as a anyways as as one of the, you know, most fashionable women of all time like icons.
9:10
I feel like she has a good perspective on like what fashion is and it's just whatever you can get away with.
And I like that.
That's a good point.
I feel like a modern fashion.
You look at it and you're like this person looks like an animal.
Don't even look like human at that.
Point the runway shows.
I don't you know what I mean with the point of these runway shows is at all.
9:25
It's actually a money thing, so the I only know this cuz my wife buys lots of expensive things.
So those runways, so many of the outfits there are made to look high fashion and then the people who are in attendance there.
It's like a a huge honor to be like invited by like Stella McCartney or Coco Chanel or whoever to or Gucci to attend the runway show.
9:45
Like, it's a like usually you have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to get invited to one of those shows and it's usually like.
On their clothing.
Yeah, it's like 20 people a year get invited, hand selected across the whole nation to get invited as like consumers.
And then while you're there, they'll parade these, you know, people around and then you're somewhat expected to bid on the actual outfits themselves.
10:06
And the outfits are so atrocious.
I mean, it's like he's never gonna buy that and.
Actually wear that out to like, Walmart No one.
You would never wear these.
Things you'd be amazed, you'd be amazed.
And sometimes it's not the whole outfit.
Sometimes it's a piece of it, or it's a hat or or a blouse or whatever.
But like, it'll be like it'll be like 50 thousand $100,000 dresses.
But to me it seems like the ugliest clothing that they could get away with.
10:24
I to me it seems like a social experiment.
Like how wild?
Social experiment.
So there's a camera there.
This camera.
I'm waiting for the joke to come like 20 years later, because I've seen some of these things with like shoes with a goldfish in them.
It's.
Stupid.
There's like, these necklaces.
10:39
Pendant things with a turtle inside of it.
It's so live turtle like a baby turtle.
Are you serious?
I've seen that before.
It's very.
But it's just.
But and it's a weird turtle.
Right.
Well, for like 24 hours maybe, I mean.
Think about the life it gets to lead.
I mean, the comparison is just like, it's just floating around water all day here.
10:55
It like gets to travel the world.
It gets to like, hang out.
With, I bet if you asked the turtle, I'd probably say I preferred that too, right?
I saw this video and it was someone who did a social experiment where they created like this new hip store where they got like, I think it was like H&M and, like, cheap.
11:11
Yeah, yeah, Payless.
Payless.
Yeah, but it's from Payless shoe store.
And then all all these people came and started blogging about it and like, Oh my God, this is so cute.
This is amazing, but it's all just cheap.
And they bought it was like 500 to $700.00 shoes and they just only used pale of shoes and had people review them afterwards.
11:27
The influencers, they're like, by the way.
Well, it really goes to show you how important marketing is if you just.
Brand.
Yeah, that's all it is.
The association?
You'd have no idea.
Yeah.
Like, like this shirt?
No.
How much do you think this?
How much do you think this?
Very nice.
11:43
Very.
Yes.
How much?
Guess how much?
Guess how much?
I'm guessing this shirt right here.
I can tell based off the material alone, 300.
Dollars.
How do you think it is?
I haven't felt it.
Give it a little touch, man.
You could feel it if you want to it.
Feels like old Lulu.
I'm gonna go 60. $60.00 Nah, it's Tom Ford.
12:04
Yeah, really, I.
Didn't know you were an expensive.
Clothes.
No, it's free.
It's free.
Yeah.
I'm not.
I'm not spending the money.
No.
Oh, my gosh.
No.
That would be amazing.
No.
Jason and Brett Oppenheim give me their clothing and they where they.
They had the.
Brokerage that he used Oppenheimer.
Yeah.
12:19
And so they buy some of the nicest stuff, But you know, overtime it'll shrink.
So when it shrinks, it no longer fits them.
But it fits me perfectly.
So I get all their handy deals.
Yeah, yeah, must be.
So I have a whole wardrobe of almost exclusively Tom Ford and Dior.
12:35
Well, I buy brand new tank tops.
I'll just like let the record.
Show How many times do you wear them before you toss?
Honestly, I don't know.
You said that your wife Layla has very expensive taste.
Does this ever bother you?
If she's like Alex, I want to buy a $50,000 purse.
You'd be like.
For Alex, it's pennies.
12:52
It's like you wouldn't care, no.
She does that.
She's like, no, she does whatever she wants.
But not a single part of you.
I also she earns her own.
Like we do this together, but it's a.
Joint thing, right?
Like exactly so.
I mean, I spend like gym equipment.
That's like what I like.
That's like the one thing that I spend.
13:08
Much more new equipment, Like they're not coming out with new machines every month, right?
I mean they do come up with new machine do yeah, for sure.
Every month is like it's like a fashion.
Is it inside your apartment?
No, I'm so we just bought the, the old UFC hundreds.
Yeah.
And so there's a, there's a huge, huge chunk of space.
13:24
So we're, yeah, we're making a a massive gym there.
So that'll probably cost like I don't know 450 grand all in.
But, like, so it's like how many purses could ship Probably a lot you know.
And so but like I just buy, you know, my stuff's a little chunkier than hers is.
But like Leila wanted to have nice things her whole life and so we have the ability to do that.
13:42
So what do I gain by depriving her of that?
It's not like it puts us in any kind of different financial situation than we are now.
If her spending in any way materially affected our goals, she wouldn't do it.
Like she's only done that when it basically doesn't affect us in any real way.
Why would I stop her from doing that?
Like why?
13:57
Why have the money to?
Begin with Have you ever thought of the reason why she wants the expensive things and why she wants to I?
Don't think she knows the answer either.
Who knows?
Like when people ask why, we just guess and answer and we answer with things that we've answered in the past that people have given us approval for.
So it's like, why are you so motivated, Alex?
14:14
I could be like, my father never gave me enough approval or I could say my mother didn't pay enough attention to me.
I could say I had a teacher who encouraged me early on or I spoke once in class and I did a good job and I really wanted to do more of that.
Like, I could make up 100 different reasons.
But all we know is that I do these things and I think just erasing the why and the because it just makes the life a lot easier because you don't have to deal with it.
14:33
So it's like the two things that I've been focused a lot on.
It's like elimination of should, which I think I talked a lot about on one of the the, the first podcasts that we did together.
And I'd say, like my focus right now is kind of elimination of why.
And because because we don't know.
You have no idea.
Like I don't know if you're like I think he was.
It's like when someone tries to guess your intention, it's like you don't know, you don't know why I said that.
14:53
And the real reason I don't know why I said that, we just know that I said it and just focus on that.
And that's just been easier in terms of like communicating with other people, managing relationships, even persuasion.
It's like trying to be like you did this.
You don't know, Stick to what you can observe.
And that's just made my life a lot easier.
15:09
It appears like it's a part of human nature to come up with all of these extra details, problems, justifications, etcetera, explanations for certain things.
Why is it in our nature to continually do this and complicate things when you when you explain things?
15:24
It's just so simple.
I have no idea.
I know that we do it.
I don't know why.
That is so unfair.
That is, I mean it's a perfect.
Why is it?
Unfair.
No.
It's a it's a great answer.
No, it's a great answer.
It's a great.
It's like, I can make something up if you want, but it'll just be made-up, Yeah.
15:41
And to be fair, most people will just make up answers to questions of like, why?
And it's a hard bounce for me, 'cause sometimes I'll get on podcast and like the more strict I have and kind of to do to a certain degree, like what mood I'm in, I might answer very much more strictly on that.
But it can sometimes make for a more boring podcast experience, 'cause people are like, fine, so we don't know anything.
15:59
I'm like, yeah, exactly.
It's interesting for me to for you to go from like Layla wants and has all these nice things to you where you're just like, I'm just gonna get down to the basics.
Why do I want this?
Do I really need it?
No.
It seems like Layla's very much an opposite in that she'll just say I want it.
16:15
I don't need to think about why I want it and what this means.
I just want it.
I'm not gonna put any more effort into that.
There's a boat, big yacht that had a name on it that I really liked and it was don't analyze your pleasures.
And she knows that she likes it and I like that she likes it.
And like, what is wrong with that?
16:32
Like the only reason that someone would have any objection to that is simply because of the price tag associated with it.
If she liked buying $1.00 clothes, no one would have any issue with it.
It's just because it's expensive.
But that's based on their understanding of expensive, not necessarily my context.
And even if it was, even if I had made the exact same amount of money as whoever would be judging me for or judging Layla for buying clothing like that.
16:49
Why do you care how I spend my money?
Spend yours your way.
Because basically them expressing that is expressing their preference that I would live they.
They would prefer that I live the way they live their lives, sure, but like, why don't you just keep living your life the way you prefer?
No, keep living my life the way I prefer.
17:05
I don't prefer that you live your wife a different Live live your life a.
Different live your wife.
Yeah.
Do whatever you want, OK?
Yeah.
If there's like like that's my like no elimination of should elimination of wine, because that would be my, you know, presidential campaign.
No shoulds, no whys and no because's.
17:20
Do you think if you were president that you could do a better job or you could do a great job?
No, I think I would do a horrible.
Do you think so?
I don't know.
I heard this question.
I heard this question online and everyone's like saying, oh, you should ask people this question to see what they say.
I don't know.
I have no aspirations or desires.
17:36
I have.
I actually had a conversation this morning about that.
This one's like, man, if you like, could talk about politics, you'd go so much wider.
I don't have interest.
Like I've never been interested in politics.
I don't follow the news I like.
Again, the only thing that I consume is something as it relates to how we make money and how we run our businesses.
17:54
That is the only thing that I like.
I'll consume anything tangentially to that.
And that's it.
Like if I was in healthcare, I'd probably be looking more about like what you know, if I was like getting into like HRT, like hormone replacement therapy.
If as a as an industry if I want to get into, then I'd be looking at legislation that's pending that might make some of our, you know, reclassify some of the drugs that we might be selling or something like that.
18:10
Like I would be that would be something I'd be interested.
But it wasn't because of the politics.
I would be interested because of the economics.
So one I don't have interest, second is that I'm not very knowledgeable about it and those kind of go hand in hand, but like if I were to be someone to ask me a political question I don't have.
Any skill and interest.
Yeah, I have.
I have no knowledge on that and and if I made a point, people probably have an excellent counterpoint and they'd be like, what do you think about that?
18:30
I'd be like you're probably right, I don't spend time on this.
I feel like I would be making an ignorant, I'd be giving ignorant advice, and if I were to do anything, it would just be like from first principles.
And I'm sure there's many things that get in the way of that from like a legislative perspective and whatnot.
And so I focus on the things that I am good at and that I enjoy.
Is there anything you're unhappy about?
18:48
I would say I have this the same the same complaints that any entrepreneur would which is like I always want things to happen faster.
But like I also realize that and and try to adjust my expectations appropriately and talk to Solomon and be like what did you expect?
If I were to give me advice, I'd be like you're doing you know you're doing fine and you're it's taking it's actually happening faster than you originally thought this would happen.
19:05
So like are you really just readjusting your expectations so that you can be dissatisfied?
Well that sounds silly.
I like my life.
It's weird to I mean like it's it's odd nowadays to just be like I like my life.
I've spent a lot of effort to create an environment with people that I enjoy doing things that I enjoy.
Are there things day-to-day that come up that are stressors.
19:21
Of course.
Like that's, you know, any business, anything you do has overhead.
But I like what I do every day and I think I'm I'm pretty good at it and that brings me a lot of enjoyment.
When you wake up, you'd say the off the rip emotion that you feel is tired.
19:39
And then like do you get.
Oh, I mean, if I get 8, I can like cure cancer.
So like I'm, you know, I try to like, I got 28 hours sleeps in a row this last week.
And I was like, I could literally repaint the Mona Lisa right now.
Like I felt so good.
What occupies that time that would inhibit you to get 8 hours?
19:55
Nothing inhibits me from getting 8 hours, I just wake up earlier.
That's more that's like more often would happen.
Oh really?
Yeah, I haven't put an alarm on.
Yeah, I haven't put an alarm on it.
How do you do that?
Forever.
Upon first wake up, do you get up or do you sometimes?
Think, no, I try.
If I can.
If I can go back to sleep, I will.
But I I mean, there's a lot of things I want to do.
20:11
And so, like, I get excited.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, like, I'll be physically tired, but like, I'm excited mentally.
Like my brain will turn on and I'm like, oh, there's all these things I want to do.
I mean there was a time when I I had a one of those rings that like did your sleep stuff.
I got more annoyed about the ring then I 'cause I it's maybe an indication of how much I've changed over time.
20:29
I was 22 the last time I did that.
So I was like 12 years ago.
But I got I got so competitive with myself to try and like beat my last night's PR that I would like stress about trying.
Like I would like not move so that it wouldn't like wake the ring up to think that I was sleeping, you know what I mean?
And then I was like, I'm sleeping worse now that I have this ring on.
20:45
So I'm like, fuck.
And it if anything I'd wake up the next day and it would give me a reason why.
Like the day would be like, it would tell me if I was gonna have a good or bad day.
And I was like, well, that's silly because I've had plenty of days that have been very little sleep and been great days and I've had days, right?
'Cause I have the aura ring and I use it a lot.
And I do say that when I see in the morning that says, like you did not get a good night of rest, be careful today.
21:04
It does kind of put me in a mood where I'm like, oh, crap, yeah, yeah, it's telling me I gotta be careful.
I wouldn't have even thought about that had it not been now planted in my mind that maybe I'm gonna be a little slower today.
Well.
That's like the superstition, the stuff that I've talked about where it's like Doctor Cash, a good buddy of mine.
21:19
He says he defines a scam as something that if you remove it, your function gets worse.
And so it's like basically we create these crutches.
So it's like, oh man, if I don't have my greens juice in the morning, like, I feel if I feel terrible, but then after a while you start to be able to only take the green juice just to feel normal.
Well then if I take the green juice away, then I feel bad.
21:35
Well, then that's a scam like that doesn't it doesn't actually do anything.
It's not it doesn't work And so I I just I'm I'm super cautious and to like to your point about like creating the very earlier, it's like I just really try not to be superstitious about anything because I want I want to have as many of the controllables under my control as I can and if I like, I love the idea of competing against somebody who has a million crutches.
21:55
It's like you just knock one of them out and they're they're screwed.
Like like if my competitor like oh if I if I don't have 8 hours of sleep I'm a bear.
It's like, well, I can't wait for you to have one bad night's sleep and then I'll just win that day because I don't mind having a short night's sleep and still working.
Check.
I work fine.
22:11
So anyways, all that to say, sometimes I sleep shorter and sometimes I sleep longer.
I sleep as long as I can.
With Layla, I know we kind of like alluded to this in like previous conversations.
A lot about Layla, but.
I can.
It's always about Layla.
I'm.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
Man, she's got an interest.
Too.
She's interesting.
OK, you guys live, I'm sure, incredibly challenging, incredibly busy lives and maintaining a relationship.
22:33
I know we've talked about this before, but maintaining a relationship in that environment can be incredibly challenging.
And you said last time that you have an algorithm like you have logic that determines the success of your relationship with Layla, and if something isn't fitting, then you need to change the inputs.
22:51
I'm wondering, has it continued to serve you to see it as an algorithm 'cause I like to think that love is this thing, that it's more of like a nondescript thing that kind of just like occurs between two people, and it's not so like algorithmic and equational, you know what I mean?
23:08
Well, I think just for the audience sake, it's not like I have this Excel sheet at home of like, OK, three hugs equals you know, like a a a kiss or you know what I mean?
I don't have.
Like Chanel.
Bags.
Yeah.
One Chanel bag equals two good days.
You know, whatever, you know.
Well, I would say this, which is that if you feel like it is that ephemeral thing that's so hard to capture and so hard to describe, like I'd be like, good luck finding it.
23:27
And honestly, I think the big difficulty with love and marriages in general is that everything's n = 1.
So even like like my relationship with Layla's unique in that I am one of one and she's one of one and I've seen and you probably have two, I've seen like 60 year marriages, you know people were 90 in their 90s, very different dynamics with all of them And like you guys have unique partnership for this podcast and everybody else has unique dynamics for their partnership and we know what has worked for them.
23:54
I share what has worked for me.
If some of those things help other people, awesome.
If they don't then ignore them.
You know, both of us tend to be very agreement oriented, meaning neither of us like to be controlled.
Both of us have a lot of agency, like we like to make our own decisions and kind of operate freely.
24:10
And so like how do you get two people together that are really strongly independent.
We make agreements and like these are like I agree to these things, you agree to these things and like as long as that works for us, then we don't change the agreement.
It's worked great.
And if we if something comes up then it's like, hey, let's revisit this and if it makes sense then we we revisit it.
And that has worked really well because we have exceedingly clear expectations of one another in terms of like what we're going to do and what we're not going to do.
24:32
And and that has worked really well.
And there's always resolve between these disagreements.
Yeah, eventually.
I mean pretty quickly usually, yeah.
We don't argue much.
Do you have some other like silver lining, that kind of not silver lining, but like other thing that arbitrates these disagreements between you and her?
24:49
Maybe some fundamental agreements that you made right in the beginning that you can then use as rules to decide current disagreements.
Well, I think fundamentally Leila and I also both believe that love is conditional, not unconditional.
And so even the idea of marriage for us has been based on agreements, which is like if there were a time in the future where Leyla no longer wanted to do the things that I want to do, then I would not hold her to her commitment to be with me because it was contingent on that.
25:20
We want these same things.
And so it's like similar mission, similar values, similar interests.
If you want to go to the same place and gather the same way values and what you spend your time on in between interests is aligned, then you'll probably be OK.
And I think the problem is that a lot of people will.
25:35
This is my, you know, one makes two sense is a lot of people look for, are actively looking for hookups and then thinking hookups will turn into life partners and wives and spouses.
But if you were to look for a hookup, you would look for a very different thing than you would for a spouse.
And so expecting one to become the other, I don't know if that's the best, the best frame.
25:55
This has worked for us because we are that way now.
There are, there are people that I know have amazing relationships where one is completely subservient to the other and that works for them.
I really enjoy our relationship because I get tremendous utility from Layla.
She serves me in a lot of ways more than I would say most men get from their spouses or at least businessmen.
26:14
You know what I mean?
Who are like it's very, it's not common at all for a wife to be even close to Layla's level.
I mean sometimes they're like Oh yeah, she's like the secretary in the business and sometimes they over title the person to make her make her feel better or whatever.
But like, that's I would say more of the norm, if at all, in the business.
26:30
Like Leila absolutely runs the business.
She's CEO, period.
I'm like off to the side and I like think of good things every once in a while.
Like she's the one who runs everything.
And like only the people inside of our company can actually like, appreciate that.
And I will still always get the credit because I am who I am and I look the way I look and I talk the way I talk.
But like, she's really the one that does it.
26:47
And so I get a ton out of that.
And that this is how it has worked for us.
Like Leila in every other relationship in her life was always the dominant one.
Like because most guys will fold to Leila.
She's incredibly strong willed and like it's, I mean, it's my belief at least if you if you enjoyed a male female dynamic, you just need it.
27:04
Like if you are a strong woman, you just need a more strong man.
What sort of personal contentions do you have between the two of you 'cause it seems like everything is really just business oriented.
Yeah, I mean we we talk about business all day.
That's what we do.
I would say that the busier we are with business, the more we will try and carve out time to not be business.
27:21
If things are more like normal pace, we don't really need to carve the time out.
The time kind of happens on its own.
And so I've seen, you know, clips and stuff where people say, like, you have to have a date night once a week and you can't talk about business.
And like, people like, just like throwing these rules out.
I just hate all of that.
If we feel like we need to, like, reconnect because it's like we're a little bit too distant in terms of like, hey, I feel like I haven't seen you in a week, then like, let's go out to dinner.
27:43
Let's take some time and let's just hang out and and catch up.
I mean, sometimes the equals, like, I feel like I've been with you all day.
Like, I'm going to get some space, go to the gym, hang out, you know, get some food with some guys and like, I'll be back.
And so I think we just managed that.
And I think, especially in like the world of remote work, I actually think that in my opinion, people spend too much time together.
28:01
I think this is Ester Perl, but I think you need to createspace to be missed.
There's no time where, like I'm more excited to see Layla than a time that I haven't seen.
Her motivation is the equal opposite of deprivation.
If I haven't seen her want, I'm deprived of Layla.
I'm more motivated to see her.
I've seen her a ton, then I'm probably less motivated to see her.
So you think a lot of times in relationships people could be spending too much time together?
28:18
Absolutely.
Nowadays, for sure they live in the same house they they literally spend all day together.
I don't think that's at least normal from how we kind of I.
Think you need 2 experiences to come together and then you could do you have something to talk about?
Because otherwise if you're if you've had the same experiences all day for weeks, I was like what do you talk about?
28:34
I was at a certain point, yeah.
Like, how was your day?
I don't know.
I was there.
Like, yeah, we have nothing else to say.
So, like, I think when we figured this out for our relationship, it was still like two or three years in.
We actively just, like, created a ton of space.
We worked on opposite sides of the house.
We didn't attend.
I came off the meetings that she was on.
And so like, at the end of the day, I was like, oh, oh, you met with John today.
28:52
How was that?
She's like, oh, this is what this happened.
I was like, oh, and you met with that vendor who's doing this thing.
She's like, yeah, and This is why we negotiate.
What do you think about this?
And you know, like blah, blah, blah.
And then I go through my calendar and like literally we still to this day do that.
It's at the end of the day, we go for a walk, 45 minutes, I sync up my phone.
She takes her phone.
We go through our calendars and we just literally download, like, how is your day?
29:08
How's by day?
Like what are the things that we're you know, working on and moving forward.
And that's how we kind of like re sync up.
And then after that we just, we're we're kind of husband and wife the the rest of the day real quick wise.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
29:25
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, it'll take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
29:44
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
What was the logic behind buying that UFC building?
That's dope.
It's pretty, yeah, it's a lot.
It's a lot of space.
But to go from someone who's kind of working from home remotely to getting a full on office space, it's it's massive.
30:03
How many square feet was that?
It was like 12,000 square feet something.
It's three floors of 12.
It's 36. 36,000 square feet?
Yeah, it's 12. 12 It's part of the grand plan, one I'm investing in.
So we're investing heavily in media and so that's going to have a ton of studios inside of it that we're we're actively building out right now, ton of different sets for different types of content that we want to be putting out with higher quality and higher frequency in the future.
30:28
That's what I'm building towards.
And so having a place where all of my team could sync up and I could attract talent to come, you know, here to Vegas as is kind of what we were, what we were shooting for.
So what's the grand plan with with content?
Are you trying to, like, take people under the Hormozy brand?
30:46
No, I actually, I'm actually gonna do more me personally and Layla and just we're it's more that we're gonna we're gonna be facilitating more types of content rather than more talking ads.
Because as much as like my quote brand has grown, that's actually still been the results of like 1/2 day a week or every other week of actual filming.
31:05
And the rest of it is just the the the awesome team that we have that has had a cut distributed repurpose content across different platforms.
But I actually want to increase inputs into the machine and in order to do that I I thought it would make sense to to have to make this type of investment.
Yeah, but 36,000 square feet.
Yeah, well, I want a massive gym.
31:21
I want a massive gym.
So that's like floor one basically.
A whole floor, 12,000 square feet of gym.
That makes no sense. 12,000 square feet.
A big commercial gym?
Well.
Half 1000 square feet.
The bottom the bottom floor half is parked.
But there's no but there's.
There's gonna be a commercial.
Half the Yeah, 100%.
Yeah, but still 6000 square feet of gym.
31:37
There's no way there's enough Sheens.
I I barely can fit anything in there how I'd I'd like equipment.
I'm a I'm a connoisseur I'm I have a I'm an aficionado of Jimmy Coven.
But I.
Feel like you could probably get 99% of the same result?
31:53
Sure, with 2000.
But this isn't this isn't a utility question.
This is all what Alex wants.
This is my purses in my in my Coco Chanel.
Like she could have a plastic bag and carry her shit, but like she wants a Chanel purse.
I could just have one shoulder press, but there's three different brands that make different ones that I like for different reasons.
32:11
There is one question I have.
There's a space in that building I think where there's one of those like roll up things that goes into a space.
What's your purpose?
With that, that's just parking.
That's the bottom floor.
Is, half is, is.
I thought there's, but there's one where it's kind of like a bit of a, it looks like a bit of a warehouse.
32:27
Yeah, it's there's the roll up, that's the whole, that's the bottom floor.
Yes, there's the roll up and then you've got all the parking and then I mean it has all the pillars.
What would it take for the iced coffee hour to be able to, you know, get an office space in there?
Gotta take it up with Leila.
Layla said that.
She would probably said she do for free.
That's what she said.
Just, she said.
32:43
Just don't ask.
Don't ask, yeah.
She said.
Actually say it's OK.
Preparing it.
No, I'm, I'm stoked about it.
But to answer the question, I don't want to spoil anything, but we have a bunch of new shows are going to putting out new types of content, new characters that we're going to be bringing in to the content.
33:01
Like a lot of really cool stuff.
Like I was super inspired when I went out to Steve, Dave Ramsey and his whole setup.
Really.
Yeah.
Yeah, but what was it like for meeting Dave Ramsey?
It was great.
Dave was exactly the same.
You know what I mean?
It's as I expected him to pay.
I mean my whole interview if you, I don't know if you saw it was was all about business.
Yeah, like I just wanted because like he doesn't.
33:17
He always talks about personal finances and savings.
He kind of has just like his buzz, his buzz things.
And I wanted to like try and avoid those to get to like how how does Ramsey Solutions work and kind of like what what were some of the strategic decisions that he made that that led him to there?
The thing that I find really interesting is that he has somehow managed to have an education and information business without being seen as a scam.
33:39
And I find like think about anybody else who sells a course, coaching events and an app that's like the prototypical every other coach, whatever guru out there.
And somehow he managed to do that and build a $300 million a year business from basically the same ingredients.
33:54
And I was like I wanted to really get close to like what made it different for Dave versus everybody else.
And so I think there's two main things.
This is my two cents.
So Dave, if you ever see this, this is my thoughts.
One is that the promise that he was making was something that is absolutely believable.
No one could fight, which is that if you spend less money, you will have more leftover.
34:11
It's very different than most other promises, which is our make money, which is like if you you do this thing then you make an extra $2000 a month or whatever it is.
It's like if you make 5000 and you save 1000, you have 1000 leftover.
There's just no one can fight you, right?
And I think that really protects him from a promises perspective.
34:28
The other side is that he absolutely focuses on brand above everything and his reputation.
And so like an indication of that is that he does the biggest slice of revenue that he has is media like everybody else.
34:43
Just like, right.
Hooks the shit out of their audience at all times.
And so like they couldn't even sell media places, media spots on their own if they wanted to because they have like no goodwill in their audience.
But he still deposits so much more goodwill, provides so much more value at scale that he's able to make, you know 10 million a month just on media a lot.
35:00
And he shared that on the podcast.
So I don't mind sharing it.
Those are the two big ones.
And then the third kind of bonus take away that I had was they run a lot more events than I thought they did, which I thought was pretty interesting.
They run an event every week.
I think that's isn't that a newer I?
Don't know if they have a new, they have that venue, but they're doing a little week.
And I thought that was interesting.
35:15
And then the second thing, you know, Bonus B2 is, was the amount of volume that he was putting in.
And that was part of what inspired me to basically do more was I figured that he would spend the majority of his time running Ramsey Solutions and then make, you know, do his show and then and and whatnot.
35:31
But when you look at actual hours, he spends like 20 hours a week making content.
And I also found that with PBD, he also did 20 hours a week and some of these other brands that produce a lot of content.
And when I look at my hours significantly less than that could spend way more on the portfolio side.
35:47
And so the building was somewhat of a commitment investment towards building towards that.
I think what I'm getting from this is that you were inspired by Dave Ramsey.
You bought this building and you can turn your version of my.
Way.
Your Dave Ramsey approach to what you're doing.
36:04
Yeah, that'll be an element of it for sure.
That's really interesting.
Yeah.
I mean, I wish you could tell us more about.
Model, yeah, I mean you'll see it, but a model success, you know what I mean?
I mean I think that we will do it a little bit differently because we're, you know, we're us, we talk about business, we have different subject matters and whatnot.
But I think it's funny because I've been a remote only business since I mean basically my almost my entire career.
36:23
And so I mean I had my in person gyms, but even those I ran from home because you know I I didn't drive out to all the locations every day.
And so it's really cool having the in person now and like seeing people at the office every day.
And I think the amount that we can influence and teach and and upskill the team in an in person environment is so much faster than in a remote environment.
36:43
And the ability to influence culture at scale is so much faster and in a person environment.
So I'm actually just very excited for our speed of execution that we're probably gonna be able to.
Unlock When is the gym gonna be complete?
Probably a month.
Well, I'll say it's stages.
So the entire gym will be done probably in a month, and it'll have the first wave of equipment.
37:00
I'll have equipment orders coming in for the next year after that.
Wow, I really wanna go there and work.
Out.
Oh, it'll be the best gym in Vegas and no one will be able to go.
No one can go but but Jack and I, it's.
Not gonna be like it's not like a public gym.
I'm not gonna like have it's.
A private gym.
It's like someone's out, you know?
37:16
Yeah.
It's my office.
I'm not like having.
But Jack and I?
Have a little bit of room for a couple.
Of Jack and I could go, right.
I mean, we getting invite you.
Just take it up with Layla.
I'm sure she'll she'll be able to write us in terms for.
Sure, she for sure says yes.
Are you going to put a ping pong table in there?
We.
Already have one?
37:32
Got it?
We game, we ball.
Are you living from the office?
I feel like I wouldn't leave like for you to be that efficient.
I would live there.
Not as much as you'd think, actually.
So to be fair, we're still like building out some of the stuff and some stuff's like half done, and so it's easier for me to do some things at home.
But one of the things we wanted to be really particular about was we wanted to create an incredibly rewarding environment that would encourage people to come, you know, as often as possible, but not have like rules.
37:54
As in you don't have to show up at 9:00, you don't have to stay till five.
Like, you don't have to succumb certain days a week because we've been a remote company.
But the idea was that we would want to create an environment that people wouldn't want to stay home from.
And so that's kind of what we're shooting for.
Yeah, When I saw, well, Jack and I saw Mr. Beast, he turned one of his offices into a bedroom and it was incredible.
38:13
And it made me kind of think if I were in that position, I would not mind living.
If I were single, I would absolutely live in the office.
If I were single, I would, yeah.
But I bet.
But it's big enough where you and Layla could have.
She's 3000 square feet in this place, a ton and you would never even know well.
38:28
There's already a suite.
There's two suites that have, well actually there's three suites that have bathrooms and full everything.
And the previous owner was international and so he would come and he would sleep here or sleep at the building and then he would fly back.
I think he was like Asian.
No, she wouldn't go.
Not even close.
38:43
Like, not a chance, Not a chance on on Earth.
I mean, that just seems like so much fun because, like, the gym is down there.
You also just never leave here.
And I think I think there's like it's almost creating space to be missed from work too.
It's like it's nice to have somewhere to go.
And I will say with the office thing and Jason, you can back me up here, I do feel it's such a different vibe going home.
38:59
When you work from home all the time, it's like home and work are just basically all the time.
But working somewhere separate from where you live when you get back at home feels a little bit more relaxing, which is kind of nice.
Sure.
Yeah.
So you prefer at this point having an office?
I yeah, I do.
I'm Super Pro Office right now.
39:16
Really like it?
That's something I've not had in a very long time.
I used to go into the Oppenheim group and almost every day, pretty much I'd be there.
Even when I was mostly doing YouTube full time, I'd still go into the office just because I liked it.
I enjoyed just getting out of the house, going somewhere.
It's exactly other.
People.
39:31
It's literally that.
Got me in the zone of working because it's like, oh, everyone else is here.
I put on my headphones and it's exactly that.
Felt motivated.
It's exactly that.
And I know I'll work out harder when the team's there around me.
Like, I'm like, I now I'm going to be able to like to be able to record content while I'm working out, which I don't really do because at public gyms it's weird.
39:47
I already get enough people stopping me.
It's like they don't want to draw more attention.
But like, I'll be able to do that at the gym there and that'll be awesome.
So like, now I'm actually having another rewarding, like, stimulus from working out.
So it's like I get to work out and then I also get to make content.
So it's like I have even more reason to work out.
So it's just giving more more ways to win, which I like.
40:04
I think it would make a great series if for your content what you would do like you know how Dave Ramsey has people on, Take note of this.
You work out with somebody else in kind of like a podcast setting, so you mic them up and you do workouts.
Planning on doing, yeah, OK, perfect.
40:19
Yeah, I agree.
I think that would be very.
Cool part of the plan.
Yeah, yeah, it'll I'll announce the name.
It's gonna be called Between Sets.
Between sets.
Fantastic name.
Wow, I like that.
Yeah, that's good.
Did.
You come up with that?
You did?
Yeah, cuz a lot of my life lessons actually happen between sets.
40:35
And so it's like I'd be lifting with an older guy and be between sets and he'd be like, you know, blah, blah.
I already asked him a question and he's like, yeah, this is kind of how I see it.
And I always liked that environment too, 'cause, like, at least my obviously my experience in the gym has been so overwhelmingly positive throughout my entire life.
I've.
I've had so many mentors, so many friends, so many life lessons learned in the gym between sets.
40:54
I want to kind of, like, take the audience along for that kind of same experience that I I mean, I grew up, basically.
I mean, I've spent so much of my life in the gym, you know, literally, like from teenage years in high school to literally what my career was.
For the first five years, my professional career after my job was literally being in the gym all day.
So I have just so many positive experiences there.
41:12
And just also as a weird side now, this is from a creator perspective.
I think like of my top like 20 clips of all time, like six of them are me at the gym and I've only recorded at the gym twice ever.
So it's just kind of interesting.
I was like, I don't know if it's like a juxtaposition of like, dude, but not talking about fitness stuff, 'cause I'm not I'm I basically.
41:29
Don't talk about, you know what The thing is Gym contents is doing really, really, really well right now.
And so it's it's a bit it's on an uptrend.
But the other thing I've noticed is that when you're talking, people lose retention if they're if you're just static.
But if you're there doing something, it's like listening to you with Subway Surfers on the bottom, except you could incorporate you lifting weights and speaking.
41:50
There's two things going on.
I could, I could watch you lift the weight and I could listen at the same time.
So I think it's really dynamic.
I think that's really important.
You would know, but yeah, so we're super stoked about that.
And also all my so all my tweets, the vast majority of them coming to me while I'm working out.
So it's like I'll be between sets and I'll just be firing off tweets and that's and so this time I'll just be doing that to a camera.
42:09
The one request I have Meet with Sam Selleck.
Do something with him as soon as possible.
I would love if if he could be the first person you have.
Between sets.
Well, we're gonna have one.
That's not him first, but.
Who's the 1st?
So when Chris Williamson and I did our podcast, we actually worked out together.
42:24
And so we had a really great exchange while we worked out.
And so the team compressed that into the, which will be the first episode of Between Sets.
But yeah.
How long is that gonna be actually?
You would know.
How long is the episode?
1314 minutes, Yeah.
We're not doing.
We're not doing.
We'll see.
42:40
We'll experiment with it.
I'm gonna tell you what will be the best if you make this an hour long workout and you include the entire thing.
Yeah, I think the entire hour with, by the way, no edits.
If you could do one straight shot, post it to YouTube, No edits.
42:55
Yeah, including like the you getting up.
Like you're kind of out of breath.
People are loving that.
That's why Sam is doing so well.
It's just no edits.
It's just real.
And that's what I think is lacking right now on YouTube.
Yeah, no, I mean we'll we're down for anything.
Yeah.
You know, whatever serves the audience we're we're happy to you know provided it works with our values.
43:13
We're down to don't know.
What's your hair care routine?
Oh God, nothing.
Do you use shampoo?
No.
What?
What do you mean?
You don't use you don't use shampoo?
Why?
My hair gets like fluff, super fluffy, so I just.
Don't just use water.
43:29
What about conditioner?
I.
Don't.
Ever.
No shampoo ever, right?
I feel like for like 8 months.
Yeah, but I feel like the hair just way down.
You scrub, I mean, you scrub.
I mean you still scrub your scalp.
You still like?
Thing is, you strip yourself of the natural oils when you do use shampoo.
43:45
This is the theory.
And then you over produce these oils which then makes your hair really oily and creates dandruff.
But if you get past like the lump of like, no shampoo.
And ends up being healthy.
I don't.
Know.
I mean, I've been doing this for years.
I've been doing this for years.
And it's also good because apparently when you're like really scrubbing on your scalp, it facilitates hair growth as well.
44:03
It's what they say you're stimulating the.
Working forms, you know.
What about your beard?
Do you use any product there?
Actually, I started using basically like a basically it's like a chapstick for your beard, but it's just I, I and if I, if I comb it out in the morning, it just stays a little straighter.
Otherwise it's just like, fuck, it's like a mangled monster.
44:19
And do you do that?
Do you keep this look because it's for branding?
Or do you do it like for any other reason?
It's so funny.
I got there was like a a mastermind or something like a group of people who were all.
So a buddy of mine was there and he was like, somebody got up and was like, so this is Hermosi's strategy to blah, blah, blah.
44:35
And I always find it funny when people break down my strategies when there wasn't one.
But I was wearing.
I literally am wearing the outfit that I can wear in the most environments comfortably.
So like, I can wear this at the pool, I can wear this at the gym, I can wear this at this podcast.
I can go out to dinner, 'cause I just throw a flannel on top of it.
I'm good to go.
44:50
And also we're in Vegas and so it's hot a lot.
And so I wear like, the lightest thing that I can wear with.
But that beard is more maintenance to keep it like that, I'm guessing, than it is to trim it.
No trimming and shaving is way more than this.
I literally just exist.
And then I come in the morning 5 seconds while I'm on zoom.
45:09
Jason will five.
I'll be on Zoom.
Yeah, but you have to trim it every now and then, right?
No, somebody comes you.
Sculpt if something, everything.
Comes.
Why can't you just do it yourself?
I let him do it.
I mean, I just sit down.
He comes, I can take a call, I can do whatever I want.
He's just cutting it while I'm there.
45:25
How much is that?
I don't know.
People have been saying it could be a weak chin.
A weak chin.
He's actually.
What?
I say to this.
He's hiding a no chin.
Yeah, you're right.
That's what they're.
Saying you're right.
That's it.
That's.
What it is, It's all what's behind.
45:40
It that's what it is, Yeah.
It's weak Chin.
OK, one let I have a question about the Nicorette.
Sure.
Have you found Cuz I've heard, I actually heard this from Tucker Carlson on Theo Von, which is amazing.
If you guys haven't seen it, you guys should watch it after this episode that this Nicorette stuff.
45:56
Like nicotine in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's this stuff, all the auxiliary things that happens when you ingest nicotine, usually, which is like the smoke that hurts your lungs or your gums and etcetera.
But nicotine actually increases mental acuity, it makes you more energetic, it motivates you, etcetera.
46:12
Have you noticed the same thing with this Nicorette?
I mean, I mean, I've been to a Nicorette for like 14 years.
Really.
I I didn't know this.
Why?
Why do you start?
Well, I mean, I like nicotine in general.
How did you get started on that?
I started chewing nicotine.
46:28
You started chewing it or you started smoking I.
Started chewing nicotine.
You went straight to chewing.
How do you decide?
One day I'm gonna start chewing.
I liked dipping and then I was like, well, dipping's bad for you.
So then I just like started chewing Nicorette, got the same benefits and and chewing it so.
46:43
What are the benefits that you get?
It's I mean it's a short acting stimulant.
So it's a 30 minute half life.
So like you can chew this at 5:00 in the afternoon because you want to have like a boost from 5:00 to 7:00 or something.
Now 30 minutes.
So it's like it'll half multiple times in that time period but you can go to sleep fine And so it's one it's an appetite suppressant.
47:01
So if you are trying to like maintain calories or something like anything like that like if you are hungry and you're like oh shoot, I'm gonna it's I got to take a call at 12 and I'm hungry now I got to wait till one.
It's like you can pop in a credit and it's just very easy.
It is stimulating from a energy like perspective.
It also increases short term memory, which is nice and I have a history of Alzheimer's in my family and it's been shown to decrease the likelihood of of Alzheimer's because it promotes angiogenesis, which is just basically increasing blood flow in the brain.
47:28
And then what are the negatives of doing that?
I haven't found any.
I see nicotine a lot like caffeine.
Like, it's just it would just be like if for some reason we magically found that coffee had like cancer causing stuff in it, but caffeine itself was fine, it's like, OK, well don't drink coffee.
47:44
You can still like drink Mountain Dew or you can just take caffeine pills.
Exactly.
I see nicotine the same way and I also haven't found myself addicted to it.
Like I forget to chew it.
I like it because I've, if you want to talk about, like associating things from a behavior perspective, like I chew nicotine when I work and so I have associated work with nicotine.
48:01
And so it's like, if you want to get addicted to work, then put an addictive agent close to the thing that you actually want to do.
But if I don't work, I forget to chew it.
Why aren't smokers just chewing Nicorette gum all the time?
Smoking is addicting.
It's the oral fixation.
Smoking is addicting.
I guess this is the first I've ever heard if someone is chewing the gum.
48:17
Yeah, smoking is addictive.
Smoking separate, like nicotine in and of itself.
And I'm never gonna get in the science pros in the comments, but like, I have no draw it.
I forget to take it.
It might say take.
I mean chew it, I forget to chew it.
So I have not found it to be addictive.
Per the science people that I know, into and of itself is not addictive.
48:36
It is the other things like chewing tobacco, like the act of dipping, things like that are addictive.
Smoking is addictive.
Vaping itself is like the.
I thought those were addictive because of the nicotine, not because of the way they're consumed.
Multiple things.
You're saying.
You could have decaf coffee and it would satisfy your coffee addiction in the same way, Essentially assuming caffeine and nicotine are.
48:55
Well, it would be like me smoking a cigarette that doesn't have caffeine if that was the analogy, right?
So I don't understand.
Well, no, no, no.
Like, like you're saying, it's not necessarily the nicotine 'cause you say you forget to take it.
Yeah, but for the people that are addicted to smoking cigarettes, it's the oral fixing.
Things are paired.
I think it's the together.
I think it's both the things together and also like there's also many cause like also when do people smoke and like this is getting like I'm gonna be very clear this is beyond my, you know my scope but people pair things that are positive with smoking.
49:20
So it's like you go outside, you get some time like you're working, you, you associate it with a break and then you light up.
So it's like there's all of the other things that get associated with together and that's what gets harder to to quit.
Got it.
That makes sense.
But I enjoy it.
49:36
If you are wanna someday start into the nicotine world, just don't take too much.
Try to get Layla addicted to it and no one gets addicted so doesn't really matter.
But she chewed too much and she was like this isn't for me.
I was like well that's like drinking a whole bottle of vodka and and saying like alcohol isn't for me.
I was like take a shot, see how you feel.
49:52
But I think the same thing with nicotine is like chew 1/2 a milligram and just see how you feel and go from there.
I mean, I chew a ton, but I just like it.
So whatever I.
Do believe that we probably have to put some sort of disclaimer here, Yeah, Oh, absolutely.
The Iced Coffee Hour people.
We're not knowledgeable on this subject.
50:07
Oh, neither.
Intuitively I would say don't do it, but you do have somebody that says it has positively affected.
Don't do it.
In the same way that Tucker Carlson said that it has positively affected his life.
But I don't know.
I've just heard bad things.
That's what they taught me in schools.
And my official stance is don't do it and it doesn't affect me.
50:24
What you do so like and what I do doesn't affect you.
That's fine.
I have accepted whatever risks come with it.
I enjoy it.
And if I die five years younger, it's OK.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's.
That's so fascinating.
50:39
The laugh.
The laugh at the end.
Why do you need to live a long time anyways?
Well, because.
Compared to 1000 years, whether it's 85 or. 70 It's only life or only opportunity at anything, right?
Then wouldn't you wanna extend it?
Not.
Necessarily, I think there's a difference between health span and work span in lifespan.
50:56
Like some people like add years to their life, but they don't add life to their years.
That's great.
I like that a lot.
That's a fantastic quote.
You've tweeted that I'm guessing.
No, but I'm sure someone is.
You should.
That's a great tweet right there.
Do you have any other tricks like the Solomon chats that you employ to be better off?
51:15
Sure.
I have a lot of frames on dealing with stress and missed expectations because I think if you're in business or really just in life in general, like you're bound to have expectations that are not met.
And so I've just have a number of, to your word tricks that I've used.
51:30
So like one of them is one that I call the frame of the veteran, which I got for Doctor Kashi, which is basically like something bad happens.
And then you imagine that it happens 1000 times in a row after that.
And then you think, OK, well, how would I feel in the thousandth time of this happening?
And usually on the thousandth time you would have already habituated to it and just be a part or fact of life.
51:47
It's like, well, if that's how I can feel about it, then, then I might as well feel about it now that way now.
And so I actually, the first time I ever used it, I had, I just bought this, this who sounds so hokey.
I got this flannel shirt that I really liked.
It was like a color scheme I thought was cool and the maid that I had shrunk it and I was like super annoyed.
52:05
And I thought to myself, I was like, well, if everything that she ever did shrunk and every time I wash something shrunk, then I wouldn't be upset about it, 'cause it just would be how clothes work in the dryer or so if that's how it always was, then I wouldn't be upset about it.
So if I can choose to not be upset about it then, then I won't be upset about it.
52:21
Now and then it was over.
And so it's like having like frameworks like that that have served me really well.
Like the the reason I had the the time one when we just talked about like, lifespan is like when my cat Bill died, I was super bummed because I really liked the cat and he died at like 18 months.
So it's kind of like weird.
52:36
It was like a freak, odd death.
And I remember being sad about it.
I was like, why am I sad?
Like what?
Like, why am I sad?
And I was like, I feel like it's not fair that he lives such a short life.
I was like, OK, so that means that I had an expectation that he would live longer than he did.
52:51
I was like, what if cats only live six months and I got to hang out with Bill for 18 months?
Well, then I'd be like, well, shit.
I mean, he lived a good long life.
I mean, I got him three times longer than most people get their cats.
And so then all of a sudden, like, my status was like, it shifted to, like, more of an appreciation for the time that I had with him.
53:09
And so it was.
It was simply just shifting my expectation around what I expected or I demanded of the universe that my cat should live longer.
But, like, but why?
And then I think about that within the context of, like, our lives.
Because if all humans live to 20, if we live like at 34, I'm like, dude, I'm murdering it.
53:29
But like within the context of like all time, we all don't live long at all.
And so if I got to live the way that I wanted to live for the extent of my life, it's only the expectation that I would deserve to or demand that I live longer and have that unmet, which is the thing that would cause me to be more upset.
But if if I make life choices that cause me to live till 75 versus 85, the lifespan is still the lifespan and the only thing I lose is the president.
53:50
So all of these things, what I like about it is that it's just a change in perspective.
It's not a change in what is, it's just a different framework of.
How you see it.
And that makes that makes all the difference.
One of the other frames I use is it's just zooming all the way out, which is one of my favorites, which is just, you have this instance that bothers you.
54:07
Whatever happened where I lose $15 million, I'm really upset about it.
And then I just like, zoom all the way out and I'm like, you know, far enough out you can't even see the Earth.
And I just like remind myself of that.
And then I'm like, OK, this just doesn't matter.
And then I zoom back in again.
And so I usually play with time and space in terms of trying to reframe whatever the issue is that I'm upset about and think like, what is the expectation that I have and how is it unmet and how can I shift that expectation?
54:29
And what if the expectation went completely different?
What if every time I drove there was always 20 minutes of traffic?
Would I still be upset?
Probably not, because it would be just like how it always is.
And so like using those things on a regular basis, I think it allowed me to make better decisions and be a little bit less emotional or reactive to bad news.
54:45
But I think if you compound that like small amount of space that you can create for yourself for an extended period of time, you can make better decisions.
And so that's probably been to answer your question, like some of the tricks that have been really useful for me.
I'm wondering, because you spend a lot of your time working and it seems like you have this routine every single day is somewhat similar.
55:02
Are you concerned that you're spending some period of time in your life that a lot of people would deem like the golden years doing the same thing over and over again?
Rather than like openness to experience and maybe trying traveling or trying and going this, doing this new hobby like this ping pong thing, right, Doing a new thing and experiencing it.
And then what if it's like 10 times better than whatever you had?
55:19
What if you allocated a certain percentage of your time on a weekly basis to try out something new?
One, I wouldn't know if there was something that was better, and so that doesn't bother me very much, like there could be some.
I'm sure there's something that could be hypothetically better, but I also would hedonistically adapt to it anyways and probably return right back to my baseline.
55:38
I mean, there are people who live in Africa who never leave the tribe and are happier than we are.
And so, like, I don't think finding out more things is the is like the path.
But for me, to somebody who would criticize my, quote, way of living, I do exactly what I want with as highest percentage of my day as I humanly can with the people that I want to do it with.
55:56
And so, like, I get criticized from family still to a degree that I quote work too much.
But that's because, like, their projection of what work means to them is just so negative.
And if I said all I do is play video games all day, then they would say that I'm not working enough.
But what if I my job was to play video games all day?
56:13
Then I'd be working too much.
It's just like it's simply just their projections of how they would prefer I live my life.
Their statement is I would prefer you live your life the way I want you to live your life.
To which I say no, so I live my life the way I want to live it.
And that is enough.
Cool.
56:30
I love it.
OK.
Thank you, man.
Fantastic.
Thank you guys.
That was great.
We're so happy to have you on.
I want like I mean if it's not too much to ask every year you know they're occurring guests because look at we have developments like last time.
You shoulds now it's about because it's.
56:46
Exactly that.
That.
That's a huge change.
And I I bet you next time there's gonna be more exemptions, probably.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I'm gonna eliminate.
I mean, I try to eliminate all labeling language, but that is.
A big Then there's not even any is just.
I mean, yeah, I mean that actually is a big.








0:00
You think that everybody that has money is sophisticated about their investing.
And what I figured out was almost no one is.
They're very primitive.
And so I just learned that put money and stuff you love and you understand.
Don't put money and stuff because it sounds sophisticated, because you're getting ready to lose your butt.
0:18
Because you're trusting some guy who doesn't have any money who's trying to sell you something.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
0:37
Please share and enjoy.
I am super thrilled to be here today because Dave's a legend and I'm going to.
I'm going to give a little bit of an intro from my perspective of you this.
Is a little scary.
And I and I actually wanted to take the first like few minutes to actually just kind of like hype, Dave.
0:58
And I think it's because like on in the marketplace of attention right now, I actually still think you're underpriced.
I still think that you are underappreciated for the amount of value that you provide to the audience at large and.
Flattery will get you everywhere.
Got me here.
But one of the things I wanted to hit on was like I see, and I'm sure you do or your team does, like there are a lot of people who take, I would, you know, I'll use the term fake gurus.
1:22
But a lot of people who haven't achieved, you know, a 100th of the level of success that you have that take a lot of shots.
And at you and you know, a lot specifically around your views on debt.
But sometimes just in general.
And you know, we have a big belief at at acquisition.com that the only people that ever hate you are never ahead of you.
1:41
And I feel like that's been extremely true and it's been tough for people to be ahead of you in general.
But I just want to give context for my audience that number one, you've been doing this for three decades.
Yeah, a little over.
1:56
Yeah, 3 decades and your overnight 3 decades success.
Yeah, for real and just in time to get old.
And what I'm going to be directing the the conversation today around is actually around business stuff.
2:13
So Dave has a zillion things on personal finance.
I mean I think that was the, you know, the the wedge product that helps a lot of everything.
But because our audience is predominantly business owners, I want to focus on the actual building of Ramsey Solutions and kind of some of the things that you that you learned along the way, some of the big mistakes that you did, some things that you'd go back in time and would have done differently and even as you've kind of scaled the brand.
2:37
So that's kind of the direction.
Does that work?
OK.
So can you give a little bit of background in terms of how Ramsey Solutions, the education business, which was the first business correct?
They've all kind of evolved together, OK?
2:55
How did that come to be?
And then what was your thinking around the business model at that time and like what has it evolved into?
Well, all of it started.
Extremely primitive.
3:12
I mean like 1 + 1 = 2, barely, you know, kind of thing.
And so like, for instance, we started, I, I, I went down.
There's a talk radio show or talk radio station in Nashville at the time that was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
And there was a guy doing a bad financial show, like a Saturday Night Live skit, you know, on there.
3:33
I went on as a guest on the bad financial show and I didn't have any books.
I just went on for fun.
I was actually promoting a real estate club I was in and he said, hey, I hear you're helping people with your with foreclosures and helping them stop getting their car repoed or if they're having financial trouble over at your church, are you doing that?
3:52
And I said, yeah, I'm just kind of doing that for fun, just to help folk as a ministry at the church.
And he goes, wow, if you got any questions about that call up and phone rang and he never got any phone calls.
He didn't know what to do, didn't even know how to put the guy on the air.
And so he said, hey, come back, let's do that again.
Because his phone never rings.
4:07
And so I went, I did it like 2 times.
And then he quit and then we went down and talked to that guy that that was running that station into letting us work for free.
And so a couple guys, me and a couple other guys went on the air answering questions in a really heavy hillbilly twang, WWTN you're talking Nashville.
4:29
Y'all call in.
I mean it was it was nasty, buddy.
I'm telling it was nasty and but with information was good and the phone rang from the very first day at about the same time I had finished writing on my laptop in my living room on the very first version of Windows.
4:46
This is 1992, my first book and I self published it carried home in the trunk of my car.
Got 1000 copies and I went on the radio and said hey y'all get my book and some people did and and the 18 months later educate to get to your question.
5:04
We moved the card table out of my living room and 1 old beat up desk from the days when I went bankrupt and open an office in an 800 square foot month to month rent and me and another guy and the other guy was going to do financial coaching the way I teach to do that.
I was going to continue to do that and we launched a in April of 1994 a class on how to handle money.
5:27
It was actually how to avoid bankruptcy.
And one of the lessons was on the different types of bankruptcy.
One of the lessons was on how to stop a foreclosure.
If it's an FHA, if it's a VA or if it's Fannie Mae, different processes to stop a foreclosure.
And you know, all these different things.
5:42
And the people that came weren't bankrupt.
They were just making a lot of money and spending it all.
So they were broke.
It was all the money comes in, all the money goes out.
Only the names are changed to protect the innocent.
But they weren't behind on their house payment, right?
They just were fighting with each other in their marriage, and they didn't know how to do a budget.
6:01
And no one ever told them about insurance.
So I took the bankruptcy and the foreclosure lesson out and replaced it with a retirement lesson.
And here's how investments work.
Lesson compound interest.
Whoa.
And which is you know still for the general public causes their brains to just go meltdown in in a wonderful way the first time you see compound interest.
6:22
Right.
And so yeah, we that was called life after debt in April and four people came the first night I sold three of them.
So for you digital people I had a 75% conversion rate set up right.
But I'm telling you it's primitive overhead projector bad suit you know that whole thing.
6:40
And then we changed it to called it Financial Peace University.
The five months later, in September, six months later and now Financial Peace University's had 10 million people go through it and 50,000 churches have taught it.
Unbelievable.
So for context, the services that you had was education with some level of service kind of like holding accountable or keeping them consistent On top of that, which the reason that I I was really intent on talking to you was that in the space that we're in today and obviously the the marketplace has changed a lot.
7:14
You have an education business and I would say that the vast majority of quote education businesses are not perceived as legitimate.
How do you think you've been able to anchor in it like it's it's very clear that Range Solutions is a legitimate business obviously, but what do you, why do you think that so many of them are not perceived that way?
7:39
Like what's the gap?
What are What are people missing there?
I I honestly don't know.
I I know that in the financial world in general and I think most of your listeners and you and I will agree to this that that there's a lot of us.
7:55
I grew up in that world and and and I'm a nerd by nature and got a degree in finance for God's sakes.
And so I, in other words, I thought the way to fix everything was with the math.
And math treats the symptom, not the problem.
And what our brand differentiator and it may be the difference in what you're talking about as well it is that we did come to understand that it's a behavior problem.
8:19
It's personal finances, 80% behavior, 20% had knowledge.
I've said that like I don't know 8,000,000 times in 30 years and but it is.
And the problem with my money is the guy in my mirror, if I can get him to behave, he can be skinny and rich.
And we've talked about this all these lines these riffs that we do and we do them over and over and over and over and over again and but it but.
8:38
But that's the differentiator.
That's the thing that he said Oh yeah because I mean knowing how to do a budget is different than actually doing 1.
Knowing how to live on less than you make or that you should is different than actually doing it.
Knowing that eating 73 doughnuts will make me fat is different than not eating 73 doughnuts.
8:57
Right.
Personal testimony but the But yeah that that stuff.
I think that's the difference.
And then what has happened is that if you go through and you do the stuff that we teach and we've got the systems in place to help you be held accountable to do it and encourage you when you're struggling and scared and hopeless, it.
9:21
But if you're arrogant and prideful either way, we're going to be there in your grill saying we love you so much that you need to change.
If you do the stuff and you actually make the changes due to the accountability that that that because if you doing what you've been doing you can keep getting what you've been getting.
9:36
So you got to change the recipe.
So if you change the recipe you have success and lives transformed is legitimacy that gives you legitimacy.
And so in in other words I don't know if they set out to be illegitimate but they didn't maybe they didn't have the the the the life wasn't actually changed.
9:58
You know, if I join a gym and then I don't get anything out of that, I don't have any weight loss, no increased muscle tone, no, you know, increased aerobic, whatever, whatever it is you're trying to accomplish.
If I don't get any of that, even if it's my fault, it feels like the gym is illegitimate.
10:17
I don't think the gym's necessarily legitimate, but the results were illegitimate.
And so then you get labeled that way.
And so I hear people say Dave Ramsey stuff doesn't work.
The haters, right.
And it absolutely does not work unless you're working, yeah.
Like I guarantee that.
10:34
I can make you that personal guarantee.
Shifting back to the business, explain to me how, how the actual products we developed over time.
So in the beginning you had the education and then you had the services that that layered on top of that.
10:50
Was that the main thing for like a decade or and and like walk me through how you ended up scaling that.
Was that all through media?
We had the, the.
OK.
The the radio show didn't make money for a decade because they don't pay you to do radio.
Even today I don't get paid by radio stations.
11:06
I have a a clock split with them and so and we didn't have anything to sell when we split the clock and so we didn't make any money.
So whatever we put into radio was lost dollars.
But it was the megaphone.
It was the the, the the lead mechanism.
11:23
OK.
And so we we, I start doing some speaking and then I thought hey, we could do like a little public event in town because we were on only on the air and one time.
But so we went on the radio and announced and I think we had, I don't know 100 people or something come out and paid us like 40 bucks or something to sit for three hours or five hours or what it was and listen to me Yammer in my hillbilly twang about getting out of debt.
11:48
And so we had live events started to develop.
We had the little book, so we had a little bit of a publishing thing going and we had the class itself which is a long form.
It's a combination of 12 step and curriculum so to speak and and and and so radio, publishing, live events, those were the 1st and what becomes financial Peace University were the first LM Oh, and one-on-one coaching, one-on-one counseling we call it in those days, we now call it financial coaching.
12:19
So there's no confusion that we're not licensed therapists because some people can't seem to.
It's not clear.
But anyway, coaching is hard to mess that up.
So yeah, so we do that.
And each of those things grew at different rates.
And so there were different times in the 30 years that Financial Peace University was bringing in the lion's share of the money and then publishing would come up and pass it.
12:45
Live events has pretty much always been a slightly profitable but really good secondary lead source.
So if you come to a live event because you heard us on the radio, it's going down the funnel, the marketing funnel so to speak.
And then they might buy Financial Peace University which is you know a nine week commitment and a higher you know instead of a $20 event ticket it's a $80.00 to go through it or whatever they.
13:09
So we were working that that and there were always books on the back table too.
So and so once those things worked and the book and then we had a New York Times, you know the book eventually involved and was purchased by a publisher and became my first New York Times bestseller once that happened.
13:25
And then we start doing a bunch of, we start getting more and more radio stations and doing more and more media.
So instead of just doing the little local news Sky, we actually with the book tour the first time got on the Today show and and then that opened up something, then that opened up something and then pretty much been doing New York media for 25 years.
13:46
Obviously all that's free, but it's lead generation.
And so if I were to say this back to you, the radio station served as the big megaphone to gather attention and then point it in a direction.
And one of the places you'd pointed in the earlier days was the live events, which functioned a little bit as a conversion event for you guys from a business perspective.
14:05
And then those people would get funneled into whatever was appropriate for their budget.
You know, either they'd buy some books or they'd buy the curriculum where they buy the curriculum and someone on one council, one-on-one financial coaching.
And then that machine has been what you've continued to spin the wheel on and then gathering more and more and more media.
14:23
Yeah, we've got and we've got more and more product mix, OK.
I mean we've got, you know, we ended up, I advertised for a stock brokerage firm and then when I sent the leads, the people would go over there, the local broker that they went to would tell them to do stuff that I had just told them on the air not to do.
14:43
And so that didn't work and people are pissed off.
And yeah, and so we said, well guys, y'all can't do that with the leads we send you.
Well, you can't tell us what to do.
And I said I can tell you can't advertise.
So we're not really on the air.
So we dropped those folk And so the product suite from there, that was the core initial product mix.
15:06
And then what we did was we would hear about some need that was a a similar thing but a finger off of that.
So for instance a local coach at a Catholic High School was took my financial peace book and started teaching his seniors because they needed to know about personal finance with and then called me up and goes, hey, I hope you don't mind.
15:26
I'm like well, I don't mind and I'm kind of complicated, but let's work together on this.
Let me.
So I went over and spoke to him a couple of times.
They're sweet kids and he's a great guy to Greg Carson, he's a friend of this day that was.
And we ended up out of that developing a high school curriculum that's now been taught in 48% of the high schools.
15:42
Six and a half million kids have been through it.
And so you know, that was again another product line that Ed Solutions is another department if you will, inside of Ramsey today and pretty substantial revenues for high school, college and even middle school curriculum.
15:58
And and then, you know, corporate America says, OK, we'd like for our employees to get this stuff.
So we take a modified version of the financial Peace University that doesn't have as much of the Bible stuff in it and we have to not violate some HR rules and stuff.
16:14
So we had to change some of them, make it a little more of an ally on different things.
And it's called Smart Dollar and gosh man, lots, I don't know 10,000 companies have now taught it and including big ones like U-Haul and Costco, all of their employees have gone through it.
So that's a whole other product line, but it's you know there.
16:31
So there's the brand suite or the product suite continues to evolve as we look at different things where we can serve.
We took over all the publishing and so we do.
All our books, now self published, have for about a decade.
How do you think about spinning out new products like what to do versus not like because there's obviously focus in a business, right?
16:51
If limited time and resources.
Like how do you say this is going to be something we're going to just partner with someone on or this is somebody something we're going to bring in house and actually own entirely or just not do it all and ignore and just let somebody make some extra cash on it and we just don't worry about it?
Yeah.
Well, one thing we don't do is we don't.
17:09
We have made a conscious philosophical decision to not sell financial products.
So we don't sell insurance.
We don't sell investments.
We don't sell real estate.
We endorse people that do, but they don't work for us.
They're advertisers of shorts endorse in our Ramsey trusted is what it falls under that brand.
17:30
So some of them are have ads on the podcast.
Some of them we say go to the website and fill out a form.
You find the realtor we recommend in your area, that's Ramsey trusted, that kind of thing.
And so that way when I'm giving real estate advice, someone doesn't say, oh, he's just trying to get us to do that.
Now they still say he's trying to just get us to be a real estate lead, but that's a different than he's trying to sell me a house or he's trying to sell me a mutual fund.
17:53
We don't endorse particular mutual funds and we don't sell investments like that.
So you can't say the reason Dave does insurance is because or says term by term insurance is because he owns a term insurance firm because I don't.
And you know one of the lies out there floating around is I own half of Churchill Mortgage, which I don't know a dime of.
18:13
It'd been nice if I had and I've done really well and I don't, I don't have for some of Zander Insurance.
They're both advertisers, been with me 2627 years consecutively and but I don't own any of those.
They're just they're they're they're friends of mine.
But I may be doing business with them for three decades and they do really well and I do a great job for our listener.
18:32
And so those are media partnerships, they're sponsors, and that's how you're.
Sponsors.
That's all they are.
I mean they're just advertisers on the on the original talk radio show, which is now like you guys, I mean podcast and Youtubes and Tik Toks and the whole thing, everything, yeah.
Would have been some of the major beliefs that you had to break along the journey from and if so what's what's top line revenue today across all of the portfolio I'm calling portfolio.
18:58
I'm using my own language but and across Ramsey solutions.
Ramsey Solutions Revs will be a little over 300 million this year.
OK, so for context, in terms of size here for my audience, 300 a lot.
So what?
What, what were some of the because you know, a lot of businesses grow, at least in my observation of businesses is they're they're stepwise, it's they'll, they'll grow, they'll grow and then they'll hit something and then they stay there until they figure out whatever that thing was and then they go super fast again and then they hit another wall and they keep going.
19:27
What have been some of the, you know, two or three major pivot points in the business in terms of your lessons or beliefs that you had to reshape that allowed you to breakthrough to new levels of growth?
You know, I think because the product line was so diverse, the different ones of those were stepping at different times and it caused our actual revenue growth to not stair step but to be fairly smooth, interesting on a curve, got it.
19:58
But like, you know, if we went for instance to Financial Peace University, it went through different seasons where it would go wee and then it was stop and it was just sit, you know, and and we're kind of in one of those stop and sit modes now because we're making this.
Transition from being primarily church distributed because churches aren't teaching classes like that in this current environment as much as they used to.
20:17
And so we've got to have a more direct consumer digital distribution methodology and we're we're discovering that right now.
So it's plateaued right now.
Financial University is awesome, it's excellent.
But it's from a business revenue perspective, business model it's you know it's big spike would have been the mid 2000s.
20:34
I mean it made it went crazy up and it was kind of like the 800 LB gorilla revenue wise inside the building and then it moved over to the other thing.
So what are the your question is not the stair step of question.
Your question is what are some milestones along the way?
20:50
Like lessons believed you had to shift.
That allowed you to be an entrepreneur that could get to, I mean 10.
I mean do you remember when you hit your first $10 million a year, first 30 and your first hundred and your first, you know any, any big changes that happened in you as a person that that you can denote and say, I learned this and This is why we were able to breakthrough that.
21:07
Yeah I I figured out fairly early that that organizations are not going to outgrow the character and intellectual capacity of their leadership primarily me.
21:28
And so if I'm if I remain dumb in some of the areas I'm dumb in then we're we're not going to be at 600 million you know I've got to or somebody else will be doing it and if they remain dumb they can't you just can't do it.
I mean there's stuff you don't know and and so I was AI grew up in a real estate household.
21:45
Mom and daddy were in residential real estate business And so I've been selling my whole life straight Commission for me but self-employment is a isn't my DNAI don't.
I don't know how to think about working for someone and some and when you grow up in that world, you know you learn to kill it and drag it home because you ain't got anything to eat if you don't kill something and drag it home.
22:03
And so very tactical and so I couldn't spell strategic when we started and we got large enough that we started hiring these things called MBAs and these people that actually had.
And now over the years I've got a ton of MBAs on the team and I love the MBA programs most of them that are out there they do a really good job of teaching.
22:23
But one of the things I learned almost universally about MBAs, they are heavily steeped in strategic thought.
And so the MBAs on our team and me about 20 years ago made a really good trade.
They taught me how to think strategically because I didn't know how and I taught them how to work.
22:44
So it's a good trade.
And so would you say that basically them coming in and talking strategy was like a big unlock in?
Terms of growth, critical thinking skills, The way you solve a business problem, How do you, you know, I would just go in there and go, OK, the answer is activity.
22:59
Just go run into the wall enough times and the wall will fall down.
Meanwhile, the NBA standing over the side going, hey Dave, over here there's a tour.
If you just walk around, you don't really, I mean, you don't have to run into this stupid wall, this is dumb.
And so 'cause they're they're looking down on the maze, the labyrinth, and can see the way through.
23:16
And I'm just going just get after it.
Just get in there and hustle, you know?
And you need to have both.
You got to have the energy of the hustle and grind and the because when in doubt, activity is the answer.
But unfocused, unplanned activity is not always fun.
23:33
It causes pain sometimes, too.
So we're much better at what my friend Jim Collins calls calibrated cannonballs now than just firing cannonballs, which.
From a branding perspective, because I think you've developed a really strong brand, what are what are some of the deliberate decisions you've had to make to associate with versus not associating with in order to continue to strengthen the brand, expand the media?
24:01
Because I would imagine like in the flywheel that is Ramsey Solutions, the media is a huge part of that.
And so like what has been one of the big things that kept that wheel spinning and expanding compared to the many other people who try to to top you.
I mean, even the people try and get more audience, more ear balls.
I I don't know.
24:19
We discovered.
I don't know how we figured it out.
It was accidental.
I guess it was people getting pissed at us in the early days.
Well, you know, like we would endorse something on the radio just local T local radio station and you know go to such and such car lot.
Well, somebody go over there and they go the guy tried to screw me, Dave.
24:34
He'd call me up on the air or call me up at my house.
You know find me in the mall and go you.
The guy you sent me to is a Dang gum crook Ramsey.
And so now I can't trust you.
And and I would lose the advertiser because I would have to cancel them because I was ashamed of them.
24:52
And so somewhere along the doing stupid stuff like not vetting who we're going to associate our brand with instead of just buying, oh, we were so happy we had an ad sold, you know, a little revenue.
My God.
And then you figure out that doesn't play well because you're destroying your credibility with the market.
25:09
We figured out we were a trust brand and radio endorsement taught us to be trustworthy, worthy of trust.
And so we're very careful.
As a matter of fact, just a few minutes ago I came out of a meeting where I turned down to potential advertisers and the sales team said we think we need to turn these down.
25:27
But before we do it's a lot of money we need to ask you.
And I said, yeah, that that guy, if we put that guy on, he's going to it's going to cause our audience is not no that's not so would you send your sister there?
Would you send your mom there?
Would you send your friend that you play softball with?
25:44
You know, would you send them over there?
And if they don't pass that acid test, we don't put them on the air.
So if I won't really buy it or I don't really believe someone should buy it for their own good.
I mean like 100% of the things we advertise I don't necessarily buy personally at my stage of life but I'm not the market for them either.
26:04
So but but I do believe in them and I believe they're good for you and sometimes we've messed that up.
We've endorsed things we shouldn't have endorsed in the early days even.
I mean it's it's in in the last few years I've had a really disastrous one that was a mess and it's caused me all kinds of problems.
26:23
But you know initially started out good and then turned bad and we didn't we didn't cut them off fast enough and that's our fault for not cutting them off.
But we weren't doing it for money.
We we're trying to help people and so it's a trust brand and and so no single relationship advertiser endorsement is it could not possibly give you enough revenue in our world to offset the damage it will do if they don't take care of the customer.
26:52
Because people all we've got is trust.
And if they don't trust us for that, they also aren't going to trust us when we tell them to get out of debt.
They're also not going to trust us when we tell them, hey, this is going to affect your marriage.
You know the the advice we give is no longer trustworthy if the endorsement is not trustworthy.
So the whole stinking thing ends up revolving around this word.
27:09
And so we spend a lot of time discussing and vetting and cheeseclothing the whole It's a mess.
But yeah, it's it's OK.
It's worth the effort.
I agree.
I'm with you on that.
And I mean I think that you know in acquisition.com we try to do the the same kind of approach which is like how can we be as trustworthy as humanly possible Because you know we, we do equity deals and so we have a huge vetting process and you know 99.9999% of the audience I have will never do business with me, but I still need to treat you know everyone so that the reputation which compounds is based on trust, so that we can do deals over the.
27:46
Long term and just to be very transparent it it's emotional for me and most people in this building when that doesn't go right, when we mess that up somehow because we our intent is to never mess that up and when it gets messed up, it hurts our feelings more than it does anybody's.
28:10
Mentor mind, give me this quote, you might like it, he said.
Never risk the Empire for a pot of gold.
Here it is.
That's a great one.
I love it.
So Speaking of pots of gold, so 300 million is where you're at right now.
What do you see as the as the next thing to get you know Ramsey Solutions to 600 million like you were saying earlier, like what's the, what's the path forward there?
28:29
Like what do you see as the strategic opportunity?
What are you investing in right now?
Well, we're seeing an explosion with our every dollar app.
For one thing it's it with minimal effort honestly has caught fire.
28:47
So we're going to pour a little more gas in that while we're at it, we're going to put some effort into it since it's working and we do think that Financial Peace University is going to stair step again and we've got to finish.
We got to find that methodology for delivering those age-old principles in a new in a new way.
29:03
We are a platform and delivery agnostic.
I don't care how we get it to you, but we got to get it to you and it's not an efficiently with the least friction possible.
So people actually do this stuff and so that that's their some things are going are logistically have in the last say 20 of the 30 years have not they didn't shrink they grew but they don't have the logistical ability to grow revenue wise as much.
29:35
And an example that be live events there's only so much of that you can do and it it doesn't it doesn't hockey stick you you 'cause you you have a bottleneck actual bodies on a stage and bodies to set the stage up and that kind of stuff and number of cities you can actually draw a crowd in and that kind of thing.
29:53
So the only way you can hockey stick that thing would be to run the prices where they were just not for the average guy and our whole thing we do is for the average guy so so that's going to if they if it stays the same or grows at 5% and something else grew at 50% it's going to get to be a smaller and smaller piece of the pie mathematically but not still not be something we're ashamed of.
30:13
We love live events and I'm we're one of the biggest event companies in America.
We do a great live events but but it's going to end up that one's not probably going to be the answer unless now streaming could it would have to monetize for the first time but they suck on monetization but but it's good at getting information out there.
30:37
So we don't see hardcover books as being something that's going to hockey stick in the coming years but I do think they're going to continue to be a a valid part of the mix.
So it's probably more digital application and delivery because it's the easiest to scale and lowest cost of goods and and it more easily iterates than anything analog.
31:04
And the rate of change has exponentially increased in 30 years.
It used what what used to would take us five years to see unfold in the marketplace is unfolding in five or ten weeks right now and how fast entire social media platforms become irrelevant is is kind of amazing.
31:25
And so you know betting the whole thing on one delivery mechanism woo dumb.
And so in my mind anyway, but yeah, so, So I think whatever it is is going to like an app, like a budgeting app or a delivery digitally of FPU or delivery digitally of our entree leadership, which is our small business teaching and coaching.
31:50
You only have so many physical coaches for small business guys and that's got a limiting factor.
Do I want 3000 of those people in a building?
No, I really don't.
I'd a lot rather figure out another way to help you folk out there, and that that is not as manpower hungry.
32:11
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check on my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not, keep enjoying the show.
32:28
So when you said the Every Dollar app just kind of like took off, is that like a micro example of how product iteration works for you is like let's throw something together, let's see how it works and then if it starts taking off disproportionately to like the effort you say, OK, now we're going to invest more resources in it.
32:46
Yeah.
We put a huge amount of effort into building it.
Oh, and launching the initial, yeah, it was a major initiative and a push and then it kind of, you know it it it's had a good growth rate, but it really wasn't.
But something shifted in the marketplace, I mean literally in the last four or five months and the way the consumer is viscerally responding to the word budget differently than they were certainly 10 years ago, but probably even 10 months ago.
33:15
And so when we develop things.
So we're going to, you know, we've always iterated it, we've always updated it, we've always made it better every time and all that kind of stuff.
But it just seems to be some attention that we didn't cause.
So why not join the parade?
33:31
Right.
I think probably someone that's the the macroeconomic environment has changed a little bit in the last, you know in that period of time people are probably feeling the need for a budget.
And it might be that.
I mean I think the product, the, the original launch on it was it's probably coming up on 10 years, you know, so OK.
33:48
And and the, you know the, the number of people that are walking around, adults that have have never lived in a world that wasn't a smartphone world is much larger than it was 10 years ago.
And so the marketplace has shifted in that regard, but the, the, the iPhone, the whatever whatever smartphone is native to a much larger percentage of population than it was when it was launched.
34:16
So we may just be seeing that demographic shift and then.
They're aging into.
It.
Yeah, that because they, you know, that age group.
I mean if you're 28, you you wouldn't ever think of doing a budget on paper.
It would not occur to you that that no more than you would handwrite a letter in cursive.
34:35
You know, I mean, it's just absurd.
So, but you know, when I started all this, that wasn't neither one of those was that unusual, right?
So Speaking of of of the app in particular as as a an increasingly large part of the pie, how does it measure compared to the other pieces like just by percentage, you've got the events, you've got the education, you've got entre leadership, you've got the app, you've got the live events like how, how do, how do, how do those divide up in terms of like size for Ramsey solutions?
35:05
The Ramsey trusted items which includes national advertisers and the whole smart Vista pros.
All the endorse all the people we endorse for investing, all the real estate agents, although there's about 8009 thousand different people that we endorse for in different areas tax really all that tax and real estate and investing through Ramsey Trusted and then you've got a singular national advertiser like a Churchill mortgage for mortgages that kind of all that falls under Ramsey trusted.
35:35
So that's a lot under there, but the the, the national associations plus the strategic alliance as we call them, the the what used to be called the ELP program probably amounts to 40% of the revenue.
And so not let it not putting on back to our earlier conversation, not putting on one that's bad is a big deal there because you're going to mess up the whole thing.
36:02
You know, you're going to mess up the empire with that singular bad pot of gold.
And so we have to, you know, to be a real estate agent and Ramsey trusted you really are.
We're really going to do the stuff we tell you do or we're really not going to let you in there.
I mean it's a big deal, you know and so because we love you and we love our customers and we want everybody to have a little love fest, we don't need anybody pissed off.
36:23
So you're really going to do this stuff.
So that's probably, I think it's probably sitting in about 40% of the Revs right now, but that's half that had gone building too.
In terms of the 1100 people that work here, entree leadership is probably 15%, you know something like that.
36:41
Financial Peace University is probably 15%.
You know every dollar is 10% maybe or less, it's less than 10%, but they know they just kind of fall out like that.
36:57
Publishing and live events together, not that huge revenue, but again, they're almost.
They're like middle.
Almost.
Almost.
Yeah.
They're almost lead gathering things.
So I'm trying to think what else falling in that P&L, but just something like that there's.
The big ones.
That's big rocks.
37:12
How do you think about reallocating or reinvesting capital within the business versus taking it out of the business as an owner?
Well, we we don't randomly.
If we have something we can.
I can get more ROI here on something that we have a high belief in than I could anywhere else.
37:35
I mean certainly on mutual funds at real estate.
I mean, I love mutual funds at real estate, but I mean I can get 1000% ROI on launching a product and I can't even approach that on this other stuff.
So I would rather deploy the capital here, but I don't need to deploy it stupidly.
37:51
So when in doubt, we take it home and we.
Doubt take it out.
Yeah, that's it.
And and plug it into the, you know, plug it into generosity and plug it into some more real estate or mutual funds.
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna pivot a little bit on the on the investing side because I wanted to give you something that you might not know but you did a a podcast with Graham Stefan and.
38:17
He was fun.
He's a great guy.
Yeah, Graham's.
Graham's a nice guy.
He's done, he's done a great job too on his stuff, man.
Yeah, he's.
Followed in your footsteps in a lot of.
Ways well he no he's he's different but I mean he's doing he's good he's we like him.
Yeah, Graham's a good dude, and he showed you his investment portfolio.
38:35
Oh yeah.
That's like a thing he does when he has people on.
I'm like, I don't know, Graham, I don't know if I'm qualified to help you with that.
Yeah.
You said something to him that massively changed the direction of how we invested, Just so you know.
Yeah, so I I just wanted to share that with you.
So I think you had said loosely well before I look at this, if this were your brain or your knowledge or your experiences, what percentage of this pie would you say is real estate versus stocks versus anything else?
39:02
And he said, well, because he had asked you, do you think I'm over indexed on real estate.
But when you asked him the question, he said, well, I mean I guess probably 85% of my knowledge is around real estate and I think his portfolio kind of reflected that.
You were like well then that's a perfect mix for you and for me as we were coming out of the of our liquidity event, we'd probably taken about 40 million home before that.
39:22
Wow.
Good for you.
That's awesome.
It's not 300 it.
Was 300's gross?
Dude, you know the difference of grossing that.
But anyways and so I had during while I was growing the business, I I basically just didn't really invest at all.
39:38
I mean, I just put in indexes and was like I'll deal with it later.
And then we had the liquidity event and I had, I talked to probably every guy that I know was who is richer than me and was like what should I do with all this?
And the answers that I got were as different as there are people under the sun, which left me more confused than anything.
39:57
And so the reason that that little piece of advice that you gave to Graham was so meaningful for me was that it was personalized because everybody told me what they did and what had worked for them.
But, you know, one of the guys I asked was like, oh, take all that and buy one huge building.
40:12
And I was like, I don't know anything about.
I was like, I really, I don't want to risk everything on one building.
He's like, well, I've been doing this 30 years.
Like, that's what you should do.
It's like I'm going to mess this up.
That scares the crap out of me.
Yeah, I have no tenants and termites and toilets and all that stuff.
I have no idea how any of that stuff works, right.
40:30
And so when I thought back on when I looked at that pie and thought, OK, well, what's my knowledge base, it was like it's all business.
Everything I've done has been business and all the money I've made has been business.
And so I showed that clip to Leila, my wife.
And I was like, I think, I think this is what we should do.
I think we should just stick to business and just buy businesses and grow them.
40:49
And so I love it.
That's what we did with acquisition.com is that.
We're like, good for you.
That's a great wow.
But that little piece of device changed the direction of how, I mean, how we allocate all of our assets and what we do.
Because it's funny, 'cause if I was going to write a $5,000,000 check into a building, I I'd, I got like, you know, three or four deals that were around that size in terms of check size and I'd get all the way to the end.
41:13
And I was like, I don't know what I'm doing and I'm just trusting that this is a good deal.
Like I had the Excel sheet and the, you know, projector returns all the stuff.
And I was like, I don't feel good about this 'cause I don't know when.
On the flip side, if I'm going to write a $5,000,000 check into a business, I feel fine about it because I'm like, oh, I know how like I know I've I don't know everything.
41:32
Obviously it's your, it's your, it's your sandbox, right?
Yeah.
And so anyway, that's.
Beautiful.
I love that.
That's what What happened was we had a product that we called wealth coach for a little while and we ended up doing these very small.
41:48
But I don't know, we charged more than we ever charged like 1000 bucks or something.
We always charged 20 bucks.
So to come to this little seminars and we would end up talking to these people that were millionaires or 5 million and 10 million.
And I I kept asking them, OK, what do you put money into?
Because they're they've actually done it.
42:03
They had money.
Like you've actually done it.
You have money.
And so it's not someone with a theory on TikTok, you know?
And So what I kept hearing from them was this array of all kinds of different things.
I couldn't.
It wasn't the answer to the question, wasn't a certain investment made them rich.
42:20
What it was was they put money and stuff they knew.
Yeah.
And I mean one guy was a car dealer and he had a massive classic car collection, which for an ego driven person is a horrible idea.
Right.
But because.
Because you can lose your butt in in any kind of collectible.
42:37
Yeah.
But for somebody that is in the car business and his his grandfather had a dealership and he, his father had a dealership and he had a he he knows that loves it.
Yeah.
He goes out in the garage and pets the cars.
I mean, you know, say guess what he's making That portfolio seriously gave him a great return.
42:56
Now do I recommend to the general public, go get a car.
No, no.
Put money and stuff you understand and you love.
And don't put money and stuff because it sounds fancy or somebody you know it sounds sophisticated because there's something that happens when you get money.
43:13
You think that everybody that has money is sophisticated about their investing.
And what I figured out was almost no one is they're very primitive.
I mean, a lot of people I talked to were farmers and we know they got lots of land.
They got dirt, man, That's it.
43:29
Just dirt.
And it doesn't even.
I mean, they don't even necessarily plant it, but they just buy dirt and one guy, 8000 acres of dirt, you know, And I'm like, God in Kansas, you know, I'm like, golly, I wouldn't need more good.
I don't know anything about that kind of dirt.
I like real estate, but that would scare me to death.
43:45
But for him, it was the most comfortable, natural thing in the world, to your point.
And so I just learned that put money and stuff you love and you understand.
Don't put money and stuff because it sounds sophisticated, because you're getting ready to lose your butt because you're trusting some guy who doesn't have any money who's trying to sell you something and driving a boy a bad car.
44:04
And so yeah, I won't name the bad car.
But anyway, yeah, I mean that that's, that's where that came from, was just anecdotally hanging out with those folks and researching it.
And it gave me peace because I was starting to make bank for the first time.
And I'm like, I need to be like doing double backflip, limited family partnerships or some kind of crap.
44:24
I don't even know what they are, but I probably ought to be doing one if I'm making this kind of money.
And and then I and you talk to a guy and he's like, yeah, you ought to do a double backflip with A twist.
And I'm like, yeah, but get right up to it.
And I'm going, you know, I don't half understand.
No, I think I'd rather just bury it in the backyard than that cause at least I know where it is.
44:40
You know it's.
Funny, though, because even with the dirt example, there's a guy who his entire investment strategy explained in an interview, He's like, you guys are going to be bored about what we're going to do for the next 55 minutes, 'cause I can explain it in five and we're like, and I, you know, I'm listening, I'm like, OK here, you know, here's it.
44:55
He's like, OK, So what I do is I find a city and I find the Main Street because usually there's a a Main Street that goes through the middle of the States, the oldest St. whatever it's like.
And then I take a ruler and I go out 30 miles, he's like, and then I buy all that land, he's like, and then I wait 20 years.
45:17
I love this guy.
And what are the, what are the big, any questions?
He's like, So what do you want to do with the rest of our time together?
They're like, so how do you hedge?
He's like, oh, Biden cash because you can't, you know can't take loans on land.
And yeah, that's that's what I do.
45:33
And we've been doing that for many, many, many, many.
I had dinner with a guy the other night that had $2 billion net worth and he's second Gen. but his dad was dirt doing dirt not unlike what your friend was doing.
And then he couldn't get the bank to do the deal and he was borrowing money to do the dirt.
45:51
And so he bought the bank.
It was a little hometown bank and they screwed with him.
And so he bought it and he's like, OK now they'll behave.
And then he started making money on the bank and got in and got to figure out how to banking and and now they own like 15 or 20,000 acres 3 wineries around the world and a whole bunch of banks bunch of community banks and they and they're billionaire multi billionaires and so yeah but it started from that and they don't really do anything else it's the the wineries are more of a fun project I don't I think they know what they're doing with those probably the way he was talking he knew wine and the but the but he knows banks and he knows dirt and that's where all their money is and they're they're not diversified for having as billions with an S you know I mean it's it's interesting those kind of people are enthralling to me.
46:45
And it's interesting cause most of the the billionaires that I have looked at, they usually make their money in one or two vehicles that they know exceedingly well where they feel like they have an unfair advantage.
And like they they they get there not because there's a marketplace advantage, but because they have an information advantage.
They know it better.
47:01
Exactly, exactly.
And if you go through the Forbes 400, I think it's 67% Last time I looked her first Gen. and they're all billionaires now.
You don't qualify if you don't have AB and they're first Gen.
And I think I looked at them of the first gens, it was 90 something percent were business driven.
47:24
So it was Michael Dell, you know, Bill Gates, Hobby Lobby.
David Greene, Chick-fil-A, True Kathy, you know.
And so they started a business and it led to either they took it public or they just monetized the crud out of it and it just has a value marketplace valuation.
47:42
Oprah, you know.
But you know, the the secret of Oprah's wealth is not her celebrity status.
It's the empire she built under the celebrity status.
And so, you know, you go down those things like that and you go, OK, you can get to one to $5,000,000 net worth with your 4O1K and your paid off home, but you know, mathematically impossible to get to a billion in your 4O1K.
48:06
It's not possible to do it.
So you got to do there's other strategies to be involved if you're going to do that.
So I wanted to take a quick second because it would it'd be hard for me to to to talk to Dave Ramsey without talking about debt and a lot of people.
So in my audience I'm kind of dead agnostic.
48:24
I don't talk much about it, but a lot of people don't know that I actually have no debt either.
And so everything I've bought to this point in my life has been cash.
Now I'm not against that.
I just kind of like talk about, you know, when I get right at the edge of something, I just, I end up not doing it.
It's been that way with most kind of loan things in general.
48:41
And I read financial or total Money makeover years ago and you had this line in there about debt that was I'm going to try and say it back to you as I understood it because there's there's obviously the big biblical component.
But for everyone who might not believe in that, I wanted to give at least my my rational understanding of how you see it, which is that debt introduces risk and risk when it when compounded over a long enough time horizon.
49:10
No matter how big a number you acquire, any number multiplied by zero is still 0.
And so if you know that you're going to be playing this game for a very long time, even a small amount of risk when you're going 200 miles an hour, you can flip the car.
That was my understanding of how you saw debt.
49:27
Is that accurate?
That's that's how I I saw it.
Or at least I interpreted your view on debt.
Now that line is actually from Warren Buffett, he in one of his in his famous annual reports.
They're, they're very cheeky and fun to read.
And especially the opening paragraphs or so in one of those he he was talking about in a down year like O 8, you know, we soon discover that leverage is not always your friend.
49:50
And those of us that could do math realize that any number multiplied by zero is going to equal 0 and that does that for you.
So yeah, it's again, having grown up in the real estate business, one thing you're going to do in the real estate business when I was growing up, if you said I'm going to be a real estate investor, they took you to the hospital.
50:07
They took out your risk meter and they broke it with a hammer and they put it back in.
You're not allowed to perceive risk if you're going to be a real estate guy because.
And because it's every it's a glass half full.
We're eternal optimists.
Everything's going to work out because real estate's always awesome.
It's just awesomeness home parade.
50:23
You can't mess this up.
The renters will pay your rent.
Oh God, that I'll pay your mortgage.
You.
How can you mess this up.
And you know so if if a little bit of leverage is is good, then a lot of leverage is amazing.
And and that's how I went broke.
You know I I leveraged up to my eyeballs on.
50:40
I had a bunch of short term notes and the bank called, did the unthinkable and called my notes when they got sold to another bank and they saw a 26 year old kid owed them a million two on the 90 day notes doing flips.
This was before Chip and Joanna told us how to do it and so and do a flip.
Oh my God, we didn't have HG to channel to tell us how to fix up a house.
50:58
I without cable TVI did this stuff and so yeah so that's where it came from And then what happened to me because I lost everything following the borrow all you can because it works plan I had to stop and go.
51:18
I think I've got a bad set of rules The playbook I've got sucks.
I keep losing and and my kids are getting skinny.
I mean this is not working.
So when I did that the 1st, as you said, the first door I went through was I was, I had just become a Christian.
51:36
And so I started studying the Bible.
And so from as a matter of faith, I started reading scriptures and all the scriptures say negative things about that.
It doesn't say it's a sin and so you're going to hell, but it's stuff like the borrower's slave to the lender.
You're a fool if you cosign.
I mean it says these things in scripture and then you talk to old rich people and they go, well, you stay out of that boy, you know, and OK that's kind of grandma God's and grandma's ways of doing it.
52:01
So what did I miss in academia when I fell in love with leverage from an academic viewpoint?
Because how is it it's incongruent to me that if this book of wisdom and these people that are long in the tooth with Gray hair, that have proof, social proof, they've got money and they kept it, are all saying avoid debt, what is it that we're missing in academic land?
52:26
With my intellect so spiritual, social proof, now I got to solve it intellectually.
And what I ended up doing, I ended up speaking at Vanderbilt to a group of MBAs early in my career.
And it it, it forced me to because I knew I was going to go in there and get tackled, right, because they're going to go, you're primitive moron.
52:45
You believe the Bible, you know you don't know anything and you don't know how to do math.
And I know I know how to do math.
As a matter of fact, it's about all I know how to do.
I'm a math guy.
So what I figured out was, was that in business debt or real estate debt business is not publicly traded.
53:04
No one includes all the math.
They leave out a risk factor associated with that mathematically.
And so we look at a very inaccurate and primitive measure of leverage.
53:20
And so if I can borrow this money at 2% and I can invest it at 8, why am I not making six?
Well, A, you left out inflation.
B, you left out taxes.
But aside from that, and that's pretty basic because this is the argument, it's that, it is that.
The argument is that primitive.
53:37
But you did not adjust for the risk you took on.
Because I think we can all agree if you have a business that's doing $10 million top line and you've got $12 million in debt, you have a lot more risk than if you had $2,000,000 in debt and even $2,000,000 is more risk than if you had zero debt.
53:54
We can agree that debt is equal to risk.
And if we can agree to that, then we ought to be able to sign.
If we're going to really get down in the analytical jungle, we can assign a mathematical formula that well, tada, there is one.
It already exists.
We just never applied it in that in the investment world they teach us to adjust.
54:13
You don't compare an aggressive growth stock mutual fund that has a high peaks and valleys on the graph, volatile with a growth and income fund which has almost no peaks and valleys.
So a growth and income fund may have a beta of a .8, meaning it is only 80% as risky as the S&P when you're comparing it to an aggressive growth stock mutual fund that might have a two point O, meaning it's twice as volatile, risky.
54:46
And so in that world we're taught, I mean one of the first things you learn doing financial analysis in that world is the you use the beta as an inverse in the math and you and you flip it on its head and you multiply it through and you adjust for risk mathematically so that you can then say after you adjust for the volatility, the .8 versus the two point O versus the S&P is a one point O, it's your baseline.
55:08
When you adjust for that risk, the perceived return of the aggressive growth stock mutual fund at 20% rate of return where the other one's making 11.2, it it goes away, it neutralizes it And you might end up with with a risk adjusted that 11.2 will come up and the 20% will come down risk adjusted.
55:30
And then you can actually compare apples to apples but you've risk adjusted for the volatility.
And mathematically we don't do that in business.
We just go oh, I want to buy a bulldozer, let's go get 50,000 at the bank.
And I think I can do it.
I think we can push some dirt and that that is your risk analysis.
55:48
Well, kiss my butt.
That is dumb.
OK And and people do that all the time.
And So what I determined was, is that I'm going to go, if you want to compare 2 dry cleaners, you know one has that, one doesn't.
I've got to risk adjust for that mathematically.
56:03
And you have to apply beta formula that I present that to this group of MBAs and they're all sitting there with their jaws on their lap going no one ever said that.
And I said it's because it's never been said.
No one, no one does it in the world, no one, no, you're not trained this way.
You're trained that way and only one bucket of finance, all the other buckets of finance, zero real estate people do this.
56:25
Zero, none.
They do not analyze risk.
And so if you take risk out, then unlimited leverage is logical.
But if you say unlimited leverage, they go, oh, oh, not quite, maybe 80%, maybe a 70%, maybe AL to V, right.
56:42
And you know, we.
But if you push them up to the edge, they can actually feel it a little bit because they there's a remnant of a risk meter in there, but it just doesn't function anymore.
That's where that came from.
No, I love it.
Probably more than you wanted, but.
Yeah.
No, no, I wanted to to kind of hear your take on it and because obviously in, you know in the, in the business acquisition world, there's also debt that's that's factored in Now we've done all, all cash deals up to this point.
57:07
But I wanted to just kind of hear your take on it.
And I I quote Warren Buffett a lot.
He's a big.
Yeah, but even though even in the publicly treaded realm, you know if you we were taught and and still taught bonds or debt.
And so if you're looking at a company with publicly traded stock, it has a heavy bond weight, you discount the PD, you you don't compare that stock apples to apples where the company has no bond rate 0 bonds.
57:32
They have zero debt.
They don't have bank debt, they don't have short term debt, They're sitting over there debt free you you would give them some benefit on their stock analysis.
Mathematically we're taught to do that.
But again, it does not transfer from the mutual fund world or the publicly traded world to the real estate world or the.
57:50
Small business world.
Small business, privately held businesses don't even, I mean, I know people that do, you know, do have a billion dollar top line and honestly, they don't even look at.
They just, they just, some of them, a lot of them just don't borrow money.
They don't even know why they don't borrow money.
58:06
They just don't borrow money because somebody told them to one time and they go, I like not being in debt.
I can sleep better and that's their entire analysis.
You know me, I've got analysis and I can do the country boy thing too and say I just sleep better, bring on a pandemic.
58:21
I got cash.
Yeah, I I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll bring us home because I had A and I could talk to you all day and I appreciate you taking the time to to you know talk to me and the audience the game have.
Been honored Fun, fun conversation.
If you had advice that you could, you know I'll keep it specific to business advice that you could give 40 year old Dave, would you tell him then that like you know now that you didn't know then?
58:52
Play incremental long ball.
Don't look for the home run.
I keep waiting for somebody to call me and for this to get easy.
One phone call and it's all over and it's like, oh, now I don't have to think about it anymore.
59:08
Someone else is going to do it for me.
It's all automatic.
It's never going to be automatic.
It's never going to be easy.
It's it's a hustle and grind.
It's a claw.
You're going to make a bazillion mistakes, make mistakes that are experiments that you survive.
You put out a hypothesis, you survive the experiment.
59:24
To live another day, to have another experiment put out another hypothesis, another product that fails, another idea that fails.
And our failures at Ramsey are in new, in number and in money, are way greater than our successes.
The only thing is we survive them.
A, we didn't have debt, and B, we never bet the farm on one horse.
59:43
And so from a diversification standpoint, we never pushed all the ships to the middle of the table on one hand.
And so we're not looking for the singular home run.
We're looking to survive and fight another day and keep iterating.
And the the culmination of that, the accumulated value of those iterations, are what we call the gleaming mountain of success, which turns out as a pile of garbage and mistakes that you're just standing on rather than laying under it.
1:00:12
I love that one of the things that we have in our community is 100 golden, 100 golden BBS.
No silver bullets.
There you go.
That's the one that's exactly, you know, you beat me.
That's much better than mine.
I would have just gone with that.
You know, it's the same thing.
I keep waiting on the phone call, but I mean, it's never.
I've had a couple of my thought was it, and then I was found out.
1:00:30
They were just people, and they weren't magic.
What's funny?
Because I joke with our community, because a lot of my community is small business owners, you know, probably, you know, from $100,000 a year to $100 million a year is probably like the the broad brushstroke of the people who are listening to this.
And the biggest thing a lot of them suffer from is, you know, shiny object syndrome is that as soon as something starts to get hard, something new looks easy.
1:00:54
And so they jump from the hard thing to the easy thing.
And really it's just uninformed optimism.
And then they get into it.
And then they have informed pessimism.
That's beautiful.
That's beautiful.
Yeah.
I mean, by the time it shines, you're light.
You're late.
1:01:11
It's too late.
I mean, if you think TikTok is new, you're late.
It's already not new.
It may have already turned down.
And we while we were talking right now.
I mean if if we have a second, let me know in terms of how because you've survived, survived a strong word, you've thrived platform agnostic, you know you have you.
1:01:33
I mean, you were in radio, you've done live stuff, but then I see YouTube clips of your show pumping out every day.
You guys crush it on YouTube and you do it kind of your way.
How have you thought about navigating platforms as they come and go and how you kind of like reinvest in what, where, where are we going to make a bet and say, OK, we're going to start expending resources here?
1:01:56
Or is it just if there's attention, we'll go there?
Like how?
How do you think through that?
We try to go there and then we expend resources based on results.
And so the YouTube shorts that we've been pumping out is only about a year and a half old and we're getting incredible results, but we're getting results on those.
1:02:18
As an example, we don't view those as life transformation items.
We view them as lead magnets to lead you to the long form show to financial peace university to a book which are life transformation items.
So they're free advertisements that cause people to get a get a little sample.
1:02:39
You get a little old lady standing Costco with a sample biscuit, right.
And so you get a little sample and get a little sample biscuit and then you may go buy the whole thing in the freezer and.
But so we I would not do.
1:02:55
In other words our philosophy on like changing lives is why we're here.
We would not only do YouTube shorts because they don't change lives, OK, We would not only do the new long form TikTok, 6 minutes, 7 minutes, we would not only do that because it won't change your life.
1:03:12
And so it's got to lead us somewhere And based on its response on doing that or just general activity around whatever the item is, whether it's a long form or short form, it is we're going to, we're going to pour gas on where we're seeing stuff work.
1:03:28
And, you know, so we don't, you know, for the last two years, we put little to no effort in growing Twitter.
Tucker Carlson might change that.
It may become a broadcast medium.
And so we'll probably be on Twitter next week.
1:03:46
Well, Elon's definitely.
Yeah, pushing Elon and he's going to, but I mean there if it's not going to just be a a cauldron for trolls then and it's actually going to put out some positive information in a way that is consumable and could grow and talk.
1:04:01
If if Elon proves that with Tucker, I mean we'll jump in there and try it right now and all that is we're not going to put a ton of money on it or resources or bandwidth on it.
But we're this week we were discussing, we're probably going to try it and talk what Tucker's doing and what Elon's doing with Tucker and with that whole idea of broadcasting there because Facebook Live is didn't work.
1:04:21
It's not working, not from our perspective anyway.
But we're still there.
We're not.
We didn't abandon it, but we're not putting effort on it.
We're YouTube shorts.
Yeah, we got a lot of people in this building working on that every day.
Yeah.
You guys crank those.
Yeah, they do.
They put out a bunch of them.
When you think about content for you, are you because you're recording 12 hours a week?
1:04:40
Correct.
Four days?
3 hours a day?
A 15 hour?
OK.
Well, not counting commercials.
Yeah, we do.
We do 3 hour talk radio show every day.
The entirety of your kind of content creation and then the teams take all of that and disseminate it through all the the, the channels.
I do a podcast that I just took over that's caller driven on leadership in small business called entree leadership, took that over in January.
1:05:04
That and the Ramsey show are the only two things I'm on.
But Ramsey Network has about 10 shows that are YouTube and or radio and or.
I mean we put them on everything but I mean the Ken Coleman Show is the only ones on talk radio. 75 stations plus podcast plus YouTube.
1:05:22
Deloney at John Doctor John Deloney has a huge show on podcast and YouTube only the Rachel Cruz with George Campbell.
The smart money happy hours.
But we sawdust every one of those.
Every one of those couldn't say sawdust.
We're going to take pieces and clips and do all kinds of things with them instead of we don't go create.
1:05:42
Well I say very seldom do we go create a YouTube short of anyone in the building or anything in the building.
It is clipped from something we were already doing, so it's repurposed content that was already developed for something else, You know, highly edited.
1:05:59
Yeah, I I mean, because I've, I've observed what you're doing and thinking like how can, how can we do even more of that kind of stuff?
Lots of payroll.
Yeah we're our media is all right.
Well, this has been phenomenal and I'm honestly just so grateful that they they had me and my team out here to this is considered Ramsey Studios.
1:06:22
Is that what this would?
Yeah, we call it that Ramsey Solution Studios, yeah.
And just also so grateful for that one tiny tidbit that.
Wow.
I'm honored.
I had a tiny bit to do with all that you do.
Man, you're amazing.
I'm proud.
Proud of you.
Well done.
Means a lot.
1:06:37
I appreciate it.
Well, thanks so much for having coming on the game.
Thank you, brother.
Hopefully the something in the future.
Absolutely you can count on it.

If in a Group, One person or one being one animal, whatever brings more to the table, you are now envious of that person and what it does is it elevates the rest of the group to go and achieve the same, which is good for the collective.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
0:19
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar.
Portfolio.
My hope is that you use the lessons to bring your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy what?
I want to talk to you about Today was a conversation that I had and we were having a conversation about motivation, and I figured I would share it with you because I think it was of a lot of value.
0:44
And so I was showing that recently I had delineated between the feelings of envy and jealousy and how important it has been for me to be able to first name those emotions so that I could then analyze how I was feeling about them and the actions that I would subsequently take as a result of them.
1:05
And so I want to at least first cover those, and then I'll tell you about our conversation.
And so envy is having the the desire for something that someone else has that you do not have.
So you are lacking and someone else has something that you want and do not have.
1:22
That is envy.
Jealousy is when you have a threat that somebody is going to take something that you have that they do not have.
All right?
And so for example, I'll give you an example of each So envy.
I may be envious of a friend of mine.
1:38
So I was actually talking to a good friend of mine who runs a big weight loss company.
And right now he's doing better than I am.
And now I am envious of his success.
I am.
I can feel it.
I'm envious.
I got off the phone and I was like, I'm envious of you, Right?
On the flip side, if someone comes to talk to Layla, right, it is the fact that they pose the threat of taking attention or her attention that I think should continuously belong to me that I would feel jealous over.
2:05
I haven't had, I haven't felt jealousy in a long time, but that is that is an example.
It could also be like with your kids, if you have some, you know, some other adults in their life starts taking their attention or has more influence over them, you are jealous of the influence that that person is now is threatening your influence over your child, right?
2:23
So 2 examples, they're nuanced, but I think it's important.
And when I was talking about this, I was talking about how I think envy gets a bad rap.
And I'm not going to go into the spiritual religious side of this or even the happiness side of this because I think envy absolutely does not make you happy.
2:39
But I do think that envy will make you successful.
All right.
And so this, this is where I want to kind of dive into this.
Envy is adaptive, right?
As human beings, This is actually from our old brain, right?
So this is animals have this too.
They are envious of one another.
2:55
And it's because if in a group, one person or one being, one animal, whatever brings more to the table, you are now envious of that person.
And what it does is it elevates the rest of the group to go and achieve the same, which is good for the collective, not happier for each of the individuals, but is a pro survival tool, right?
3:16
And so for me, understanding this and at least being able to name the emotion rather than saying I don't like this guy or I'm angry at this person or having this negative feeling that you cannot put words to.
Instead being able to say I am envious, has been very relieving for me.
Because now I can actually tell those people, hey, I'm envious of you.
3:36
And for some reason I think it just creates another level of candor because it's a certain level of vulnerability And saying you have something that I wish I had.
But then you'll notice that the conversation is not defensive on that person's part.
Most of the time they're like, well, let me help you.
And it's only when we guise our intentions or or try and or try and feign, you know pretend to be a different way than we are where people also can sense that you're being disingenuous like great job man right?
4:04
When realize deep down and they can tell from your your subtle tonality changes in the way you look that the that you're actually not happy for them, right?
And so I think if you can at least say it then it actually gives you power in terms of judging your motivations 'cause obviously you might think that envy is a bad motivation.
4:20
It is my belief that I would rather deal with people who do good things for bad reasons than bad reasons for good things.
Or I said the same thing twice, but they do the right thing for the wrong reasons rather than the wrong things for the right reason.
All right.
I'd rather someone who does the right outcome.
4:38
And he gave me an example that was really powerful.
He said a friend of his was a top Navy SEAL and you know, one of the best Navy SEALS.
He trains Navy SEALS.
Just a total badass, right?
And before that he was an EMT.
And he talked about his experience as being an EMT is that most people think, you know, EMT's have to be really caring that you want them to, you know, they have to save these people's lives every day.
5:01
And he said the Navy SEAL was saying, I was not compassionate at all.
I didn't really care that much about the person who was on the table in front of me.
But what I did care about was my stats.
I cared about the status of being the best.
I wanted to have the fastest to the hospital.
5:18
I want to have the highest survival rates, highest success rates of the people that were under my care because I cared about myself being the best.
And so the question is, if you were the person who was on the table having a heart attack, would you rather have the compassionate EMT or would you rather have the self interested EMT who is doing it for status?
5:41
Well, if it were me, I'd rather have the guy who wanted to pride himself on being the best in the world and didn't even care about me at all because I knew his result was going to be more pro me than the other person's.
And so I think that as as humans, as entrepreneurs, we judge ourselves a lot on our motivations and our and our intentions.
5:57
But I think that if we can take a step back and a name the emotion, so that's not this amorphous thing that we can understand.
But then take the next step and say is this, is this a pro adaptive emotion?
Is this something that's going to help me or is this an emotion that's going to drive me to do something that is negative?
6:16
And I think at least even even in naming that we can increase the time between emotion and action.
And the further that time gap is in general, the better the quality of the decisions we make.
Because the more rational we are, we're never completely rational because we're we're emotion driven beings and we have limbic systems that override things.
6:35
But the more we can decrease the triggers of the emotional triggers that that cause us to make bad decisions, ultimately the better decisions we make.
And so I I I say all this to say big picture. 1st.
Naming the emotions is important.
Second, it creates space so we can make better decisions.
6:54
Third, we can analyze those decisions and say, is this something that is going to help me in my life or is this something that's going to hurt me?
And then as a result of this, we don't have to judge ourselves as strongly on why we are doing things and rather what is being done.
7:14
Because candidly, I am a very envious individual and maybe this is me just rationalizing my own negative, you know, emotions.
Who knows?
But at least for me, saying it that way and framing the thought process in that way has helped me feel better about myself and just not.
7:32
Or really just less bad if that's probably a better way of saying it, and not constantly berating myself for having desires that I think are wrong.
And so Dan Sullivan said this, and I'll end with this, is that when people want something, if you want to make more money, if you want to have a bigger house, you want to have a bigger car, you want to build a podcast studio, whatever, right?
7:55
He said wanting is reason enough because so many times we asked, but why do we want that?
We're probably not going to change the desire.
And so letting us letting ourselves desire things and giving ourselves permission to desire things and myself specifically, has been incredibly freeing.
8:13
And what it's done is given me a tremendous amount of my attention back that used to be allocated to analyzing why I'm feeling this way or why this is right or why this is wrong.
And instead accepting the fact that I want something and that wanting it is OK as long as it is not something that is hurting other people and that is not something that is hurting me.
8:36
And so anyways, I hope that makes sense.
I hope that provide you some value or hoefully maybe some clarity around putting words to your own emotions, the decisions that results from them and whether they are positive or negative and eliminating the adjustment from that equation provided it's something that helps.








0:00
This is my most brutally honest advice to my younger self.
You can beat 99% of people simply by continuing to work without needing your immediate reward.
This bit is advice to my younger self on how I work harder.
You're going to lose sleep, You'll doubt whether it'll work, you'll stress to make ends meet, You won't finish your To Do List.
You'll wonder if you made the right call and have no way to know for years.
0:17
But that's what hard feels like.
The other great reason for working harder is that the harder you work, the more you realize what you used to think was hard work isn't even close to what you're capable of.
Because if you want to know what the most dangerous money making combo in the world, it's work ethic and time.
Because once you realize just how much more work it takes to get from good to great, you realize you can only be great at a few things and you're forced to ignore the rest.
0:36
The amount of work it takes to be good negates the ability to be great at more than one or two things.
Because there's just only so much time.
It just takes work, shit loads and shit loads of work.
And every time I dress it up or cut a corner, I get brutally reminded by life that the work just needs doing.
So yes, this is your friendly reminder that it's OK to work on weekends.
0:53
I used to think that if I worked on something for a day, it was a lot.
I was like, dude, I worked on this for a whole day, was like a huge amount of work.
And I would say that to someone to show them how hard I worked.
And then it became like I worked on this for a week and then a month.
And I would say now that I can work on the same project for a year or two years.
1:09
And that's what like to the books, has been huge projects for me.
My quickest shorthand on the shift in work is that I started counting in hundreds, hundreds of minutes, hundreds of hours, hundreds of days towards a specific goal.
If you count in hundreds, it just automatically forces you to do a significantly larger amount of effort, just sheer volume of work.
1:25
I think one of my favorite parables about work is that there was a in art class.
They split the class into two groups and one group They said make the absolute best pot and turn in one pot and the other group they said make as many pots as you possibly can.
At the end of the semester, the team that had to make as many pots as only possible not only made more pots, but also ended up making better pots than the one that spent all of their time trying to make one.
1:47
I think a lot of people need that permission to have a lot of shitty first drafts in order to start working harder on anything.
But that's not how I operate because for me, I would rather spend a lot more time in my first draft so I don't have to make so many more edits.
If you do it the right way, you realize how many hours you're going to have to put into something.
2:04
And usually most people that I feel like haven't done that level of effort confront the work and then they get scared about it.
I have to find a different way.
This can't actually be how people do this.
That is how you do it.
The work just needs doing and no one's going to do it for you.
I started with a normal hourly job and I think a lot of people do a lot of early job thoughts or lessons are that when you show up to work, you are working because you're getting paid to be there.
2:26
When you start working for yourself, you're not getting paid to be there.
You're only getting paid on what you do.
I've gone on vacations with other entrepreneurs.
They're like, man, we had a crazy work day.
I was like, I was with you, call me like that was not at work.
These are off days for me.
Like these aren't like real work day because work occurred.
It to me is not a work day unless I have a clear output for what I have done or move forward work didn't have.
2:46
The longer you can delay when you need to be rewarded for the work that you do, the greater the outcome is.
It's kind of like a plane taking off.
The longer the runway, the bigger the plane.
And so a lot of people can barely even get a bottle rocket off the ground because they have such a short attention span and such a need for immediate reward.
3:03
If you feel like you're behind where you should be by now, if you feel like you're losing, if you're not sure it's going to work, there's nothing wrong with you.
That is entrepreneurship.
You're on the right path.
You're doing the right things.
You're seeing the milestones along the way.
But the milestones aren't parades.
3:18
It's uncertainty.
It's a sleepless nice.
It's not knowing if you can make payroll.
It's not even being sure that the five years you put into this idea is actually going to turn into something that you'll get credit for eventually.
The biggest shift that I had internally during those harder times was that I am the output of my work.
3:34
All of this effort is to create who I want to become.
I get to use that as my reward every day, rather than the approval of strangers.
Sitting in uncertainty is the feeling of entrepreneurship.
You're not doing it wrong.
Like that's what it feels like.
It's kind of this weird dichotomy of feeling like you never have enough time, but then you also have all the time in the world.
3:51
The biggest reason that a lot of entrepreneurs don't succeed is because they're in a rush.
The rush what creates poor decisions?
And so they consistently hop from thing to thing to thing because they think this thing will get them there faster by hopping consistently to guarantee that they'll never get there.
And I think we have a culture that rewards speed because everybody wants things fast and easy In $100 offers the book.
4:10
I talk about value.
You have a dream outcome and then you have basically everything that discounts or multiplies it.
A discount would be risk associated with it.
I want this thing, but I want it to be guaranteed.
I want it to be easy and I want it to be fast.
And entrepreneurship is literally the opposite of that.
The dream outcomes there, but it is not guaranteed incredibly hard and takes forever.
4:28
The problem is that it's so compelling to sell people on that and there's so many more ad dollars that go into its fast.
It's easy and it's guaranteed that.
It's really tough to shift the landscape of the language around entrepreneurship because there's just so much money to be made by making that promise.
4:44
The concept of the the billionaire who like starts back over and they're like could he do it again?
It's like well, of course the problem with the show is, is that they give you 90 days.
The premise is wrong and I get why they do it is because they have to cater to people who think that way which is most people can he build $1,000,000 business in 90 days.
4:59
But it's like, but he could build a much bigger business in two years, and that billionaire would probably never build the business that he builds on the show.
So it actually reinforces the wrong perspective from a brand foundation perspective.
It's how can I build a reputation over a long period of time, not necessarily with the intent to transact, but simply to build a reputation associating myself with these positive things.
5:19
That takes time for one, lots of people to find out about you and two, for a lot of people to develop a strong affinity and make multiple associations with you so that it's stronger.
The classic example of that is somebody who makes content for five years and then it launches a product and the products immediately A billion dollar thing.
Well, it's not that they made a billion dollars in a year, it's that they spent five years letting the roots go down for the bamboo tree and then eventually it shoots up.
5:39
Right.
On the other hand, you've got kind of product based foundation software.
You might take a long time to code and like write a huge code base that could go after some big problem.
It could be regulatory stuff, because if you want to get into like banking, for example, there's lots of barriers to entry.
Even if you're starting an e-commerce brand, you would be talking to different manufacturers, you'd be going through prototypes, you'd be trying things out, you'd be testing it in beta groups to get feedback, and then you'd probably have some sort of capital investment to capitalize your first inventory run.
6:02
All of those things are the foundations.
The reason I like service business for people who are starting out is that you don't have to do either of those things.
But if you had one or two or both of those things, then you can create something bigger, faster on a longer time horizon.
It's actually the classic example of how long do you sharpen the axe.
6:19
If someone is doing a business that they have No leverage because they built no foundation, they basically just take whatever axe is given to them and they just start hacking away at the tree.
Except in the game of business, the tree might be a mile wide and the axe that you have could be a lightsaber if you spend enough time sharpening it.
6:34
Even if it took one guy a year of going from dull axe to lightsaber, he would still catch up at year two and then from year 2 to 10 doesn't even get close to the other guy.
But the problem is that everybody listens to everyone else who's judging them on their time horizon.
Like you quit your job on a employee time horizon.
6:51
Your family's like, have you started making money yet?
And you're like it's been 2 weeks.
They're like, well yeah, this is when you would normally get a paycheck.
You're measuring stick has to change when you get into a different game.
Sometimes the fastest way to get to $1,000,000 a year isn't the fastest way to get to $10 million a year.
And to the same degree.
The fastest way to get to 10 isn't the fastest way to go to 100.
7:06
If we're measuring effort in terms of stress and hours per day, running a local restaurant takes the same amount of work as building an application.
That could be a billion dollar application, and it might take you a few years for a restaurant to build a reputation in the area, get locals coming in, hire and train good talent.
7:22
Like it takes a lot of work to do all that stuff.
And to the same degree, hiring really good development engineers and creating a prototype.
Like the actual work and stress is almost identical.
It's almost like you have three slot machines that you're going up to and they all cost the same cost, but one of them has a billion dollar payout, one has a $10 million payout and one is $100,000 payout and everyone just lines up for the 100, $1000 payout.
7:42
The third variable, if we're going to like make this in terms of dimensions, the next one is how long are we measuring the payout for the slot machine.
We assume that slot machines payout immediately, but if one slot machine pays out now, one pays out in a year and one pays out in five years, what if the odds were the same but you only got one coin?
7:58
Which one would you do?
People say they would do the billion dollar one, but based on their behaviour they're just standing at the at the the fast token machine, not being able to break it.
The fact that you don't know if it's going to work is exactly what makes it worth doing.
It's why entrepreneurship isn't for the faint of heart.
8:13
You have to embrace uncertainty.
What makes entrepreneurship isn't the work itself, it's actually just not knowing if the work will work.
We're afraid of wasted effort, but if it makes you better, then no effort is wasted and as long as you can make that connection you're not going to burnout, you're just doing what it takes.
The biggest meta lesson of my entire life was when I lost everything the first time I had sold all the gyms, and then that was my nest egg for my five years of work.
8:35
Even though it was not as much as I had hoped, but it was still something.
And then I put that all into the next thing and then lost it all.
But after losing it all, I was able to immediately go out and make $100,000 the next month with nothing maxing out a credit card to do it.
That moment was I was like, oh, like I thought that the gyms were the thing that I had built, but it was my skills is the thing that I had built.
8:54
I consider skills income insurance.
You just know that you will be able to make money.
People want to invest in the stock market because they want to have a retirement.
If you invest in skills, that is your retirement because you will always be able to trade them for money and whether the money is in bitcoins, seashells or dollars, you'll always be able to trade something of value.
9:10
I'm sure this is going to piss off the exact same people that we think it's going to piss off.
You don't need a weekend like the concept is barely 100 years old.
It's a modern invention, right?
What you really need is work that you don't need a weekend from.
And instead of thinking about work life balances like a seven day work week, think about work life balances like on like a seven-year time horizon.
9:26
And so like there are seasons of work and there are seasons of less work.
My goal would always be that I just never have something I want to retire from.
In some ways you could say I retired from owning gyms for a while, but I haven't retired from work.
I don't think anyone who wants to live a long life should retire from work.
All the people that I know, we're really old.
They pretty much die when they stop working.
9:42
I've seen the people who stay alive the longest have reasons to stay alive and work is a good one.
The problem is that everyone's idea, like the masses who are listening to this, their idea of what work is, it's not what I'm talking about.
Theirs is like the soul sucking work at a job you hate for a boss that doesn't appreciate you, for a company that doesn't do good in the world.
I completely understand why you would not be motivated to do that and you would want to get away from that as soon as possible.
10:02
You'd be amazing how much faster you can get to your goals when you don't go backwards 104 days a year.
Contrary to what the mediocre masses will tell you, weekends can also be for work.
We had a contractor once who said I quit my job so that I wouldn't have to work weekends, and he was upset that he had worked a weekend.
10:17
You do not have an accurate estimation of reality if you think that starting a business is going to mean that the first business you ever start, you're not going to work weekends right now.
If I started a business, I could take weekends if I wanted to, but I think that's because there's a level of skill you have to get to to get there.
A buddy of mine was talking to me about how he had an employee who was asking for, like, 6 weeks of paid vacation.
10:35
They have, like, not a lot of experiences.
Like I need this time.
He's like, well, I tell you what he's like, What if I give you 110 days a year off paid?
Would that work?
They were like, yeah, he's like like cool.
That's weekends and federal holidays.
If you just don't go backwards on weekends, you can move ahead so much faster.
10:51
If you go out drinking or you do your cheat days on the weekend, then you can undo all of the work that you're doing in the rest of the days of the year and be neutral or even negative at the end of the year.
Depending on how bad off track you go during those 104 days.
From a business perspective, you might get inquiries over the weekend.
11:08
If you don't work your leads over the weekend, you started a deficit.
You might lose those sales if you generate income during the week and then you don't on weekends.
It's 100 and four days a year that you're not generating income out of 365.
You're also going into a deficit that you have to then make up for in the first two days.
So let's say that the two day negative has to get offset by two days of positive.
11:25
So then you're really only working three days.
Now you compare that to somebody who's either not losing steam on the weekends or actually getting ahead on the weekends.
That person isn't moving ahead like twice as fast.
The moving ahead like 7 times as fast.
And so I think that's the piece that a lot of people are missing is the look at somebody who's further ahead, be like, well, this person works like this.
11:41
It's like, well, if you work the same amount as them, they're actually going to keep getting further ahead.
So you have to work as much, switches them to match, probably a little bit more because they're more skilled at working than you are, and then even more to get ahead.
Success is the only revenge.
As you expand, they shrink into irrelevance as you get louder.
11:56
No one can hear them.
You don't beat them.
You cast a shadow so big no one can see them to begin with.
Because at the end of the day, there's no greater waste of time than justifying your actions to people who have a life that you don't want.
And there's no amount of pain you can inflict on a hater that will be more painful than their own life.
12:14
Last part was from Leila.
Like, there is no retaliation, There's no retribution, There's no actual revenge.
So I have beaten a lot of business people in the field, people that I saw as competitors, like, where it was very clear we're going head to head for a market.
What's really weird is that when you actually win, when someone actually goes out of business, it's like, not cool.
12:31
You don't, like, spit on their corpse.
You're just like, oh, there is a tipping point at some point where you start to gain an advantage, you start to separate from them.
But then, like, they start flailing and acting erratic and trying to get ahead.
And then further, you know, they go down that vicious cycle because you are their hater in their mind or their competition.
The biggest mistake of my career I made because of a competitor.
12:49
That mistake cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million actual money.
Not like, like, oh, this is an opportunity that I did like, I actually lost like $25 million on this.
And I just swore to myself that I would never let somebody else dictate my behavior.
Winners focus on winning.
Losers focus on winners.
So the same thing goes with competitors.
13:06
Winners focus on customers.
Competitors focus on winners.
They're always trying to copy you, but because they're trying to copy you, they're not looking at their customers, they're looking at you.
And so they're completely distracted.
They're not looking at the data source that matters most.
First off, if anyone ever copies you, you've already won because they need you.
You don't need them.
You should be afraid when people stop copying you, because it means that you've got nothing.
13:24
And so I see people copying what I'm doing as a positive sign that I'm on the right path rather than a distraction that merits all of my attention getting redirected to trying to destroy someone.
If you walk like downtown in any city, well, that building is a $400 million building and that building is $400 million.
13:40
That's how much money a billionaire has.
Everything else that's there is still up for grabs.
There's so much out there, it's super hard to comprehend.
When we had 5000 plus gyms in gym launch, I think we had 45 gyms in Atlanta.
They would be like, well, there's another gym down the street.
I'm like, there's also 1500 gyms in Atlanta.
So the 45 that are all gym launch gyms are just going to do better than the other 1455.
14:01
The pie is so much bigger than people think it is.
If you feel like you are the output of your life, get the end of your life.
Who you are is the thing that is the thing that you became, then competition is good for you.
Like, if you look back at that person, would you want that person to have no challenges?
Like if you were at the end of your life and you looked back, would you be like, I'm glad I overcame no adversity.
14:18
I'm glad no one ever put me to the test.
I'm glad I never got to see what I was truly capable of.
I'm glad I never had to risk it all when the chips were down.
You would never say that.
We just don't like going through it in the short term, but we do want the outcome of it.
If you just accept that that's the price tag for the person you want to be, then you just pay it willingly by two simple lenses for friendship.
14:34
Number one, do they generally root for you when you win #2?
Do they make you better?
Finding people who do even one of those two things is rare.
Both is even rarer, which is why they get the highest title of friend.
One of the highest RY traits in life that you can make is all the fake friends that you have for one real friend that has your back, even when it all seems lost.
14:53
Bonus points if it's your spouse.
The rare people in your life who root for you to hit your goals are more valuable than the goals themselves.
Consider yourself lucky if you find even one human who believes in you more than you do, and never let them go.
When you start out, people are happy for you that you're doing something but I this is going to be really fucked up.
15:08
But I actually think that people are happy that you quit your job because it counts you out of the race, because the likelihood that you win is so low, and so they're happy because you're actually taking a step back.
You literally take a step back in income, Take a step back in status because you're not doing well.
Like I went from a white collar job to being a personal trainer.
15:24
Like it was a big step back.
So any of my peer group were like, Oh yeah, so good that you're doing that.
If I had immediately jumped and started a tech startup and raised $100 million, they probably immediately wouldn't have been happy for me.
I think the reason that you get that underdog rooting in the beginning is because you actually take a step down in status and so their relative standing actually increases.
15:40
So they encourage you, but then as you come up, your success reminds some of the dreams that they didn't pursue to begin with.
It also reminds them that you started with probably the same resources, and that's why it's so hard to go home for a lot of people.
Because everyone who you grew up with in middle school and high school, you become a glaring example of what they could have done but didn't.
15:58
It's what you make them think about themselves.
Astonishingly, more people know what they should do than claim to know what they should do.
There's usually a voice.
On some level, acting is a hypothetical punishment they haven't actually experienced yet for taking an action that they haven't done yet.
Because we fear this hypothetical punishment, we don't take the real action.
A lot of people just stay stuck there.
16:14
There was one specific voice that I was, like, really afraid of for selling gym launch because I thought 46 million and wasn't enough that that person would be impressed.
And then what I thought about was like, this person is going to prevent me from doing.
Like this person's opinion.
I was like, what do I care?
Do his own life?
What if he does sell his company for more money than me?
Does that mean I suck?
No, it just means that like, I decided to do something, he decided to do something.
16:31
I'm only ascribing value to this person's opinion just because I know who they are.
There's 100,000 times more people who I don't know who are beating me than the ones that I do.
So why would I listen to this one person?
Unless someone is ahead of you, take their hate as envy and then disregard.
Envy is when you want something that someone else has.
16:47
Jealousy is when you fear losing something that you have.
So if you've got your girl and some guy comes up, you get jealous.
If someone has a girl that you wish you had, you experience envy.
So envy is about something you don't have, jealousy about fear of losing something you do.
If people are further behind you, then they're envious of you.
If someones ahead of you, then they're afraid that you're going to take what they have.
17:04
Mind you, In either of those scenarios, it doesn't matter.
I see hate as feedback, nothing more, nothing less.
And I think feedback is worth taking into consideration and what level of validity there is.
So if someone says, hey, you copied my entire business and you've never met them, but you know that that's not true, I had this guy come up to me, saw me on the street randomly.
17:23
He was like, hey man, I need to apologize to you for what?
I've, like, really, really hated you for a long time.
Why?
He's like, because you stole the closer framework from me.
And I was like, dude, I know the fuck you are.
He was like, let's be honest, like, what's the likelihood that we both came up with the same acronym?
And I was like, hi, you take an acronym that's for a closer, and then you fit the words.
17:41
I actually went back.
I found my first document that had closer on it, and I screenshotted the date and it was before he had started selling.
He squashed it and I was like, you're copying me, motherfucker.
I said it joking because I give a shit that hates feedback.
If I'm getting data from the environment, it's data.
It's not good or bad.
It just is.
If everybody ahead of you is afraid that you're going to beat them, that's probably decent data.
17:58
If everybody behind you is envious of where you're at, that's probably decent data to know.
If people are all trying to sue you at the same time for something, then maybe there's something there that you shouldn't have done that you did.
It's the second layer of judgment is the one that everyone gets in trouble with.
This thing happened.
Now I'm going to ascribe meaning to it.
18:14
What does the hate mean?
Doesn't mean anything.
It's just feedback.
And then you take the data and do whatever you want with it.
Sadness comes from a lack of options, which is why it feels like hopelessness.
Anxiety comes from many options but a lack of priorities, which is why it feels like paralysis.
Looking everywhere but moving nowhere.
Solve sadness with knowledge and anxiety with a decision.
18:32
Understanding this changed my life.
Let's say somebody gets really depressed to get laid off.
Why are they sad?
Because they have a perceived lack of options.
If I have five job offers on my table, am I sad that I got laid off because my job offers are better than when I just left?
No.
Now, if I had a hundred options on the table, I might have anxiety because I have too many options that I don't know which one to do.
18:48
It's a perceived lack of options.
With sadness, you don't know what to do because you don't know anything to do.
With anxiety, you don't know which to do.
Disappointment is when an expectation was unmet, you either change your expectations or change reality.
The stoic frame for that is that you imagine all the things that could have gone worse.
I mean, there's a lot of frames, but that's one of them.
The other one is that you imagine that that thing happens 1000 times in a row.
19:05
What would you feel in a thousandth time?
Probably nothing.
Why?
Because you'd already adjusted expectations.
And if you already adjusted expectations, then you can adjust them.
Buddhist monks fundamentally basically do that.
They just change nothing externally and only change internally, which is fine.
But to a certain degree like I want to be benefits humanity and I don't know how beneficial that is.
And to be fair, me saying that I want to do that also creates an expectation of myself which I could be let down for.
19:23
So like I do create a possibility that I am let down by saying I want to help people and if I don't help them then I would be disappointed.
You can shoot big as long as you don't make missing mean that you suck.
I think that being has been the best goal for me to pursue because it's the one that 100% under my control.
If I have something that is disappointing that occurs, what type of version do I want to be in this instance?
19:41
And then what would that man do?
And as closely as I can map my actual behavior to that person's, the more joy I'll experience because I'm present in doing the things that I think I should be doing, and I can still give myself kudos for how well I handled a shitty situation and then end up deriving joy from something that otherwise might have been bad.
I remember seeing this quote once.
19:57
I was like, if you follow your own advice, you'd already be way further than you currently are.
And I thought about that and I was like, yeah, I don't think I need to follow anyone else's advice.
I think I should be doing the things I already know I should be doing.
Then you just have like kind of the emotional component of feeling like you want to maybe release something or whatever, and me being able to talk to my future version.
20:13
Myself in a dialogue format allows me to get grace from a future version of self and also get approval from a future version of self.
So somebody that I esteem higher than myself is future me, who's hopefully better, and his judgement on my current situation and his advice.
It tends to be really good advice.
20:28
The best advice I've gotten has been from future me.
No one's afraid of failing, they're afraid of what other people will think of them when they fail.
But if they're afraid of that, imagine what those other people think of you when you're not even trying.
Well, the reality is they're not at all.
If they don't have what you want, don't listen to what they say.
20:45
Having what you want is a really easy evidence point.
That's high likelihood, basically.
It decreases the risk of whatever advice they're providing.
That's not a perfect frame because there are amazing Olympic coaches that never won the goal.
The fastest way to move forward in life is listen to people who can give you advice that can get you there faster, so not having to suffer and experience and waste all that time and back.
21:04
Step to learn the lesson to move forward and so the faster you can avoid those lessons and just keep moving forward, the faster you move.
But the problem is we don't know who to trust.
And so I have made 7 levels of how I weigh advice that have served me well, but at the lowest level, #7.
Comments on social media, which is basically comments from strangers who don't know me and don't have what I want.
21:23
Number six people giving their two cents who do know me but don't have what I want #5.
Someone who knows me and knows someone who went to where I'm trying to go #4.
Someone who's been there #3.
Someone who took someone else there, #2 one who took someone just like me to exactly where I want to go, and #1 someone who has been there took someone else there just like me multiple times.
21:45
Do I trust somebody who's taking someone else there because I am the someone else more than someone who's only taking themselves there?
Because if someone's taking someone else there, then I could slot in and there's a likely they could do it again.
If they've only taken themselves there and not taken anyone else there, then they might not be a very good teacher, which happens all the time.
Michael Jordan has an insane record.
22:01
Playing basketball has a very poor record.
Owning a basketball team.
I'm big on give, give, give until they ask, right?
And especially if you're starting out, the best thing to do is give away stuff for free for multiple reasons.
One, because you probably suck because you haven't done it yet and it's a gift.
If someone allows you to work for them because you have a chance at providing value.
22:20
And from there you can leverage that into testimonials, referrals, and potentially even a paying customer.
They might if you continue to provide this value for free eventually say, hey, I've got too many people providing for free.
I have too much demand on my time at price of free and I can go to 20% of the price that I want to go to.
And if everyone says yes and you of demand, then you go to 40% of the price and then sixty and then a hundred and then 500%, right?
22:39
And you keep going.
But what happens is a lot of people will shortchange that.
And so I get DMS every day of people saying, hey, I want to give you value in exchange for and it's just stop, don't tell me what value you want to give me and what you want to trade that value for.
And usually it's them actually massively undervaluing my time, as though them making it free to me is somehow more valuable than me paying for something.
23:01
Like I have tons of money, I don't have tons of time, and so it's my much scarcer resource.
This kid was like, yeah, I have a lot of advice that I think I can give you on social media.
And I click over his profile, he's got 100 followers and he said I'll do it in exchange for a testimonial.
And it was just like, it was so blind reality.
First off, you have no evidence that you're good.
23:18
Second off, it's delusion.
And so the way to do it right is to go above and beyond, do a ton of work, and then just give it to the person not in exchange for or an expectation of, but just give it to that person and then guess it'll happen nothing.
Because most times if someone's way ahead of you, they might not want it or might not need it.
But you make your best approximate guess of what they might need.
23:35
Do your best shot at it.
There's probably three things that can happen.
One, most likely nothing happens.
They don't respond to you.
They don't care.
The second option is that they see how hard you worked on something.
And even though they don't need that thing, everyone one level up needs people who work hard on things.
And then so you still prove how hard you work by how good the thing that you give is.
23:52
And so they might have an opportunity for you, not even in the main thing, but on something else.
And then the third and probably the least likely but probably the one you want the most, is that they say, wow, that's amazing.
I would love for you to do that.
Now to be fair, most of the people on my team came from doing that.
You roll the dice and people roll the dice one time with their time and say, I did this work for this one guy and he didn't immediately hire me on retainer, but did you do it for 100 people?
24:15
If you give tremendous value to 100 people, you'll be able to make more income than most jobs in America.
Simple by providing A tremendous amount of value to 100 business owners.
One of them or five of them will respond back and say, yes, I would like more work from you or I can offer you a job.
I was afraid to charge people money, but I did want them to, like, be invested.
24:33
And so I started a nonprofit called the Free Training Project, where I said if they donated $502,000 to the charity of their choice, I would train them for 12 weeks.
That's how I got my first customers.
But then after the 12 weeks, some of them were like, I still want to keep training with you.
And I was like, hey, I'm the charity now.
I am poor.
Please help me.
That's literally at literally the other 12 weeks, I was like, I think I want to do this full time because I did it while I still have my job.
24:51
And then I was like, I think I want to do this full time.
I hope you guys are OK with this.
I like if you could pay me instead.
I just kind of like it.
Everyone did.








0:00
This is my most brutally honest advice to my younger self.
You can beat 99% of people simply by continuing to work without needing your immediate reward.
This bit is advice to my younger self on how I work harder.
You're going to lose sleep, You'll doubt whether it'll work, you'll stress to make ends meet, You won't finish your To Do List.
You'll wonder if you made the right call and have no way to know for years.
0:17
But that's what hard feels like.
The other great reason for working harder is that the harder you work, the more you realize what you used to think was hard work isn't even close to what you're capable of.
Because if you want to know what the most dangerous money making combo in the world, it's work ethic and time.
Because once you realize just how much more work it takes to get from good to great, you realize you can only be great at a few things and you're forced to ignore the rest.
0:36
The amount of work it takes to be good negates the ability to be great at more than one or two things.
Because there's just only so much time.
It just takes work, shit loads and shit loads of work.
And every time I dress it up or cut a corner, I get brutally reminded by life that the work just needs doing.
So yes, this is your friendly reminder that it's OK to work on weekends.
0:53
I used to think that if I worked on something for a day, it was a lot.
I was like, dude, I worked on this for a whole day, was like a huge amount of work.
And I would say that to someone to show them how hard I worked.
And then it became like I worked on this for a week and then a month.
And I would say now that I can work on the same project for a year or two years.
1:09
And that's what like to the books, has been huge projects for me.
My quickest shorthand on the shift in work is that I started counting in hundreds, hundreds of minutes, hundreds of hours, hundreds of days towards a specific goal.
If you count in hundreds, it just automatically forces you to do a significantly larger amount of effort, just sheer volume of work.
1:25
I think one of my favorite parables about work is that there was a in art class.
They split the class into two groups and one group They said make the absolute best pot and turn in one pot and the other group they said make as many pots as you possibly can.
At the end of the semester, the team that had to make as many pots as only possible not only made more pots, but also ended up making better pots than the one that spent all of their time trying to make one.
1:47
I think a lot of people need that permission to have a lot of shitty first drafts in order to start working harder on anything.
But that's not how I operate because for me, I would rather spend a lot more time in my first draft so I don't have to make so many more edits.
If you do it the right way, you realize how many hours you're going to have to put into something.
2:04
And usually most people that I feel like haven't done that level of effort confront the work and then they get scared about it.
I have to find a different way.
This can't actually be how people do this.
That is how you do it.
The work just needs doing and no one's going to do it for you.
I started with a normal hourly job and I think a lot of people do a lot of early job thoughts or lessons are that when you show up to work, you are working because you're getting paid to be there.
2:26
When you start working for yourself, you're not getting paid to be there.
You're only getting paid on what you do.
I've gone on vacations with other entrepreneurs.
They're like, man, we had a crazy work day.
I was like, I was with you, call me like that was not at work.
These are off days for me.
Like these aren't like real work day because work occurred.
It to me is not a work day unless I have a clear output for what I have done or move forward work didn't have.
2:46
The longer you can delay when you need to be rewarded for the work that you do, the greater the outcome is.
It's kind of like a plane taking off.
The longer the runway, the bigger the plane.
And so a lot of people can barely even get a bottle rocket off the ground because they have such a short attention span and such a need for immediate reward.
3:03
If you feel like you're behind where you should be by now, if you feel like you're losing, if you're not sure it's going to work, there's nothing wrong with you.
That is entrepreneurship.
You're on the right path.
You're doing the right things.
You're seeing the milestones along the way.
But the milestones aren't parades.
3:18
It's uncertainty.
It's a sleepless nice.
It's not knowing if you can make payroll.
It's not even being sure that the five years you put into this idea is actually going to turn into something that you'll get credit for eventually.
The biggest shift that I had internally during those harder times was that I am the output of my work.
3:34
All of this effort is to create who I want to become.
I get to use that as my reward every day, rather than the approval of strangers.
Sitting in uncertainty is the feeling of entrepreneurship.
You're not doing it wrong.
Like that's what it feels like.
It's kind of this weird dichotomy of feeling like you never have enough time, but then you also have all the time in the world.
3:51
The biggest reason that a lot of entrepreneurs don't succeed is because they're in a rush.
The rush what creates poor decisions?
And so they consistently hop from thing to thing to thing because they think this thing will get them there faster by hopping consistently to guarantee that they'll never get there.
And I think we have a culture that rewards speed because everybody wants things fast and easy In $100 offers the book.
4:10
I talk about value.
You have a dream outcome and then you have basically everything that discounts or multiplies it.
A discount would be risk associated with it.
I want this thing, but I want it to be guaranteed.
I want it to be easy and I want it to be fast.
And entrepreneurship is literally the opposite of that.
The dream outcomes there, but it is not guaranteed incredibly hard and takes forever.
4:28
The problem is that it's so compelling to sell people on that and there's so many more ad dollars that go into its fast.
It's easy and it's guaranteed that.
It's really tough to shift the landscape of the language around entrepreneurship because there's just so much money to be made by making that promise.
4:44
The concept of the the billionaire who like starts back over and they're like could he do it again?
It's like well, of course the problem with the show is, is that they give you 90 days.
The premise is wrong and I get why they do it is because they have to cater to people who think that way which is most people can he build $1,000,000 business in 90 days.
4:59
But it's like, but he could build a much bigger business in two years, and that billionaire would probably never build the business that he builds on the show.
So it actually reinforces the wrong perspective from a brand foundation perspective.
It's how can I build a reputation over a long period of time, not necessarily with the intent to transact, but simply to build a reputation associating myself with these positive things.
5:19
That takes time for one, lots of people to find out about you and two, for a lot of people to develop a strong affinity and make multiple associations with you so that it's stronger.
The classic example of that is somebody who makes content for five years and then it launches a product and the products immediately A billion dollar thing.
Well, it's not that they made a billion dollars in a year, it's that they spent five years letting the roots go down for the bamboo tree and then eventually it shoots up.
5:39
Right.
On the other hand, you've got kind of product based foundation software.
You might take a long time to code and like write a huge code base that could go after some big problem.
It could be regulatory stuff, because if you want to get into like banking, for example, there's lots of barriers to entry.
Even if you're starting an e-commerce brand, you would be talking to different manufacturers, you'd be going through prototypes, you'd be trying things out, you'd be testing it in beta groups to get feedback, and then you'd probably have some sort of capital investment to capitalize your first inventory run.
6:02
All of those things are the foundations.
The reason I like service business for people who are starting out is that you don't have to do either of those things.
But if you had one or two or both of those things, then you can create something bigger, faster on a longer time horizon.
It's actually the classic example of how long do you sharpen the axe.
6:19
If someone is doing a business that they have No leverage because they built no foundation, they basically just take whatever axe is given to them and they just start hacking away at the tree.
Except in the game of business, the tree might be a mile wide and the axe that you have could be a lightsaber if you spend enough time sharpening it.
6:34
Even if it took one guy a year of going from dull axe to lightsaber, he would still catch up at year two and then from year 2 to 10 doesn't even get close to the other guy.
But the problem is that everybody listens to everyone else who's judging them on their time horizon.
Like you quit your job on a employee time horizon.
6:51
Your family's like, have you started making money yet?
And you're like it's been 2 weeks.
They're like, well yeah, this is when you would normally get a paycheck.
You're measuring stick has to change when you get into a different game.
Sometimes the fastest way to get to $1,000,000 a year isn't the fastest way to get to $10 million a year.
And to the same degree.
The fastest way to get to 10 isn't the fastest way to go to 100.
7:06
If we're measuring effort in terms of stress and hours per day, running a local restaurant takes the same amount of work as building an application.
That could be a billion dollar application, and it might take you a few years for a restaurant to build a reputation in the area, get locals coming in, hire and train good talent.
7:22
Like it takes a lot of work to do all that stuff.
And to the same degree, hiring really good development engineers and creating a prototype.
Like the actual work and stress is almost identical.
It's almost like you have three slot machines that you're going up to and they all cost the same cost, but one of them has a billion dollar payout, one has a $10 million payout and one is $100,000 payout and everyone just lines up for the 100, $1000 payout.
7:42
The third variable, if we're going to like make this in terms of dimensions, the next one is how long are we measuring the payout for the slot machine.
We assume that slot machines payout immediately, but if one slot machine pays out now, one pays out in a year and one pays out in five years, what if the odds were the same but you only got one coin?
7:58
Which one would you do?
People say they would do the billion dollar one, but based on their behaviour they're just standing at the at the the fast token machine, not being able to break it.
The fact that you don't know if it's going to work is exactly what makes it worth doing.
It's why entrepreneurship isn't for the faint of heart.
8:13
You have to embrace uncertainty.
What makes entrepreneurship isn't the work itself, it's actually just not knowing if the work will work.
We're afraid of wasted effort, but if it makes you better, then no effort is wasted and as long as you can make that connection you're not going to burnout, you're just doing what it takes.
The biggest meta lesson of my entire life was when I lost everything the first time I had sold all the gyms, and then that was my nest egg for my five years of work.
8:35
Even though it was not as much as I had hoped, but it was still something.
And then I put that all into the next thing and then lost it all.
But after losing it all, I was able to immediately go out and make $100,000 the next month with nothing maxing out a credit card to do it.
That moment was I was like, oh, like I thought that the gyms were the thing that I had built, but it was my skills is the thing that I had built.
8:54
I consider skills income insurance.
You just know that you will be able to make money.
People want to invest in the stock market because they want to have a retirement.
If you invest in skills, that is your retirement because you will always be able to trade them for money and whether the money is in bitcoins, seashells or dollars, you'll always be able to trade something of value.
9:10
I'm sure this is going to piss off the exact same people that we think it's going to piss off.
You don't need a weekend like the concept is barely 100 years old.
It's a modern invention, right?
What you really need is work that you don't need a weekend from.
And instead of thinking about work life balances like a seven day work week, think about work life balances like on like a seven-year time horizon.
9:26
And so like there are seasons of work and there are seasons of less work.
My goal would always be that I just never have something I want to retire from.
In some ways you could say I retired from owning gyms for a while, but I haven't retired from work.
I don't think anyone who wants to live a long life should retire from work.
All the people that I know, we're really old.
They pretty much die when they stop working.
9:42
I've seen the people who stay alive the longest have reasons to stay alive and work is a good one.
The problem is that everyone's idea, like the masses who are listening to this, their idea of what work is, it's not what I'm talking about.
Theirs is like the soul sucking work at a job you hate for a boss that doesn't appreciate you, for a company that doesn't do good in the world.
I completely understand why you would not be motivated to do that and you would want to get away from that as soon as possible.
10:02
You'd be amazing how much faster you can get to your goals when you don't go backwards 104 days a year.
Contrary to what the mediocre masses will tell you, weekends can also be for work.
We had a contractor once who said I quit my job so that I wouldn't have to work weekends, and he was upset that he had worked a weekend.
10:17
You do not have an accurate estimation of reality if you think that starting a business is going to mean that the first business you ever start, you're not going to work weekends right now.
If I started a business, I could take weekends if I wanted to, but I think that's because there's a level of skill you have to get to to get there.
A buddy of mine was talking to me about how he had an employee who was asking for, like, 6 weeks of paid vacation.
10:35
They have, like, not a lot of experiences.
Like I need this time.
He's like, well, I tell you what he's like, What if I give you 110 days a year off paid?
Would that work?
They were like, yeah, he's like like cool.
That's weekends and federal holidays.
If you just don't go backwards on weekends, you can move ahead so much faster.
10:51
If you go out drinking or you do your cheat days on the weekend, then you can undo all of the work that you're doing in the rest of the days of the year and be neutral or even negative at the end of the year.
Depending on how bad off track you go during those 104 days.
From a business perspective, you might get inquiries over the weekend.
11:08
If you don't work your leads over the weekend, you started a deficit.
You might lose those sales if you generate income during the week and then you don't on weekends.
It's 100 and four days a year that you're not generating income out of 365.
You're also going into a deficit that you have to then make up for in the first two days.
So let's say that the two day negative has to get offset by two days of positive.
11:25
So then you're really only working three days.
Now you compare that to somebody who's either not losing steam on the weekends or actually getting ahead on the weekends.
That person isn't moving ahead like twice as fast.
The moving ahead like 7 times as fast.
And so I think that's the piece that a lot of people are missing is the look at somebody who's further ahead, be like, well, this person works like this.
11:41
It's like, well, if you work the same amount as them, they're actually going to keep getting further ahead.
So you have to work as much, switches them to match, probably a little bit more because they're more skilled at working than you are, and then even more to get ahead.
Success is the only revenge.
As you expand, they shrink into irrelevance as you get louder.
11:56
No one can hear them.
You don't beat them.
You cast a shadow so big no one can see them to begin with.
Because at the end of the day, there's no greater waste of time than justifying your actions to people who have a life that you don't want.
And there's no amount of pain you can inflict on a hater that will be more painful than their own life.
12:14
Last part was from Leila.
Like, there is no retaliation, There's no retribution, There's no actual revenge.
So I have beaten a lot of business people in the field, people that I saw as competitors, like, where it was very clear we're going head to head for a market.
What's really weird is that when you actually win, when someone actually goes out of business, it's like, not cool.
12:31
You don't, like, spit on their corpse.
You're just like, oh, there is a tipping point at some point where you start to gain an advantage, you start to separate from them.
But then, like, they start flailing and acting erratic and trying to get ahead.
And then further, you know, they go down that vicious cycle because you are their hater in their mind or their competition.
The biggest mistake of my career I made because of a competitor.
12:49
That mistake cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million actual money.
Not like, like, oh, this is an opportunity that I did like, I actually lost like $25 million on this.
And I just swore to myself that I would never let somebody else dictate my behavior.
Winners focus on winning.
Losers focus on winners.
So the same thing goes with competitors.
13:06
Winners focus on customers.
Competitors focus on winners.
They're always trying to copy you, but because they're trying to copy you, they're not looking at their customers, they're looking at you.
And so they're completely distracted.
They're not looking at the data source that matters most.
First off, if anyone ever copies you, you've already won because they need you.
You don't need them.
You should be afraid when people stop copying you, because it means that you've got nothing.
13:24
And so I see people copying what I'm doing as a positive sign that I'm on the right path rather than a distraction that merits all of my attention getting redirected to trying to destroy someone.
If you walk like downtown in any city, well, that building is a $400 million building and that building is $400 million.
13:40
That's how much money a billionaire has.
Everything else that's there is still up for grabs.
There's so much out there, it's super hard to comprehend.
When we had 5000 plus gyms in gym launch, I think we had 45 gyms in Atlanta.
They would be like, well, there's another gym down the street.
I'm like, there's also 1500 gyms in Atlanta.
So the 45 that are all gym launch gyms are just going to do better than the other 1455.
14:01
The pie is so much bigger than people think it is.
If you feel like you are the output of your life, get the end of your life.
Who you are is the thing that is the thing that you became, then competition is good for you.
Like, if you look back at that person, would you want that person to have no challenges?
Like if you were at the end of your life and you looked back, would you be like, I'm glad I overcame no adversity.
14:18
I'm glad no one ever put me to the test.
I'm glad I never got to see what I was truly capable of.
I'm glad I never had to risk it all when the chips were down.
You would never say that.
We just don't like going through it in the short term, but we do want the outcome of it.
If you just accept that that's the price tag for the person you want to be, then you just pay it willingly by two simple lenses for friendship.
14:34
Number one, do they generally root for you when you win #2?
Do they make you better?
Finding people who do even one of those two things is rare.
Both is even rarer, which is why they get the highest title of friend.
One of the highest RY traits in life that you can make is all the fake friends that you have for one real friend that has your back, even when it all seems lost.
14:53
Bonus points if it's your spouse.
The rare people in your life who root for you to hit your goals are more valuable than the goals themselves.
Consider yourself lucky if you find even one human who believes in you more than you do, and never let them go.
When you start out, people are happy for you that you're doing something but I this is going to be really fucked up.
15:08
But I actually think that people are happy that you quit your job because it counts you out of the race, because the likelihood that you win is so low, and so they're happy because you're actually taking a step back.
You literally take a step back in income, Take a step back in status because you're not doing well.
Like I went from a white collar job to being a personal trainer.
15:24
Like it was a big step back.
So any of my peer group were like, Oh yeah, so good that you're doing that.
If I had immediately jumped and started a tech startup and raised $100 million, they probably immediately wouldn't have been happy for me.
I think the reason that you get that underdog rooting in the beginning is because you actually take a step down in status and so their relative standing actually increases.
15:40
So they encourage you, but then as you come up, your success reminds some of the dreams that they didn't pursue to begin with.
It also reminds them that you started with probably the same resources, and that's why it's so hard to go home for a lot of people.
Because everyone who you grew up with in middle school and high school, you become a glaring example of what they could have done but didn't.
15:58
It's what you make them think about themselves.
Astonishingly, more people know what they should do than claim to know what they should do.
There's usually a voice.
On some level, acting is a hypothetical punishment they haven't actually experienced yet for taking an action that they haven't done yet.
Because we fear this hypothetical punishment, we don't take the real action.
A lot of people just stay stuck there.
16:14
There was one specific voice that I was, like, really afraid of for selling gym launch because I thought 46 million and wasn't enough that that person would be impressed.
And then what I thought about was like, this person is going to prevent me from doing.
Like this person's opinion.
I was like, what do I care?
Do his own life?
What if he does sell his company for more money than me?
Does that mean I suck?
No, it just means that like, I decided to do something, he decided to do something.
16:31
I'm only ascribing value to this person's opinion just because I know who they are.
There's 100,000 times more people who I don't know who are beating me than the ones that I do.
So why would I listen to this one person?
Unless someone is ahead of you, take their hate as envy and then disregard.
Envy is when you want something that someone else has.
16:47
Jealousy is when you fear losing something that you have.
So if you've got your girl and some guy comes up, you get jealous.
If someone has a girl that you wish you had, you experience envy.
So envy is about something you don't have, jealousy about fear of losing something you do.
If people are further behind you, then they're envious of you.
If someones ahead of you, then they're afraid that you're going to take what they have.
17:04
Mind you, In either of those scenarios, it doesn't matter.
I see hate as feedback, nothing more, nothing less.
And I think feedback is worth taking into consideration and what level of validity there is.
So if someone says, hey, you copied my entire business and you've never met them, but you know that that's not true, I had this guy come up to me, saw me on the street randomly.
17:23
He was like, hey man, I need to apologize to you for what?
I've, like, really, really hated you for a long time.
Why?
He's like, because you stole the closer framework from me.
And I was like, dude, I know the fuck you are.
He was like, let's be honest, like, what's the likelihood that we both came up with the same acronym?
And I was like, hi, you take an acronym that's for a closer, and then you fit the words.
17:41
I actually went back.
I found my first document that had closer on it, and I screenshotted the date and it was before he had started selling.
He squashed it and I was like, you're copying me, motherfucker.
I said it joking because I give a shit that hates feedback.
If I'm getting data from the environment, it's data.
It's not good or bad.
It just is.
If everybody ahead of you is afraid that you're going to beat them, that's probably decent data.
17:58
If everybody behind you is envious of where you're at, that's probably decent data to know.
If people are all trying to sue you at the same time for something, then maybe there's something there that you shouldn't have done that you did.
It's the second layer of judgment is the one that everyone gets in trouble with.
This thing happened.
Now I'm going to ascribe meaning to it.
18:14
What does the hate mean?
Doesn't mean anything.
It's just feedback.
And then you take the data and do whatever you want with it.
Sadness comes from a lack of options, which is why it feels like hopelessness.
Anxiety comes from many options but a lack of priorities, which is why it feels like paralysis.
Looking everywhere but moving nowhere.
Solve sadness with knowledge and anxiety with a decision.
18:32
Understanding this changed my life.
Let's say somebody gets really depressed to get laid off.
Why are they sad?
Because they have a perceived lack of options.
If I have five job offers on my table, am I sad that I got laid off because my job offers are better than when I just left?
No.
Now, if I had a hundred options on the table, I might have anxiety because I have too many options that I don't know which one to do.
18:48
It's a perceived lack of options.
With sadness, you don't know what to do because you don't know anything to do.
With anxiety, you don't know which to do.
Disappointment is when an expectation was unmet, you either change your expectations or change reality.
The stoic frame for that is that you imagine all the things that could have gone worse.
I mean, there's a lot of frames, but that's one of them.
The other one is that you imagine that that thing happens 1000 times in a row.
19:05
What would you feel in a thousandth time?
Probably nothing.
Why?
Because you'd already adjusted expectations.
And if you already adjusted expectations, then you can adjust them.
Buddhist monks fundamentally basically do that.
They just change nothing externally and only change internally, which is fine.
But to a certain degree like I want to be benefits humanity and I don't know how beneficial that is.
And to be fair, me saying that I want to do that also creates an expectation of myself which I could be let down for.
19:23
So like I do create a possibility that I am let down by saying I want to help people and if I don't help them then I would be disappointed.
You can shoot big as long as you don't make missing mean that you suck.
I think that being has been the best goal for me to pursue because it's the one that 100% under my control.
If I have something that is disappointing that occurs, what type of version do I want to be in this instance?
19:41
And then what would that man do?
And as closely as I can map my actual behavior to that person's, the more joy I'll experience because I'm present in doing the things that I think I should be doing, and I can still give myself kudos for how well I handled a shitty situation and then end up deriving joy from something that otherwise might have been bad.
I remember seeing this quote once.
19:57
I was like, if you follow your own advice, you'd already be way further than you currently are.
And I thought about that and I was like, yeah, I don't think I need to follow anyone else's advice.
I think I should be doing the things I already know I should be doing.
Then you just have like kind of the emotional component of feeling like you want to maybe release something or whatever, and me being able to talk to my future version.
20:13
Myself in a dialogue format allows me to get grace from a future version of self and also get approval from a future version of self.
So somebody that I esteem higher than myself is future me, who's hopefully better, and his judgement on my current situation and his advice.
It tends to be really good advice.
20:28
The best advice I've gotten has been from future me.
No one's afraid of failing, they're afraid of what other people will think of them when they fail.
But if they're afraid of that, imagine what those other people think of you when you're not even trying.
Well, the reality is they're not at all.
If they don't have what you want, don't listen to what they say.
20:45
Having what you want is a really easy evidence point.
That's high likelihood, basically.
It decreases the risk of whatever advice they're providing.
That's not a perfect frame because there are amazing Olympic coaches that never won the goal.
The fastest way to move forward in life is listen to people who can give you advice that can get you there faster, so not having to suffer and experience and waste all that time and back.
21:04
Step to learn the lesson to move forward and so the faster you can avoid those lessons and just keep moving forward, the faster you move.
But the problem is we don't know who to trust.
And so I have made 7 levels of how I weigh advice that have served me well, but at the lowest level, #7.
Comments on social media, which is basically comments from strangers who don't know me and don't have what I want.
21:23
Number six people giving their two cents who do know me but don't have what I want #5.
Someone who knows me and knows someone who went to where I'm trying to go #4.
Someone who's been there #3.
Someone who took someone else there, #2 one who took someone just like me to exactly where I want to go, and #1 someone who has been there took someone else there just like me multiple times.
21:45
Do I trust somebody who's taking someone else there because I am the someone else more than someone who's only taking themselves there?
Because if someone's taking someone else there, then I could slot in and there's a likely they could do it again.
If they've only taken themselves there and not taken anyone else there, then they might not be a very good teacher, which happens all the time.
Michael Jordan has an insane record.
22:01
Playing basketball has a very poor record.
Owning a basketball team.
I'm big on give, give, give until they ask, right?
And especially if you're starting out, the best thing to do is give away stuff for free for multiple reasons.
One, because you probably suck because you haven't done it yet and it's a gift.
If someone allows you to work for them because you have a chance at providing value.
22:20
And from there you can leverage that into testimonials, referrals, and potentially even a paying customer.
They might if you continue to provide this value for free eventually say, hey, I've got too many people providing for free.
I have too much demand on my time at price of free and I can go to 20% of the price that I want to go to.
And if everyone says yes and you of demand, then you go to 40% of the price and then sixty and then a hundred and then 500%, right?
22:39
And you keep going.
But what happens is a lot of people will shortchange that.
And so I get DMS every day of people saying, hey, I want to give you value in exchange for and it's just stop, don't tell me what value you want to give me and what you want to trade that value for.
And usually it's them actually massively undervaluing my time, as though them making it free to me is somehow more valuable than me paying for something.
23:01
Like I have tons of money, I don't have tons of time, and so it's my much scarcer resource.
This kid was like, yeah, I have a lot of advice that I think I can give you on social media.
And I click over his profile, he's got 100 followers and he said I'll do it in exchange for a testimonial.
And it was just like, it was so blind reality.
First off, you have no evidence that you're good.
23:18
Second off, it's delusion.
And so the way to do it right is to go above and beyond, do a ton of work, and then just give it to the person not in exchange for or an expectation of, but just give it to that person and then guess it'll happen nothing.
Because most times if someone's way ahead of you, they might not want it or might not need it.
But you make your best approximate guess of what they might need.
23:35
Do your best shot at it.
There's probably three things that can happen.
One, most likely nothing happens.
They don't respond to you.
They don't care.
The second option is that they see how hard you worked on something.
And even though they don't need that thing, everyone one level up needs people who work hard on things.
And then so you still prove how hard you work by how good the thing that you give is.
23:52
And so they might have an opportunity for you, not even in the main thing, but on something else.
And then the third and probably the least likely but probably the one you want the most, is that they say, wow, that's amazing.
I would love for you to do that.
Now to be fair, most of the people on my team came from doing that.
You roll the dice and people roll the dice one time with their time and say, I did this work for this one guy and he didn't immediately hire me on retainer, but did you do it for 100 people?
24:15
If you give tremendous value to 100 people, you'll be able to make more income than most jobs in America.
Simple by providing A tremendous amount of value to 100 business owners.
One of them or five of them will respond back and say, yes, I would like more work from you or I can offer you a job.
I was afraid to charge people money, but I did want them to, like, be invested.
24:33
And so I started a nonprofit called the Free Training Project, where I said if they donated $502,000 to the charity of their choice, I would train them for 12 weeks.
That's how I got my first customers.
But then after the 12 weeks, some of them were like, I still want to keep training with you.
And I was like, hey, I'm the charity now.
I am poor.
Please help me.
That's literally at literally the other 12 weeks, I was like, I think I want to do this full time because I did it while I still have my job.
24:51
And then I was like, I think I want to do this full time.
I hope you guys are OK with this.
I like if you could pay me instead.
I just kind of like it.
Everyone did.








0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Hold on everybody.
Happy hump day, have you Wednesday.
0:31
Hope you guys are having an awesome awesome week so far.
Today, I have a video that I have been pondering for a really long time in terms of like putting notes down and what I wanted to cover.
I really hope that comes out the way that I want it to, but that being said, one of the more questions I get from people in general is how to level up, how to move up in their skill set.
0:50
And I made the headline when to stop coaching classes and how to level up your skill sets to scale your business.
So ultimately the business will always be limited by A personal growth and your skill set growth.
So an easy example to illustrate, that is somebody who's just starting out, in Fitness is coaching their session, right?
1:09
So some of the people are in this group right now who are often, all right, now they coach their sessions, right?
And so, sometimes the questions like, well, how can I stop coaching these sessions because I can't afford.
I can't afford to pay someone to coaching sessions instead of me.
Right.
And the honest truth is that a lot of times, you can't afford not to pay someone.
1:27
Now, the caveat is that the reason that you can't afford Word to pay someone at this point is because you like a skill set that allows you to make more money than the $15, an hour that you're making coaching the classes.
And so if you have a desire to make more money and yet you are feeling your time with tasks that are a ten dollar an hour or 50, not whatever, you know what I mean.
1:47
An hourly wage that is below if you would like to be making and that should be an indicator for you that you need to level up and acquire more skills.
So the nice thing is once like high-value skills are not difficult to acquire, but most people just don't know that that's how it works.
2:04
So here's the example, the gym owner has been coaching all of this sessions for three years at his gym and then all of a sudden the revenue and the business triples because he uses Jim on stuff.
Now you can forget that it's Jim launch but the point is that what happens is he shifts from his time?
2:21
Being spent telling people how to squat, right?
And then turns into him selling because selling is a more valuable People skill set in the marketplace like and so for that for every hour you meets with two people and he closes one or two at five six hundred dollars.
And now he goes for making $15 an hour to making 500 to 1000.
2:39
Now now, how many hours of $500 an hour, does it take to cover all of your training sessions?
One sale covers all of your training sessions for the week.
How important do you think that it is for you to get all of your training session hours back?
Probably pretty important, right?
2:56
And so, that would probably be the next skill set that you would need to acquire in order to get out of the day-to-day operations of your gym right now.
The next thing is how to plug.
Let's be real though you're like, well I'm sure I can sell it off, people walk in the door.
So the reason that the actual Jim, let's gyms and Jim - Jim's make so much more make it so quickly is that we give them to skills.
3:15
Not just sales, the sales and marketing and once you have both of those together that's when you can really start cranking and make your own paycheck, right?
And so So if you aren't making the money that you want to make, it's because you lack the skills that are necessary to just like right now, you're trading your time for dollars for $15 an hour thing.
3:31
Like, I don't know how to make more do.
I need to train more sessions and no, obviously not, you need to think differently in terms of what you're trading your time for dollars.
For ultimately we always trading our time for dollars despite what anyone will say.
But it's just that like a skill set of leadership is just more difficult to track.
The our is being spent on leading or casting a vision.
3:51
But is that more valuable than sales Yes, right.
And so that's the next answer questions, like okay.
So first thing I need to learn is how to coach sessions, and that's the first thing you do.
And then you're like, okay, well, if I can make more than four times five times as much as that, then for every one hour or selling, I can replace 10 hours of training awesome.
4:10
So I just need to sell for five more hours, boom, right now, for anyone who has, who's like, working at a gym right now, like, this is how you become more valuable.
This is how you become more valuable business is because you acquire skills that are valued by the business that are valued at a higher rate, want to get paid.
Work.
This is how you do it right now.
4:26
What happens and this is where we're business owners are not foreigners will get stuck, right?
This is the obstacle part is that once you make a transition from let's say sales so you made the transition from coaching to sales which I think is really really easy because the value discrepancy is so enormous like one sale covers an entire week of training sessions, that is how huge the value discrepancy is.
4:49
And what's crazy is if you watch an hour's worth of videos and recordings You can acquire that skill.
You should do it, right?
That should make sense.
Now, once you do start selling in your like you know what?
Now I've been selling for a while.
I get this gig.
I feel good about it, right?
5:05
It should be at the point where you're almost board selling.
Now once you're board selling, what does that mean?
It means you need to make a process about it because now you've gotten so good at it that your subconscious is taking over.
You unconscious competence awesome document it, right?
And once your document, then you can transfer the skill to the next person because teaching people how to sell is more valuable than being able to sell, right?
5:24
Because you're scaling an ability.
All right, so that is the next thing that you need.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, share it on Instagram or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
5:42
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Now once you're scaling your ability to sell, then you have to start owning the next thing, right?
6:03
And so the next thing for you is going to be owning the actual business which is going to be mostly in the beginning.
Just making sure that your it's continuing to rain.
What I mean by that is marketing, right?
And then casting the vision and running an actual team because that is a skill.
How many people have had really shitty managers, right?
They didn't have the skill.
6:19
And so the entire team is a whole operated at a lower level.
And so, if you can get everybody to operate it twice, the productivity.
That is a very, very A valuable skill, but a lot of people don't have that in the beginning.
And so what happens is there's this this jump that needs to happen where you go from selling to Leading and marketing marketing still because it's still more valuable and probably no one else will do it or have that skill set in your area, right.
6:44
But marketing and Leadership now the thing is that when you make that jump, you the new person who's coming into sales.
Isn't that good yet, right?
And when you jump into leadership, you're not that good yet either.
And that's where people get in trouble.
So how do you not get in trouble when you make your transitions?
7:02
You stay in the boring zone for a little longer than you think you should.
All right?
And the boring zone is where you're like, you just boring makes you rich.
I'll say it over and over again, like a boring business will make you rich as in everyday the front desk girl, smiles and Greece people by name that is boring.
But that is fundamental business.
7:18
Right?
Every day, the sessions are great, right?
Like the bathrooms are clean.
The music is fresh, like, these are simple things like, you don't always need to do different.
A lot of times, you should be better at the thing that you are doing something that is really refreshing.
For maybe the people who are on here right now.
Just as total side note, and I'll make a whole video about this, but half the people who are watching, this are below average.
7:41
Just mathematically half the people watching this right now are below average.
So if you think about it from that standpoint, there's a lot of room for growth.
There's a lot of things that you can do to be better, right?
Because half the people watching, this are not even middle.
So when everyone's like, man, we totally over-deliver, like we're the best in the area, like you're probably not because of you worried already before.
8:04
Anyways, so let me get back to the main point skill.
Set was as you were acquiring these skills.
You have this little this little Gap period.
The first thing is when the business is boring, that is when you need to document.
All right, let's move.
And you're documenting the process.
And then at that point is when you start bringing someone in to start shadowing, take over a third of the sales, half of the sales and that we can get feedback, but you're not a huge cash flow risk, right?
8:27
The next thing is that you want to make sure you're stacking cash, that's why.
It's one of the big things that we have in Legacy statcast this whole time.
Don't then think like, okay, now I finally deserve my vacation because this is the first three months in a row.
I made 15,000 dollars.
Net.
Awesome.
That's what you should have been doing for a long time.
8:43
Put it in the bank, right?
Because you don't know how good things, We'll be forever.
I don't know how good things are going to be things are great for us right now, but I don't know.
And so I like to have a huge War chest just in case, right?
And so you have that war chest so that when you do make that final transition you push the person full-time in a sales.
9:00
If for some reason cash flow drops or sales drop, you can do so without having to jump back in because you have a cash flow cushion, right?
You have a cushion here and that's what you want.
Now, during that period of time, as you're making huge transition, from one third of sales to have sales to three quarter sales being the other person.
9:16
That's when you start really investing in consuming all the content around leadership, right?
And then practicing it, because no shit.
If you're trying to sell, right, what do you do you practice?
You get in front of people because reading the book is just the beginning, watching the modules is just the beginning.
9:32
How do you, how do you know that you're leading people?
Well, you can see right.
You can see if you're selling them because that's really what it is.
Is just a higher level cell.
You're selling them on the business, you're selling them on the vision, you're selling them on the future.
You're selling them on your customers, right?
Rather than Selling them to get their credit card, which the transactional, and can only be one time.
9:49
Now you're selling them for life and you're selling them on a continual basis, right?
Because the reality is you don't just sell an employee one time, you have to sell them on a daily basis, right?
You have to sell them on a weekly basis, that's why the cam Cycles exist.
That's why you have to have repeated communication Cycles because people's motivation dips, right?
10:08
They forget because their kids get sick and because they get sick and because their parents have issues and blah blah blah, blah.
All right, other things take their attention, They are not you yet, they don't manage their attention, the way you were trying to because they're not that stage yet, their attention just gets taken from them left and right, and they don't even know that it's happening, right?
10:25
But you have to know that it's happening.
You have to take responsibility for the fact that it's happening.
So you have to be the one who's repeatedly selling them on a regular basis so that they get bought in so that they keep their productivity high and they ultimately make the business profitable.
So here is a cute.
10:40
Here's your litmus test for knowing if this is something that you should be investing in it right now, your income has been Been stagnant for a period of time, right?
Or not grown, in the amount that you think it should have grown as period of time, it is because you have a lack of skills, right?
10:57
You have a lack of skills and so, if you want to make more and it has been stagnant than it could be, you don't know how to sell, right?
And so you're just coaching sessions or maybe you're selling, but you don't know how to get someone else to sell for you so that you can scale your time, right?
11:14
Maybe that's a sign, maybe that's what it is.
Or maybe you don't know how to lead and manage people to get the most productivity out of the entirety.
Because whenever you take yourself out of the training or like being micromanaging on the trainers are being micromanaged yellow pad, man, in front desk, for being my commission sales, everything drops, why?
Because you're lacking leadership skills, right?
11:31
And so, just look at that is a little litmus test of what skills am I lacking?
If it's been the same, just are trying to identify what skill it is and then once you know, it's guilt is then the easy part is just attacking it and then just doing it until it gets better crazy, right?
So anyways, um, I hope that this was die before you.
11:50
I think I covered all of the notes not in any order that I wanted to but I hope that makes sense for you guys.
I hope you guys have an awesome amazing week.
Thank you all for giving me your most valuable asset, which is your attention.
I hope I give you a good return.
On it.
12:06
All right.



0:00
This is my most brutally honest advice to my younger self.
You can beat 99% of people simply by continuing to work without needing your immediate reward.
This bit is advice to my younger self on how I work harder.
You're going to lose sleep, You'll doubt whether it'll work, you'll stress to make ends meet, You won't finish your To Do List.
You'll wonder if you made the right call and have no way to know for years.
0:17
But that's what hard feels like.
The other great reason for working harder is that the harder you work, the more you realize what you used to think was hard work isn't even close to what you're capable of.
Because if you want to know what the most dangerous money making combo in the world, it's work ethic and time.
Because once you realize just how much more work it takes to get from good to great, you realize you can only be great at a few things and you're forced to ignore the rest.
0:36
The amount of work it takes to be good negates the ability to be great at more than one or two things.
Because there's just only so much time.
It just takes work, shit loads and shit loads of work.
And every time I dress it up or cut a corner, I get brutally reminded by life that the work just needs doing.
So yes, this is your friendly reminder that it's OK to work on weekends.
0:53
I used to think that if I worked on something for a day, it was a lot.
I was like, dude, I worked on this for a whole day, was like a huge amount of work.
And I would say that to someone to show them how hard I worked.
And then it became like I worked on this for a week and then a month.
And I would say now that I can work on the same project for a year or two years.
1:09
And that's what like to the books, has been huge projects for me.
My quickest shorthand on the shift in work is that I started counting in hundreds, hundreds of minutes, hundreds of hours, hundreds of days towards a specific goal.
If you count in hundreds, it just automatically forces you to do a significantly larger amount of effort, just sheer volume of work.
1:25
I think one of my favorite parables about work is that there was a in art class.
They split the class into two groups and one group They said make the absolute best pot and turn in one pot and the other group they said make as many pots as you possibly can.
At the end of the semester, the team that had to make as many pots as only possible not only made more pots, but also ended up making better pots than the one that spent all of their time trying to make one.
1:47
I think a lot of people need that permission to have a lot of shitty first drafts in order to start working harder on anything.
But that's not how I operate because for me, I would rather spend a lot more time in my first draft so I don't have to make so many more edits.
If you do it the right way, you realize how many hours you're going to have to put into something.
2:04
And usually most people that I feel like haven't done that level of effort confront the work and then they get scared about it.
I have to find a different way.
This can't actually be how people do this.
That is how you do it.
The work just needs doing and no one's going to do it for you.
I started with a normal hourly job and I think a lot of people do a lot of early job thoughts or lessons are that when you show up to work, you are working because you're getting paid to be there.
2:26
When you start working for yourself, you're not getting paid to be there.
You're only getting paid on what you do.
I've gone on vacations with other entrepreneurs.
They're like, man, we had a crazy work day.
I was like, I was with you, call me like that was not at work.
These are off days for me.
Like these aren't like real work day because work occurred.
It to me is not a work day unless I have a clear output for what I have done or move forward work didn't have.
2:46
The longer you can delay when you need to be rewarded for the work that you do, the greater the outcome is.
It's kind of like a plane taking off.
The longer the runway, the bigger the plane.
And so a lot of people can barely even get a bottle rocket off the ground because they have such a short attention span and such a need for immediate reward.
3:03
If you feel like you're behind where you should be by now, if you feel like you're losing, if you're not sure it's going to work, there's nothing wrong with you.
That is entrepreneurship.
You're on the right path.
You're doing the right things.
You're seeing the milestones along the way.
But the milestones aren't parades.
3:18
It's uncertainty.
It's a sleepless nice.
It's not knowing if you can make payroll.
It's not even being sure that the five years you put into this idea is actually going to turn into something that you'll get credit for eventually.
The biggest shift that I had internally during those harder times was that I am the output of my work.
3:34
All of this effort is to create who I want to become.
I get to use that as my reward every day, rather than the approval of strangers.
Sitting in uncertainty is the feeling of entrepreneurship.
You're not doing it wrong.
Like that's what it feels like.
It's kind of this weird dichotomy of feeling like you never have enough time, but then you also have all the time in the world.
3:51
The biggest reason that a lot of entrepreneurs don't succeed is because they're in a rush.
The rush what creates poor decisions?
And so they consistently hop from thing to thing to thing because they think this thing will get them there faster by hopping consistently to guarantee that they'll never get there.
And I think we have a culture that rewards speed because everybody wants things fast and easy In $100 offers the book.
4:10
I talk about value.
You have a dream outcome and then you have basically everything that discounts or multiplies it.
A discount would be risk associated with it.
I want this thing, but I want it to be guaranteed.
I want it to be easy and I want it to be fast.
And entrepreneurship is literally the opposite of that.
The dream outcomes there, but it is not guaranteed incredibly hard and takes forever.
4:28
The problem is that it's so compelling to sell people on that and there's so many more ad dollars that go into its fast.
It's easy and it's guaranteed that.
It's really tough to shift the landscape of the language around entrepreneurship because there's just so much money to be made by making that promise.
4:44
The concept of the the billionaire who like starts back over and they're like could he do it again?
It's like well, of course the problem with the show is, is that they give you 90 days.
The premise is wrong and I get why they do it is because they have to cater to people who think that way which is most people can he build $1,000,000 business in 90 days.
4:59
But it's like, but he could build a much bigger business in two years, and that billionaire would probably never build the business that he builds on the show.
So it actually reinforces the wrong perspective from a brand foundation perspective.
It's how can I build a reputation over a long period of time, not necessarily with the intent to transact, but simply to build a reputation associating myself with these positive things.
5:19
That takes time for one, lots of people to find out about you and two, for a lot of people to develop a strong affinity and make multiple associations with you so that it's stronger.
The classic example of that is somebody who makes content for five years and then it launches a product and the products immediately A billion dollar thing.
Well, it's not that they made a billion dollars in a year, it's that they spent five years letting the roots go down for the bamboo tree and then eventually it shoots up.
5:39
Right.
On the other hand, you've got kind of product based foundation software.
You might take a long time to code and like write a huge code base that could go after some big problem.
It could be regulatory stuff, because if you want to get into like banking, for example, there's lots of barriers to entry.
Even if you're starting an e-commerce brand, you would be talking to different manufacturers, you'd be going through prototypes, you'd be trying things out, you'd be testing it in beta groups to get feedback, and then you'd probably have some sort of capital investment to capitalize your first inventory run.
6:02
All of those things are the foundations.
The reason I like service business for people who are starting out is that you don't have to do either of those things.
But if you had one or two or both of those things, then you can create something bigger, faster on a longer time horizon.
It's actually the classic example of how long do you sharpen the axe.
6:19
If someone is doing a business that they have No leverage because they built no foundation, they basically just take whatever axe is given to them and they just start hacking away at the tree.
Except in the game of business, the tree might be a mile wide and the axe that you have could be a lightsaber if you spend enough time sharpening it.
6:34
Even if it took one guy a year of going from dull axe to lightsaber, he would still catch up at year two and then from year 2 to 10 doesn't even get close to the other guy.
But the problem is that everybody listens to everyone else who's judging them on their time horizon.
Like you quit your job on a employee time horizon.
6:51
Your family's like, have you started making money yet?
And you're like it's been 2 weeks.
They're like, well yeah, this is when you would normally get a paycheck.
You're measuring stick has to change when you get into a different game.
Sometimes the fastest way to get to $1,000,000 a year isn't the fastest way to get to $10 million a year.
And to the same degree.
The fastest way to get to 10 isn't the fastest way to go to 100.
7:06
If we're measuring effort in terms of stress and hours per day, running a local restaurant takes the same amount of work as building an application.
That could be a billion dollar application, and it might take you a few years for a restaurant to build a reputation in the area, get locals coming in, hire and train good talent.
7:22
Like it takes a lot of work to do all that stuff.
And to the same degree, hiring really good development engineers and creating a prototype.
Like the actual work and stress is almost identical.
It's almost like you have three slot machines that you're going up to and they all cost the same cost, but one of them has a billion dollar payout, one has a $10 million payout and one is $100,000 payout and everyone just lines up for the 100, $1000 payout.
7:42
The third variable, if we're going to like make this in terms of dimensions, the next one is how long are we measuring the payout for the slot machine.
We assume that slot machines payout immediately, but if one slot machine pays out now, one pays out in a year and one pays out in five years, what if the odds were the same but you only got one coin?
7:58
Which one would you do?
People say they would do the billion dollar one, but based on their behaviour they're just standing at the at the the fast token machine, not being able to break it.
The fact that you don't know if it's going to work is exactly what makes it worth doing.
It's why entrepreneurship isn't for the faint of heart.
8:13
You have to embrace uncertainty.
What makes entrepreneurship isn't the work itself, it's actually just not knowing if the work will work.
We're afraid of wasted effort, but if it makes you better, then no effort is wasted and as long as you can make that connection you're not going to burnout, you're just doing what it takes.
The biggest meta lesson of my entire life was when I lost everything the first time I had sold all the gyms, and then that was my nest egg for my five years of work.
8:35
Even though it was not as much as I had hoped, but it was still something.
And then I put that all into the next thing and then lost it all.
But after losing it all, I was able to immediately go out and make $100,000 the next month with nothing maxing out a credit card to do it.
That moment was I was like, oh, like I thought that the gyms were the thing that I had built, but it was my skills is the thing that I had built.
8:54
I consider skills income insurance.
You just know that you will be able to make money.
People want to invest in the stock market because they want to have a retirement.
If you invest in skills, that is your retirement because you will always be able to trade them for money and whether the money is in bitcoins, seashells or dollars, you'll always be able to trade something of value.
9:10
I'm sure this is going to piss off the exact same people that we think it's going to piss off.
You don't need a weekend like the concept is barely 100 years old.
It's a modern invention, right?
What you really need is work that you don't need a weekend from.
And instead of thinking about work life balances like a seven day work week, think about work life balances like on like a seven-year time horizon.
9:26
And so like there are seasons of work and there are seasons of less work.
My goal would always be that I just never have something I want to retire from.
In some ways you could say I retired from owning gyms for a while, but I haven't retired from work.
I don't think anyone who wants to live a long life should retire from work.
All the people that I know, we're really old.
They pretty much die when they stop working.
9:42
I've seen the people who stay alive the longest have reasons to stay alive and work is a good one.
The problem is that everyone's idea, like the masses who are listening to this, their idea of what work is, it's not what I'm talking about.
Theirs is like the soul sucking work at a job you hate for a boss that doesn't appreciate you, for a company that doesn't do good in the world.
I completely understand why you would not be motivated to do that and you would want to get away from that as soon as possible.
10:02
You'd be amazing how much faster you can get to your goals when you don't go backwards 104 days a year.
Contrary to what the mediocre masses will tell you, weekends can also be for work.
We had a contractor once who said I quit my job so that I wouldn't have to work weekends, and he was upset that he had worked a weekend.
10:17
You do not have an accurate estimation of reality if you think that starting a business is going to mean that the first business you ever start, you're not going to work weekends right now.
If I started a business, I could take weekends if I wanted to, but I think that's because there's a level of skill you have to get to to get there.
A buddy of mine was talking to me about how he had an employee who was asking for, like, 6 weeks of paid vacation.
10:35
They have, like, not a lot of experiences.
Like I need this time.
He's like, well, I tell you what he's like, What if I give you 110 days a year off paid?
Would that work?
They were like, yeah, he's like like cool.
That's weekends and federal holidays.
If you just don't go backwards on weekends, you can move ahead so much faster.
10:51
If you go out drinking or you do your cheat days on the weekend, then you can undo all of the work that you're doing in the rest of the days of the year and be neutral or even negative at the end of the year.
Depending on how bad off track you go during those 104 days.
From a business perspective, you might get inquiries over the weekend.
11:08
If you don't work your leads over the weekend, you started a deficit.
You might lose those sales if you generate income during the week and then you don't on weekends.
It's 100 and four days a year that you're not generating income out of 365.
You're also going into a deficit that you have to then make up for in the first two days.
So let's say that the two day negative has to get offset by two days of positive.
11:25
So then you're really only working three days.
Now you compare that to somebody who's either not losing steam on the weekends or actually getting ahead on the weekends.
That person isn't moving ahead like twice as fast.
The moving ahead like 7 times as fast.
And so I think that's the piece that a lot of people are missing is the look at somebody who's further ahead, be like, well, this person works like this.
11:41
It's like, well, if you work the same amount as them, they're actually going to keep getting further ahead.
So you have to work as much, switches them to match, probably a little bit more because they're more skilled at working than you are, and then even more to get ahead.
Success is the only revenge.
As you expand, they shrink into irrelevance as you get louder.
11:56
No one can hear them.
You don't beat them.
You cast a shadow so big no one can see them to begin with.
Because at the end of the day, there's no greater waste of time than justifying your actions to people who have a life that you don't want.
And there's no amount of pain you can inflict on a hater that will be more painful than their own life.
12:14
Last part was from Leila.
Like, there is no retaliation, There's no retribution, There's no actual revenge.
So I have beaten a lot of business people in the field, people that I saw as competitors, like, where it was very clear we're going head to head for a market.
What's really weird is that when you actually win, when someone actually goes out of business, it's like, not cool.
12:31
You don't, like, spit on their corpse.
You're just like, oh, there is a tipping point at some point where you start to gain an advantage, you start to separate from them.
But then, like, they start flailing and acting erratic and trying to get ahead.
And then further, you know, they go down that vicious cycle because you are their hater in their mind or their competition.
The biggest mistake of my career I made because of a competitor.
12:49
That mistake cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million actual money.
Not like, like, oh, this is an opportunity that I did like, I actually lost like $25 million on this.
And I just swore to myself that I would never let somebody else dictate my behavior.
Winners focus on winning.
Losers focus on winners.
So the same thing goes with competitors.
13:06
Winners focus on customers.
Competitors focus on winners.
They're always trying to copy you, but because they're trying to copy you, they're not looking at their customers, they're looking at you.
And so they're completely distracted.
They're not looking at the data source that matters most.
First off, if anyone ever copies you, you've already won because they need you.
You don't need them.
You should be afraid when people stop copying you, because it means that you've got nothing.
13:24
And so I see people copying what I'm doing as a positive sign that I'm on the right path rather than a distraction that merits all of my attention getting redirected to trying to destroy someone.
If you walk like downtown in any city, well, that building is a $400 million building and that building is $400 million.
13:40
That's how much money a billionaire has.
Everything else that's there is still up for grabs.
There's so much out there, it's super hard to comprehend.
When we had 5000 plus gyms in gym launch, I think we had 45 gyms in Atlanta.
They would be like, well, there's another gym down the street.
I'm like, there's also 1500 gyms in Atlanta.
So the 45 that are all gym launch gyms are just going to do better than the other 1455.
14:01
The pie is so much bigger than people think it is.
If you feel like you are the output of your life, get the end of your life.
Who you are is the thing that is the thing that you became, then competition is good for you.
Like, if you look back at that person, would you want that person to have no challenges?
Like if you were at the end of your life and you looked back, would you be like, I'm glad I overcame no adversity.
14:18
I'm glad no one ever put me to the test.
I'm glad I never got to see what I was truly capable of.
I'm glad I never had to risk it all when the chips were down.
You would never say that.
We just don't like going through it in the short term, but we do want the outcome of it.
If you just accept that that's the price tag for the person you want to be, then you just pay it willingly by two simple lenses for friendship.
14:34
Number one, do they generally root for you when you win #2?
Do they make you better?
Finding people who do even one of those two things is rare.
Both is even rarer, which is why they get the highest title of friend.
One of the highest RY traits in life that you can make is all the fake friends that you have for one real friend that has your back, even when it all seems lost.
14:53
Bonus points if it's your spouse.
The rare people in your life who root for you to hit your goals are more valuable than the goals themselves.
Consider yourself lucky if you find even one human who believes in you more than you do, and never let them go.
When you start out, people are happy for you that you're doing something but I this is going to be really fucked up.
15:08
But I actually think that people are happy that you quit your job because it counts you out of the race, because the likelihood that you win is so low, and so they're happy because you're actually taking a step back.
You literally take a step back in income, Take a step back in status because you're not doing well.
Like I went from a white collar job to being a personal trainer.
15:24
Like it was a big step back.
So any of my peer group were like, Oh yeah, so good that you're doing that.
If I had immediately jumped and started a tech startup and raised $100 million, they probably immediately wouldn't have been happy for me.
I think the reason that you get that underdog rooting in the beginning is because you actually take a step down in status and so their relative standing actually increases.
15:40
So they encourage you, but then as you come up, your success reminds some of the dreams that they didn't pursue to begin with.
It also reminds them that you started with probably the same resources, and that's why it's so hard to go home for a lot of people.
Because everyone who you grew up with in middle school and high school, you become a glaring example of what they could have done but didn't.
15:58
It's what you make them think about themselves.
Astonishingly, more people know what they should do than claim to know what they should do.
There's usually a voice.
On some level, acting is a hypothetical punishment they haven't actually experienced yet for taking an action that they haven't done yet.
Because we fear this hypothetical punishment, we don't take the real action.
A lot of people just stay stuck there.
16:14
There was one specific voice that I was, like, really afraid of for selling gym launch because I thought 46 million and wasn't enough that that person would be impressed.
And then what I thought about was like, this person is going to prevent me from doing.
Like this person's opinion.
I was like, what do I care?
Do his own life?
What if he does sell his company for more money than me?
Does that mean I suck?
No, it just means that like, I decided to do something, he decided to do something.
16:31
I'm only ascribing value to this person's opinion just because I know who they are.
There's 100,000 times more people who I don't know who are beating me than the ones that I do.
So why would I listen to this one person?
Unless someone is ahead of you, take their hate as envy and then disregard.
Envy is when you want something that someone else has.
16:47
Jealousy is when you fear losing something that you have.
So if you've got your girl and some guy comes up, you get jealous.
If someone has a girl that you wish you had, you experience envy.
So envy is about something you don't have, jealousy about fear of losing something you do.
If people are further behind you, then they're envious of you.
If someones ahead of you, then they're afraid that you're going to take what they have.
17:04
Mind you, In either of those scenarios, it doesn't matter.
I see hate as feedback, nothing more, nothing less.
And I think feedback is worth taking into consideration and what level of validity there is.
So if someone says, hey, you copied my entire business and you've never met them, but you know that that's not true, I had this guy come up to me, saw me on the street randomly.
17:23
He was like, hey man, I need to apologize to you for what?
I've, like, really, really hated you for a long time.
Why?
He's like, because you stole the closer framework from me.
And I was like, dude, I know the fuck you are.
He was like, let's be honest, like, what's the likelihood that we both came up with the same acronym?
And I was like, hi, you take an acronym that's for a closer, and then you fit the words.
17:41
I actually went back.
I found my first document that had closer on it, and I screenshotted the date and it was before he had started selling.
He squashed it and I was like, you're copying me, motherfucker.
I said it joking because I give a shit that hates feedback.
If I'm getting data from the environment, it's data.
It's not good or bad.
It just is.
If everybody ahead of you is afraid that you're going to beat them, that's probably decent data.
17:58
If everybody behind you is envious of where you're at, that's probably decent data to know.
If people are all trying to sue you at the same time for something, then maybe there's something there that you shouldn't have done that you did.
It's the second layer of judgment is the one that everyone gets in trouble with.
This thing happened.
Now I'm going to ascribe meaning to it.
18:14
What does the hate mean?
Doesn't mean anything.
It's just feedback.
And then you take the data and do whatever you want with it.
Sadness comes from a lack of options, which is why it feels like hopelessness.
Anxiety comes from many options but a lack of priorities, which is why it feels like paralysis.
Looking everywhere but moving nowhere.
Solve sadness with knowledge and anxiety with a decision.
18:32
Understanding this changed my life.
Let's say somebody gets really depressed to get laid off.
Why are they sad?
Because they have a perceived lack of options.
If I have five job offers on my table, am I sad that I got laid off because my job offers are better than when I just left?
No.
Now, if I had a hundred options on the table, I might have anxiety because I have too many options that I don't know which one to do.
18:48
It's a perceived lack of options.
With sadness, you don't know what to do because you don't know anything to do.
With anxiety, you don't know which to do.
Disappointment is when an expectation was unmet, you either change your expectations or change reality.
The stoic frame for that is that you imagine all the things that could have gone worse.
I mean, there's a lot of frames, but that's one of them.
The other one is that you imagine that that thing happens 1000 times in a row.
19:05
What would you feel in a thousandth time?
Probably nothing.
Why?
Because you'd already adjusted expectations.
And if you already adjusted expectations, then you can adjust them.
Buddhist monks fundamentally basically do that.
They just change nothing externally and only change internally, which is fine.
But to a certain degree like I want to be benefits humanity and I don't know how beneficial that is.
And to be fair, me saying that I want to do that also creates an expectation of myself which I could be let down for.
19:23
So like I do create a possibility that I am let down by saying I want to help people and if I don't help them then I would be disappointed.
You can shoot big as long as you don't make missing mean that you suck.
I think that being has been the best goal for me to pursue because it's the one that 100% under my control.
If I have something that is disappointing that occurs, what type of version do I want to be in this instance?
19:41
And then what would that man do?
And as closely as I can map my actual behavior to that person's, the more joy I'll experience because I'm present in doing the things that I think I should be doing, and I can still give myself kudos for how well I handled a shitty situation and then end up deriving joy from something that otherwise might have been bad.
I remember seeing this quote once.
19:57
I was like, if you follow your own advice, you'd already be way further than you currently are.
And I thought about that and I was like, yeah, I don't think I need to follow anyone else's advice.
I think I should be doing the things I already know I should be doing.
Then you just have like kind of the emotional component of feeling like you want to maybe release something or whatever, and me being able to talk to my future version.
20:13
Myself in a dialogue format allows me to get grace from a future version of self and also get approval from a future version of self.
So somebody that I esteem higher than myself is future me, who's hopefully better, and his judgement on my current situation and his advice.
It tends to be really good advice.
20:28
The best advice I've gotten has been from future me.
No one's afraid of failing, they're afraid of what other people will think of them when they fail.
But if they're afraid of that, imagine what those other people think of you when you're not even trying.
Well, the reality is they're not at all.
If they don't have what you want, don't listen to what they say.
20:45
Having what you want is a really easy evidence point.
That's high likelihood, basically.
It decreases the risk of whatever advice they're providing.
That's not a perfect frame because there are amazing Olympic coaches that never won the goal.
The fastest way to move forward in life is listen to people who can give you advice that can get you there faster, so not having to suffer and experience and waste all that time and back.
21:04
Step to learn the lesson to move forward and so the faster you can avoid those lessons and just keep moving forward, the faster you move.
But the problem is we don't know who to trust.
And so I have made 7 levels of how I weigh advice that have served me well, but at the lowest level, #7.
Comments on social media, which is basically comments from strangers who don't know me and don't have what I want.
21:23
Number six people giving their two cents who do know me but don't have what I want #5.
Someone who knows me and knows someone who went to where I'm trying to go #4.
Someone who's been there #3.
Someone who took someone else there, #2 one who took someone just like me to exactly where I want to go, and #1 someone who has been there took someone else there just like me multiple times.
21:45
Do I trust somebody who's taking someone else there because I am the someone else more than someone who's only taking themselves there?
Because if someone's taking someone else there, then I could slot in and there's a likely they could do it again.
If they've only taken themselves there and not taken anyone else there, then they might not be a very good teacher, which happens all the time.
Michael Jordan has an insane record.
22:01
Playing basketball has a very poor record.
Owning a basketball team.
I'm big on give, give, give until they ask, right?
And especially if you're starting out, the best thing to do is give away stuff for free for multiple reasons.
One, because you probably suck because you haven't done it yet and it's a gift.
If someone allows you to work for them because you have a chance at providing value.
22:20
And from there you can leverage that into testimonials, referrals, and potentially even a paying customer.
They might if you continue to provide this value for free eventually say, hey, I've got too many people providing for free.
I have too much demand on my time at price of free and I can go to 20% of the price that I want to go to.
And if everyone says yes and you of demand, then you go to 40% of the price and then sixty and then a hundred and then 500%, right?
22:39
And you keep going.
But what happens is a lot of people will shortchange that.
And so I get DMS every day of people saying, hey, I want to give you value in exchange for and it's just stop, don't tell me what value you want to give me and what you want to trade that value for.
And usually it's them actually massively undervaluing my time, as though them making it free to me is somehow more valuable than me paying for something.
23:01
Like I have tons of money, I don't have tons of time, and so it's my much scarcer resource.
This kid was like, yeah, I have a lot of advice that I think I can give you on social media.
And I click over his profile, he's got 100 followers and he said I'll do it in exchange for a testimonial.
And it was just like, it was so blind reality.
First off, you have no evidence that you're good.
23:18
Second off, it's delusion.
And so the way to do it right is to go above and beyond, do a ton of work, and then just give it to the person not in exchange for or an expectation of, but just give it to that person and then guess it'll happen nothing.
Because most times if someone's way ahead of you, they might not want it or might not need it.
But you make your best approximate guess of what they might need.
23:35
Do your best shot at it.
There's probably three things that can happen.
One, most likely nothing happens.
They don't respond to you.
They don't care.
The second option is that they see how hard you worked on something.
And even though they don't need that thing, everyone one level up needs people who work hard on things.
And then so you still prove how hard you work by how good the thing that you give is.
23:52
And so they might have an opportunity for you, not even in the main thing, but on something else.
And then the third and probably the least likely but probably the one you want the most, is that they say, wow, that's amazing.
I would love for you to do that.
Now to be fair, most of the people on my team came from doing that.
You roll the dice and people roll the dice one time with their time and say, I did this work for this one guy and he didn't immediately hire me on retainer, but did you do it for 100 people?
24:15
If you give tremendous value to 100 people, you'll be able to make more income than most jobs in America.
Simple by providing A tremendous amount of value to 100 business owners.
One of them or five of them will respond back and say, yes, I would like more work from you or I can offer you a job.
I was afraid to charge people money, but I did want them to, like, be invested.
24:33
And so I started a nonprofit called the Free Training Project, where I said if they donated $502,000 to the charity of their choice, I would train them for 12 weeks.
That's how I got my first customers.
But then after the 12 weeks, some of them were like, I still want to keep training with you.
And I was like, hey, I'm the charity now.
I am poor.
Please help me.
That's literally at literally the other 12 weeks, I was like, I think I want to do this full time because I did it while I still have my job.
24:51
And then I was like, I think I want to do this full time.
I hope you guys are OK with this.
I like if you could pay me instead.
I just kind of like it.
Everyone did.

How the ultra rich get rich and avoid taxes legally.
And if you don't know who I am, my name is Alex Mosey.
I got my first $100 million by age 32 and I did that by taking $42 million in distributions from my first big company gym launch and I ended up selling that company for 46.2 million.
0:18
I reinvested that 42 ish million in distributions into a portfolio of companies that's a day at acquisition.com which is over $200 million a year.
And so that's my evidence to why I have something worth saying about this.
Now that being said, I'm going to split this video into two parts.
0:33
One is the four strategies that the ultra rich use in order to get wealthy.
And then the second-half, I'm going to explain how you can use those same 4 strategies to reverse engineer a $10 million goal.
And the reason I use $10 million as the net worth goal is because $10 million at four, 5% per year, which would be basically a risk free investment strategy.
0:53
You'd be able to live like the top 1% in today's market.
So you could move these dollars up as dollars get inflated and all of that kind of stuff.
But for now, these are the BIG4 strategies.
And so these developed over time as my understanding of money improved.
And so for me, I now want to make a billion dollars or at least be worth a billion dollars.
1:15
Ha ha, lots of zeros.
OK, so the first version of this that I thought in order for me to be worth a billion dollars was to make 1.5 billion dollars.
I know a lot of zeros in income, all right?
1:34
Because after taxes, which would be 67% taxes in the US, which is the highest federal tax rate that you can that you have to pay, you'd be left with 1 billion dollars overall post tax.
OK, that's the zero leverage version of making money.
1:50
So this is just income generation, all right?
V2 of this is thinking, OK, well, if I make a billion dollars or I make income every year, I'm going to invest a certain percentage of that income into making money for me passively.
2:05
And so this feels harder than making $100 million per year and reinvesting that money at 9%.
So the clear point here is I'm just saying this is just the S&P, this is just the market, This isn't doing anything fancy.
2:21
You're just buying indexes of the S&P 500 now at $100 million a year.
In 10 years you would make $1 billion.
Now that's because this post taxes, you'd have 600 and sorry, $67 million post tax income that you then invest at that same 9%, which would get you your billion dollars after a decade.
2:47
And you're like, OK, well, making $100 million a year in income versus making $1.5 billion in income over however long period of time, this feels a little easier because now I'm giving two things.
I'm generating income plus I'm using public equities.
3:03
All right.
So I'm, I'm using passive investment strategies for things that are ready available to the public for everyone.
The V3 version of this, it gets spicier and spicier every time.
Is that you do you make $100 million per year and you own the asset, you own the business that makes this much money and you sell it at call it 12X.
3:27
When I say 12X means 12 times earnings, which a company of this size, it'd probably be fair that it would get that kind of multiple because it's so big, which means that you would make 1.2 billion, which would leave you post tax with around $1 billion.
Now, what people don't talk about this as a total side note and as somebody who sold multiple companies is that everyone has this big dream to sell the company and get the check.
3:49
But what they don't tell you is that you then have a check and then you have to do something with the check.
So now you have to translate that check back into equities.
So you just sold equities and you get money and then you have to buy equities yet again.
And so then you have to think to yourself, am I going to get a better return on this billion dollars than I do within the existing business or asset that I ended up selling?
4:07
And I'm going to translate these zeros down to the $10 million goal that we're talking about in a second.
But I just like to show it looks like it's scale so that this can just so you can see how the big ultra rich stuff actually happens in the real world.
Now this is the the V3 version.
This is income.
4:23
So that's the skill plus private equity.
All right, so this is public equity.
This is private equity, right?
So a little bit different.
This business isn't available on the market.
There is institutional buyers who raise funds and then they will give you a check for the business.
That's V3 of this.
4:40
Now V4 of this is very sexy and has three different sub strategies.
All right.
And so in this instance, you have your business that makes $100 million per year.
And so you choose one of three paths, path one.
4:56
So we'll go A will go B and we'll go C.
So at the top level you can do something called an ESOP.
And ESOP is an employee stock ownership plan where you sell between 33 and 49%.
Mind you, this is a minority stake in your business.
5:13
And a bank will finance your employees backstopping that debt with the equity that you sell them.
Employees get the equity here, bank is here, and then there's you.
And so the bank gives you money and lends it to the employees to pay you using the stock that you gave them as collateral.
5:33
Now, what's interesting about this, at least in the United States, and I'm sure there's different functions like this internationally, is that this payment, at least in our tax laws, is tax free.
And so you get a smaller multiple because banks will always payless because they have to think about risk and not upside.
Then potentially a private equity buyer would, but this is tax free to the owner, which is pretty sweet.
5:52
Now one of the other nice things here is that you still maintain control of your business because you still own majority.
And so if you do it in this way, you can help your employees get wealthy, you get a tax free check, they get to participate in the growth of the business.
And often times Esops can go well because then now you have a huge team of people who are also incentivizing growing the business and quote, act like owners, but they didn't need to come up with the money.
6:13
It's like, here's your stock.
And then they go straight to the bank and then the bank gives them the loan to pay you for the stock you gave them.
That's kind of how it works.
OK, that's version A of this.
Now, the way this works though, is that you just traded the equity and you get cash for what you gave the employees, but you still own the asset.
6:32
And so the asset is still worth what it is in the private realm.
So if you add those two things together, you still have a billion dollars, but you get the liquidity and you keep the control.
The version B of this is something called a dividend recap.
So dividend Recap is using the same bank structure that you'd have with an ESOP, except you just cut the employees out of it.
6:52
You just go directly to the bank and say, hey, how much will you loan me using my entire business as collateral?
Now, if you think, huh, that's weird, think about it like buying a house.
If you buy a house, you go to the bank, you put X percent down and they give you debt for the rest of it, and then you pay that debt off.
And so the business actually works the same way.
7:08
So if you have no debt on the business or even if you do have debt on the business, you go and say, hey, we can reliably produce this much income.
And so we could pay off this level of debt.
And so then a bank would say, OK, well, we'll give you 4 times or five times your total EBITDA or your earnings for the year roughly, and we'll give you that as debt.
7:25
So if I make $100 million a year, they might give me a $500 million loan that they know that my business will be able to pay the interest off on, which for them makes sense because they're just getting paid to give money that they that they loaned out, right?
And then you have terms associated with that debt right?
Now, if your business is growing, then it makes a ton of sense to do that.
7:42
You do risk a little bit as an owner.
And the key point here is that the business carries the debt, not you personally.
And so you as a person, the owner of the business gets to take the $500 million, but the business pays the debt off.
And so let's say five years later, maybe the business pays all of the debt off, you got the $500 million, and you still own the business, just like owning a house at the end of paying it off works the same way.
8:05
Kind of cool.
Now, the third version of this is one that people are a little bit more familiar with, which we kind of used earlier, which is public equities, meaning you go public with the company that you have.
And so now when you go public, you only have to sell a small percentage of shares in order to make them available to the public.
8:23
And by doing that, the remainder of the stock that you have starts to have an actual marketplace value.
And so the value of this, and one of this is one of the biggest benefits of going public is that you don't have to sell 33 to 49% of your shares.
You can sell 10% or 5% of your shares and then the other 95% has a market value in real time.
8:44
And so then you can still go to those same institutions, banks, etcetera and say, hey, I want you to loan me.
And The thing is this here you can do a piece meal.
You don't have to go through a six month process or 12 month process to get one specific amount.
You can say, hey, lend me 5 million today, lend me 20 million tomorrow, lend me, you know, 100 million on this other day.
9:02
And you can do that process in 24 hours because you have equities that are publicly available, which they can collateralize, meaning they can then take that if for whatever reason, you don't sell.
And so most of the times banks will loan up to 50% of the value of the stock that you have.
9:20
And so if I have a billion dollars in stock, I can get a loan up to fifty $500 million.
And so this is exactly what Elon did when he went to go to go buy to buy X.
He just took a loan out of his wallet and then just bought it in cash.
Kind of cool, right?
And so the idea here is that these are three different ways that you can use and you're like, OK, well then what's the meta strategy for V4?
9:42
V4 is you have an income producing thing, plus you understand debt because all three of these strategies use a bank or an institution to front the capital.
And the main thing with all three of these is that you actually retain ownership and control.
And so as my understanding of money and markets improved, I started to understand different ways that I could achieve my billion dollar goal.
10:03
Now, if you're like, OK, Alex, that sounds great, but you said there was something about the ultra rich and avoiding taxes.
Well, let's talk about the taxes and let's translate it to the $10 million goal.
OK, So here, this is tax free, pretty nice with the ESOP thing, the dividend recap also the this isn't tax free because you have to take it as a, as a, as a payment, right?
10:25
So that one you still have to pay taxes on here.
It's tax free because it's a loan against your public equities.
Part of me feels like dividend recap might be tax free, Not sure on this, but the public equities, absolutely the loans that you take against them are tax free because they're loans and you pay interest on them and then you have to pay loans back.
10:42
And that's the big thing.
And there's a big, you know, I'd say a little bit of a misconception on this.
It's like, oh, these rich people, they should be paying taxes on, on unrealized gains.
Well, until someone gets money for something, I think that it's like having someone pay income tax on a paycheck they haven't gotten yet.
I feel like that's a little bit ridiculous.
On the other hand, with the public equities piece, you still have covenants that you have to be responsible for to whoever gives you the money.
11:08
And so it's not like you get the money and you can do whatever you want with it.
You have to pay it back.
That's how loans work.
Now, the only way that this works long term is that your business continues to grow.
If the business goes down, then you're in deep shit, so you can lose it all.
And so there's risk that's not being appropriately valued when people say, oh, these rich people just take loans off their stuff.
11:26
But this is fundamentally how you can do it and get liquidity or cash from something that you own that's valuable.
OK, Now, if you're like, all right, Alex, that sounds fantastic, but I'm not trying to make a billion dollars right now.
I'm trying to get to $10 million over the span of my life, ideally as fast as possible in net worth.
11:45
And the reason I use $10 million is that because at 5%, you can make about 500,000 a year, at least in the US, which would be about the top 1% in terms of earnings.
Pretty sweet.
Now, as a side note, this you also payless taxes on.
So this is usually going to be something called qualified dividends, meaning you only pay 20% on this rather than paying income tax.
12:06
So you actually get more for your money when it's off of passive distributions.
OK, cool.
So if we're using these four strategies here, V1 of this is just the pure income method, which means that over the span of your life, you're going to need to make $15 million in income, and then after your 67% tax rate, you'll be left with 10 million bucks.
12:27
OK, that's V1.
Not a lot of leverage, but you can do it that way.
The V2 version of this is that you make your $1 million per year, per year, oops, there we go, $1 million per year and you make and you still pay your taxes on that, but you invest that post tax at 9% and then after 10 years you have $10 million.
12:55
So a total interesting side note on this is that with 10 years then at 9%, and given that the tax rate that exists in the US is that on a 10 year time horizon, you can measure how good someone is at investing their money based on what their value of their portfolio is 10 years later relative to what their income would have been untaxed.
13:14
And so if I made $1,000,000 a year, in 10 years I should have $10 million if I paid 0 taxes.
But since I pay 37% taxes or anybody who would make this would pay 37% taxes, then every year they're actually making $670,000.
And so if you invested that 670 at at 9%, then you'd make at the end of that period $10 million.
13:34
So you'd actually be back where you started because you had to invest to make up the difference in taxes.
And obviously the first year of that 10 is significantly more valuable because of compounding than the last year of that 10.
I'm keeping this simple and not getting into living expenses and things like that, which obviously would complicate this.
13:50
OK, so that is income, Income plus passive investing income plus active investing.
So V3 of this is that you make $1.2 million per year from an asset, meaning you own a business that let's say it does $10 million in revenue and it does $1.2 million in distributions or owner earnings.
14:14
All right, And let's say that you can sell this thing at 10X all right, so less than the company over here.
But the only way you'd be able to sell a company at this value, which you can at this size reasonably, you know, if it's a business that truly is an asset.
So right now there's HVAC companies that are selling at 10-12 fourteen X, there's dental offices, there's accounting firms.
14:33
So these are real businesses that can be sold if you're in the right market.
Again, I'm going to use simple illustrations here.
So this would then give us $12 million that you would get pre tax and then you pay your capital gains taxes that you'd have to pay within the US, which would leave you with 10 million bucks.
14:50
Now again, same as before, OK, I had this thing that was passively making me $1.2 million a year, $100,000 a month.
Well, what am I going to buy with my $10 million that's going to replace this thing?
Sometimes thinking the second step ahead can influence whether or not you want to sell this overall, but I do like to make the point.
15:08
So this one is income plus our active or private equity.
So we have public here, we have private here and then V4 is going to look a little bit different because we have this $10 million goal.
And so I want to tell you a different strategy that think is wildly underrated, which is you can go and become an employee at a company or a partner, depending on how you want to see this of a company that then goes public for a billion dollars that you own 1% of and that you earned over five years.
15:43
And what's cool about this particular path is that you get all the benefits of this path over here is that you can take loans against the stocks that you have that are worth 1%.
And you too can live like the ultra rich and take those those loans tax free.
Now, you can't do an ESOP because you're you're not the owner of the business.
15:59
But you can do, in my opinion, the most attractive of the three of these things, which is that you can have in real time access to liquidity or cash to buy the things that you need based on the value of the asset you have.
And so let's say that you you start working in a business, they say we'll give you .2% per year times five years.
16:15
And you do the five years and the over that time period the company goes public for a billion dollars, 1 billion.
Well, you get the idea.
Then your stock is worth $10 million.
But here's the nice part is that you paid probably a very, very, very gracious tax amount to get this or these options associated with the shares.
16:37
And then you have something that is worth $10 million that you can then take loans against.
All right, So these are the four strategies from the ultra rich translated into normal income goals.
Now I want to zoom out for a second because I think this will be helpful for everyone.
No matter which of these paths you choose or the versions of the path that you want, you'll notice some common themes.
16:56
The first one is that you have to be valuable.
Like you have to learn how to provide value in the marketplace, either as an employee or as a small business owner or as a larger business owner overall.
But either way, you have to learn how to generate income.
And the way you generate income is by solving problems for other people and learning skills.
17:12
And so a lot of time I see dedicated to content from people who don't talk about the most important thing, which is sure, you can have all these passive investment strategies, but if you're working off of $35,000 a year, it's never going to happen.
Like we like to talk about the one lady who works at McDonald's for 50 years and saved every penny she ever had, so she can end up with $1,000,000.
17:34
But is that really the ideal strategy when maybe taking a weekend and getting a certification can bump you to 50 or $60,000 a year?
Or you just learn outbound sales and you bump yourself to $150,000 a year, five times the earning potential.
And so I think that the investing stuff gets really sexy because it feels passive.
17:51
But you live your whole life, and so you might as well get 5 * 10 times more for the time you are guaranteed to have to give.
We all spend seconds every second we're alive.
And so you might as well get more for them.
The second one is what I want to talk about is the fallacy or the three fallacies of Warren Buffett.
So Warren Buffett, a lot of people are like, I just want to do what Warren Buffett did.
18:09
He just slowly invested, right?
Well, let me walk you through what the fallacies of Warren Buffett are.
So 3 fallacies of Warren Buffett #1 I'm going to be just like him.
18:27
Well, did you buy your first stock at age 7?
And did you do that weeks after Pearl Harbor when there was literal blood in the streets?
Well, if you didn't buy your first stock at age 7, literal weeks after Pearl Harbor, then maybe you don't already have the makeup of somebody who's going to be the greatest investor of all time.
18:52
Something to consider.
The 2nd is, are you going to live through the greatest growth in American history as you start your investing career, which is exactly what Warren Buffett was able to do.
And the third one is one that I actually talk about that I don't hear talked about a lot, which is just luck.
19:13
And so let me hear me out.
I think Warren is brilliant and I talk about him all the time and I think there's a lot of things we can learn from him.
But what I see when I look at the top .1%, whatever the top of the top of the top of the top is that you have all the skills, all the traits, all the everything, comma and luck.
19:32
Because the only way, like if you were to think the hypothetical, the, the number one person on Earth in general would have all of the things plus luck, because some everyone's going, there is luck that goes around.
And so the number one person's going to have everything that's required plus luck.
19:47
There's plenty of investors that are brilliant investors that are worth $1 billion instead of $100 billion.
They just didn't get the luck part right or they've been only investing for 30 years instead of 70, right?
Or 75 or 85 or whatever the amount of years he's alive now.
All right.
And so I think these three things are some are things that are not considered when people are like, oh, I want to do the strategy and I want to highlight this because the main theme of all of these is that you have to generate income.
20:12
You have to make money.
It's the only way you can even have.
The income, so like right now I have a handful of investments that are doing exceptionally well, but the only reason that I would be able to make those investments is because I have excess capacity in terms of cash capital that I could deploy.
If you don't.
And this is where like living below your means to make more so you have the delta so you can kind of you can get aggressive is so important.
20:32
And I think it's really lost in the narrative today.
And so the last thing I want to talk about is what rich parents give as the greatest gift to their kids.
And so the number predictor of success long term is the zip code you're born in, All right?
And I find that really interesting and also disparaging in some ways because it means that it controls for IQ, it controls for ethnicity, controls for gender.
20:52
It's the zip code that you're born in.
And I see that as mostly due to the associations of other people in that zip code.
And so it's like, OK, that means that conditions can create our behavior or shape our behavior.
So then what behavior changes happen in a rich environment versus a poor environment?
21:08
And I think that it can really come down to one main thing, which is the leverage of the opportunity vehicles that you pursue.
And so I remember this clear as day because I, I came from what I would consider upper middle class.
So my dad's a doctor, But when I went to Vanderbilt, I was exposed to an entirely different level of wealth that I didn't even really knew existed.
21:27
I'm from Baltimore.
There just wasn't any like New York money.
Like it wasn't really a thing like if like it just, it was a concept I didn't understand.
But for them, the opportunity vehicle that they wanted their kids to pursue had leverage, meaning they got more for what they put in.
21:45
And so a middle class parent might say, hey, you're a salesman, awesome.
And you sell cars.
OK, well you sell cars and cars cost whatever.
And the top, top, top cars salesman might make, you know, 300 to 400,000 a year.
22:03
OK, now some people are like there's this one guy, cool, well good for him.
But for most like let's call it top 1% or making three to $400,000 a year.
Now the upper class salesman or the upper class or the ultra rich, whatever you want to call it, ultra salesman sells companies.
22:21
And guess what, he makes 4% on the deal.
And so if he sells a $200 million company, he makes 8,000,000 bucks for one sale.
And so same fundamental skills, obviously do a little more analysis here, but fundamentally you are selling stuff and all somebody who is wealthier does is tries to get more for what they put in.
22:42
They try and add zeros to the price tag of the things they sell.
If you sell a $500 million building, you get a Commission for that, just like you get for selling a $50,000 house.
Same concept, you just add scale to it.
And every one of these people has the same number of hours per day, which just means they get more for their time.
23:00
And so thinking through this, what poor people or middle class people miss that rich people or rich kids, rich parents pass to their kids is which opportunities to say no to, they don't even consider the equal lower class or middle class opportunity.
23:19
And I think of this on something that I like to refer to as measuring sticks.
And so I'll give you a little story to illustrate the point.
So when I was a kid in high school, I worked, I started my first job when I was 15 to 9 months, which is like the legal age that I could start working.
I started working as a blender tender at Smoothie King and as I as I levelled up and became a, a lead and then I think a manager at some point.
23:42
And then eventually I shifted to catering, which I got 25 bucks an hour for, which is awesome back in my day.
Anyways, I was hood rich.
And The thing is, is that I measured how much money I had and how many Chipotle burritos I could buy because I knew that Chipotle burritos were about 7 bucks.
23:58
And so I was like, man, I just got, you know, 200 bucks for this shift.
That's like 28 burritos that I can buy now, which is awesome, right?
I was super excited about it.
And So what happens is the measuring stick that you use to measure stuff, The wealthiest people in the world just have a larger stick in two ways.
24:15
One is they measure over longer time horizons.
And they also use like they literally called, by the way, in Wall Street, a stick is $1 million.
So that's the slang among rich people.
Like if you're like, oh, I didn't know that there was slang for $1,000,000, there is slang for $1,000,000.
24:31
When you have lots of millions of dollars, you say give him two sticks.
It means 2,000,000 bucks.
And so when you hang around people who talk in increments of $1 million, imagine the opportunities that they're pursuing.
And more importantly for everybody who's listening to this, the many things they say no to.
24:47
And so this is where you lose years and decades of life is that you say yes to opportunities that you otherwise shouldn't.
And so they're able to be patient or more selective because they know that they're going to get, they want to maximize how many dollars they get out for the effort and time they put in.
And unless something is going to ladder up to remember thinking longer time horizons, something where they can get sticks for their time, then they're not going to do it.
25:10
They're willing to take a job for 50 or $60,000 a year or $80,000 a year as an analyst at, you know, PwC, Orson Young or McKinsey or an investment bank at Goldman Sachs.
They're willing to eat dog shit for that period of time because they know that that's not the plan.
25:26
This is just the period that they're learning and gaining experience so that they can do the next thing.
They see it in stepping stones.
And the vast majority, in my opinion, of people who stay stuck don't have a plan.
They don't see where things ladder up to and they don't reverse their goal into the present.
And so no matter what, whichever of these paths you use, one, you have to focus on income generation and learning skills.
25:48
Two, you want to make sure that you actually say no to the things that don't matter and be very selective about the things that will give you the highest return. 3 surround yourself with people who have bigger measuring sticks in terms of time and money than you, because whatever opportunities they're discussing will likely be higher leverage in the opportunities that you're considering.
26:07
And then finally in with regards to the fallacy of of Warren Buffett, if you want to make obscene amounts of money, you will not make it the way that someone else has already made it.
It will be made in a new way.
Which means the single greatest and most valuable skill that a human being can have is the ability to come to their own conclusion and have the confidence to act on it despite it being contrary to what other people are doing.
26:33
Because if it's what everyone else is doing, then it's not an opportunity.
Because The funny thing about opportunity is, is they look like risk while they're opportunities.
And the moment they're no longer risky is when the opportunity has closed.
And that's how life works.
You have to make bets.
And you want to make the bets that you feel like you have an information advantage over other people so that you can come to your own conclusion rather than listen to other people.
26:54
Have an amazing day.
Hope you enjoyed the stuff.
That's how it all turns to it.
And if you like these kind of deeper business concepts, I have two, two free gifts for you.
I wrote $100 million offers and $100 million leads.
These are both available for free on my podcast, which is the game Alex Romosi.
You can just search my name.
You'll probably find it.
I also have these in course.
27:10
If you like watching rather than listening on my site at acquisition.com, you can just click training and you'll see the courses that we have available.
They're all free, but if you do like something hard, you can grab these wherever you buy books and hopefully make a lot more money.

What makes it that some people succeed with programs, with education, with customers, with vendors?
Why do some people win and others don't?
I break down the five levels of competence as I see it and how it can apply to different domains in your business and how it can use that framework to level yourself up and get your customers more successful, get your employees more successful, and make yourself more successful.
0:19
And breakdown the reasons that the business might not be growing, that you're identifying with yourself as the reason that you're not winning rather than the reason you have to win.
I had someone say this recently to me.
They're like, you know, how do you know what programs to buy?
0:35
How do you know what workshops to go to?
How do you know what courses to listen to or what channels to watch in order to learn, right?
And they're like, how do you know that it's going to work?
And I think that's the question that always gets asked is like, how do you know it's going to work?
And I think that fundamentally asking that question shows that it won't work because it is never going to be the thing that works.
0:59
You are going to be the thing that makes it work.
And so when I look back at my history as a student of and continue to be a student, but a student of the game of business, the I have yet to have a negative ROI on any purchase that I've made, whether it's tutoring courses, workshops.
1:17
And to be fair, I've bought from, from, from bad people I've brought from some scumbags I've brought from bad teachers, but I have absolutely ROI D every single purchase that I've made.
And so whenever I hear someone say, like, I bought something in it and it didn't work, it kind of grinds my gears.
1:33
And I think I've had it and heard it enough times in the last month or so that I wanted to make this podcast about it.
And so this is, this is what I want to kind of zoom out on is that I want to give you a top down approach in terms of levels of competence and then bottom up approach from a skills perspective.
And I think if you combine both of these things together, you will make a lot more money and you will be more successful at the things that you try to learn.
1:55
And so if you're like trying to learn how to make TikTok ads to start a second, you know, acquisition channel for your business, then this would apply to you.
If you're if you're a customer of an agency, then this will apply to you.
If you're trying to be a student and just get in the game, then this will apply to you.
And so the first thing is understanding the levels of competence.
2:12
And so at the top, the best and the highest level of competence is something that I will call positive active, All right, So you've got, you've got the inclination and you've got active or passive.
And so there's 5 levels, all right.
So the top is and, and, and the characteristics of somebody who has this belief set is that no one has proven that it cannot be done.
2:33
And they ask other people to prove to them why they can't do it.
And they think I will be the best student that this person has ever had.
No matter what, no matter how incompetent of a teacher they are, I will make it happen.
I will win because that's who I am, not who they are.
2:52
Basically, the idea that we make our success dependent on the quality of the teacher puts the power in their hands rather than ours.
And so on the flip side of this, the reason that basically any single program in the world will still be able to get positive reviews of some sort is that no matter what, some percentage of real winners will always go into everything.
3:11
You just look at the public school system, like more or less a dog shit system, but there are still winners that come out of it.
And it's not because the quality of the teachers is because of the mindset of winners, because winners will win.
And so the highest level of this is an example of like Elon where he's like, break it down to physics.
3:27
He's like, if you can't show me that it's physically impossible based on the laws of physics that we know that it is possible and I'm going to go do it.
It's the same concept as Rod Rodger Bannister running the 1st 4 minute mile like no one had done it before.
And he's like, well physically it's not impossible.
It's not breaking the laws of physics for me to run a 4 minute mile.
3:45
And so that is positive active.
Now, underneath of that, you've got the second class of competence, which I would consider positive, passive.
This is all the people who ran the four minute mile after Roger Bannister.
They're the people who say, OK, he did it, so I can do it.
4:01
And to be clear, this is still good.
There's still winners absolutely that can do that.
And when I look at the people that I've worked with, customers, employees, anything I can identify and these are honestly, these are your these are your A minus players.
Like they're like, OK, he did it, I can do it.
4:17
And honestly, that's a great perspective.
Like it's not impossible.
I just need to do the same stuff they did.
And that's awesome.
That's the that's the replicate before you iterate.
They're like, I'm going to just do what they did and get what they got.
And that's an awesome perspective.
Now there's three more levels of this.
And as we go down, some of you will start nodding your heads as either like you are this person or you know someone who's this person.
4:38
The third level of competence here is what I'll call neutral passive.
And so this is somebody who just says, well, it's worked for other people.
Let's see if it works for me so it no longer goes from.
I will like prove to me why I can't make it work.
Level one.
4:54
Level two, OK, someone has made it work, therefore I can make it work.
Two, let's see if it works.
You're passively accepting whatever happenings and you're just open.
Now.
This is where the majority of people are.
This is where most people just sit.
They just live their life passively letting things quote happen to them.
5:12
And they're sometimes mediocre customers for, for for an agency or a vendor.
They're mediocre customers for you.
This is the person who goes into the gym and it's like, we'll see if your program works for me.
Like I'm, you know, we'll see if it works.
Now underneath of that, you've got level 4.
5:29
All right, this now we're going down.
This is it might work for other people, but it probably won't work for me.
This is negative passive.
So they're still in the passive see, but they're negatively inclined.
This is the person who half asses and I'll give you a story about this that happened recently.
So we had a business owner who came out.
5:47
I was just a salon owner.
OK, so a salon hair salon owner.
And the guy said, hey, I used your gift card campaign and it didn't work.
And I was like, all right, bro.
Like, so I just went through it.
I was like, did you get a referral from all the people?
6:04
Did you write the name down of he's like, well, I didn't do, I mean, I asked them and I told them that they had to use the card on other people, but they came back in trying to use the card for themselves.
I was like, well, that's not the play.
He was like, well, I told them that.
And I was like, well, obviously you didn't tell them well enough because that's not the play.
6:22
So, and The thing is, is I, I just, let's just stop.
I was like, do you want me to take accountability for the fact that the gift card play has worked for so many businesses and just not yours?
I was like, do you want me to just say it's my fault?
I was like, would that make you feel better?
And he was like, well, no, I was like, that's what you're coming for.
6:38
You want me to say that it's my fault?
I was like, you didn't do it.
You didn't do it right?
So you just did something else.
And yeah, that something else didn't work 'cause that's not what the program is.
That's not how the gift card play works.
If you don't know, I'm talking about, it's on my YouTube video.
6:54
It's a whole play.
And so eventually it got him to be like, OK, I just didn't do it.
I was like, cool, guess what?
Now you can do it again and you can do it right, 'cause you know what?
You messed up.
You had to let him know it's for somebody else and you had to get the referral and you had to get the three-way introduction.
Otherwise they're going to try and use it on themselves, not bring you people in and you're just giving away services for a discount.
7:11
That sucks.
Don't want to do that.
He's like, OK, fine.
And so we had a little moment and he got over it OK, but that's negative passive.
That's like, it might work, but it probably won't work for me.
And by the theme of this podcast, if you want to be the best student ever out of all of Mozi Nation, I have two books.
7:29
They actually audio books that are for free that I have here on this podcast starting at 579.
It's my $100 million offers and $100 million leads.
They have sold over 1,000,000 copies, 26,005 star reviews on Amazon if you like hard copies.
But if you actually follow the steps, I've got courses on the site that are also free, acquisition.com/training.
7:45
If you just follow the steps, prove why it will work for you and it will.
Now here's the fifth level.
This is the bottom of the barrel, all right.
This is the this is your one star customers.
This is this is this is the customer you sign on who just generally sucks at everything and they take an active role.
8:04
All right, so this is negative active.
I can prove that this will work for everyone but me.
I have bad luck.
Nothing works out for me in the end.
I am the special snowflake that nothing works for my my body is different.
Calories don't affect me.
8:20
I could starve to death and I am immune to death because I could not eat for years and my body would still hold on to fat because I am special.
And so what's interesting about this is some of you guys may be laughing about this right now, but some of you are this person.
But you just might not be this person in business.
8:37
You might be this person with your weight, but you're not this way in business.
You might be this way in your marriage, but you're not that way in business or you are that way in business and you're not in your marriage.
You're like, I'm a, but you know what?
Oh, this, this way of communicating.
It's not going to work for us, not in our relationship, but I'll prove it.
8:54
I'll, I'll go to your fucking sessions.
I'll follow your little framework for communicating with my wife or my husband.
Then I'll prove to you that it won't work because we're so special that nothing works for us.
You want to prove it?
And what's interesting about this is that it because it underpins a whole set of beliefs behind this that your identity is attached to.
9:14
So it's so much harder to say, listen, I've been fat my whole life and, and, and it's my fault.
It's so much easier to just not have it be that way.
It's so much easier to be like, you know, I've always struggled with, with women or our, our, you know, our marriage has kind of been on the rock, but that's kind of how it's always been that way, right?
9:32
And so we, it's so much more difficult to accept that all of that pain and suffering that you've been through is 100% your fault.
And so instead, it's easier to just try and actively prove that it won't work.
Now, there's some good, there's some interesting stuff about #5 so I actually find #5 people very, very interesting because they, in my opinion, have the highest potential to jump from 5 all the way to one.
9:55
And I've had so many experiences in my life.
This is the one star becomes the five star.
This is the, the person that all of a sudden like something switches.
And The thing is, they go from negative active.
They have the active, they're trying to prove it, but they're proven the wrong thing.
They're trying to prove it wrong, but all of a sudden, sometimes if you can get it to swap, they just try to prove it right and then they become absolute fucking animals.
10:16
And so I'll tell you a story.
So there was a gym owner at gym lunch and he was, he was definitely one of these number fives, right?
He was like, it's not like my gym's in a different market.
The people, the people here are different.
My weight loss leads are different than everyone else's weight loss leads.
10:32
My market's different, my zip code's different.
The corner that my gym is on is different.
But all of a sudden he'd been on enough calls and I probably ranted at him or something on some, on some, on some live call and he was like, you basically just called me a pussy.
10:50
And I was like, yeah, probably 11 way or another.
And so he said, I just decided, what if, what if it did work?
And what if I took the same energy that I'm that I'm doing to try and prove myself right and try and prove this system works.
11:06
And what if I just did everything as though I as though it was going to work.
And I assumed it was going to work.
And so he did that and he ended up becoming one of the top facilities out of the thousands that we had.
And then we ended up hiring him because he completely outsourced his gym, made it profitable, made it make more money using the setup that we had.
11:25
And the interesting part here, and this is what's crazy, same system, same gift card play, same advertising, same gym model, different approach, different level of competence showed up and execute in an entirely different way.
I'll give you a different example.
11:41
I had a lady, this is one of my first probably 50 customers at my gym.
Her name was Autumn.
So Autumn came in and she had the nothing works for me.
I have a special thyroid, you know, whatever, you know, if calories, I could starve myself forever and I'd still live.
I defy the laws of physics and, and after like 2-3, four weeks, all the people that she had started with started losing weight.
12:05
And of course, now normally in that level 5, she'd be like, well, that's of course, of course.
That's why because I'm different than them.
I'm special.
I get my identity from being special and I just was like, listen, I was like, do you want to be right and fat or do you want to or do you want to?
Do you want to get skinny?
12:20
I was like, which one matters more to you being right or being thin?
I was like, I just had AI had to have a sits on with her and I was like, just be real.
But if being right is more important to you, I was like, then then you can be right.
I was like, but which one's more important to you being right, being thin?
And she was like, I want to be thin and I was like, then fucking do this.
12:39
And so she did.
And of course she lost a bunch of weight and then she became one of my top clients.
And then she started referring everyone.
And The thing is, is that when you see a level 5 turn into a level one, you're like, Oh my God.
And The thing is, they become absolute ambassadors, brand champions for you because you help them get over that.
12:55
And so I say this from a business owner perspective because don't lose hope on those people.
Sometimes you just have to say, do you want to be right?
Or do you want this outcome?
I'm cool either way, but you're the one who has to live with it.
And so she decided that she wanted to be thin, which is awesome.
13:14
And so it's kind of one of those.
It's kind of like, it's interesting that in like neat.
So Matrix and Star Wars probably 2, two of my favorite kind of universes of, of, of movies.
But like Morpheus and Yoda sit in very similar positions in terms of the guide for the, for the main character.
13:29
And so there's a, there's a point in the Dojo where Morpheus looks at Neo and he says, stop trying to hit me and hit me.
And so the, the point there is that when you it's basically the difference between going through the motions, acting as if versus actually trying to, to succeed.
13:47
There's trying to do the things that looks like success versus actually trying to win.
So replace, stop trying to hit me and hit me with stop trying to win and win.
Stop trying to make ads work and make ads work.
Stop trying to hire the sales guy and hire the sales guy, right.
And so that's the idea that like a no fail situation where there there's absolutely somebody, this is like the the founder who says no one can sell.
14:09
Like I can sell.
Yeah, no shit.
There's people who sell way better than you, right?
You just haven't found them yet.
OK, That means that it's possible.
So what are you complaining about?
You just need to go do more.
Stop trying to make your marketing work and make your marketing work.
Stop trying to prove yourself right, that you're special and win.
14:27
It's the same reason that Yoda says there is no try.
There's only fail or do and not do.
And so it's the same concept because the reason that try is such an insidious concept is because it allows the possibility of failure.
It basically says that there is a way that this won't work.
14:47
But if you fundamentally believe that if like even at level 2, if someone else can do it, so can I, then there is zero possibility of failure because if they can do it, I will do it.
And obviously the level above that is, even though no one has done it, it is not impossible and therefore I will.
15:06
And so that's the, that's the top down approach that I would approach.
I said there's two levels of this in terms of, of thinking through becoming the best student.
Is that where are you on that, on that pyramid?
Are you level one?
Are you level 2, Level 3, level 4?
And are you in different places in different domains?
15:22
Are you some way in your fitness life or some way in your marriage or spouse life or some way in your, in your business life?
And notice how you approach it differently.
And then look at the one that you're most successful 'cause you're probably going to be better, hopefully better at one of those domains than the other.
15:37
And think about the thought process you have when you approach it and use, try and think about using that set of beliefs and systems on the one that you fail at the most.
And that has been helpful for me.
Now the question that I always like to ask, because obviously been I've been in the education world and I like education a lot is why, Why do we have unequal outcomes?
15:59
Why is it that you've got 100 people who start and you've got one guy who murders it, one guy who tanks, and then you've got all these people in between?
And so the, this is the bottom up approach in terms of thinking about this is the number of skills someone has going into an education process, program, whatever predicts their success.
16:23
So let me explain.
So if you and this, this happens all the time, this is the, I went through three different things and then I did this thing and then it finally worked.
But what you didn't know is that you were building this bridge towards an outcome, and the first thing you did give you the first five bricks, and the second thing you did give you the second five bricks.
16:39
And the third thing you'd give the next 5 bricks.
And then the last thing you did just give you the one last brick you needed to finish the bridge across from where you are to wherever you wanted to go.
But The thing is that we attribute all of the success to the last brick just because it was the most recent, not because it was the most important.
16:56
It's the same thing as like, it's kind of weird in the world of like education and business education.
It's like, oh man, I I, you know, I used to think this guy was good.
Now I now I learned from this guy.
But it's like saying, yeah, my kindergarten teacher taught me a simple addition.
And then my algebra teacher, wow, he really taught me.
17:12
That guy who taught me, you know, simple addition is an idiot is like, no, he taught you what you needed to get to where you're at now because skills and education build on themselves.
And so you were able to be successful the algebra teacher because you had the simple arithmetic teacher beforehand.
17:28
And so we have this weird thing where you get to an advanced level and you think that the person who taught you the basics was somehow wrong.
They were just at a different part in your process in the stage and building the bridge.
And so the reason that's that that some people are successful and you are the last brick if you're a business owner for that particular business, is that they were able to assemble all those skills at a time.
17:50
Now, the more skills someone comes in with and also the more meta skills that someone comes in with, the more likely they are to be successful.
And the reason for that is the vaguer the instructions can be.
And so for example, someone can come to me and say, hey, Alex, can you build a nose strip company for me?
18:06
And I would say sure, because I have that skill set to build.
I have all of them, right?
Like I know how to market on how to sell, I know to get product and how to do logistics, all that stuff.
They can just say that vague of instructions that I can go do it because I had that skill right now, that stack of skills, rather the meta skills you have allow you to bridge the gap where things are vague.
18:25
And the vast majority of education basically has to meet people at some level.
Because if you truly start at 0, then it has to be like, here's how a computer works.
Here is how a phone works, here's how you use the Internet, right?
And of course, most things that you do in education aren't at that level.
They're higher up than that.
18:41
But The thing is, is that you might be a level 4 of education here, but a level one at one of the steps and then all of a sudden it quote doesn't work for you, but it's because you actually are have a remedial level of education on that step.
And that's where having the meta meta skill of like, I mean, as simple as this is like, shoot, 30% of people can't read good.
19:01
Like they're just they're not even, they're not even literate.
And so, so of course it's going to they're going to have a harder time trying to learn anything because they can't even have the ability to learn right.
And so I think about this.
And so if something has filled for you in the past, rather than blaming the thing, blaming the fact that you did not have sufficient skills to make it work.
19:23
And even in the most counter example where something's absolute, like just absolute talk shit, 'cause it does happen, right?
I think you could still learn what not to do.
Some of us had phenomenal examples of what not to do in a marriage from our parents.
Some of us had exceptional examples of how not to parent from our parents.
19:43
We've had exceptional examples of how not to boss from our bosses.
We've had exceptional examples of how not to deliver a product from a business.
And so sometimes it's using inversion, thinking of like, OK, what are all the things that made this horrible?
And then do the exact opposite of that.
20:01
And I think that that's why you can always ROI every single experience you have because there's you can always either benefit from it or benefit from the inverse of it.
And I think both like if you have, if you have such a terrible experience, you just like new and innovative ways to ruin my experience.
Wow, I didn't even know this existed.
20:18
Well, if I can do the inverse of that, then that still will give me the benefit of, of learning from this experience.
I still, they as much as they wanted to make me fail, I still got better.
Like, I still will win.
And so I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll wrap this with, with a, a scene that I like a lot from Invictus, which is a, a, a movie from 2006.
20:40
It's Morgan Freeman and, and Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman's Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon's like the head of the rugby team.
And it's right during the apartheid when it's the whole racism is that it's, you know, Max or whatever.
And, and he says, I'll, I'll read you the quote.
He says, how's your ankle?
20:56
Is it healed?
It's one of the first questions he asked him was like, I heard that your, your ankle, you know, was hurt, you know, is it healed?
He asked the the head guy and he said, the truth is, Sir, this is Matt Damon responding.
He said, the truth is, Sir, you never played 100%.
And Mandela responds as in sports, as in life.
And I like that a lot.
21:14
I remember hearing it and being like, whoa, that like, for whatever reason, it just hit me when, when, when I heard that.
Because we have so many times where we blame the conditions for the lack of success.
But the reality is that the Champions create success regardless of the conditions.
21:29
And so they don't look at the education system.
They don't look at the thing that the teacher gave.
They don't look at what the vendor provided and think, well, I'm going to prove that they were bad so that I can be right.
They just win no matter what.
And so I think it's like kind of like Tom Brady of like, OK, well, he can go to a different team and still go to the championship, still change the conditions because he forces the winning to occur.
21:53
And that's why like that is the, like, that is the quintessential thing that like if you look at your team, if you're a business owner and you're like, who on my team is a level one?
Who's level 2, who's Level 3, who's level 4, who's level 5?
Who wants to just like prove that my thing's not going to work?
22:09
Who's just like, we'll see if it works.
Who's like, I think this can work.
Other people have done it, we can do it too.
And who's like, we will be the first to do it because there's no reason we can't.
And I think it's a great way to, to measure and assess your team.
I think it's a great way for you to measure and assess yourself and apply it between different domains.
22:27
And so I think if as I think about these things for my, for myself, I think that the biggest thing that I've been fortunate with is I, I hate the idea of someone making me worse.
And I hate the idea of quote not getting better from something I invest time to money into.
22:45
And so I've always had the desire to be the number one person in anything that I ever try and learn.
And so it's like, even if this guy's mediocre, I'm going to be the best student he's ever had no matter what witch has come to bite me in the ass because every single person I've ever bought something from has claimed that they are the reason for my success.
23:02
But The thing is, is that all right, I'm just going to get real nasty with you.
I've been more successful than every one of their customers and them so like fuck you.
And so I've always taken it from the approach of replicate before you iterate.
23:20
So I don't try and get fancy.
So this is, I'm shifting gears out because I just got a little, little passionate about this.
But like I, I will do everything they said to the T to replicate what they've done.
So if I want to learn something from them, they have been able to do it and I will do exactly what they did.
23:40
And then I can get the same result.
And then once I've replicated it, then I'm like, all right, here's seven ways I can do this better than them.
And then I will iterate.
But I think one of the other issues that happens is people try to iterate before they replicate.
And The thing is, is unless you, unless you've learned to replicate, you don't know why it worked to begin with.
And so you have to retrace the steps.
23:57
You have to pick up the bread crumbs and be like, OK, that's we did this because there's that hole there.
OK, we did this because there's that problem there.
OK, got it, got it.
Now I have a good lay of the land.
Now with the other skills that I have that the person who taught me doesn't have, I will make this better.
And that's how I think you can stair step your way.
24:13
Learn from as many people as you can.
And when you learn by your from your third teacher, you can pull from your first and 2nd teacher to try and make what you learn from the third teacher better.
But The thing is, is that in any of these paths, you just have to Start learning and be willing to know that no matter what happens, as long as you execute, you will learn either what to do or what not to do.
24:31
But you learn either way.
And I think that gives you a no fail situation as a student because it means you become an inevitability.
Like I will win, whether it's with you, the next guy, the guy after that, I will win.
I will figure this out because there's no way that this is impossible.
24:49
There's no reason that Facebook ads can work for other people's businesses, not mine.
There's no reason that doing a direct mail campaign, if I can get it into the right business owners hands that I cannot find a way to monetize that.
There's no way that somebody else can be have a have a billion dollar roofing company and I have a roofing company that's only do $1,000,000 a year.
25:07
I don't need to change industries.
If they can do it, I can do it.
There's a way and I just don't know how yet.
But that's a me problem, not a universe problem.
And the thing that everyone keeps messing up about this is that they're trying to think that like they're proving the system right or they're proving their teacher right or proving the guru right.
25:27
But you're not doing any of that.
You're proving to yourself yet again that you can win no matter what.
And I think that's the big difference because some people like don't want to win because they want to prove that the teacher's bad.
It's like that's, that's like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies.
25:42
It's one of the dumbest things I can possibly imagine.
Like you want to sacrifice your outcome, your success, because you want to show that someone else is bad.
Like the best way to show that someone else is bad is to beat them and then just keep winning and move on with your life and get them to shrink into irrelevance as you grow into your potential.
26:00
I really wanted to give you a sexy outro for this podcast.
But at the end of the day, winners win and they win because of who they are, not because of what happens to them.
That's it.
See you next week.








0:00
Real quick.
Cause you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
It's going everyone, happy Thursday.
I'm just I've been a little context here, having a, my sales director.
Dylan message me was like, hey man, you made this podcast on Stewarts, what's WTF?
0:41
Jim talked, and it was about the sixth week challenge and I've had this question asked to me at two events and on that podcast and so I wanted to address it straight on and kind of give you a context for why I'm not worried and then you can either agree or disagree but that's up to you.
So if you think about like the 60 challenge, I got rights people say like well, isn't it very saturated or are like more and more people are doing it?
1:05
What does that mean for the long-term ramifications?
And so I kind of wanted to like, break that down.
So, if you look at the history of like Fitness marketing, right?
Like LA Fitness was running a free month for 35 years, right?
And they were using Direct Mail campaigns primarily because that would end and radio because that's where the media wasn't for attention was as for people are paying attention.
1:26
And so they were able to and they were also some of the only players in Space the It was a really long time.
Now if you look at the way that those media platforms work, you have to do very large media, buys for direct mail or radio over a large blanketing areas, which is why most of all players can play the other Downstream effect of that was that there wasn't a lot of testing that was able to happen.
1:46
And so once they found a play, like a direct mail play that work, they would only do like an A or B test and that would be it, right?
And so what's happened, is that, with the Advent of digital marketing, we can split test things at a much faster, Great.
And so, my argument would be that the actual offers that we have now in the creative that we have now is far more compelling, then what was created 20 years ago?
2:10
And that's just because we have far more ability to acquire information and see response on a much smaller budget and it opened up the marketplace so that smaller players could get into it.
And there are probably plenty of great advertising creative people who if they were just running for themselves, could spend 10, 20, 30 dollars a day, whereas they weren't going to bet ten.
2:29
Grandeur 20 grand on a radio Bach.
And so, the first thing is just kind of understanding where this has come from is like within like the larger history of like Fitness marketing.
The second thing is that you have to look at a Market within the context of what everything that any person is hearing.
2:47
And so, if you have Sally Johnson, right, and she's trying to lose weight, she's 38 years old and you know, make 60,000 a year, which is like the most prototypical, you know, weight loss, customer right?
Who dies 5 times, you hear.
She hears stuff cause Some of the ratios that P90X she's got, she's got Wings Watchers things that are going on, and then she has gyms all around her and all of the gyms are running different promotions L at the same time.
3:10
So it's a very busy Marketplace, no matter what you do, no matter what offer it is.
And the reality is that most times, don't even know.
Like, if you go on the street and say, hey you know what a six-week challenges.
But for like what are you talking about?
Right?
And so we because we hear it all the time and that's our world assume that everyone knows about everything that we do in our business.
3:28
And the reality is that that's just not true, right?
Right now, if you were to separate there's like there's so many more pieces to this but I'm going to try to like break it like super, you know, three main pieces, right?
You've got your traffic source and then you have your offer and then you have your conversion mechanism, okay?
3:47
The conversion mechanism is arguably, the most important, okay?
And that's what we sell at your launch and that's how our guys make so much money.
That's and it's not because they necessarily have a superior often of the offer is definitely a big piece of it but it's because the That allows them to buy traffic, which is the third pillar.
4:03
Here is superior, right?
And so, for me, I have a free case study.
That's what I give away on the front end for our for our ad stuff right now.
Right now I have already popped, I have successfully tested that on YouTube.
I've successfully tested that on AdWords, I've successfully tested on Instagram, I've successfully tested that on Facebook.
4:22
Now, I'm going to be coming out with a book in a, in the soon future, right.
I spent the last 30 days or Paige's clutching one sequence.
I think you guys will like it, but anyways, it's really good.
I'm really excited about it.
But what am I going to do?
I'll probably swap that for the front end.
4:38
I also have an info Graphics book that I finished and like I'll swap that for the front end.
The point is that the conversion mechanism of how we go appointment to a phone call to a sale is, is like that's tested.
We know how to get people to schedule, you know, how to get people to show.
And then ultimately, we get people to buy and then get great results and send their friends, right?
4:56
And so we know how much we can spend to acquire Customer from a scheduling standpoint and then all we need to do is reverse out.
Okay, what percentage of people who hit our scheduling page are going to schedule and show and then what percentage of people are going to opt in for that initial widget, right?
5:13
So right now, the case studies, as worked fine for 18, straight months, there's really no reason for me to do it besides the fact that I'm bored, which is probably something that you shouldn't do.
But I'm just breaking my own rules because I'm an idiot sometimes.
But to Circle this back to the 60 challenge, I ran the six-week challenge at my gym.
5:29
For six straight years.
Uninterrupted, six straight years rolling week, after week, after week after week.
Why?
And how could I do that?
Because I could outspend everyone, right?
It didn't matter and it's the same thing here in this gym space is that, like I'm competing against people who can't spend as much as I can, right?
5:49
And so like, people like the guys who will knock us, will say, whatever they say in like, it doesn't really affect me that much because like, I can spend four thousand dollars in email.
I just doesn't matter to me right?
Because like you let your model do the talking and if your models designed properly and you provide, you know, exceptional value and service.
6:06
Which hopefully if you're watching this, you do then people will bring their friends and bring more friends, Etc, right.
I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole so to get back to like the six-week child.
And how long will it keep working?
The offer of the six-week challenge.
Fundamentally is something that most people like as of right now, it's the offer that converts best.
6:23
It's converted the best for the last six years.
There may be another offer that we will find that does better.
For the time being, it's the best one here.
It's the one that gets the most clicks and it also worked with the conversion mechanism that we have on the back end.
Ryan care is at one point was spending like $35 Elite and still getting 12:45 back who can compete with them on that he could spend up to $250 a lead.
6:48
To break even on the acquisition.
And he still has the EFT and the back end.
So for everyone who's run lbos their whole life, that's what an lbo is supposed to do.
Is you break it, I mean, they don't, but, like you're supposed to the usually lose money in that position, then they make their money back on the back end right now.
7:03
If you can still like all this is is just a way better way.
And this is why it's the new way of doing business, right?
Like business Landscapes evolve like better players and better ways of doing business come up.
This is a better way of doing business.
That is why Uber took over?
Over taxi companies.
That's why Netflix beat out Blockbuster, who's a better model, right?
7:21
This is a better model of acquiring customers.
The fact that it's a six-week challenge is irrelevant.
It's just the widget, it's just the front end.
It's the thing that gets the click and the beauty of it is that you can always change it now.
How long will it work?
Keep coming back to this question.
It depends on the, on the, on the economics of the offer.
7:39
Right.
And so right now, and it depends on the gyms because I've got some guys and that's why conversion of how many puts what percentage of leads.
You convert is such an important number to me.
Arguably the most important number for me, that I look at if I'm looking at the health of gym and they're selling system right now if I have to Jim's, let's say let's use.
7:56
Let's use Ryan Karis as an example.
So, he's probably the number one, grossing Jim.
We have I think they'll do one like, one point, like 8 million this year.
Something like that.
His conversion mechanism is amazing, right?
He's rock.
Solid as guys are working, the leads like they come in, they close them, like crazy.
They get amazing amount of referrals from everyone, right?
8:12
And so for him, same offer, okay?
He could spend up to two hundred and fifty dollar.
A lead lead.
Okay.
And then you've got let's say someone else, okay, who has the same exact Jim launch system, okay, so I'm like just talking about my own system here, right?
8:28
And they're running a six-week Challenge and they let's say they convert. 5% of the leaves, which is really kind of poor.
Now, if you're converting 5% of your leads on to a 600 dollar offer, right?
Then that means that you can spend up to $30, make sure I do my math right times 20, yes / 20.
8:48
Yeah, $30.
So you can spend $30 a week.
That's still not bad.
You don't need and you're breaking even, right?
And most people are getting leads from work, less than that, so that person still fine.
How long can Ryan keep playing in that Marketplace for a lot longer than Person who can only spend $30 sleep.
9:05
So, does that person need a new offer, or do they need to get better at converting leads?
They need to get better at converting leads, they don't need to change anything in their machine.
They should be better at it, right?
And you guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
9:30
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out.
If that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, the how good you are at converting, your leads will dictate how how profitable, and how long can run a campaign on a given ad platform?
9:47
Now, that's kind of the last piece, which is the traffic.
So, if someone says, how long will the six weeks challenge?
Keep working.
I would then ask the natural question and that's why I had to build up to this point which is what platform because like, how long will the six-week challenge work on Direct Mail?
Probably does work on Direct Mail.
10:03
It's just more profitable online right?
For right now, how long like right now it works on It works on Instagram.
It works on Snapchat, it works on YouTube like it works on all of these things and Jim words I think you guys really excited about the thing that's tomorrow.
So look forward to that because we're releasing a ton of new Legion stuff and you will dig it.
10:21
But that's besides the point, how long will it?
Work on that platform?
It will work as long as until the the CPM.
So the cost per eye ball gets to a point where you're spending $250 per lead for Ryan Wright and then for Somebody who's doing the 5 percent, it will work for that person until they get to.
10:43
So they're doing so the so let's say, okay, I'm going to break down over for you.
So cpms is cost per thousand Impressions, right?
So typically most like, if you were to look at cpms of Facebook, six years ago, cpms are Facebook or like six bucks, okay?
10:59
For 1,000 eyeballs.
And then you could even make the argument that they were even more responsive eyeballs because there weren't as many ads, not as many as were being bought by businesses because it was in your class.
Foreman.
So you had more eyeballs that were more responsiveness cheaper.
It's like the Wild Wild West, right?
You just get create.
I was getting Penny clicks, it was the best, and there was no rules.
11:16
I have like hot chicks that were shirtless.
It was nuts.
Anyways, so it involves, right?
And so, from then, until now, the cost of ads is literally 5 x, 5 x.
Now did that affect my promotions at all?
No, because my budget, my ceiling was $200, right?
11:31
It didn't matter, right, because I have so much room to go.
Now you have your thousand-odd, let's just use $20 because it's an easy number to work with.
So right now that's kind of like a slightly below like a slightly cheaper like right now it's a average gyms are getting like 25 to 30 dollars ctms but we use 20 just because it's easier for math.
11:48
Okay, so let's say you're doing, you know, at least 25 so people get better.
So $25 will see p.m.
Okay, so $25 for a thousand eyeballs now from those thousand thousand eyeballs, let's say, you get three leads.
Okay.
That means that you're spending eight dollars and 33 cents a week, okay?
12:05
So you have eight dollars and 33 cents lead and that's what the Dollars you can.
So if in the next five years, Facebook does again and five X's to up to $125, a CPM, which that's like television cost then still and we're getting three people per right, we're still getting leads for $45 Elite and Ryan can still keep going to 250.
12:27
He's still getting five to one on his acquisition.
So how long do you think it will work?
I don't know.
It just depends on the traffic platform but the thing is is at that point There will be another traffic platform.
There will always be another traffic platform because people's attention is always somewhere.
12:44
And eventually the ad for platforms, get more developed, they get more regulated, they get more whatever and then the biggest players came in Coca-Cola, Budweiser all these guys and then they start dropping their ridiculous budgets and then they just raise the water for everyone.
And then at that point, The Savvy marketers, right?
Go to another new platform and do the same thing again, right?
13:02
And the thing is, is that in the very beginning of a new platform, people, usually will push traffic.
Like static sales Pages, they'll push them to 21 dollar, 21-day promotions and that's why the very beginning lbo stuff worked, right?
Is because it took zero effort and they could literally take it by Penny clicks.
13:19
If you have a penny, click even if you're converting, it 10% on your page or 5% of your page, you're still getting like 21 back, it doesn't matter, right?
And so guys will do that.
Just push ass loads of traffic towards a page because they can afford to do it but then very quickly, real players start entering and then you can't buy traffic for that cheap anymore, right?
13:37
And those guys go to the next one, right?
But then so like you want to be the business who can spend the most.
This is a six-week challenge the actual promotion matter at all.
No, it's the conversion mechanism.
You could do it for a 12-week.
That's why we have a 12-week transmission.
That's three thousand dollars.
What do you think?
We can spend their to our customer a lot?
13:55
How many platforms you think it works on a ton because traffic is just a store.
It's a commodity.
You go to the traffic store and you pay them for traffic, and then they give you traffic, right?
What you do with that traffic and how much you can spend.
And for it is going to be, is going to dictate how long you're gonna be able to use the traffic platform and how long, an offer or promotional work for you.
14:15
Right.
And so to bring this all the way home, I'll try to do my best.
The marketplace is much much bigger than you think it is.
If there is let's say five like the items running a six-week challenge.
Cool, there's 500 in a million-person city.
It doesn't like it doesn't matter like like even if there's ten of you or 20 or 50 of you it still wouldn't matter.
14:40
Right?
Because in the thing is in the reality is that it'll never be past that because a lot of those two Motors, don't even know how to Market.
They're not even aware enough, they're not even in little Facebook groups, with other gym, owners.
They're not trying to look like they're doing their thing, right?
And they're not going to learn from oceans are still giving away free week.
So that's the only game they know how to play, right.
14:56
But y'all are smarter, right?
And you know how to play a better game which will ultimately like those guys Guys will eventually got a business or they'll continue to struggle for years and years and years, but if you don't have to play that way, then you'll win, because you understand how the game is played, okay?
So you have your traffic platforms.
15:13
Boom, you'll have your offers which like these change every five years or so.
Right three to five.
It'll change, we probably have.
And this is from a Gary Vee private private session that he gave.
He said that Facebook has about four to five more years of golden days.
15:28
And then at that point it's going to get too expensive because the The big breads still like the big Brands, still have not started up like, you don't see Budweiser ass, not a lot of them on Facebook, right?
You will once they once they get convinced that digital marketing Works someday, right?
They'll do that.
But that's okay because we're going to have like virtual reality marketing and like all sorts of other stuff that's going to open up and we'll be on Snapchat still or Instagram or whatever, right?
15:51
We're going to be there because we're always going to be on the front because you're a Savvy, business owner.
And so if you have to hope that like, why wish I could just run ads on one platform forever, right?
Well then just get over that hope because It's like, you need to adapt to survive because that's the game of business.
The point of business is not to win, the point of business is to keep clay, right?
16:09
And to continue to play, is to continue to adapt, and continue to learn, and continue to figure out what the next thing is.
And I hope that gets you off because it should because that's the game you're playing right?
And so, traffic platforms will come.
And go offers will take much longer to cycling out because that's like human psychology.
16:25
I mean, this one's been going for six years and it's still crushing it.
So like, I don't know, I Still think that the reason that it wasn't out earlier is just because there wasn't enough testing that was in place from the earlier players and now we have much better players.
We continue to test stuff.
16:40
We spent about thirty forty thousand a month, testing new things all the time.
Still don't have anything that pulls that so you should feel somewhat safe in that.
And thing is things, don't happen.
Immediately things happen, over the span of year like month, like quarters / years in order for like, actual big changes to occur, right, which means it's not going to like die tomorrow.
17:01
So usually if someone has campaign that dies, it's because they're creative sucks.
It swords tireder, it's old, let's just normal marketing.
You got to make you shit.
Excuse me.
I mean is that so um I hope that puts to rest, some of the like what?
Like six weeks challenges are saturating.
17:17
My like, the only reason that you see all those ads is because they're working.
The only reason people keep running it is because they can keep a forwarding the traffic.
So maybe if you see lots of people doing it, it's because they're making money.
I thought, right?
17:33
And so if you're like, well, I'm too prideful to try this because someone else is doing it.
Well then it's like, okay, I'm too prideful to like adjust to the fact that consumers don't go to stores anymore and start using Netflix.
Okay.
Well, if you want to, just not adjust to the times that's fine, you don't I mean like there's a place for that like you just won't grow.
17:53
It's okay.
You don't I mean it I'm not trying to say that harshly.
It's just like business changes and so like you can mark it whatever you want to Market.
It's just going to have to To have a superior conversion mechanism mechanism, or be able to afford you, a higher level of traffic, then the people and the players who are using this one.
And I can tell you that, the people are using this promotion can outspend you right now, if you're not using it.
18:13
And so it's either Like You Can level up and you can change the way you're playing the game we can get, or you can be a taxicab, you don't have.
Meanwhile, Uber comes and takes over.
Everyone's using a wrist, not fair, okay?
Like, whatever.
So anyways, guys, I hope you have a good Thursday.
18:31
For anyone who's like not sure.
Of like and even from my dream owners.
Like if you guys aren't sure about it.
Like well, you guys are all sure but you're still doing it.
Like you're fine, we're good.
And the beauty is that even when some even if a meteor hits, right?
Even have a meteor hits and all of a sudden all women change their mind and are like, I don't want to do a six-week challenge anymore.
18:52
Cool.
They're going to do something else and we'll figure it out and it won't take long because something like someone will always be experimenting with stuff, right?
And then you'll figure it out and then you'll start running that promotion as long as you have a client Finance acquisition mechanism that allows you to afford traffic.
19:10
You'll be good to go the entire human like unless basically until men stop looking at women for how good they look, women are going to continue to want to lose weight period.
Like until we change how Evolution works, right?
Until until we change.
How I like how men are attracted to women, women are going to be incentivized to lose weight.
19:31
And look better.
And until women start not looking to men for security.
Like there will be more gay guys won't start trying to make money right?
Like I'm saying General bias is a Mustang women want to make my own I think guys want to do chick but I'm saying over all right.
Societally as like status is still given to men for the most part for how much they can provide not frowned shape.
19:51
They are, that's how you see these gorgeous super models with really rich older guys.
Like why, why is that the case?
Cuz that's where the statuses like he gets status by being with this young cute thing and she get status by being with a by having wrangled a tiger, right?
20:07
I'm just being real with you and so until that changes, these desires are going to always be there.
And at the end of the day, if you were a gym and you give service away, you're going to be giving service away in one way or another, there's no like like big new thing.
You're going to either give a week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, six weeks, 12 weeks, whatever.
20:26
That's going to be your promotion is would You like to have some and try and see if you like it.
Now, ideally, you want them to try and pay you to try it so that they're more invested in the get better results from, they get a better experience in a more likely to stay, right?
The new way of doing business, but That's what it is.
20:43
And so, like maybe 42 day challenge, works better later or something, but I don't really think that's the reality.
The only way that this will actually change is that the like we figure out a new hook on the back end that pops us from, you know, a 600 dollar sale in the first visit to a twelve hundred dollars down the first visit.
21:01
Maybe when we do that, something will change.
But like for this point as long as you can afford the traffic but you can, as long as women are gonna want to keep losing weight and keep guiding five times a year.
We're good.
So I hope that makes sense for everybody or anybody was like worried like how long is this going to work?
Like it's going to work for a while and it would need to know the reason for why it's not going to work and that's just my take, that's Alex's scoop, that's my perspective on it.
21:25
I hope you found that valuable.
Drop any questions you have, I'll ping back because this I love this stuff.
Maybe you can see that.
Like I get all flustered other club.
So, anyways, love you all.
Hope you have an amazing day, happy Thursday.
And I will catch you guys in my gym, Lords.
21:41
I'll see you tomorrow on a very, very all right, all right.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
One happy Tuesday.
Hope you guys having an awesome week so far kicked it off.
Strong with the a nice Monday.
I have a short video that I wanted to make for you today or podcast thing and how you are consuming this content.
0:38
So there are three topics that I jotted down in my notes that I wanted to cover today.
One is the concept of the zero tolerance entrepreneur.
The second topic is my definition of help and the third is why focused is alive and I'm going to try and tie all these three things together and I think it will hopefully be able for you.
0:58
So Only reasons I wanted to make this is because I'm hoping that some of you guys will tag your managers or some of your employees in this video so that they can better understand you and how you work the number of video I've ever made.
Now of all time, was that the heel on attention and the new entrepreneurial gold.
1:13
And so I kind of wanted to have this work as a little bit of a sequel to that but within the context of other people and how they play a role.
And so the first one I'll do this in Reverse middle order.
So it's two.
And then the third thing and then the first thing, but my definition of help.
1:29
One of the hardest things for people to understand who aren't entrepreneurs is that most of the time, they're not helping you.
They're usually heard of you.
And what I mean by that is that the definition of help.
As I understand it, you can Google it or whatever.
But as I understand help help is giving someone tension back.
1:46
So someone becomes more potent, more able more powerful as a human being because they have more marbles in their marble.
If you've watched the first video, it's like everyone has x amount of attention that they have at their disposal.
And so if you can put marbles, you can collect Marbles for someone and put them back into that bowl.
2:03
They are now more able.
They can do more things.
That can be a better husband, they can be a better wife, they can do better business owner etcetera.
Now for us is Jim owners, right?
We help people by giving them the attention that was taken by their insecurities, or their lack of confidence, or their lack of energy, right?
2:19
And we give that back to them in the means of Fitness, right?
So when you get in better shape, all of a sudden, you're not consumed by these thoughts about.
Am I not good enough?
Do I look a certain way you walk through a border miss this fitting weird, whatever.
Were all those things.
Our attention that are being drained from you, from the task at hand, right?
And so if we can give them back that attention, we're providing value right now, we're this ties into the, the people who play in your sphere is that a lot of people have what we would call inverted help, which is they think they're helping.
2:47
But they're actually hurting you, by taking their dreams, an example of that would be someone who's an employee who constantly comes in and blows stuff up.
And what I mean by that doesn't mean they have to be Or they have to be whatever.
They just have huge emotional swings.
3:03
They're very emotionally reactive, right?
And because they're very emotionally reactive that spreads onto you.
So they walk in the door and then you just get sprayed.
And what I mean by that is they just take a whole bunch of attention from you because they have things going on in their life that they have not handled yet.
And you should know who those people are because you feel it.
3:21
Like, in as I've heard, you feel it, you're like, Ah, that's noisy.
It's loud right?
It's because they're taking attention from you, they're not helping Okay.
Another example of that would be like if you have a, an executive assistant or an admin, who continually pings you all day long to make decisions for them, are they helping you?
3:41
Or they hurting you, they're probably distracting you a lot of the time and if that person is distracting you ultimately they're actually making things worse not better, right?
And so you have like and how do you practice is how do you figure out if someone's actually helping you versus not helping you really?
It's just, it's just that the general noise level you have in your world.
3:57
If things get quiet, you can Think more clearly.
If these get quiet you become the person that you like you, you don't become the person, you your circumstances.
Allow you to exhibit the characters characteristics of yourself that you always want to have out there.
4:14
When you're stressed, when you're spread thin, when you don't have a lot of attention, a lot of bandwidth.
You become more reactive and then you become more emotional.
And so, when you have lots of people have explosions around, you then little thing becomes explosions for you too, and then you get totally off task.
So I'm going to Bleep.
4:30
I'm going to leave this into y focuses a lot.
One of the number one things like there's this whole Mantra around like the grind and whatnot and that's cool.
I get that you have to hustle but focus is a lie as a concept because I don't think that people apply it the way it's intended to be a body.
4:48
You don't focus by thinking about something harder.
You don't focus by like doing this.
And being like I'm just going to ignore everything else and go.
The only way you focus is by removing other things.
That's how you focus, you have only x amount like your vision is just your vision.
5:04
It's in front of you, right?
But if you have other things there, then that's how it gets split, right?
And so you don't focus by doing less, sorry, you don't focus by doing more things or just felt like pushing yourself harder to do.
This one thing and trying to ignore surroundings, you have to handle those surrounding things, so that there's really nothing left and then that's when like, the whole thing about boring makes you money like boring.
5:28
But rich, I want that.
To be our hashtag.
I was think about that this morning pouring but rich is that like, you shouldn't have explosions in your life.
And if you have people who create those explosions in your life, you should either have conversations with them.
About what you expect from communication.
Here's an example, I really don't like getting voice messages.
5:47
It bothers me because I hate having to listen to someone for 30 seconds when I could have read that in about three seconds.
And I also think that people when they do voice messages, tend to ramble, I don't lie, don't know what they were going to say to just start talking, right?
It bothers me and so when someone texts it takes more time to text, right?
6:09
Did you get the think about where you going to say and usually try to make it as short as possible.
So you want to move your thumb so much which works great for me is receiver because then I can read it in a split second, right?
And I can also read it at my own Leisure, right?
And for me I don't like to have the like literally the noise of like I like keeping this area quiet.
6:26
It's carpeted for a reason.
I don't like the echo, I like it.
Quiet.
I put I used to put headphones when I was in college like don't try to headphones with that your plugs in.
So I got an absolute silence like I had I just it for me, it stresses me out.
Maybe you're the same way, maybe you're not.
But anyways, that's just an example like, you know, you better than I do.
6:47
Right?
But if you if you, if you have these little pings, these little toys of like kind of annoys me, communicate it and either.
Fix that Communications like well or end it that's it because it's not helping you it's hurting it and every little thing.
7:03
So like the reason that our closet, I wish I could pull my computer with me to show you.
I have everything labeled so it's like daily t-shirts, workout t-shirts, workout shorts and I have them on hangers now instead of in drawers because drawers because then I have to look for stuff.
7:19
Now, this might sound like ridiculous to you and I get that.
I'm not meet, I'm not that organized of a person, I really am not but I had to do those things because they bothered me and I realized that they bothered me and so it was taking attention as I want you to handle this.
7:35
Right?
And so it took me a morning.
And then from that point on, I feel good when I walk into my closet, why is it when you clean out your garage, you feel better because you have a tension that sitting in your garage and still is sitting in your garage right now because it's just wrapped up and stuff that, you know, you should do and so Doing these little things allows you to aggregate this stuff, bring those marbles back into your bowl so that you can handle even bigger and bigger things, right?
8:01
So, focus is alive because it's not about focusing harder or ignoring things.
It's about handling those things that are taking from you, no matter how small they are, because each one of those things can get added back to the boat and make you better, right?
8:16
I'm telling you how many times have you fix something?
And then the next day, you look at a problem that you thought was insurmountable and all of a sudden you're like, oh, that's really odd.
It's because you have more attention.
Literally, you become better.
I'm like, I'm not, I talk about this stuff because I'm telling you, when I talk to guys, who were doing eight figures and they're like, dude, I'm stalker talking about.
8:34
They're like, how are you doing it?
Such a crazy rate.
They asked us all these questions.
I can usually tell within a couple seconds that they're super split.
And so like the advice that I give most people's I'm like, do less, like there's no way you can handle all that stuff, do less, boring, the rich do less and all of a sudden they won't do you.
8:52
Like, I went from three businesses to one and now we're making three times as much money.
I'm like, awesome, it's amazing.
What happens when you only have one thing you have to do, right?
Becomes really easy.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
9:09
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
9:26
Its fo free in exchange for emails that I can email you when we launched under the real leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like 8, Eight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
Okay, and so Zero Tolerance.
9:43
Entrepreneurial.
So, I covered my definition of help.
So hopefully, if you have people around you and you're like, you're not helping me, you're actually distracting, you're taking my attention, you're stealing attention for me.
And if people communicate to you in ways, like they text you all the time, whenever things happen, a Facebook message, all the time or this is your voice messages, that bothers you, whatever that handle that.
10:02
So that it stopped pulling from you and making you weaker, right?
So that's the help thing.
And that should be for your staff for anybody who has to communicate with on a regular And you can even do that with your spouse.
Well you and I have defined communication Cycles.
We really do because it makes our life easier that way, we know exactly what our expectations are on, what we're going to be bringing to the table.
10:21
Like I'm not kidding this stuff.
Sounds crazy but like like the higher up, you go with the louder, everything will get the bigger, your organization will get the more of an impact.
Like I can't tell you how many times I've had her like my vision for my life.
As I want to help 10 million people like awesome, the habits that it will take in order to create the Eric you actually impact 10 million people is that you're going to need two more ten times over and to become someone much bigger and much clearer than you are right now, if you feel like you are stuck right now, it's because you have not enough attention to acquire.
10:55
The next skill set that you need to acquire in order to move up the ladder.
That's it straight up.
That's it.
Like if you're like man, I'm so busy.
I'm so tired.
Whatever the marketplace does not matter like does not care.
Your business does not Here are your clients don't care?
11:12
Honestly, most people don't care, right?
And so you have all this noise that you're giving yourself.
So there's only one solution that you have, which is to gather your attention back, cut out all of the things that bother you.
And then go Focus now because you can focus because there's nothing else distracting you and then things that used to be complicated, get really easy how it works.
11:33
All right.
And so my ask for you is just to become a zero-tolerance entrepreneur, right?
Don't talk.
Tolerate stuff like all of the little little little nap B.
They add up the messy sink that you walk past right?
11:50
And it doesn't need to be you.
You can have other people handle that stuff for you like it doesn't if you're like man, I hate cleaning.
That would be something that is loud for you then pay.
Someone get that attention back and then you can apply to another area.
It's like right now.
We built the home just like pure.
12:06
Like well this isn't like I can't do that.
That's okay, because this is just like I'm just showing you where this path goes.
I'm not saying that you have to do all of this.
Now I'm just giving you examples and hopefully you find it valuable.
So we have a home gym because I don't like the, I don't like traffic.
I don't like leaving and morning.
12:22
I don't I don't like having to wait for Layla or coordinate or having her wait for me because then I feel guilty and I get this little toy of Gilda.
She's sitting by the door.
Like I don't like that, right?
And so we have a home gym.
We have a home gym so that we can go on our own schedule.
Doing it whenever it's convenient for us and I saved the time, right?
12:38
That's like a little thing that we do.
I don't like grocery shopping.
So we have instacart which by the way, is 150 bucks a year and you get groceries delivered to your door in an hour $150 a year.
So you're talking 12 bucks a month for me to every single week.
12:55
Be able to go grocery shopping.
Two times a week, which is probably a two hour round trip.
Like by the time you figure out what you want to get, get in the car, go there And it all in the stores waiting in line.
Has some kid going nuts next to you, right?
Then you check out, get back in the car.
Come all the way back home.
I could avoid all of that. 450 bucks a year.
13:14
Are you kidding me?
Yes, right.
We buy everything on Amazon.
So it comes the next day, there's like, so, what does my life look like, right calendar-wise, ideally huddle in the morning, and then I have my huddle with my team, Barty team.
And then that's it.
That's my whole day, right?
13:31
And then I have some things that I want to get done and that's all.
And so look at your schedule, look at the things that are on there.
Look at how necessary they are necessary for you to actually be the one doing it, right?
And then see all of the things in your personal life because it's still draining from the same Bowl.
13:46
Which is why, when someone comes to work or that you have a, an employee who has a parent who's sick, or they're having trouble at home, right?
They don't, they don't do as well with work.
Did you have one bowl of attention?
And so, if you think that the issue with your parents, or your child or whatever, doesn't affect your work, of course it does.
14:03
So you have All of those things you have to handle everything and people might be like, wow, that's really hard and it's like, yes, it is hard.
That's why most people don't do it.
That's why most people don't grow.
That's when most people don't succeed, or at least to the extent, they worked.
So anyways, sorry, this felt like it was a little bit more Auntie than I anticipated.
14:21
But anyways guys, um, if you can throw a like for all the, for all the homies, poor little core little fun tap out for all the homies.
And if you have any staff who you're like, man, like I want you to understand that if you communicate with me.
Has to be deliberate, has to be with intention and we can't just do it haphazardly because you hurt like you doing that pulls from me which hurts the entire business, right?
14:42
Like if I can't do what I can do then we can't grow this thing and so I need you guys to be organized and not splatter on me whenever you don't know what to do.
And a lot of times what happens is that, if you can cut those things out, most people figure those things out there, and then they actually learn and grow themselves because they don't need you as much anymore.
15:00
And you shouldn't want people to need you because they need you.
It means you always have to be Be a slave to your business.
Something to consider.
Anyways, guys should all like, drop a comment tag.
Somebody hope you guys have an amazing week and I'll see you guys on the flip side.
15:16
You like my new shirt, they look at it.
It's got like one of my Lululemon's, all the Blazing.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, everyone, happy Tuesday.
Hope you guys are having a great day.
If you're consuming this via podcast that I hope you're having a great day to I'm laughing because I think I'm almost more excited about this is a Breaking content rules and making two pieces of content within two hours of one another, but first one was scheduled this one.
0:35
I was feeling and so I think that you will feel this too.
So the new recurring Revenue model and how we have less than 1% turn.
So I'm going to give you something.
That's just a massive secret of ours that I was debating.
Even saying for fear of people using it against us but that would be scarcity mindset.
0:52
So I'm not going to.
So here's here's how we've achieved less than one percent.
Sure.
And this is what some of the big players in the space are basically showing.
And so fundamentally, what happens, most times that when people have recurring Revenue models, their goal is to get the acquisition sign, someone up on the recurring and then pray that they pay until our pray that they pay.
1:12
Stay praying peso like those three.
So pretty that they stay and pay until the job, right?
That's the goal is like, okay, I got you now, just like, don't like, don't email them, don't text them, don't remind them that they're being built, right?
That's the, that's the thought, right?
1:28
And that's what most If people do and it's silly and it's dumb and that's why most people don't have really good recurring Revenue models, they constantly have this revolving door that they're always fighting against, right?
So what is it that Netflix is doing what is what is some of the stuff that we have modeled off of to have less than 1% church?
1:46
So in Legacy, which is our highest and program people, pay thirty two hundred dollars a month, maybe more than that for us to not, give them X, so we don't run anyone's ads, we are not an agency, and despite that Less than 1% turn so less than 1% right now.
2:03
We have over 500 gems that are in that level, right?
Less than 1% leave less, right?
How are we able to do that, right?
And I can tell you, it's not by doing the recurring Revenue model that our forefathers talk to us, right?
Which is just like, hope, you know, pray that they stay and pay.
2:18
It's actually a reverse model.
And so in the internet marketing space, there's something called a launch model, right?
And so launch model is where people, you know, you have a customer base, right?
You have a list of some sort and you have their attention.
2:34
And you, you spent, you know, you spend a month or two giving content Goodwill, whatever right?
And then after certain point, then you start to do some sort of like, hey, we got this new thing coming out, it's going to be awesome and then drum up a whole bunch of marketing and hype and then they sell and then they close the cart and then boom, nothing knowing come again, right?
2:55
So they have to start it all over again.
And so roughly talks about this is part of his story.
To help you decide if you want to get into a recurring dream.
All right now here's where it gets really interesting, I believe fundamentally so this is a writer Downer for all 18 of you.
3:10
Who decided?
Come on fundamentally.
The reason that our recurring Revenue model has less than 1% turn is because we treat it like a launch model.
We treat our recurring Revenue model like a launch model.
That is why we have less than one percent sure.
3:27
Now what that means is, You have guaranteed and nothing is guaranteed, because you're always in a week-to-week, a day-to-day relationship with the customers.
And you think that you're guaranteed, because someone is on Autos, like auto-subscribe or do you want to call it auto-debit?
Then you were fooling yourself and you are setting yourself up to lose.
3:44
But you have to assume that that, that customer every single month has to sell themselves on why they should continue to pay you, right?
And so, despite the fact that it's recurring, it's recurring payments, but it's also recurring effort.
And that's where most businesses fail.
Is that They're not actually doing a recurrent recurrent amount of effort for what they're providing, they're like, well, I gave you a portal.
4:06
You have access to it.
Congratulations, you can continue to pay me, right?
Know what happens is you have to keep making new stuff just like the launch model, right?
Where you provide good, you you provide content, you provide Goodwill, right?
And then you still do the same marketing play and hike and get everyone excited.
4:26
And then you make something that's amazing, right?
And then you do it again next month, right?
The only difference is people will continue to stay in Pay provided.
The thing meets the promise that you made.
And so that's that's that's, we're launch and recurring models.
4:42
Actually are the same thing, right?
And it's most people just think that when you get recurring models, you can get lazy.
But I promise you that's not the case, right?
You have to do just as much stuff if you want to do it right?
Here's a great example for you because I was thinking about this while I was not in the bathroom, but who's who's got the best, recurring game out there?
5:06
Netflix right?
Netflix has every single like Netflix or Amazon Prime arguably, you seen either one, but I mean, use Netflix for this example.
So Netflix has the best recurring Revenue game on the market, okay, they get every single household.
Every single person to pay 1099 or 1199 or whatever the paying.
5:23
Now right now, they have a huge stockpile of stuff.
No one could ever go through all of it, right at mean right now.
You literally couldn't get through.
If you spend the rest of your time watching Netflix.
So why do they make new stuff if they already have people in recurring?
5:41
Because they figured it out, you have to make new stuff on a regular basis.
Even or especially if you have recurring customers because you have to continue to sell them on the fact that they should still be with you, right.
And a follow-up or a corollary to that is that if you don't create new stuff for your customers then they will assume that the business is no longer active or engaged or the business owners no longer engaged and it's no longer growing.
6:05
And then a At whatever point and different customers go through different speeds or it takes different period of time, right?
For them to then say, I think I've gotten everything.
I'm going to get from this.
I'm going to move on and the reality is that if you have not created new stuff there, right?
6:23
They have gotten everything that they were going to get from you and they should move on.
And so if you want to hack the recurring Revenue model and you want to see like the difference between 5% churn and one person turn is 5X, it's not four percent, it's five times, the customer value Talk about how you can acquire customers more profitably, keep them and never lose that.
6:47
How do you do that?
So, like the amount of effort that everyone puts into marketing, right?
If I could say, Hey, you can get five times the ticket price from someone by taking your effort and putting into making new stuff for them, that who from all these people who have said, they're already going to pay you the best people in the world.
7:03
The awesomest people in the world.
The people who you have the highest potential likelihood of acquiring more money from other already giving you their information and gone on subscription, right?
Right.
And so actually make amazing stuff and do it on a regular basis.
The recurring Revenue model and the launch model are the same.
7:20
And the people who get that and don't get lazy, are the ones who will win, and the good news for all of us is that most people are lazy.
And so we have this gigantic opportunity to disrupt every single market place that you were in or that I am in by simply providing stuff on a regular basis and showing that the business is not stagnant that the business owner is engaged and that you are actively trying to solve.
7:42
Problems and huge.
The cool thing to awesome things about this one.
If you're constantly trying to make new stuff, you are constantly engaging with your existing existing customer base.
So you have a communication cycle.
The more communication you have soaked with someone, the more Affinity they have for you.
7:58
The people that you talk to the most in your life, you probably like the most in your life, right?
Most people I talk to most out of every human being on Earth to Layla.
I also like her the most out of every human being on earth, right?
You're probably the same way, hopefully, right?
And so So, the more communication would have someone, the more likely they are to like you and you watch like, everyone's like how do I get known liked and trusted?
8:19
Well, there's how you get know like they already do know you the like you more with the amount of communication and they'll trust you if you keep your promises, that's how you do it, right.
So man, I hate this great point that was going to make it.
I totally lost it.
But um, anyways, to wrap up the whole record such a good point.
8:39
Kaymer was but, um, any Oak to Wrap this up for everyone.
If you want you to hack this, you have to understand that growth is going to be part of the game and the customer needs some feel like, oh, that's what it was that you think you're going to be engaged with the customers more.
8:57
And then the side benefit is that once you're engaging with them, your understanding their needs, which means you understand your customer better than everyone else because you're actually talking to them crazy concept, right?
And then, you know, all of the problems they have which means that you can write better marketing.
You can have better creative, which helps You acquire more customers, and then beyond that, right?
9:15
When you have that, then you can actually create things that solve problems.
I cannot tell you the amount of times people message me cold and say, I could solve so many of your so many problems for your gym owners, I had this great opportunity for you.
And like, really how many gym owners have, you talked to?
9:32
None or what, you know what I mean.
And so I mean I got approached the other day about.
Hey Mose, a nation quick break.
Just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
9:49
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
About a product that someone it's been like a year and a ton of money developing a software for, and they'd never asked me what we needed and then I was like, well, it doesn't do this and that's the only way that I would use it and then nothing right simple stuff, but no one actually asked.
10:19
So if you ask your customers what they want, you engage with them, they like you more, you have better Mark, you have better knowledge of them so you can write marketing for them and then you actually make stuff that they actually want.
Now, the second piece, Piece of why this is awesome.
Is that once you had a list, a menu of all the problems that your customers have, then you go ahead and make stuff and you give them the pipeline, right?
10:43
Of all the things that are coming out next reckon.
So what does that do?
It's future Paces people.
It gives people the opportunity to see what is coming, right?
And so for example, let's say that I had.
So right now I'll give you, I'll give you an idea of our pipeline for legacy.
10:58
So if you're not in legs, This is what it is.
We have Instagram, new Instagram ads, new Instagram story ads that are in beta right now.
Which means that we test we spend like 30 grand, 40 Grand testing, and twenty or so markets, to make sure that we have winners on both those platforms.
And then I will roll that out.
11:13
That'll be the first one.
The second one will be, we're doing a whole new releasing, a whole new set of ads, for Facebook ads, because we're focusing a little more on acquisition for our guys.
And then we also have Snapchat ads that are getting revamp because I've actually tested them to work great.
But I want to make sure they work in all the markets that we Have and then that would be six weeks out, right?
11:31
And so if you were, if you're a gym owner and your legacy, you know, what's coming, right?
And so let's say even that you were like, you know what, I'm not that into it.
I mean, I don't know why you would say this, but I'm just saying, if you were, you were like, I'm not that into Instagram and Instagram stories, but Snapchat sounds amazing, right?
11:50
Someone will hold on, and stay for the thing that they know is coming because they know the value that it will provide will be far.
Success of the two months.
They got build versus one right now.
How do I wrap this up for like, you're like cool, Alex?
12:07
I get how your business is getting less than 1% Shirin.
Good for you.
Nice stash, right?
No one cares.
So, how do you use that concept and make more money with the gym, right?
Make new stuff for your customers.
Take the exact same template.
12:23
Ask them.
What is the thing that you were struggling?
The most with what is it?
What is it?
That's getting in the way of your nutrition.
What is it?
That's going.
Ting, the way of you getting to the workouts.
What is he getting in the way of you staying motivated?
Why can't you stay a week in week out?
What are the obstacles?
And then they will tell you.
12:38
And then, all you have to do is follow the same process of like now I have all of the problems and then you probably like, you probably have a few Solutions already.
You probably have them, and you didn't even give them, right?
We're in this like, totally.
Like, I've given every solution that I can think of, and now we're in a bit.
12:56
And that's why, you know, all of our jobs are on the Forefront of Of the marketplace is because they're finding out the new what's working right up.
But for you, the good news is that body hasn't changed very much, right, like the marketing landscape changes constantly, but bodies haven't changed in 2000 years, but in Psychology has a neither, but you can still solve problems for your people and they see that you're trying, right?
13:19
And if you actually are trying and putting an Earnest effort in, right?
They can appreciate that because they like people, I honestly think people care more about intention well.
They Care about the result to, but like you gained some leeway by showing that you care, which you should write.
13:36
It's really hard to do all these things and not care, side note.
So if you don't care about your customers are doing this stuff that you might be in the wrong business.
But if you do like your customers, then you should want to solve their problems.
And this process that I just outlined is the secret to getting lunch less than one percent.
13:51
Sure.
Would you like to 5x the revenue of your Jim?
Would you like to 5x the the lifetime value of your customer?
Cool, ask them the next Next problem that you can solve get all of them, consolidate them figure out, which ones you think that you can solve the best weight, make the solution, give it to the ones who are struggling the most, not the ones who are doing the best with it, but the ones who said, I struggle with emotional eating cool.
14:16
Here's what.
Susan Sarah and Jake did when they struggled with emotional eating and overcame it, let's take that and let's give it to Jessica, Laura and Lily.
I don't know, has had to think of three names doesn't have to be women.
14:32
Not all of them.
It could be all guys.
Those could be our guys need for all.
We know, who knows, you know, new world, and give it to them and then see if it works.
Don't give it to your customers.
Unless, you know, that the solution works.
And then what'll probably happen is, you'll find out that there are some things that worked in some things that didn't and then you will take that fix it and then give it back to them, or give it to three, new people who are struggling with emotional eating, And I promise there's more than three or Jim Wright and see if that fixes them and then if it does, now, what happens?
15:03
Now you have a whole bunch of people who appreciated the fact that you went above and beyond what you promised them to really solve their problem.
And now, you have customer zealots were telling everyone about how amazing you are and how like the fact that you went above and beyond to solve their problem.
15:20
And then when you do produce the new, the new product, or if you want to say, they get everyone excited about it for you.
You don't need to Hype it because You're going to say this.
Change my life.
It was awesome.
You guys will dig it, right?
And everyone will believe that because they should because it shouldn't change their life, right?
And at this point you're like well, because one of the number of things is we don't we don't pitch it, our event.
15:40
So people are like every single event I've ever been to.
I always get pitched and you don't pitch it, your offense.
It's like, no, you're already a customer and so I am pitching you but you've already given me your payment information.
And so, I'm just continuing to sell you on why you should keep paying us.
15:57
Us and stay and for those reasons we have less than 1% turn.
We have, you know, the growth rate that we have and all that stuff.
And so I hope that this made sense for you before you go.
Can I get for you?
Some people under Thor like because if someone can understand this concept this is like this is the keys to the castle.
16:17
This is the keys to the kingdom.
Just tell you, when this, how you win in this Marketplace, this is what Netflix is doing.
Look at the big players.
Look at the people have explosive growth rates.
Look at people who Who are retaining customers better than anyone else.
If you can never lose a customer you can do whatever you want for acquisition.
16:33
Real Talk, the reason lbos don't work.
It's not that they don't work but I thought Alex was against Olympiacos, I'm not against Lobos.
Most people have such low lifetime value, their customers that they can never recoup the cost. if your average customers, only pending if you talk to most gyms that come to us, Don't have lifetime value of customers that are, that are more than four or five months, right?
16:55
And so that's why they need a different acquisition system.
Now if you have a acquisition system and you have the lifetime value, then you become a super jump and that's what we mentally seven-figure facilities.
Right?
But in the very beginning, you need like, whatever.
I'm not going to be docked on the acquisition whole, but you should get the point.
17:13
I hope this makes sense to you.
This is the secret, this is how you do it and if right now, you don't have this process in place of continuing to mine.
Your Is to keep them engaged to show them, you know like that you care you should.
Then you're leaving a lot of money on the table and honestly the job of serving customers gets way more fun when you talk to them and actually solve their problems.
17:33
And that they know that you're trying to do that too.
And they also see the things that you have in the pipeline and as entrepreneurs, we liked building things.
What a better way to build stuff than build stuff for the people who are paying you already, right?
And then you get word of mouth because they tell your friends, they're like, no, it's not like any other gym I've ever been to you like Constantly coming up with new stuff right there, constantly trying to solve our problems.
17:55
You don't hear that for people who are going to normal Jim's.
Right.
Right.
You want to set yourself apart?
That's how you do it.
Okay.
Sorry.
So this is my second piece of content for the day.
This one is from the heart, rather than scheduled can probably feel a difference.
But anyways, Pasa like up, if you want to sew the other gym, owners can see it.
18:12
So that Facebook thinks that this is a good post that people should actually watch which if you do care about the industry then, Double thumbs and drop a comment for somebody in your gym where you trainers and you can also doesn't have to be you.
You can you can leverage other people like I don't I'm not running the legion betas but I just over see what the pipeline should look like.
18:32
But I'm not the one who's putting all the ads in the accounts and double checking, and making all the creative.
Like, I have some oversight in terms of what I think is going to work best right now, but I'm not the one doing it.
And so like, if you have a trainer who's like, man, I love making videos, then you can be like awesome, like go make videos around this and then Give it to the customers at ask for it and then have them get excited.
18:54
You know what I mean?
Like, it doesn't have to be you if you like, how can I have the time to do?
That asking questions, doesn't take time thinking about the problems and coming up with potential solution.
Doesn't take a lot of time and then the execution, you can always send off someone else's passionate about Lots of love.
19:09
Happy Tuesday, taco Tuesday, shot.
A little thumb action.
Anyways, have an awesome day and I'll catch you guys soon.
Double content.
Tuesday to time, Tuesday.
All right.
Lots of love.
Happy Tuesday, taco Tuesday, shot.
A little thumb action.
Anyways, have an awesome day and I'll catch you guys soon.
Double content.
Tuesday to time, Tuesday.
All right.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Hey, what's going on, everyone?
Happy Thursday.
I was light on content this week so I figured, hey, it is Thursday.
I am almost missing any concept of the entire weekend.
So I was going through my notes of things that I had kind of jotted down.
I wanted to go over and this is the one that that spoke to me today.
0:34
So I'm just calling this the future Marketing in the current state 80/20.
Or 90/10 what I wanted to just kind of addresses just a single point that has been incredibly profitable for me in a lesson that I learned from someone else.
Gary Vee is someone that I actually, I think so, people have very mixed, you know, mixed feelings about him.
0:54
I mean, that's what a good marketer does, anyways, but I think he's incredibly smart and I think he really understands what's going on.
It's just my opinion and he has said repeatedly many many, many times in many videos that one of his greatest regrets as a marketer was not spending enough on Google ads when it was hot.
1:15
For those of you who've been in the game longer, you've known, you've seen the their cycles that happen within marketing, right?
And everything comes down to just where attention is where eyeballs are and the relative cost of those eyeballs.
And so the cost of those eyeballs relative to the amount of them that are actively viewing.
1:34
So examples you can go you can buy television ads right now but that ad platform has completely matured and now has gone far past maturity to the point where it's over priced relative to other things that you could be spending money.
And, you know, in my economics class back back in the day, there's two types of profits, there's economic profits, and then there's accounting profit.
1:56
So kind of profits is just where you are spending money on something or you have Business in an industry.
That is not growing, but you are able to make a profit off of.
It is not like, like you're just making a profit off of a business that it existing, but it's not new, or different or sexy, it is an established market.
2:13
Economic profits is when you are getting a disproportionate amount of profits from dollars that you were spending.
I'm trying to make this confusing but basically, it's looking at the opportunity cost of the money that you're spending meaning, if you were given a hundred dollars to spend on anything, Anything where would be the best place to put that hundred dollars rather than just a place that you would get a positive return?
2:35
So accounting profits would be a positive return independent of opportunity costs, and economic profits is where you're taking that same hundred dollars and putting it in the best vehicle to get the highest return for that hundred dollars.
Now a lot of us don't know because we're not all knowing you know what thing or what vehicle is going to make us the most money for our hundred dollars and I'm trying to bring this full circle with what gave you was saying because what happens As entrepreneurs, we love new things, we like more so than anyone we love new stuff, right?
3:05
We love shiny objects, we love getting excited.
And there's this Rush that you feel when you figure out a new platform or a new whatever, there's this balancing act that you have to do between doing what is working right now, and preparing yourself for the fact that it will change.
3:21
And for those of you who are on here, who are, who are just, just just listening like a parade right now.
For example, if you don't know how to run Instagram, Ads and Facebook ads profitably.
You were just, you're missing the boat.
You like the 80%?
Like 80% of that attention are saying, like there's what's working now?
3:38
And then what you need to prepare yourself for a lot of times, we put a disproportionate amount of effort towards future proofing.
Meaning, like people will spend 50% of their effort trying to find the next thing rather than doubling down.
On the thing that is working right now.
And so, it's this weird psychological trick that we play on ourselves were like, oh, this thing's working great, let me find something else that's working like this.
4:00
Rather than just saying, cool, let's spend more on the thing that's working, right?
And so I put out a challenge in our Legacy Group, which is double your ad spend for the month.
Because if you look off of, just our own metrics my gyms and then now having, you know, worked with over 1000 gems that we had to launch a legacy.
4:20
It's almost directly proportionate the amount of money that you will make in a month will be directly proportional to the amount of money that you're spending on marketing provided.
You're putting it into a vehicle that works, which would be in this Since Facebook and Instagram because they are now at this point where and this is taken from a private friend of mine, had a private dinner with Gary couple weeks ago and like five-person dinner small dinner and they were just asking him, they're like to know, what do you, what do you think, what platforms are coming up?
4:47
Which would be looking at?
He said, first of all, We have four to six more years of golden years on Facebook.
So if you're in here and you're like, man, I'm too late.
I missed the boat, you didn't miss the boat.
Alright?
Like people are still crushing it on Facebook, we still crush it on Facebook.
5:03
We still crush on Instagram.
And so the point is, it's like, we have like the Gold Rush is here.
The iron is hot and you need to strike.
All right.
You need to take like the somebody posted in our group, you should sell your house, take the money.
And then this is just a video from Gary Vee but so your Take the money and put it into Facebook ads because you'll make more money that way.
5:24
I mean, that's obviously an extreme example, but the concept should still hold true.
Which is, we now have, people were asking us questions.
What should I do with all this money that I'm making, Anthony raunchy made a video in here?
You know, I think a couple weeks ago saying like the problems that he has now or different before use having, you know, how do I fill my gym problems?
5:42
And now it's like, what do I do with the money problems?
Now have capacity issues.
Like there's different problems that you're trading, but most people are like, okay, well now I have 50 Grand 100 and 200 Grand, you know, my taking out.
What should I do rowdies?
You should still double down because right now, like looking at an investment vehicle to try and get 10% a year and taking all the attention that it's going to take to go try and make 10%.
6:03
And that would be a phenomenal return on two hundred thousand dollars a year, right?
Which is 20 grand.
But like if you took 20 grand of your 200, so you just to 10% and then you just spent it on Facebook ads that you know, you're going to get a 5 to 1 return on or ten to one return on or some of you guys 22 run and turn on, right.
6:22
Where should your attention to going right?
Should your attention me going towards actively with actively pursuing something that's going to give you passive income, right?
Or should you be taking that attention and putting it towards the thing that's already making you money?
The whole point of like the investing game is there's only two things that you can do with your money.
6:41
You can either lend it to someone or you can buy stuff with it.
You can buy assets, you can buy pieces of businesses or you can buy, real estate, whatever.
Right.
But the point is that, if you are a business owner, You already have the thing that most people try and invest in.
And so you like, There's no point in trying to be passive right now and build up.
7:01
This passive Revenue stream when you have this thing, this engine in front of you, that is making you tons and tons of money.
You should be spending more money on that thing.
All right?
Like, people always ask us like, what is, what is our investment strategy?
Okay, my investment strategy is not to think about it and what I mean by that is like we just invested indexes because I know that I don't have to think about it and I will not need the money for 40, 50 years, right?
7:23
And I have enough cash like that is not there, that is liquid that I can spend heavily on the thing that is making us money.
And I spend as much money as I possibly can, until the marketing is never my bottleneck.
And so, for a lot of people watching, this is probably what I should have had all.
7:40
This is that your marketing should not be your bottleneck.
This is the, this is the punch home point.
If right now, you're not breaking your machine, your business because of the inflow, then it means that you should be spending more on marketing.
7:58
Okay, so what that would mean is that I will keep spending provided, I have a positive acquisition cost or - acquisition cost meaning of making money in the acquisition of customers.
Right.
I should keep spending there until I have too many leads to handle or my sales person is too booked, right?
8:16
Or We're moving down the pipeline, or I have capacity issues at my gym.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
8:44
Right at that point, that I go back to the marketing and then I level it so that I can deal with that flow.
But then I want to increase the pipe, right?
I'm going to increase the width of the pipe which for the people who work with us.
The first thing that you're going to do to increase the width of the pipe is do a Ln, which is automated leader tonight, you don't have to have someone who's manually working all the leads so that you can crank and not worry about having to be like, okay now I need one person full-time and another part-time person or not any true full-time people, or whatever it is, right?
9:12
So phone, that's the first thing that you're going to do.
So, you crank and then all of a sudden, the next bottleneck would be your leading Archer process which now you've automated.
Boom.
So now that pipe is wide and the next piece of that is going to be your sales guy, right?
And so, for some of you guys it's you for some of you guys, it's a sales person who's working for you.
9:30
And so until that person's calendar is completely booked.
Keep cranking.
And then again, once that person is completely booked, are you able to continue to fulfill?
And so right now if you're marketing, if you're like man I wish I could get more people in the door most times, you just need to spend more.
9:49
We're looking at like I'm getting questions from people saying like what do I do?
So I can get a 10% return when they have something right in front of them, that get some of 300% return in a month.
Warren Buffett said that diversification is a hedge against big difference which I think is like one of the most profound like investment statements.
10:09
Meaning he didn't diversify his his funds because he knew what he was doing.
And so right now if you spend $1000 or ten thousand dollars on Facebook ads, you know what you were doing because you have this machine that you've built for, right?
10:26
And so you can go all in on something because it's not risk.
Because, you know, the game, right?
And that's part of the reason that for us with our money.
I know that if I'm going to learn another game, like, I know how long it took us to learn the gym game.
Now, how long?
10:42
It's taking us to learn the game that we're in.
Now I know how long it takes and so for me to say okay cool I'm going to go start buying real estate and buy you know a 20 million dollar building.
That's a whole nother game.
I'm not going to learn that six months.
10:57
It's going to take me three years just like it takes you to learn any game to think that I'm going to You like with ego, right with pride go in there and be like, I'm so smart.
I'm going to figure this out like against other dudes, who have been doing it for 20 years, who literally are going to actively try and get our chips right our dollars, because it's a deal and in real estate.
11:18
A lot of times, it's a zero-sum game.
Meaning there's a winner and a loser period, right?
And so, anyways, all that to say some people right now, you probably need to just double down on the thing that is already working.
Not distract yourself with the A new shiny objects, we will go waste our money, testing, those things for you guys, so that we can give it to you already tested and working out of the box.
11:41
So you don't have to worry about dropping 50 Grand at me like Loops, right?
We get to do that.
I get to do that.
That's, that's our fun stuff right before you.
Like, put all the money in the thing that you already know is working.
Don't worry about your investment stuff, take the money that you have, put it in the machine that, you know, is getting five to one.
11:59
Right.
So anyways, I hope that makes sense for everybody, your marketing should be should not be your bottleneck and you should spend until the point that it is not that way.
And if you are watching this and you're like man, I'd love to have five to one or ten to one returns and already know and know all the metrics of my business then you should probably hop on to Jim lunch so we can show you how we do it.
12:19
But anyways hope you guys have an awesome Thursday that was a note that hopefully someone here is listening to and you know what I might as well address this And so people ask how do you scale ad spend?
So there are a lot of different schools of thought around, how to scale at spent one, is you start with your budget and then you scale every 24 to 48 hours by 10 to 20 percent?
12:45
That was one school of thought.
I personally don't do that, but that is one school of thought that is pushed out by lots of super do Facebook people, right?
The second is doing a duplication.
So, let's say you spend, you got five ads that are 20 bucks a day each right.
13:03
You can duplicate the ones that are winners.
Let's say, three of the five are real winners and you duplicate those ones.
And now you're at 160 day and then you two became one of those once again or 180 it is, right?
That is another way of scaling your ad spend, that is how I scaled all the ads been when I was doing my gyms.
13:20
Now, the Third Way of scaling, your ads been, is actually what I do with our business, right?
Too much.
Like what I'm trying to scale to To a lot of gym owners and this is what we do now.
So I can't say that I've tested this with Jim's, but I'm saying this is our process.
So what I do is I spend usually like three times what, I want my daily ad budget to be and I start there and then I prune back to get to the acquisition cost that I want.
13:48
And so let's say that I wanted to spend $1000 a day.
I spent a lot more than that, but I'm just saying, let's say I wanted to spend thousand dollars a day.
So I want to spend a thousand dollars a day.
I'll probably start with 30 ads at a Dollars today and then within 48 hours, I'll be able to easily cut out 10 of them right now I'm at 2,000 a day and then I'll look again another 48 hours later and I'll be like OK, these ones are definitely winners.
14:10
These ones are maybes.
Maybe I'll cut another five out and I'm at 1,500 a day.
And then at that point, what happens, a lot of times is sometimes I go a little bit higher than what my budget wasn't originally or what I was hoping to have, but but I'm still ridiculously profitable in my acquisition, so I sort of, like, trick myself into spending more than I was intending to And then make more money than I originally was going to.
14:34
So I hope that makes sense.
That's the answer.
A question that I got on our Legacy page that is how I scale had spent.
The other the second way of doing duplication obviously works really well too.
We've done that over and over and over again.
But the starting superhighway is a good way to kind of break your own breaker on spending beliefs and I would definitely recommend splitting that between a couple different accounts.
14:57
I had this weird belief that Facebook things like once you once you That you can't spend money with them that like they start spending it more like aggressively but not in a good way.
Like they'll just send you more junk traffic and sometimes the conversion on your page, will go down.
That's just my experience.
So, I split it up.
15:13
But the reality is that anyone who claims that they know what's going on with Facebook is just either either they're lying, or they're lying to themselves.
It's just because like no one knows what's going on on Facebook.
I have friends who were very high up in the Facebook world and they're like, we don't even like, we don't even Find out about robots, like, they don't even tell their own employees about the changes that are happening inside a Facebook.
15:37
Like they usually find out because clients call them and say, hey, this thing change, what's going on?
And then they have to actively figure out what people like, no one knows, it's a big black box, anyone who claims, otherwise it's just, his is just trying to sell you a dream, all right?
You just test any look at what happened and you figure it out, which is what I recommend.
15:55
You do for everything in your life, which is don't trust.
Anyone just trust the data because at least it, Is reliable.
And you can make your own inferences off of it.
Cool.
So don't let so recap don't let your marketing beer bottle neck.
So spend until isn't if you to scale your ad spend, you can use any of the strategies, I just outlined the starting high and splitting it between out of constance.
16:17
What we do but it is up to you what you want to do.
And I would not be worried about how you're going to spend all of your time and attention trying to figure out how to go from 7 percent passive return, to 10 or 12% passive return when you have this machine In front of you that you will regret five years from now, not spending tons of money into a known Beast that, you know, the return on that you can control.
16:39
So, all these other investment vehicles, real estate stock market, whatever being a note holder on something.
Those are all things that you can't control.
This is a machine, you can control.
So, like, spend it where you can control.
All right.
Anyways, have an awesome Thursday, hope that was bad before you drop a like or a comment to another gym owner who probably needs to hear this.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else so not everyone, happy Sunday.
Day.
I had this video on my mind, it's been on my mind all morning and I've been trying to like peace out how I want it to say it.
So I titled this is not having the skill preventing you from making the money you want.
0:42
I'm also reading a book on Headline, so hopefully that's all I got your attention.
Anyways, I had, I wanted to make this video because I saw someone posting the group about basically an ad agency, or rupture company or something like that.
And I wanted to address it because for me, it's We're so far past that and like, in like the clients that I deal with, on a regular basis are all of our gym Lords.
1:06
And I'm talking about how to get them passed, a million-dollar run rate, and like, all of these things.
But I forget that there are other people who are not who have like, we're just entering our world and what not.
And so I wanted to kind of explain like, why Jim launch is what it is, and why everyone makes more money and it's not from the leads or whatever, right?
1:27
The reality is we are by far the most expensive player.
ER, in our Market because we sell something that no one else sells and what we sell is we sell a skill right?
Everyone else sells a service or they sell leads or they sell you don't I mean some version of that, right?
1:44
And that's and ultimately.
What it is is like you are still beholdin to them.
You're still handcuffed to them because you never acquired the skill and the skill is ring making.
And so the question is, do you want to be a Rainmaker?
And The follow-up question to that would be if you're a business owner, which most people who are in your are right?
2:05
If you don't, if you will have someone else to make it rain for your business, you're always waiting for the weather to change rather than being able to change it for yourself whenever you want.
And your income is always going to be tied to the level of skill that you have.
Whether that's like in the beginning, you're not making very much money at all, cause your training sessions and that's a lower value skill.
2:25
I'm not saying that it's bad or good, it's just that.
What's what with the marketplace values that skill at it?
It's like 15 bucks an hour, right?
And so, you can't really make more than that because that's what your trading your time for in terms of skills.
After that you level up to sales after that, you have up to managing other people selling.
2:40
And then after that, you made it, you know, level up to market, right?
And so, the skill that we give is a combination of sales and marketing, right?
And so that's how we get people to make tons of money.
Really quickly is because we level up their skill set, right?
2:56
And so they go from waiting for it to rain to becoming the Maker.
Now, the next question would be okay, why would we as a company do that, right?
Because the rest of the entire Market does not want to share that skill with you because they want you hold on to it and then have you rent it from them, right?
3:15
They want you to lease their skill set and then do it for free, right?
Which in best case scenario means you're probably like best case scenario you make money than you need them again.
Worst case scenario, which happens far more than the best case is that you just spend money and then Their skillset isn't that good?
3:30
Because they don't care that much.
Now, here's here's something that's crazy for you to think about.
Especially if you're new to this world every agency owner, or Rapture company under, that's of any significance, right?
Has people who run the ads for them?
What do you think they pay?
3:45
Those people usually, 15 $20 an hour.
How long do you think it takes them to train them?
Not that long takes like maybe a week to to to buy in to that and then think like and Buying on the, on the sales pitch that, hey, I know.
4:02
It's really complicated.
You don't want to keep up with this stuff.
You're a little gym, owner, Pat, you on the head, like you should just focus on training clients.
You should just focus on your low value skill, right?
That's what they're saying.
Focus on your low value skill, let us do it.
The high value scale, right?
The thing is, is that then they go ahead, turn around and train someone else on it, and a week, it's not difficult, right?
4:22
It's just that you don't have the information and that's what's being held hostage from Which is annoying.
Anyway, so I just gotta like flood alert, it's raining here.
But anyways, to go to bring this back, the reason that we're able to do this in sell the skillset is because we're banking on the fact that we have something else to give you.
4:43
And that is where everyone else is at least.
To my knowledge fall short is that if the only skill you have right, I'm saying like the rest of the marketplace is generating leads and marketing for a gym then you have no skill.
Set beyond that, which means the reason that their companies are limited at the revenue race that they are, which is usually a lot less than ours will be candid with you.
5:06
Right?
It's because their owner is limited by their skillset, right?
Just like what we're saying, like the signals apply and so rowdies that I'm hoping that we will give you the ability to fish for yourself, right?
We will give you the ability to Make It Rain which is why our price point is five times higher than everyone else's is because we actually give you a skill that will You a lot more money.
5:30
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
5:46
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
Now, once you have this skill, you will need something else because you will break your gym, right?
6:06
That's what happens.
And then you will need another skill set.
And again, to my knowledge, no one else provides the next skill, which is everything else that we provide and Legacy which is how to make the actual business term, right.
And like in a good way and released at cash and measurably increase profit increased Revenue over an extended period of time with the blueprint step-by-step, right?
6:29
Like we do that At.
And so I'm crazy enough to just give you everything that everyone else is trying to lease to you, or hold you hostage with, with the kind of understanding that we have other things to give you that are more valuable than that.
6:45
This is just how we get to know each other.
This is our handshake and US proving that we are who we say, we are going to do what we do.
But it's really, like, in the reason.
Everyone is so Vigilant.
And so Evangelical in this group if you're new to it is because Until like while you're still plugged into the Matrix which is where you are right now, if you're listening to this and have been signed on like the moment you become unplugged and you realize how it works, right?
7:10
Like how you don't need an agency, you don't need a REV here company, in order to make it rain for yourself and then it's very simple.
Like it's not hard to do.
It's just being guarded and made to seem complicated to, I mean, for lack of a better term to keep you down like to Su because they don't want you to know, like, I'm just being real with you because the moment you have that skill set, you no longer ever become a client of theirs.
7:38
We are ripping people out of the marketplace pool for anyone who sells services to gym owners related to Market because they no longer need the skill, they already have it.
And the beautiful thing is that once you go behind the curtain, you realize there's no magic, right?
7:54
Like they can promise whatever they want, but at the end of the day, you're just going to be testing a It's you already have the offer.
I'll tell you the offer.
It's a free six.
We challenge.
Look at our garden funnel.
Like if there's, there's nothing complicated about that, but it's the details that you will probably miss and the details are the things that make our gyms so much money in the details, are what make them more money after the fact as well, right?
8:18
Because once you like, once you can acquire customers profitably, your gym should grow.
And if it's not that it means you have other holes.
And anyways, I hope I've made.
The point, the reality is that most most guys don't have anything else to give you, and so for that reason, they don't give you everything that they have up front.
8:37
Because that's the only skill that they have.
That's also because most record companies agencies, whatever, never were gym, owners their marketer, dudes.
They're dudes, who went to a clickfunnels event found out how to run a Facebook ad to a quick photo.
And then said okay I'll just sell that the route is like six gems.
8:56
Like I got invited to speak, they're not as marketer.
Still, the only person who's ever been invited speaker, who was a brick and mortar gym owner when they got on stage.
Every other person in the last four events, that put phones of ever had in their history, was not a brick-and-mortar owner, they were all information marketers.
The only one who ever survivors and but 20 2016, I had six gems and I was 25 or 26 or whatever it was and they were like, how are you doing this?
9:19
And I was like, I got this cool thing, it works really well and I just walk through the process of how we do it which is you know which later became Jim lunch.
I had I didn't have anything to sell gym owners.
I had like 100 mm or 7 be like hey can I buy that from you?
And I was like, no like no you can't.
It's like I just want to but obviously you don't things have changed since then.
9:39
But um anyways I hope you guys are having a good Sunday.
Hope that makes sense like those rules of skill sets, apply to everyone.
And so the reason that their companies aren't bigger than they are is because their skills have not leveled up to a point where they can be bigger than they are.
9:55
And part of like is is one of the skills.
Of being able to teach someone to fish more valuable than running ads for summer.
Yes, which is why we make more money than they did.
You know, you can ask yourself the question, do I want to learn how to scale, you know, a business from someone who's done this exact business and then scaled their own or not?
10:15
You know someone who hasn't actually ever run a gym or multiple you know.
But anyways that's that wasn't I'm not trying to take shots that's not the point.
I just I just hope that the explanation of skill sets make sense to you.
I forget that people still like making this like to me I we're so far past that, but I forget that people are still making the decision of like should I have an agency or should I join Jim watch?
10:38
And like it's like you want to be dependent on someone for the rest of your life, or do you want to just learn how to do it?
Just it just seems it.
Just seems so obvious to me.
And, you know, if the average gym has a quarter million dollars a year in revenue, is it not worth 16 Grand?
10:54
Like duh.
But you know, that's your own, that's your own journey and you have to cross that in.
Your own time.
But anyways, everybody trying to keep secrets out of fear of loss.
As for my wife yet, a lot of people are operating from a scarcity mindset and they don't want to give you that skill because then they're like well then what will they pay me for and the reality is, they're right?
11:11
Because if they have nothing else to give you, there's nothing else, you will pay them for, which is why they don't want to give it to you.
I'm happy to give it to you.
Cause we got a whole bunch of other stuff that's going to make you a lot more money than this.
You don't.
I mean, this is just our way of getting to know you and showing you that like this, the game we play.
So anywho vinay, Nissan.
11:29
I haven't seen you in a while mr.
Lewis Bob Patrick kale Austell.
Everybody to reduce David hope you guys are having an amazing Sunday drop a like.
I know this is probably OG stuff for you guys because y'all are are studying set it up.
11:45
You know, I forget that there's still a lot of gym owners out there, who don't know how to do what you do.
So have an awesome day, keep crushing it and I will catch you guys soon.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Welcome everyone to the gym Secrets podcast.
My name is Alex movie and I am going to be your hmm, your guide through this strange and magical world.
Anyways, what I wanted to talk to you.
You about today is the concept of marketing and branding, and this is a little bit, usually, I'm pretty tactical with my stuff, but this is just something that was on my mind because I had a phone call yesterday with gym owner, who, you know, gone to a branding company.
0:43
So, I'm saying this to, hopefully save, everyone, lots and lots of money.
The kind of hopefully shift how you're thinking about how you Market your business.
So the idea of branding, right, and I got like everything that I tell you, you're like I've made the mistake.
Okay.
So like I paid some 15-thousand dollars to make me a Citing the logo, right and got zero dollars back for it but did not work at all.
1:07
So I like I'm saying this because I've made the are right, but if someone is promising you to make you an expensive logo or website, like do just like you click.
One of you can make your own site in a work.
It'll make you more money.
All right, I'm just saying that right off.
Back.
Feel like being nice, guy can click my affiliate link, anyways, but the difference is this branding is be.
1:29
Yes, because it doesn't actually produce anything people.
Like well, it's good to have like a weird.
It's like, what does awareness like how do you how do you monetize awareness, right?
How do you supposed to know anything about?
Oh this guy bought because he was aware know, like you have to have direct response marketing and what I mean by that is that every single piece of marketing material that goes out, should have an offer and it should have a deadline and there should be something that is clear.
1:53
That is trackable, that is monetizable.
So what I'm going to do is basically give you a brief outline and this is from The Godfather.
Dan Kennedy, but no matter what, when you like in your business, you should always have an offer that is going on.
There's always an offer, okay, rule number one, always an offer.
2:10
All right, this is from Dan Kennedy's no-holds-barred, direct response, marketing.
But, whatever that is, I could have this.
But this is so true.
And like, I just want to save you so much time and money and spending and trying to like, like branding doesn't matter.
Your colors don't matter.
2:27
Like, they really don't, okay?
Like, like, Xerox.
Like, who would think Xerox would be the name of a business like Printing Supplies.
Like, who here is Xerox was like, oh, pretty now you do because they've made so, like, like, like it's everything has to do with how your monetizing, the traffic platforms that you're using, whether it's Direct Mail, whether it's radio, whether it's television, whether it's Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, stories, whatever it is, right?
2:51
Like whenever wherever people's eyeballs are, there's going to be a way to monetize it and it's not through branding, okay?
So here are the guidelines.
How you're supposed to be doing this?
And this goes for really, any business, not just in business, but one, you always have to have an offer.
People should always have an offer that they should say yes or no.
3:08
To.
Okay, for me at the end of this podcast, him to say, hey if you want, you can have a free download of our four case, studies of how we feel, Jim's from zero to full in 30 days.
How do we do it?
I got four cases, you can download for free walk through the whole thing.
That's my offer.
Okay.
Now there's always an offer.
Okay.
3:23
Second thing is always the deadline.
I'm actually not really making my role there.
You can download this free ones whenever but But we do have a deadline because our prices increase every like eight weeks.
So she's either pants less of the services that we do then do it sooner rather than later.
3:39
Okay, so first, there's an offer second.
There's always a deadline third clear instructions, I said, go to gym, or secrets.com for / quiz, which is where you can download the free case studies.
Hopefully it is clear instructions.
Now, when you have an offer, that's like a direct mail piece, it would say like step one go like This to the short code or call this number or whatever, right.
4:04
If you're making an ad on Facebook, it should say, click then opt-in, right?
Like super simple but people don't know what to do.
Like, you have to let him know what to do next because they're like, all I want to do that.
But now what I want to do like I can't tell you the amount of times before I was doing this, people would comment below my and be like, I'm interested and it was because I didn't tell him what to do.
4:23
I was like, here's this amazing offer.
I spent all this time on this copy and I was like, hey do you guys want it?
And they would be like, I'm interested.
And I'm like, dude, click the link.
But I had to say that because I didn't put it in the copy.
Okay, so one you have a deadline sir one you have an offer always have an offer.
Okay.
Second you always have a deadline three you always have clear instructions on what their next steps are and what it's going to look like.
4:43
And what's nice about this is that the more the experience that they go through is in sync with exactly what you said.
The more they're going to inherently it subconsciously.
Trust you already because what you said was going to happen happened, okay?
For this kind of overarching statement, you never spend money on branding.
5:00
The only branding that you're going to have is going to be from people seeing your direct marketing materials and like the point of marketing materials is to make you money and if it doesn't make you money, which branding doesn't because there's no way of tracking it which is number five must be trackable.
5:19
Then you don't know what you're doing.
You're literally just shooting money into the dark, right?
So any marketing company that tells you hey, give us money and then there's no way that they have for you to measure whether or not something is effective run, the other way as fast as you can and tell all your friends to not be with them.
5:38
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
5:59
Okay, you can ask any one of the clients that I have.
I got on the phone with someone yesterday who have been in a mastermind, you've heard of them and spending two thousand dollars a month, okay, been doing it for six months and I was like, awesome.
How much is your business grow?
And they're like, what do you mean?
6:14
It was like, well, you start like they sold you on the fact that you're going to make more money in your business.
And I was like, this is six months ago, what are you making dent?
And I was like, what are you making now?
Just like, wow.
I don't really think about that.
I was like, asked any of the people we work with and they will give you to the penny how much money they have made more since they've been working with us, okay?
6:37
Like you gotta have that, all right?
So it has to be measurable.
That's number five.
Six, whenever you have an offer, you have to have follow-up.
And I'm going to explain another podcast what perfect follow-up looks like, okay?
But you have to follow up with people.
Like if you just expect people to up, like some of the best offers in the world are free, but it's not because of the off people, like how can you get the hook to make money on something that's free?
6:58
There's A bajillion ways to make money on something that's free, but it's in the follow-up.
It's in how you ascend people, it's in how you increase people's awareness of your product and service and the problems they have in your ability to solve it that will dictate whether or not.
It's going to be successful and ultimately profitable for you and you know, good for them.
7:14
Okay.
Seven last one.
There will always be strong copy in this medium.
Copy has to be what I'm saying right.
But in the ads and the direct marketing materials that you are making Have to have strong copy right?
7:30
Like and like copy like so many times especially in the Fitness business.
I see guys who are just like this is why I hate huge opportunity ads.
Okay this is why I hate him.
Okay?
Huge opportunity.
We're looking for 15 people.
Like if that's if that's it, like that's not copy.
7:45
That's just someone who's super promotion aware and not problem.
We're okay.
And so what you get is a bunch of people were promotion aware and not aware of the problem that they're trying to solve.
And so when you're trying to position yourself in the market, place to someone who's going to be Be an expensive like which if you're working with me you should be the most expensive in your workplace.
8:03
There's no advantage to being the second cheapest.
In any Market Place, there is an advantage to being the most expensive, which anyone is listening.
We are the most expensive, just FYI, but we're also the best, all right?
But there has to be strong copy, all right?
8:19
Has to be compelling that has to hook.
People has to drive emotions.
It has to solve the problems that they think that they have.
Or if they don't have the problems, makes them aware of the problems with And then solve them.
Okay.
There's a sequence that you take someone through through persuasive copy.
It's like it's too soon to be filled in death to go through.
8:36
On this podcast, that I try to keep this short but those are the seven components of your marketing that is outbound as a gym owner or small business owner.
Okay?
So one if you don't always have an offer make one okay to there should be a deadline on that offer, always three.
8:53
There should be clear instructions for what a prospect needs to do in order to attain that offer and then after they had that offer, what you You want them to do next, OK?
In the copy that I have, I'm like, hey After you opt in, for the tree case, study there is going to be application page.
And if you want to hop on a phone call, we're not going to sell you anything promise, okay?
9:11
Like we literally just hop on the phone would like to get to know you like you have that option.
Okay.
So I let them know what's going to happen next.
And then the next page I said, hey thanks for applying just so you know all you gotta do now is schedule time to call and make sure you show up, okay?
Like and then after it's like each one of the things that's going to pre-frame the next step so they know what's going to happen.
9:29
People hate being surprised.
Actually, they hate bats.
Crosses people like it's friends but But people hate the unknown, because like the number one, fear people not knowing what's going to happen next.
All right, so always have an offer have a deadline.
Clear instructions.
No branding.
Okay?
Forget branding, never do branding again.
9:46
Five.
It has to be measurable.
You have to have a way of measuring your return on every single piece of marketing that you do.
If you don't have a way of measuring to turn your literally burning money, it's like it's insane.
Okay, don't do it.
Six, there has to be follow-up, okay?
You have to the process, you have to be choreographed experience that you're trying to take a prospect through to elicit, a certain result, okay?
10:07
Free stuff or whatever thing you want to do is a bait or hooker off or whatever.
It is like, you have to have a thing that like there always has to be a next thing.
The Next Step, otherwise, they just stopped.
And then they forget about you, you have to have a next step for them, which is why value letters exist, which is why I sentient exists for clients.
10:23
So if you don't have a cinch in your business model, I would strongly recommend doing that and then seven, there will always be strong copy.
You have to have words on pages that get people emotionally engaged, say yes and raise their hand and say, I want that and it makes this whole process so much easier.
10:41
All right, so we've had our 10 minute Mark.
I hope you guys have an awesome drive to work or between workouts sets, or whatever it is, or whatever people listening if you are Jim.
And you like Get from zero to full capacity in 30 days you can go to gym, launch secrets.com for / quiz, and download our for pre-k centers.
11:00
We walk you through how we do this process and if you want to hear my constructions, you on the next page, you can apply and will hop on the phone promise you won't sell anything for least.
Won't take your money.
If you do, you want to talk to us again after that?
Then we'll take the money.
Anyways.
Have an amazing, amazing day, and I will talk to you guys on this.

Hello, everyone.
I am wearing a Star Wars themed picking the brain shirt.
This used to be my favorite looking shirt for a very long time and I just found in my closet so I'm very excited about it.
That being said, if you were in the podcast and you were listening in And then you can just think of the coolest shirt ever.
And that is what I'm wearing.
So today, I wanted to make a fun presentation podcast for you and I'm calling it.
0:38
The six things that I would tell my younger self for opening up my first gym.
So I posted the other day picture of my first gym.
The first day I took, I can sleep like four days because all my equipment got there, like two days before I was planning on opening it.
And it was like disgusting was all I'm Dusty and nasty and like covered in dirt cuz I got it like off some you know, back.
1:00
The truck somewhere like it was, it was super sketchy.
But anyways, I like I needed it to be clean.
So I like I just things like I got it and I had to clean it.
Like 20 pitch took me forever.
So he was, I didn't sleep the night before my chin actually ended up opening.
But it was a, it was a fun ride and I'm glad that I have memories.
1:19
Now, what would I have told myself my younger self before, I'll be on my first gym tactics and theories.
I'll start with the tactics and I'll just Hammer them out really quickly, and then I'll kind of go into the theory, which I think is Maybe Be more important or more impactful for you tactically.
I would have said, don't do unlimited do three days a week, you'll double Your Capacity.
1:37
I would have said, don't open up as many sections as you can with the hopes you'll sign up more.
People only sent only open up session from you already know they're going to be full.
Make sure that your prices are like between 170 and 210 for your lowest session.
And if you want to offer something private, you need to have it between 500 and 700.
1:54
And then I would have kept myself in the head and then like, don't worry you can you can do it.
Those are like the immediate tactical differences that I would have done and then I would have said Bill Bill weekly not monthly so you can make more money that way.
But those are like those are the very easy tactical things that are pain in the butt to fix after the fact.
2:14
But like, if you can start out right?
And just say we're doing three days a week, you don't have unlimited.
You have a semi private session that is 500 to 700 dollars a month which works out to like a buck 25 to a buck 75 a week, the weekly that would cover most of the initial, you know, front end huge.
2:29
Mishaps that I had and lots of mistakes that I made in the meantime.
Now from a theory perspective this is actually something I'm more interested in sharing with you.
There's probably just two things that I would that I would ask myself to consider and it's just that when I started out everything that I thought about was making money, making sales and so I came into it.
2:51
I did I honestly really didn't have.
I mean I like Fitness for myself but within the first month I realized that I wasn't actually training people to you know, treat Young dudes to get jacked.
I was really helping, you know, 35 to 42 year old women lose weight.
It's a lot different.
3:08
And so, very quickly became about money.
And so, the two things that I would have said to myself is first, you need to actually like your customers.
And you need to embrace the fact that the reason that you don't have people storming into your gym right now is because you aren't that good, and that's something that I would really. really have tried to like take the heart and maybe I would only have listen to like my older self saying this but like for the gym server on here, if the one of the things that bugs me the most is when people are like, I have such an amazing gym, my facility, so huge, our culture's amazing, our communities, great blah, blah, blah.
3:46
All right, so we just can't get people in the door.
I'm like, do you understand like the the conflict there that doesn't make sense, right?
Like if it were so amazing, people would tell everyone they know about it and then your gym would be full and so there's this thing where we want to like protect our own Egos and say like we're doing so well.
4:07
We're so good.
The reality is, you're probably not, you know what I mean?
I always like thinking, like half the gyms who are, who are in this group are below average.
Right?
Like half, the gyms are below average and a like, well, that's not me.
Like, you have to, like, think about that.
4:23
And the thing is, even if you're above average, it doesn't mean you're good, right?
And there's a difference, like, you can be above average, you can still not be good and in, in a, in a day and age where you can call category economics, but basically economics of any category flow to the king of that category.
4:41
So you look at Amazon, you search socks, right?
In the first thing that comes up has like two thousand, five star reviews, The next thing on Earth that has a hundred five star reviews, then after that, there's nothing right?
And so the king of the category, gets the Lion's, Share of everything else and the rest of the guys on there, like, man, my socks are so good, right, but they're not good enough.
4:59
And so I would have not focused as much on and this might sound crazy for me for me but like I would not have focused as much on the marketing and sales and would have focused a lot more on what we could have done to truly create a memorable.
Unbelievable experience.
5:17
Till you get people coming in repeatedly and on a large scale, bringing in their friends and family, then you know that you still haven't succeeded yet.
And so I would kind of reset that bar for myself.
So that would be kind of like a belief that I would try to attack them.
Like yourself is that like you're not that good is what I probably would have told myself that you're not that good like you think you are but you're not maybe you as a trainer or your knowledge of whatever is but the business that you created and the experience that you've created for your end users, It isn't good enough that they actually want to bring their friends.
5:49
Like, you can ask for it but like SoulCycle, okay.
Soul cycle does not have an EFT.
They do not have recurring memberships, what they relied solely on an exercise experience?
6:05
That was so good, that people would come and then they would come back.
They would come and they would have, they couldn't help, but tell their friends, and their family, and their co-workers about how amazing their work I have in the morning if you listen to the Can you hear them?
Talk about it?
That was their entire when they started the business they had already had that intention was how can we make an experience so good?
6:24
So memorable.
So exceptional that people can't help but tell everyone they see the rest of the day about that was their goal.
And so if you were to set your goal like that rather than think like I need 10 more, you have to use this month, I just needed extra, I just need an extra 20.
I need extra two grand this month or whatever it is, right?
6:41
And that's just focused on you not on your customer if you were like, how could I if I was not allowed to move?
Mark it, how could I create an experience?
That was so good.
So amazing.
So five-star that everyone would tell everyone else about it.
7:00
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world getting.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now.
It'll take you less than 60 seconds.
7:16
And like I said, Only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many entrepreneurs and possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the shop.
Chipotle doesn't Market, they don't need to their food.
7:34
So good.
That people, like you've never been to Chipotle.
We're going for lunch today.
I can't believe you've never been into quality.
I used to pull up syllable.
I feel like.
That's, that's the point.
So, like if there was the first point that I would have told myself is that you're not that good and Only by accepting the fact that you're not that good.
Will you be able to grow?
7:50
And if you only think, like, if you had to handcuff yourself and say you cannot mark it, you cannot sell, like, you can only get more people.
Like I created an experience, that's truly exceptional.
You would probably take more effort in how you're approaching the class, is, what is the first five seconds of?
8:08
Like, what?
What are the exact things?
The trainer supposed to say?
What energy, they're supposed to have where they wearing.
Where is everyone located in the room?
Are they saying hi to each other?
are you greeting Everyone by name like there are all these things that we would probably do if we were trying to be better but we just don't So that would be the first thing that I would tell myself.
8:26
The second thing that I would tell myself, is you need to hire an operator.
And this is something that I, I did not do nearly early enough and I didn't understand the importance of it.
And so what I ended up just I always just ended up to I always ended up trying to pay people less than they were worth and get more out of them and that was a mistake that I made early on for a while.
8:50
So I'm not saying like I made this mistake for a long time.
And the reason that Jim wants has been able to grow at the speed that it's been able to grow as because I wasn't the one running the operations, and because Layla is better than me at a lot of things in this is one of them, and I've learned a lot from her and I know that if we were to like open a gym together like she and I it would be a totally different experience than the gyms that I had, which were very much sales-oriented marketing-oriented, just I just knew the numbers.
9:18
The client seems just like it was just just bringing bodies in and stacking cash.
And that was that was and to be The business was reflection of who I was as a business owner at that time and I would tell you that your reflects your business is a reflection of who you are as a business owner at this time and for your business to grow, you will have to grow and then your business will grow as a reflection of your growth and so Layla.
9:40
And so for like I said the second thing I would tell myself is like hiring operator hire a great operator because if you have this big vision of what you want this to be, you're going to need someone to operate that you're going to need someone to have the infrastructure and help.
You create that?
Because typically the skills that the skill sets and the characteristics that go with being an entrepreneur, or a Visionary or someone who's who's like trying to rip their green, their future and rip it into the present and what they want.
10:07
You know, creating a dream and making it real that personality type typically is not the type of person who's really good at details and meetings and communication Cadence's and he mails and billing all that kind of stuff.
And so, but it's really important from a Experience the point that all those things are dilated or on point.
10:27
And so I would have said hired amazing operator as soon as you possibly can and pay them what they're worth.
And so that would have been in someone's, like, well, what do I pay them?
I would probably say if you can try and start somewhere at like high 30s, 40 Grand, a year and then go from there.
10:45
You know me every Market is different so I don't like you said it's like just use your better judgment.
These are going to be blue really managing your business.
Des and they're the really the ones that are going to be responsible, like the Mother Goose of the business who can, who can hopefully balance your entrepreneurial spirit with like true care for your customers.
11:05
Like the reason that Jim wants like I said, is what it is is because like we have like an entire team of like moms and I hope I'm not trying to sound sexist but like we have like a whole team of moms who like take care of our gym owners, you don't?
I mean, I probably am I'm really not that good at customer service a lot.
11:23
Because I am not patient and I am not detail rates a lot of times.
And I would fail people even with the best of intentions.
And so, it's just being candid with yourself and knowing what you suck at and then aggressively hiring against that and hiring people who really are good.
11:38
And so, like the first thing that I said that I would do is understand that.
I'm probably not as good as I think I am.
And really heavily invest in thinking, like, how can I make this customer experience so good.
So amazing.
That if I had no ability to Market, That people would be banging on my door and that would be just kind of like a belief shift that I would have tried to tell myself that's the first thing.
12:00
And the second thing is if I had an experience that was that good where I had this desire to make any experiences out good, I would need someone who's going to be able to run the systems in the infrastructure to support that that dream.
And that comes from somebody who's usually a very different personalities that can usually not the type of person that you would initially, like, you don't know, mean, like, typically the people who are super detail oriented and like, Not always people who you immediately would be.
12:25
Like, I'm going to be buddies with this person, that's not always the case, but sometimes you have such great working chemistry that you can make something really magical happen.
And so it would really be following finding that first follower who really buys into the vision who really really cares about your customers.
12:41
Even, like, almost to the point.
We were like, sometimes I worry if they care more than I do, you don't, I mean, you want someone like that, whose Mother Goose, and who will go above and beyond not for the money, the money needs to take care of them so that they can get out of scarcity.
Ade so that they can not think about money and so that they can be 100% present in your business, taking care of your customers.
13:00
So and that person also needs to be like fairly dominant, like d character because they have to be able to oppose you and say, no.
And you need to listen.
And that's probably the last.
The last thing that I've learned in the two years of scaling, Jim launch has been learning to listen to people telling me.
13:18
No.
And like, everyone wants to be like I've just guns firing entrepreneur.
I say how Is I call the shots like most times.
I just get people to most times.
People just tell me.
No.
And you have to be okay with that and and it's not always know, it's just like yes, but not yet our yes.
13:33
But not now and being okay with that and saying like pool what do I need to do to help to make you feel better about being able to do this thing?
So if I had to go back in time, I would obviously give him this little quick tactics of film Bill weekly have three times a week.
Be your main session that you're selling.
13:50
So you can double Your Capacity or any capacity issues.
Sure your price point between 170 to 10 and then between 500 and 700 for.
So my privates there is no man's land between 210 and 500.
There's no point in having it and then make sure that you can fulfill at least 24 people per hour.
14:08
That those would be the things that I would have said told myself tactically but realizing I wasn't good enough and really, really heavily investing in the customer experience would be the first one and then having an operations person who I valued cherished and respected.
Their opinion in their skill set and saw as an equal to myself not as an employee would have been there that second key to growth that I would have told myself much, much, much earlier.
14:33
So, I hope that was not to, to Tactical or to find this guy wanted to, like, I couldn't, I was, I was gonna make a list of like a bazillion things that I have learned since then.
But if they were probably two that I would have boiled it down to that, I would have told myself before starting my first gym thought about it.
14:50
So anyways guys, I hope you found this valuable Drop a comment or drop a like so that someone else can hopefully find it valuable.
But otherwise have an amazing day and amazing week and I'll see you guys soon.









Company0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Let's go on and everyone.
Happy Thursday, I am.
0:31
I am having a gratitude filled Thursday like creamy gray skies here in Austin but I can't help just but feeling just a huge sense of gratitude to this community and forever you guys for you guys who tune in every day.
So thank you so much for your attention.
0:47
So I just wanted to start by saying that and I wanted to bring up something that is kind of near and dear to my heart and something that I've been kind of like mulling over a lot that I think has been useful for.
Jim Morris that we have.
And so, this originally started from Sarah Goosen, actually, she posted something in the Legacy group Dr. Jim larger of our highest level program about how right now she's she's bored and she's like, I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
1:15
I'm just, I'm just bored now with the business and what she meant is that like, you know, in the last year, she's doubled or three extra her.
Jim, she has an operations manager has come in and, you know, systems were being Being worked and you know planes are taking off and arriving on time.
1:34
And what happens is that that does kind of get boring and the difficulty is that as entrepreneurs we like to do new things, right?
And so I was at this event last week, it was for companies doing like 10 to 10 million a year, was the minimum that you could be doing in revenue.
1:50
And so it was really interesting because it was CEOs and CFOs that were in attendance there and they had a state personality profiles and basically they like assess everyone who's there.
R and you know, my personality profile.
The guy was like your a ramrod and I was like, I guess that's okay.
But he's like you're a launch persons like you just make new things and I don't like being categorized anything.
2:12
So I think identities fluid and skill sets are too but it was just an interesting thing to have someone from the outside reading assessment and then go in that direction now.
The reason that I titled this.
How to harness boring is that if you notice a lot of the messaging that we've had, even in our marketing is being around, being boring.
2:30
And I think that one of the hardest things that had one of the hardest things that I've had to learn is embracing boring, boring business boring, but rich.
And the reality is that a lot of people when they come to us, have fires and explosions going on in their business, all around them, all the time and the reality is that you should want a boring business.
2:52
It should feel boring.
Because boring means consistent, right?
In the marketplace rewards boring, like McDonald's has really mediocre food.
And honestly, the prices aren't even that good, right?
But it's the same and people value the same.
Because a lot of people don't like change.
3:08
And so, when they can have consistency and experience, that is something that is valuable, it's tangibly valuable like it's something that people pay money for one of the offshoots of like kind of embracing this concept of being born.
But rich and having a boring business, but wildly profitable but still boring.
3:24
Right.
Is like, here's just a couple examples like Chipotle, right?
They've been around 20 years has only added two things to their menu.
In 20 years, they added case only edit so Freitas, right?
That's it.
And think about the level of growth that they've had as a company, if you're going from, you know, a few locations to, you know, 2,000 plus privately held because of boring.
3:48
But consistently amazing food.
And so, if we can take that analogy and look at our gyms and say like, how can we become boring and consistent?
What you can do is you need to take your Innovative side, right?
He told me I'm a launcher, right?
Like I always want to launch new things and how can you apply that personality type to a business that needs to be boring, right?
4:09
You're boring.
Your business needs you to be boring in order for it, to have stability in order for it to be consistent in order for it to improve, right?
And that consistency is also how you show up to your team because if you're like hot one, A cold another day.
Your mean one day.
You're nice.
One day, you're Moody.
Whatever.
4:24
Like if you show up like that, then we think your team's going to be a they're going to be in a threat mode because they see this happening all the time and they're like, I don't know what's going on, right?
And then that's going to relate to your customers, your customers are going to feel that same thing.
But the second line that I had here is why better leads to bigger is that a lot of times we as entrepreneurs want to force growth right?
4:44
And that's why I'm a big you know I advocate very aggressively for Jim's that we work with.
I get Them usually to downsize in the beginning, which is crazy, because most gurus and whatever.
Like, open more locations, it makes me look better.
But I tell people to actually cut down on the amount of locations they have.
5:00
If you have three cut down a tooth have to cut down on one.
And then let's make this one incredibly profitable because most the gyms that we encounter who have two or three locations or five locations and I'd like I am in no way impressed by how many locations you have.
I want to see how much profit you're taking home, right?
And what happens most times people have profit and they open a second one because they don't know what to do with themselves and then they put them.
5:20
I was in a state of overworking because that's where they're most comfortable as an entrepreneur is just working all hours of the day and then winds up happening.
Is that the profit from one location?
Dips down the revenue, total is higher because there's two locations with the actual profit take of either goes down or stays the same and now you have twice the liability and twice the work, the same amount of profit.
5:37
So what we do is say like, hey let's see if we can get this one location to to and thousand a month, right?
And so, that's now we're we've got plenty of guys for over 100,000 a month, Mark.
And now they're shooting for the 200,000.
I'm a park with one location, right?
Profit.
Now, why say why better leads to bigger?
5:53
Is that your Innovation should be targeted around becoming better, not bigger because what happens is, if you are better than you will become naturally bigger because the product and the service that you're providing is so good that people can't help but tell their friends about it and then you grow, right?
6:12
And so, one of the beautiful things about being a market leader in the, hopefully, you will aspire to be market leader.
You already think you are Market leaders, whatever.
Is that like Like, we can't like a gym laundry.
I have known to look at.
Like, I have no one else's business to look at to try and model because like, we're ahead of everyone.
6:29
And so it puts me in a situation where we're like, where do you go?
Where do you go for inspiration?
Right?
So a I look at people in other Industries to see what they're doing.
The biggest source of innovation for you will come from your customers and it's because your customers will never be satisfied.
6:44
And it's one of these beautiful things where a lot of us lament that.
So we get sad or down on ourselves or the Worst thing you can do is start hating your customers for complaints, right?
Because think about it, Amazon still gets complaints on the fact that I ordered Prime and it didn't show up today, right?
7:02
That would be inconceivable five years ago, right?
But now because customers will never be satisfied.
As soon as you run the 4-minute mile, they just expect the four-minute mile every single day, and if you're not comfortable with that, then you should probably not be a business, right?
7:18
But if you can expect affect your customers, are not going to Satisfied ever.
Then you can take your Innovative personality in your desire to make new things and targeted around making things better not new, not new programs, not anything.
Just make the thing that you have makes the burrito that you have, make the food that you're serving, consistently amazing, right?
7:39
How can we make this more consistent help you make this more?
Excellent.
How can we make this?
So boring?
That it never fails.
We never have planes crash, we never have trainers who are not in a good mood.
We never have a front desk, girl.
Who doesn't smile and greet people by name?
How do we do that consistently?
Real quick guys.
7:57
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
8:16
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so like first you have like, hey we got the plate at home.
Run, cool.
How can we replicate that exact process?
8:31
How can I have my sales?
Guys, be hot every single day, not just one day and then there, you know, mediocre and then suck or they're only good for a week or two.
And then they have another two weeks of down.
Like one of the questions that we get is around sales is like I feel like your sales team is always so good.
8:47
It takes time.
It's a skill set to acquire to learn how to run a sales team and motivate a sales team properly.
Luckily, Dylan is an amazing sales director who we've had internally, and he pours into the sales team and fosters a culture that is, that is collaborative and competitive and awesome and amazing.
9:07
Right now, we bottled lightning, which is like, the rarest thing ever is having a team that's just crushing the way it is, but it takes time, right?
And so it's like, man, I wish all of these things would be better.
That's what you should focus on.
Not like, hey, I want to open a second location right now because this one's working.
There are so many places that you can improve your current business.
9:24
Make more profit and give a better customer experience so that it grows because if right now the business is not growing organically as in the amount of people who leave versus the people who come in without e-marketing.
If that is a net negative that it means the business actually, still is not that good and you should be able to confront yourself and look yourself in the mirror and say like, okay then I need to improve it.
9:47
I don't need to open something new to scratch, my itch has an entrepreneur, right?
I need to take my stitches and entrepreneur of Ocean and targeted towards every single thing that my customer is dissatisfied with.
And believe me, there's always tons of stuff Jeff Bezos needs to get people to like, click it and then have it appear on the front door within 10 seconds.
10:05
Like, that's what he's trying to figure out how to do with Zone.
Drones dropping things all over it like because if you start with what your customers want, they will always be to satisfy.
You always have problems to fix, right?
And if you can continue to focus on being better and not new, then believe it or not, it may seem boring.
10:21
But boring is what will make you rich, right?
And so the last one that I have here is why better is better than new in business and not marketing is that when you're marketing, the two most powerful words and marketing are new and free, right?
And so the idea is that you want to make things that are the same seemed new and different different is what catches people's attention Improvement does not.
10:47
So that's why Improvement offers are not very good from a marketing standpoint, right.
New opportunities are things that people are really Really interested in and then that will catch their attention.
And so what I'm saying is not something that will apply to marketing but it's a it will hide how you actually run your business and so if you look at every single process and every touch point that your customer has or doesn't have.
11:08
So for example, right now, if you're like, well we don't reach out to our customers on a regular basis.
Hmm.
Maybe a shed right?
Maybe that would drive her attention right now.
We don't track our attendance and we don't like follow up with people if they haven't shown up in three days.
Hmm, maybe you should maybe that'll make you more money and Improve their experience, right?
11:25
And so, it's okay to be bored.
I just want to say that.
It's okay to have a boring business, it's okay to be like, I don't know what to do right now.
Things are working pretty well with my gym.
Awesome, take your Innovative personality type and just make it better.
Doesn't need to be new, you don't need to have like, totally doesn't need to start offering burgers or enchiladas or, you know, whatever, right.
11:48
Like they don't need to offer that stuff because they just focused on making their process.
Even more streamlined, right?
They first, they had double meat and you could always get away half the time.
They wouldn't charge you double because they had to transfer it later play.
Banana Phone for ways down the down the download the line, right?
12:05
And half the time it wouldn't get there and so you get double mean you're like right and then some smart person decided to take one of those little cups, put it upside down, and put it one on it.
And then everyone knew that there was double me.
And now they have these little tabs or whatever.
Because now corporate took hold of it and actually put like, a really legit process in place for it so that it never happens, right?
12:23
So what Is that are small like that, because the devil is in the details, right?
It's in consistently having planes that take off and don't crash.
Because the thing is that even if one out of every, 20 classes isn't good, it only takes one bad class to get someone and not come back.
And so, like you're the, the emphasis has to be on how can we minimize these extraneous situations because we take pride in the fact that hey, my planes, take off on time 90% of the time.
12:50
Well cool.
But how do we prevent the 10% because realistically, Lee, the 10% has such a negative impact on lifetime value and customer feeling that it can actually, like 10% negative experiences will drown a business period, right?
If one out of ten experiences is - you probably heard Disney says, every, every for every tragic moment, you 39 magic moments, right?
13:11
In order to compensate that for that.
And the reality is that what you really need to do is just never have tragic moments.
And the way that you do that is by being boring is by embracing boredom is by embracing process embracing that it's Going to be new every day, it's going to see how can we make this better?
13:27
How can we make this simpler help you make this more streamlined?
How can you make this a better experience for end users?
And so if my ask for you is to is to like, give yourself an honest look first question to ask is, do we have more people leaving our business then coming to our business organically from word of mouth?
13:44
If the answer is no, then it means that the business needs to improve, right?
I mean, no matter what the business can improve, but that's a great golden ratio as a benchmark, because when you achieve that, then you mean You have achieved viral growth, right?
And then like, that's one of the things that we've been able and it's like bottling lightning.
14:00
That's why there aren't that many successful businesses.
If you're like, man, that sounds really, really hard is because most entrepreneurs can't focus long enough, right?
I can't tell you, man of people who come into our world, even at this, at this last event that we want to with the 10 million dollar-plus businesses.
14:18
Through the the CEOs came and there were a ton of them, had three or four businesses and they lined us up in terms of net profit and we had nine times the net profit of the second highest business 9 x 9 x net profit.
14:33
Right?
Because they have Focus, right?
They have all these other things that they're focusing on their splitting their attention because it's new and it's exciting.
And it's interesting.
But you have to break that because what took you from 0 to 1 is not what's going to get you from 122, like, what got you to start your gym and being new and exciting and starting new things and new programs, and whatever, he was new to you at that point.
14:55
But now that you're in your skill set and your identity as an entrepreneur needs to change and what you're focusing your attention on, has to be boring things, that's where you need to get your Innovative pitch out because it's the only way that your business will actually improve and grow.
So anyways, I hope I hope some of this resonated with you and as a as a final side note to that, The fact that customers will always be dissatisfied should be one of the most heartwarming things in the world because what it does is it gives you endless stream of things to improve on.
15:26
It gives you an endless stream of things that you need to do as a business owner to keep up.
And for me, it's heartwarming and you shouldn't take it personal.
I have people in Legacy all the time, who give us ideas opportunities for improvement of things that we could do better?
And that's okay, I'm telling you right now, like it, like we are not perfect but like I'll be damned if we won't try to bit and we will never get there and That is why business is not a game of winning.
15:50
It's a game of seeing how long you can play the game of outlasting.
There is no winning, there's no winning.
That's why I like if there's one podcast or video that if you haven't listened to it, listen to it.
It's called The Infinite game.
It's kind of theoretical but it's it was one of the concepts that fundamentally shifted, how I saw our business.
16:09
And what I look at in the in a 20 year time, span of like what we want to do because the goal is not to win, the goal is to be here 20 years from now on.
Same business, right?
And the only way to do that is to Outlast the way that Outlast is become better and to finally achieve a golden ratio where more people refer people to your business than leave.
16:28
And at that point, the growth will happen on its own.
You don't need to force it to give yourself a new thing to do, but it'll happen on its own.
So anyways, I hope that's comforting for you.
Never complain about your customers, your customers, or your biggest source of innovation for you.
16:44
So take that to heart and I hope this doesn't sound preachy.
That's not my intention at all.
I love you.
I'm so grateful for this community.
Thank you guys for your attention.

And if you're in this group and you're not under much, you're missing out.
17:02
Anyways, lots of love.
Have an amazing day and I will catch you guys on, all right.
That's not my intention at all.
I love you.
I'm so grateful for this community.
Thank you guys for your attention.
And if this resonates with anyone, you know, drop a like, drop a comment, we always appreciate it.
And if you're in this group and you're not under much, you're missing out.
Anyways, lots of love.
Have an amazing day and I will catch you guys on, all right.0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Everybody happy Monday.
Hope you guys.
Guys are having a very productive caffeine fills.
Nicotine filled start to your week if you only have your nicotine.
That's cool too.
So I just hope you have an energized, start your week.
0:40
So my sales manager done was like, 32 me.
So directory.
Dylan was like hey bro do you think you could make a sweet video about how to break through EFT plateaus?
And so, I thought I would use a nice sexy title like how to stack EFT is for real and the three ways to grow it.
0:57
So, I basically break down all the math behind this, so hopefully you don't get bored with this but where you can start, if you're trying to look at how to break through EFC, plateaus is just understanding how the ESU Works in general, right?
And most people don't know this like who even own a gym and have a recurring Revenue model.
1:15
So first, I'm going to show you the equation and then I'll throw you through is to grow.
Cool.
Awesome.
So for those of you who are in my world, I call this the by equation.
And the reason I call the supply equation is because I figured it out when I was cutting.
Really like pies in a sort of look like a buck.
1:31
But anyways the way that it works is this right?
The top of the equation you can split into two pieces.
All right you've got referrals.
People who come in and sign up because their friends told them about it and the other side is got cold traffic.
Okay, people who come in off of promotions Etc, right.
1:50
And these are only going to be people who sign up for EFT for recurring.
Not people who signed up for your friend and offer challenges Little Bear entry offers whatever right?
Just people who sign up for tfts, all right?
And then the bottom here, you're going to have your attrition percentage, okay?
For those of you don't know what that is.
2:06
It's just the percentage of people who leave each month.
So if you had 100 people, People who were on your EFT last month and not including new signups of those hundred, ninety of them were left at the beginning of the next month.
Then your attrition would be 10%.
2:22
New signups do not factor into your attrition percentage.
So you know First Billing in July you have 100 people, those same hundred people are colored red and then in August, the next month of those red color, people 90 of them are there.
2:38
It's ten percent attrition, doesn't matter if you sign up.
Or people you still have a 10 percent attrition, okay?
Now let's let's let's dive into how this works.
Math wise, let's say you get two referrals, okay, this month little bit low but let's just say you get two referrals.
Let's see you get 80 of teas from cold traffic okay?
2:57
And let's see that your attrition rate is 10%, which is the industry average.
All right, so 10% is the industry average for people who have Micro gyms owner operated facilities.
And if you look at these numbers, these are all pretty average.
Which numbers for the industry.
Now, if you do the math here, I'll simplify this uses this actually becomes an addition site.
3:17
So it's 2 plus 8.
So you've got 10 signups over 10 percent attrition.
Right what that means is your gym will cap out at 100 EFTPS, okay?
So you can predict with a fair amount of certainty, what your EFT is going to be, if you tap if you change nothing.
3:38
And so one of the things that my team gets on me about is that they like joke that I like to see the future.
They're like, I like he said, six months from now, we would have 500 people in Legacy.
I'm like, yeah, it's math.
Even I mean like there's no magic around it.
And the nice thing is that when you look at it as cold heartmath, you can take your emotions out of it and just look at your business.
3:57
Emotionless lie, whatever, and then you can make decisions about it.
That makes sense and actually make you money, okay?
So this is the equation.
This is how you calculate your hypothetical Max for your EFT.
And if you know that you change nothing in terms of your sign ups, right?
4:12
This won't change.
Now, let's grow it.
Cool.
So, let's take the same concept.
Okay, now and let's say the first, we can grow, And then we'll see where caps up.
4:28
So let's say you join some badass program, right?
Let's let's call it shrimps launch, okay.
And in this program you know, you sign up for two people, 10 people a week.
On a front end defining program and you keep 75% in the back end which is with the average of people that we have do, right?
4:47
And so you have full, you came in on the front, right?
And then that means you had 30 people.
Oops, that's ugly.
Who ended up staying on EMTs.
Okay.
Now, you have Really on the top side.
But let's say that you have an improved your fulfillment at all, okay?
And your attrition is still 10 percent.
5:03
That means that you're looking at 30 over 10%, which means your new hypothetical Max is 300 FTS, okay, that's it.
Now, what happens though is if you look at this on a graph and you look at it month to month, what would happen is let's say you're at 150 stood a okay?
5:23
You're at 150, stood a that means that month one. one, you'll be at 130.
Right?
But - the ten percent from last month, right?
So you'll be at 1:30 - 10 because you're just taking your 10% of your original month before, okay?
5:39
So you have plus 30 on the top but - 10 % times last month, which was 100.
Okay.
So that means that you now have 120 EFTPS, okay?
That's month one.
5:54
So you grew by 20 even though you added 30 because you lost 10 Month to 120 is our last month number, right?
Which means that we're going to lose 12 when we do this equation again, but we had 30.
So we add 30 lose 12 and now we net 18.
6:11
So you can see the growth went from 20 month. 12, 18 month to now month three, what are we going to have?
So it's we're going to have 18 on top of 120.
So 138, right?
And then if you have 138 people that are in there, you're losing your ten percent, which means 14 right?
6:27
One thing about 13.8. 14.
Right?
So you have 14, people were gonna get lost this time.
You had 30 who's 14 now you only netted 16 as your growth, right?
And so what happens is your gross, your growth rate?
If you look at it on a graph two asymptotes, if you really want to get Matthew, it looks like this.
6:46
For those of you on a podcast, I'm showing something that's a direct line that goes up and it Smooths out as it approaches a hypothetical Mike's, okay?
So, 300 FPS would be here, right?
Which is your hypothetical Max, and you're going to go like this.
And then it slows down and then hypothetically never approach it.
7:02
So what happens is here?
But in you're going to see the majority of your growth in terms of crazy growth right here which will probably be in your first six months or so right.
And then you're going to be a 250 and then it's just going to.
And then it's going to start edging, right?
It's going to give, you know, you're adding 5 and that is adding for adding 3 getting to you don't, I mean, it gets really slow and again because the attrition percentage takes bigger and bigger chunks each month because when you have 250 of T's last month, right?
7:28
Or 10 percent means you're losing 25.
So you fill in 30, you lose 25, unit 5.
Now you have 255 now, you lose 25 or 26, this month, you don't have been in the unit for and so and then and and the the train slows down, right?
So the second way to grow your EFC scishow, do the first one to sign up more people, right?
7:50
The second way to grow your EFT.
Let's take the same numbers.
Now, in the original example, we said we had ten times two, referrals and ate cold traffic.
So we said ten times Now, the industry average attrition is ten percent, right?
So if you have ten percent, let's say you put that from 10%, right?
8:08
Because your staff, you decide to start reaching out to your customers on a bi-weekly basis.
You said it right handwritten cards once a month and you decide to track your attendance and call anyone who hasn't showed up by day three of the week.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
8:25
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, It'd be a good idea anyways I'm just saying don't mind me right?
8:47
But if you just did those two things you would measurably cut your attrition from 10% to 5% hmm might be worth it now.
Let's see how well worth it is, right?
So if you have 10 / 10 people that you're signing up that hasn't changed but then you cut your attrition in half your hypothetical Jim Max's 250s.
9:07
So we went from a hypothetical Max of a gym with 102, hypothetical Max.
With 200 we do Doubled.
The gym by cutting this percentage by 5%, it sounds.
It sounds like, hey, all I have to do is decreased by 5%, it's cutting in half, and that's why the math is so strong, right?
You go from 10 percent to 3 percent, it's going to be more than tripling.
9:25
Its going to be 333 if T's, which would be hypothetical Max, right?
And this is why this number gets really funky.
The lower you go, okay?
So let me show you, let me show you some fun, some fun stuff for armor, right?
This might be interesting for you, okay?
So Legacy is our top end program, right?
9:44
Right now, we sign up on average, about 45 people a month into like, see, okay?
I'm just telling you, the numbers is what it is, okay?
And right now, we have a 1% Sure.
Okay, so if we do the math here, then our hypothetical Max, right?
10:01
Is 45 divided by point zero one, who knows what that number is 4500 gyms and Legacy because the growth rate, because we don't lose people and that's what's key.
If we had a ten percent attrition, okay?
10:16
Just, let's just do the math here, right?
10 percent attrition were so sign up, 40, 40 45, people a month, right?
Just to just to demonstrate this right?
It means we only a 450 person Max in Legacy right now.
10:33
We already have 500.
So like that should like 450 of T's versus 4500 FTS by changing the bottom number going from 10 percent to one percent.
It's big it's important.
Okay so I told you that I would show you three ways to grow your basic right to stack it so hopefully you're tracking with me.
10:54
This thing is understanding the equation, right?
With what contributes to the top will contribute to the bottom.
And for those of you who always get confused with this because I always get questions about like, how do I calculate nutrition again, I'm going to write this one more time but I'll say it out loud.
As I do it.
It's you're multiplying.
11:10
Let's say you had this is July.
Okay?
Or let's just say last month.
Okay.
Last month you have 100 dfts this month, okay?
This one of those David.
You had 90.
11:26
That means you lost. 10%, that's it.
We're people get messed up.
Is they say, well, I also signed up 12 people.
Okay?
Because now I have 102 people in my EFT.
So I don't have any attrition.
I grew doesn't work that way, right?
11:42
So you have to separate the fact you're signups in no way affect your attrition okay?
It's how many people from last month that you build were you able to bill again this morning that's how you do it okay.
Just want to clarify that one more time because I get questions about it all the time and it doesn't need to be complicated.
11:57
Okay, so the Third Way to Grow the f t is to do a combination of both and this is really what we do in gym launching.
This is how like guys like Joey Huber right now, are adding 100, ft is a month.
I know that sounds crazy to some people who are on here, not in our world yet but like Joey has 600 dfts and right now, at his growth rate, he will be at 1000 within six months.
12:19
Pretty neat, right?
He is less than two and a half percent.
Turn at 600 ft.
He's okay.
Talk about scaling delivery, you have systems and process in place.
Are you reaching out to everyone on a regular basis?
Like getting injured and carts?
Are you holding an event of you?
Like these are things that everyone's like, oh, those are all I'll need.
12:36
That's how you measurably reduce churn that's that bottom number that massively multiplies.
How much you're getting right?
Okay, so let's, let's give maybe too realistic numbers because you're like, I don't know how we can go from 10% groups and that sounds crazy.
Okay, that's fine.
But let's just say you go from 10 to 5 and let's just say you go from signing up.
12:54
Ten people on EFT is about 220.
Okay, that's it.
So we went from 10 signups at 10 percent attrition, right to with shamash, right?
And keep them us, not be named right.
13:10
You go to 20 EFT is a month that you sign up and you cut your attrition in half, okay?
You're like, listen handwritten cards, own sound, something hard, some time consuming, they're not, if you have a system around it, but anyways, but you're like, you know what?
I'm going to call people.
You don't show up by Wednesday.
I'm going to start doing that.
13:27
I think that's a good idea and you're like, you know what, I'm going to I'm going to reach out to every customer that I have at least twice a month, just via text or message.
Just, that just the pulse, check to make sure they're alive in the lights.
That's all I'm going to do.
And so what that does, is it cuts your attrition from 10% 5%.
Then you say, you know what, I'm gonna start using climate Finance, the acquisition and start spending money, right?
13:46
Start making money in the acquisition.
So now I'm not limited by marking budget.
So I used to have to spend a lot of money lose money and then trying to recoup it in conversions but Now my bottleneck is really just my sales staff, right?
And so now I have 20 people per month that are signing up for EFT meat, but look how the equation change by going from 10 percent, sir, 10% and 5%, and then 10 to 20 on the top.
14:08
This is what happened to your hypothetical.
You have t.
This guy's hypothetically.
If T is 100, that's the industry, average.
That's what most people come to us with is around, 100, gifties, give or take.
Okay?
Now this new hypothetical Max, Is 400.
Yetis meat, right?
14:27
Can you play with math?
So these should feel realistic to most people.
These numbers are not crazy.
Five people a week signing up on EFT is not is not crazy.
Like this is really, really, super achievable for everyone.
14:45
Like everyone can do this.
All right.
Going from 10% to 5%.
Everyone can do that.
Going to go and step.
Three is More challenge.
You got to be really, really deliberate about.
You got to be consistent, you have to have the systems in place to get up, good Staffing, on a smile training, has to be on point.
15:00
All those things go from 10% to 5% is really just giving it giving a hoop.
Right.
And actually just trying to make sure that you talk to everybody, make sure that you Foster relationships, okay?
Just by doing that you for EXT, your gym, you didn't double it, you quadrupled it.
15:19
Hopefully, that makes sense.
So anyways, drop this up.
Dylan, your wish is my command.
I work for you now.
So does ourselves traffic.
Anyways, I hope this math give you a little bit more sense in terms of how to calculate your attrition.
It's last month.
How many people from last month?
15:34
I was able to build this month that is what the attrition numbers.
That's where most people get jacked up, seeing the power of lifetime value in how like going down by 5% doesn't doesn't just mean.
You make five percent, more means you double your gym, right?
Double, and then seeing the power of what, like, our finest acquisition can do to our gym.
15:54
And when you use both these things together, decreasing your chair, increasing your signups, how dramatically it can increase, the revenue that you're bringing it cool.
So hope that makes sense for you guys.
Some of my last few videos have been more attention, based more, you know, how to live as a gym owner or theoretical.
16:12
This is Hardcore math tactics.
This is how you grow your Janice.
I used a curiosity.
So anyways, have an amazing Monday everybody.
I hope you are.
Crushing your goals, living the dream and I will see you on the other side and like, you know, like comment, share tag, somebody who needs to know how to do the math.
16:31
All right, right?









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Everyone happy Wednesday, hope you guys are having a phenomenal week.
I'm coming to you from downtown us, actually not downtown.
We're actually like in a suburb of Austin, clumpy cave, it's very nice.
0:37
Anyways, um, I have not been making as much content recently as because we have a lot of huge things that are going on behind the scenes and usually when my attention is occupied by that, I don't think as creatively that being said I also have this big rule where I'm not going to talk to you.
0:53
If I don't have anything that I think is worth you, you know, worth your attention.
So with that being said, Day.
I wanted to bring up something that I think will provide massive value for you and it's one of the hardest habits that I've ever had to break and I still struggle with it and it's which is why I called this, why talk to your customers is losing money.
1:14
So a lot of people and the people and like, this is like the hardest thing in the entire world is that whenever I have a huge to-do list, I look at my to do list and part of me just wants to reach out to people who are in our group and just say like, hey, how's everything going?
Just checking in hope, you know, hope.
1:29
Everything's going well right.
And I know that you probably have this Habit to, right?
I mean, maybe maybe you don't maybe you're like screw them all.
But I had this huge huge that like, I love talking to you gym owners.
Like I am a gym owner and like they're like y'all are my people, you know what I mean?
1:46
And so it is the single biggest attention and time suck that I have.
And I would posit that.
If you do this, it's probably the biggest times like that you have or productivity.
Killer like if you have stuff that you need to do then you're like you know what, this is like and like the thing is is we tell ourselves we're like yeah this is super productive like I'm checking in and providing world-class service like I'm showing that I'm the owner.
2:11
Who cares who reaches out individually?
Yeah it's retarded.
That's just not true.
I mean it's true that you care but if you really cared that you'd be taking your time to scale yourself and be productive and help on a much larger scale.
And so, the reason I said that, why talking to your customers is losing money rather than white list?
2:29
Going to your customers is losing money, is because most of us do that.
We talk to our customers and then the like yeah.
Everything's going great.
Thanks so much.
And so we get this little dopamine.
Hit were like, yeah, we're good.
This person's happy.
I feel great.
You know, we only talked to our favorite customers because we know it's going to be good, right?
2:45
You don't reach out to the crappy customers, right?
It's like, you just focus on the ones who, you know, are totally drinking the Kool-Aid, I do this.
Alright, like it is literally, the hardest thing that I've had to break because when I have a huge list of stuff to do, I'd so much, rather just message jackpot and be like, hey man.
Hey How's life it's like it's awesome.
3:02
You know her like this Burning house like these like it's great.
We just did an extra 30 grand this month.
Like I'll top bar no more Revenue in like awesome like I love hearing it.
The thing is that it does not make me more money and it doesn't help me up more gyms and so if you were doing this you are hurting yourself.
So don't do it now.
3:18
You're like well don't do that.
Well, thanks Alex, appreciate that.
So here's some of the things that I did, I have done to actively try and protect myself against this habit, that is totally self-sabotage.
So if you have trainers and they do this, Like unless it is part of their role, they're doing the same thing and so I want to be clear here having amazing customer service is incredibly important, but having structure around that service and having structure on this communication Cycles is what will make it scalable system, eyes Apple, trackable and actually make it a business.
3:45
Whereas, if you're just randomly reaching out when you're, when you have a to-do list that you don't feel like doing right, you're opening up a communication line that really shouldn't be there.
Now, these people will reach out to you, and they really shouldn't write and then that's why you message that person.
In the two days later, they message you back about something.
4:02
That's really a customer service issue.
And you should be like, well, go talk to so-and-so, but now your dick, right?
And so, they've opened up this communication cycle that really shouldn't be there.
So, here's some of the things that I've done that massively helped me out.
So here's three things first thing is that, before I had an assistant, I told my head trainer I'd say, Hey, listen, when people message me, I'm going to say that you're on my Facebook and we say, Hey, you know, it's it's you know, it's Anthony whatever.
4:31
Alex, Alex actually doesn't check his social, you know, stuff anymore because he decided it was like a really big time suck for him so you could focus on the business form, right?
And I started saying this before I had the set and let's that actually does manage my social accounts and so she really does.
So if you guys have message me and it's like, hey thanks so much for messaging.
4:49
This is the said I will definitely pass this on to Alex or we're more realistically.
She says that's really a customer service teacher or that's really a billing.
You sure that's a really, a tech issue.
I mean, route you to the correct person, that's what she does.
And the same thing.
If you have weeds or things like that, that message we I have gym owners that message me all the time.
5:04
For friends of friends were like, hey, you know where I have a gym owner, who will route me?
Wrap me into a three-way conversation.
I can't that's like, we have a process in place for that, you know, I can't like, hey, can I have 10 minutes of your time?
So I can talk to you.
Like no, I don't want a person's instantly, talk to them.
Because if I hopped on the phone or in person interested, then we wouldn't have a business, right?
5:23
And so you have to discipline yourself because like part of me is like man, sure.
Like, let me hop on the phone.
I love talking to you.
Like, you know, potential new customers is great.
But it's a waste of your time, right?
It's gonna lose you money in the long run.
So break that habit.
So first one is have a fake assistant until you have a real assistant.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
5:44
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its hope free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight.
6:09
Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
When you have the real assistant, they can do that.
But in the meanwhile, you can route them correctly and you can give amazing world-class service through the guise of someone else.
So you can be like, absolutely what else can I do?
6:25
What else can I take care of it for you today.
Like, you can just have like, amazing people.
I wow, Lisette is amazing, right?
So use that it will really help you, all right.
The second thing is, I would 100% I don't have the Facebook app on my phone.
Okay, so you're like, hold on Alex, like, because everyone here is tried to down to uninstall The Facebook app and then they reinstall it.
6:47
Alright like, who's done that everyone has right.
So this is the work around the I figured out because we obviously have a ton of people who engage with us on Facebook.
That's where our groups are Etc.
So, what I have done is I take the app off my phone, but I allow myself to do it through like Safari because I have an iPhone.
7:03
So like just through the internet app and what you will find is that if you go to Facebook through the internet app, it sucks.
And so you won't stay there.
Like, it's literally miserable, like you have to refresh it cost, like, it does.
Suffer fresh to go to the top hit refresh.
And then it refreshes it and then like half the time when you hit reply on messages, it doesn't work and they do this on purpose because they want you in the app, right?
7:26
But you can use the fact that it's not as efficient.
Because what it does is it doesn't have all these dopamine triggers at the app.
Does if I turn the app on within, like, literally 24 hours, all I'm doing is friggin refreshing, right?
Because I'm a human and like I respond to dopamine, just like everyone else does right?
And so, I can either try and like discipline myself to not respond to that, which takes a lot of attention or just Don't install it and then have the internet.
7:47
Just go through the internet to get there and that way you can go in, get in and out, check your notifications, be done with it.
That being said, number one half on Facebook, never ever.
Look at your news feed, just don't do it.
Never look at your news feed.
There's no point.
Just check your notifications and be gone.
8:03
Like your notifications is your inbox.
Once you've like scanned it get off of Facebook, okay.
So first thing, have your fake admin until you have a real admin second thing up and give them world-class service wings.
People message you in on that second thing uninstall the Facebook app and access it through the internet on your phone, that'll get you to not be addicted to it, but I'll still help you handle your customers, third, which is really the really, the first thing is don't reach out to your customers, to just talk to them.
8:30
Because you have other stuff that you need to be doing.
Because you want to feel like you're giving world-class service, because you are not doing that, you were just servicing them by now.
Prep, like not building the business that you should be doing with that time.
All right, so like do not fool yourself.
You are not helping them.
You're not helping the business.
All you're doing is opening up communication cycles, that shouldn't be there, and then they start going straight to the owner first things that really should be handled by your trainer, or by your coaches, or by retention injury by front desk or billing or whatever, right?
8:56
So don't do that.
And then the last thing and this is like super, you know, if this is a college classes would be like 50 6w, like the second level or third level.
One of the biggest breakthroughs that I had in business, however, was the moment I, so when you, when you hire your first admin so for some of you guys have might be you're out.
9:15
Since manager will start as an admin and then Ascend up to an operation spinach, and then you probably can hire an admin just for yourself.
Is that I gave them my phone?
I literally gave until I was like, you are not working for me.
I was like, this is my fault.
That may not say, you can look in wherever you want.
9:33
And they were like, I mean, I didn't give anyone my number, like, my parents made appointments to talk to me, like I'm being very real with you and it was because I wanted to put a huge wall between me and the world so that I could focus.
He's right and maybe I'm just more ready than ever.
9:48
I had no idea.
I'm sure some of you guys are very dd2, but for me that was the single greatest leap that I had and productivity and being able to get things done.
And move the business forward, was the moment that I disconnected myself in my room.
And obviously, you can't do that tomorrow sometimes, but the moment you can do it.
10:03
That was the biggest thing that broke me, free from the talking to customers from having like my cell phone available to everyone, which I know that a lot of you guys have that situation because you started with your, oh, geez, there was only Sixty of them.
And you wanted to take care of them all personally because that was the heart and soul of the business.
10:20
The reality is that like shits changed.
You like, you have a business.
Now, are at least if you want a business, they can't all have your cell phone and so that needs to get passed on to someone.
And then when they're like, wait, this isn't his, you know, Alex is nobody more like no, unfortunately, like like Alex realized she was doing everyone a disservice, because all he was doing all day, was texting people from like morning until evening and he actually wasn't getting like the real thing.
10:45
That you guys need done and so as a favor to everyone he's disconnected himself and actually put someone who can give real attention to it and not be distracted and so that way you don't sound like a dick but you are also being truthful, which is that's why you did it.
So anyways, number 1 times s the entire world for an entrepreneur.
11:01
Don't just talk to your customers.
It is a huge waste your time and you're just doing it because it feels good.
So stop doing that.
I'm just all Facebook on your phone and then if you can give this to your admin and then New phone and don't give the number people.
11:18
I mean look like don't give the number of people.
Like I think it literally took six, maybe nine months for me to get my mother, my phone number and I know some of years, right?
Wow, that's really heartless.
It's not because my mother text and for a long time he texts me all day long despite what I would say.
11:36
And so I had to make a clear statement was like, you can't do this, like you have access to me, you can't abuse it and it took a really long time.
Her to get that.
And she recently understood it and that is why she has my cell phone number now and she understands that she can't have used that, right?
11:54
So anyways, I just want you guys to know it is the number one thing the world that I've struggled with and I hope that things that I gave you will help make you some more dollars and if you have trainers who fall into the same trap tag him in it, shooter like other Germans will see that you're not a bad person if you don't actively Facebook, message everyone back within 5 seconds because it shouldn't He messages and things.
12:16
All right, lots of love, have an awesome day and I'll catch you guys soon.0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, one of you want.
0:19
Hope you guys are having an amazing Thursday.
I will make this short but I woke up with this idea today or at least topic that was on my mind and it's tempting.
From one of the beta test that were running.
So if you don't know what we do is company is, you know, behind the scenes before we roll out any new execution or play Marketing sales, otherwise we'll test it out with 15 or so Jim's and 15, representative markets.
0:44
And at any given time, we have four or five different beta is going for different aspects of the business.
One might be, you know, how can we Cruise show up rates?
How can we get this page?
You can get better.
How can we, you know, increase the sales percentage and engine whatever, right?
And so we'll try out different.
Whatever it is and so we have made is going at any given time.
1:04
Now, what I wanted to talk about today, when I said the secret to our you know, explosive growth and for those of you who don't know, I think in the last I think it's I think we're almost at 24 months.
Yeah something like that.
Anyway.
So we've gone from zero to 30 plus million which if you look at like the Inc, 500 we would be number one.
1:24
We need one more year in order to hit that book that would be number one on the list.
I like to X or 3x so it's pretty cool.
That.
Anyways, the secret to our explosive growth comes from consistent.
High level of execution was like, well, yeah, duh.
1:39
But the story that I wanted to tell you to illustrate this is that one of the babies that were running.
All top secret.
Of course, I ran a competition internally and during that competition, everyone rushed their numbers for sales and then what's happened is that just in the last, you know, three three days or four days.
1:59
As the competition has ended, the daily sales have cut in more than half as a group collectively and it made me smile, but it made me realize.
One of the things that took me really long time to acquire, as a business owner was how can you have consistently high levels of execution across the board across departments every single day, day in day out, when you have competition, right?
2:26
Amongst yourselves or whatever, it's one of those things that Five teams forward, right?
And why does it do that because Focus, right?
It gets everyone to focus on one thing, which is why I'll talk about folks all the time because it's so powerful.
If you can double your sales by changing nothing except for focusing, it's pretty powerful, right?
2:42
And so I was like, what is it that gets us to focus.
You know, month in month out that doesn't need to have like a competition that we're running internal right?
The main secret is that like you have to genuinely believe that you're saving your prospects from a Marketplace that wants to take things from them.
2:59
And that's really what it comes down to everyone on the gym.
Launch Team genuinely believes that we are on a mission to save chips and that the rest of the marketplace is not equipped or does not have the intention of doing the same thing.
So, either they have the desire to do the same thing, but they do not have the resources to follow up on that promise or they don't have the desire to do, it's a follow-up or they don't have either of them.
3:24
And if there were one that did that, then they be having the same growth that we do which we don't see anyone else who is.
And so Any ways to kind of put this in a any ribbon for you?
If you look at your team and think like how can we like that's where like talking about.
3:40
So Layla talks about this all the time.
Internally is that culture?
Trump strategy, every single time, every single time Colter Will trump strategy.
And so the question is, how much effort are you putting into the culture?
If that's what's going to Trump your strategy, you can have the smartest business model in the world, but if your people don't have that drive, don't have that Focus.
3:59
Then nothing is going to happen, right?
Or it's not going to happen nearly as quickly as you want it to how can you elicit competitions?
Like, you can only run so many competitions internally, right?
You know me like you can run them then after a while people start to get used to it, right?
The only thing you don't get used to is having a drive to save because then it means that the problem is so much bigger than you and your company that you feel this constant pool to become bigger and to become better in order to solve the problem.
4:26
And so it's problem-focused.
And so right now, if you're not communicating Your team and your team doesn't have that conviction, right?
And that's why it's really important that you ask yourselves and you ask genuinely of your team, like, are we doing everything we possibly can to help these people.
Hey, most addition quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
4:47
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And sometimes you can get lost in the day-to-day which is why it's incredibly important to voice the vision of where you're trying to go on a regular basis.
5:11
We probably I mean we definitely do it monthly because we have our monthly meetings where I have the whole team and I kind of go for you know to kind of restate the vision because obviously we always have new people that are on board every month we have new people who possess we're growing and they need to hear it but also it's just kind of repeated on a daily and weekly basis just more incipits because you're always on Message.
5:33
And it's always talking about why we do what we do before we talk about how and the, what of what we do.
So I miss the next talks about like the power of Y and this is it because what it does is it unlocks that same drive that competition does.
But instead of competing against each other or thinking about your actual competition, which is totally a dumb idea, you think about competing against the problem, right?
5:56
And then you have a photo that's much bigger than you, right?
Like we're the biggest in the marketplace, by a Longshot.
People don't know that yet, right?
I mean, but like, we are by far.
The 800-pound gorilla in this Marketplace.
I can't look at our competition.
There's no coin.
So we have to look at the problem, which is still much bigger than we are.
6:11
And so if you always look at the problem and the team genuinely believes that you really are trying to solve the problem, that's a big point.
You can talk all day about how you're trying to solve the problem, but if they see how you walk, your walk isn't like how you talk, then they're not going to believe you, right?
But if you walk what you walk, because you genuinely do believe that and you articulate that to your team, Then you'll be able to have this consistent Focus because every single day when you get in the team meeting or like, how are we solving this problem, better?
6:39
How much of a dent only make, you know, how much, how much penetration do we have in our market right now?
In order to help all these people, get to, where they like, where they needed, right?
If you talk like that because you genuinely are trying to solve that problem, your team will get on board with you, because they're going to believe that they're doing something for like greater cause which they are.
6:57
And they should be as long as you don't lie, right?
And don't lie because they will know, Right.
So that's kind of that, that was what was on my mind this morning because I saw that that huge competitive competitive drive that we had between the gyms that were in this beta test.
7:14
I mean, I mean, it was crazy.
The average gym at it at 12 and a half thousand.
Using this one play in 30 days to their gyms Revenue recurring, right?
Using one of these plays that we're doing.
And, and so like, I could see the daily sales every single day.
7:31
There were coming And and then like we ended that on Sunday and so I can see the last four days is about been about half of that and so it's just it's just something like, how can you Harnett like how do you bottle lightning, how do you bottle that you bought all that by attacking B, be competing against the problem without each other?
7:51
And I think that's really the secret.
So that's been secret to our growth is that I am a gym owner and I really do want to solve gym owner problems.
It's not a front or maybe I'm, you know, this is my lab.
Everett Evil Genius plan of but no, I'm a gym owner in.
8:07
Like I I slept on the floor for the first time on to my gym.
I know what that's like and it sucked and I was not a fan of it and I don't want anyone else to have to do that.
I feel like we've been given a position of power and I say power in a good way, because that's a lot of people have negative connotations around power.
8:24
We've been put in, we have a position of power.
We have resources, both Network wise and then also Financial that we can we can spend the night.
Homeowner can spend in order to solve problems that no one has been able has been able to solve yet.
And so it's really cool watching problems that have been that were huge in my life.
8:40
Get solved by the resources and the teams that we have now.
And so anyways, it's like I've I owe the industry so much because of how much it's helped me out.
And so that's the drive that we have as a company is to really solve those problems.
8:57
Like genuinely which is why when we do these beta tests like I could release.
All of the results.
But the thing is that sometimes when we test stuff, like it doesn't work, you know what I mean?
And if you know, something's going to work before you start it, then it's not an experiment and that's just basis, is words, not mine, but like 9 out of 10 times.
9:21
You're not going to hit a home run, if you go against conventional wisdom because conventional wisdoms, usually, right, right?
But a 1 out of 10 times, if we can hit a home run, that's worth 1000 runs.
Then it's big.
And so we've taken LM as a company is like, we're going to fail and we're going to fail, fast and fail all the time.
9:36
But when we do hit it and hit it big, we're going to hit it out of the park.
And so that's why we're trying to tackle really massive problems with in the gym business.
So, anyways, so that's just a, just a little side note about us, but that is our genuine drive and that's our goal.
And that's what we're trying to do.
And I appreciate all you guys hopping on it.
9:55
Seven something in the morning, to say, hello.
So it's up and make things coming.
Lots of guys try to unlock that talk to your team's tell him while you're actually doing this.
All right, have an awesome day.
Lots of guys try to unlock that talk to your team's tell him while you're actually doing this.

Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Happy Tuesday we're actually on no talk Tuesday which is a new thing.
We start addition wash meaning we don't have meetings going on which is awesome because everyone just gets to GSD get stuff done and So one of the things that have my agenda today was actually my son yesterday was to make this video for you guys and this comes directly from a report that was released by Zen Planner, which I highly encourage you guys to go check out like different industry reports because they're very telling just to see where the entire industry as a whole is obviously like that spans different types of Studios Etc.
0:52
But I thought the report that they had was really really geibel.
So and I just like having things confirmed, what we preach.
But anyways there were Things that were outlined that that market leaders do that the average gym does not do.
1:07
And so I kind of like I was originally thought like maybe I'll make a video about each one of them but I don't waste your time.
And so I want like, if it were me I would just want one day with all the findings so that you don't have to go through the 30-page report.
So hopefully that's cool that can save you some time.
So six things going to go over our pricing discounts space utilization, payroll commissions and Marketplace.
1:27
Okay so one of the Earnings that they have is that industry leaders.
So Jim's that make the most money charge more, hmm, what a concept and the average gym charges a hundred thirty, two dollars a month.
Now, this is different from the data that we pooled which was a hundred and eighteen dollars per month from all the gyms that we headed.
1:48
And obviously that could be a difference in what types of Studios there are pulling from.
But, you know, it's it was $14 different.
But anyways, just so you know, multiple uses, you know, multiple data sources but the industry average that Had was 172, which is in alignment with what we typically tell people to do is just a minimum, you should really charge the 167 a month so that was their average to.
2:10
I tend to skew a little bit higher than with their averages in terms of how much profit you should be trying to make per customer, but it's a good Benchmark or Brahman.
Now I think what's even more telling than the 40 dollar difference between the laggards or people who are less profitable versus the industry.
Leaders is the second point, which is discounts.
2:27
So, when they looked at what the The gym was offering as their membership average, right, 132 verses 17 to you, see a small difference there?
I mean, that small, that's a 30% difference but there's, you know, it's Ball parking right now.
2:42
When you look at the discounts and I thought this was probably like, of all the things I'm going to go over.
This is probably the biggest one industry leaders didn't really discount and so the average member at their gym was paying 142 per month.
So 172 is there is their average membership and then 142 is with their average member was pay.
3:00
Now guess what, the average laggard was paying or having their members pay, it was 72 dollars a month on average remember.
And so, what does that tell you?
It tells you all the likes when we tell the story of like most people who start their gym early on and they get all these people and they promise them a lifetime rate for being a Founder.
3:18
Right.
What that does is it just forever draws down and drag down your average.
You have t.
There's two ways to approach it.
One is you can fix it by like, filling up your gym first and then going back.
To those people and raising it and saying, sorry, we're at capacity.
Like I have to make these changes or you can make money tomorrow and just tell them that you want to raise the prices, we've done it both ways and you can, well it's nice to just make more money tomorrow but you can have your own beliefs around that you have to break.
3:47
That being said don't discount right?
Don't discount a lot of people do these backdoor deals because they're really just trying to like they're desperately, trying to close the sale, but what ends up happening is you just kill the profitability or facility and so you just perpetuate this issue.
Now, Just a side note on pricing, most people would then make the conclusion, so I'm skipping the number 6 on Marketplace data.
4:08
Well, these guys must be in markets for their alone or they're like they can control their own pricing blah blah.
You know, there's not a lot of competition, but it turns out and this is just directly from the report that the market leaders tended to be in areas that were the most populated with other facilities.
What does that tell you?
4:24
Tells you the best rice is the top is the best way to get really good.
Is to go to the jungle and cut your teeth with Like the fiercest P.
So if you can go to the most competitive marketplaces, see who's winning model that I'm going to totally to my all right now.
But when I, when I quit my consulting job, I went to Southern California, because I knew that that was the hotbed of fitness and I genuinely genuinely believe that I told everyone I was like, if I can make it there that I'll be able to make it.
4:49
And so that was the thought process.
And so I would implore you to probably use the same thing and if you're in a market, that's not super saturated than like, you might as well just use leader.
It's from the hotbeds of the fiercest competition, right?
So those industry leaders also had the true belief that their product and service was better intrinsically.
5:10
And so part of that is, you know, like the chicken or the egg like do they have higher prices and then that influences their belief about their, their quality of product or service?
Or does that enable them to have a higher quality product or service?
Or is it reverse that the height the the great quality product is what gets the hyper if you like, you can go either way?
5:29
Back and forth.
My belief is that the higher your prices, the more money you'll have leftover in order to reinvest in the experience.
And so then you actually do and are worth that higher price and the reality is that most people are willing to pay more, especially when we're talking about 30-40 percent more to have a much better experience, they just don't know that.
5:48
And so you just have to prove that to them, right?
And most people think that like initially when they're making the decision on the membership, like I can only afford X, which means this is only my only, my only 82 perceived value relative to my membership is at this rate and I have not been demonstrated value in excess of that.
6:07
And so it's your responsibility to show them and demonstrate excess far SAR value far, in excess of that.
So that they will then stay at that higher.
It's kind of like, you don't know until, you know, Most Nation real quick.
6:23
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
6:42
So anyways, so that's about pricing, make sure that you're on the 170 plus range, which you probably heard a bunch of videos for me.
Anyways, which works out to have like 39 bucks a week or more, if it's been weeks, okay?
Discounts.
Don't do them, you're devaluing yourself.
It's also a really bad habit, because it just shows lack of conviction.
6:59
Your product black Novation, the salesperson, black conviction, where you're actually selling just results.
Not what, you're not the action service.
And one of the big big nasty ones that sucks about this in mind you, I did this earlier.
So I'm not like trying to say that I did.
I told This is that, as soon as you make a discount early on what ends up happening, is that that person owns you and now they think everything's negotiable.
7:20
You know what I mean?
Like, I used to sell t-shirts to be like, well, if by 420, I'm like the price is 25 bucks.
Like, by the, you know, like just like this isn't negotiable, you know what I mean?
But when you start with that, then they assume everything is negotiable.
Also makes you seem like a mom-and-pop rather than like more established company.
7:37
Like, these are our prices, you know what I mean?
Like, this is what it is.
And so I'd highly recommend sticking To your guns and they'll respect you more in the be way.
Less of a pain in the ass customer.
Okay.
Now when it comes to space capacity that kind of thing.
So on average the industry leaders use half the amount of space per customer compared to the average kind of loser gyms.
7:59
And so what does that say?
So the tactics that I recommend highly are partnering people up.
Getting rid of movements that are not necessary that are very spacings.
Like consuming I I I totally demonize double-unders and I know, everyone's what I know in the CrossFit world, you know.
8:16
I have like my big point is this is that for general population which is with the majority of us serve.
There are other tools that are other exercises that we can use to accomplish the objective of conditions that do not require as much space as much complexity and a learning curve.
8:32
So unless you have people who are competing, right?
Which that entire organization has made a huge move pivot recently against that because they don't want to deal with a worldwide organization of competitors against that.
Like, most people are never going to So they really just want to look good and feel good.
8:48
And there's a lot of ways to do that, that don't take nearly the amount of space that, you know, doing snatches for time for you.
Don't, I mean, things like that.
So the way that they're able to use those spaces that they're selecting exercises, that are not going to be as space consuming and that's the first thing.
And the second thing is, I highly recommend you partner people up.
9:05
So that one person cheers and holds other, you know, one person.
Cheers spots and rests, while the other person does a strength-based movement, whatever.
And so that actually allows you to pretty much One and a half X or double the amount of people that you can have at your facility.
9:21
So if you're at like right now, you can only service 16 people per hour and you're doing Barbara list for everyone, right?
Like you can probably remove that stuff, partner people up and then immediately increase your capacity to 30 per session.
Why is that important?
As you can, decrease the amount of session times we have in the tiger overhead Might be something to look into.
9:41
And so as a result, the next line down is payroll right there.
Pyrrole was on average half half.
Okay?
Of the laggard so right now the laggards half of their gross revenue.
What's a payroll, whereas the industry leaders who is 25% part of that is because their prices higher so relative to the price that they're charging.
10:01
They are less of it is going to payroll that's one of its just math, right?
The other part of it is that I'm a big believer in this and I've said this before and it goes Next slide down, which is commissions, is that?
I'm a big believer in having lower base pay and then having lots of incentives around semi-private surround, you know, selling other products that you have at the facility UPS like actually doing Front End Sales, converting people into memberships, like all of these different things, selling internal plays that you're doing a, you know, 28-day stubborn, belly fat fast or whatever.
10:32
Like you're showing you're selling that to your internal members like give that as incentives.
And so then like the trainer's base pay is low.
Our, but then their upside is higher.
And so the actual amount that these facilities paid their trainers.
There's actually more than the other places, but that's because they had two times the amount of commissions as the lagging Jim's.
10:55
So, all in all, if you're like, what are the notes to take home about this one, make sure that your pricing is premium have a reason to have premium pricing, so you can have a premium product, right?
If we were really cheap at Jim watch, I would not be able to acquire customers and not be able to have the crazy support team that we do.
We'll be able to continue to reinvest in, spend money to try and figure out what the next thing is on a constant basis, new ad platforms, we had some fun, I was doing whatever right?
11:18
Like we didn't have the money to do that.
Then our product would be in theory, won't be able to Market to anyone, and we'd be able to find people.
And so it's like, it's either a virtuous cycle or vicious cycle.
I've talked about that in the past, but so make sure that your pricing is pregnant.
Right?
The next thing is never discount.
Like don't negotiate with terrorists.
11:34
I used to say that's my step like never negotiate with terrorists.
Like the price is the price for a reason.
Because if it's not that None of your like none of us have jobs, right?
And it is your responsibility as a business owner to uphold that standard.
Like, if you're the first like, you tell people, hey, don't discount.
But then, like, you always are the one making side deals because you're the owner, like, you need to practice what you preach Stand Tall, right?
11:55
And then space utilization, look at your ex exercise selection and then consider partnering people up.
I think it's a great selling point.
I sold it as safety, I sold it as motivation.
That's what it is cheering.
And then I also sold from a science component like listen, if you actually want to gain muscle like Like I can't have you just working trying to use the right term, hardcore for 60 minutes straight, like you can't do that.
12:18
You need to rest like Energy Systems, don't work that way.
So I need you to go hard for 45 seconds and then we're going to have you rest for 45 seconds and then you'll go hard again, right?
You're going to spot the other person to make sure you catch your breath and you can do another set.
So consider that it also doubles Your Capacity, the facility, and then payroll have a lower base and then higher upside of the commission's and you'll be able to get more performance and ultimately keep your fixed cost lower so that if for some reason someone isn't performing you're not getting the sales or whatever that month then you don't have as much fixed overhead.
12:49
That could skin you alive.
So anyways, those are that's the that's you not having to read a huge document.
What's going on?
That's what the industry leaders are doing.
And I would highly recommend that you here to those things because they make sense.
13:05
And the last point, which is Marketplace.
Well, they must be in some, you know, Standalone Market, they must own their Market know, they were in the most competitive marketplaces and those are the places that you have to.
And we're diamonds are formed and that's why the best practices are made.
Because if they didn't have those, they go out of business.
13:21
And so that's the place.
Those are the hot beds.
And so, if you're in a competitive market, then you more reason in any way, the following things I'm just out loud.
So anyways, hope you guys are having a two-time Tuesday, amazing Tuesday.
Hello, talk to you soon.









Company0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Good morning, happy.
Thursday will be you guys are having a good end of your week and maybe you're listening this, not on a Thursday.
So I hope you're having a good whatever day it is for you.
So I wanted to title this.
0:42
Why being an entrepreneur's is lonely?
So I mean the last episode or content piece or video or however you consume, this was you know, hardcore industry data, Etc.
And so I kind of wanted a balance that with something that I was thinking about this morning actually, and it's probably best Characterized by story which you may have heard something at.
1:02
So like half a year ago.
But when I came home from college, when I was 19 and 20, I came home and I had I went out to get like lunch with my stepsister.
Yeah scan.
And When we were at the at the lunch, at like the pizza place?
1:19
What's up Robin?
She said, you know, it's she said like well don't you like this right?
You always like this and I was like, no.
Actually I'm I don't like that at all.
Like I actually feel strongly against that and whatever she was saying and she responded with.
1:37
Well, it's hard to keep track of your constantly changing, and I remember that like really stung me a lot like as a, you know, as a first-year back from college, Change.
Is that supposed to be right?
And so I kept like, turning this over in my mind for like, a week or two until finally, it dawned on me that the words that she was using, or not the words that I interpreted them, as she said, you are changing and that is how the world will continue to see you.
2:07
And unfortunately, because of the way that like Society brings everyone up, they want consistency, they want constant, right?
They want things to be the same and the Isn't the same changes, it grows, right?
And so that's the real word is that she didn't say, like, you're constantly growing or you're constantly evolving.
2:25
She said you're constantly changing and so it went from being a positive trait, which is how we as entrepreneurs, see it growth right versus what most people see it, as which is just like, you're not, you're not consistent, right?
Like you're constantly changing and so I just use that story to illustrate the concept, but the like why being an entrepreneur is He is that inherently and I think that Fitness entrepreneurs have this even more so than anyone is that like and I think Fitness is really the gateway drug for a lot of entrepreneurs because the first thing that you start to improve is yourself, right?
2:59
And so the first thing that you really think about is like physically, you're like, man, I feel like crap I need to get in shape, right.
And so you start going down that path.
And what inevitably happens is, you know, you go through your own transformation here.
First you require a whole bunch of information and you learn, you learn, you learn growth, right?
3:16
And then you acquire a new skill, which is fitness-related.
You understand how to eat your Shadow work out, etcetera and you continue to grow in that aspect, right?
And then you get in shape and then you have this great transformation and then people start asking you about it and then you want to share it with other people, right?
And so then obviously you start getting into like well I need to start menu just feed myself.
3:35
I want to do something that I'm passionate about and this is the first real transformation.
A lot of people go through and so it's the first thing that they really become passionate about it which is fitnes, right?
And so like we as entrepreneurs Arted our fitness centers, like start this path of personal growth first with our bodies and then we continue to hone our minds and get into the business World, Etc.
3:55
The thing is, is that like the reason it's so hard to have friends, which is was going to be the alternate title, this like why is it so hard to have friends and why being an entrepreneur?
So lonely is that most people don't grow straight.
I like most people don't grow, most people don't innovate.
4:14
Most people live, the same problems over and over.
Again and you see them, 10 years later, they're saying the same thing still hate their job is still, you know, can get along with their wife or whatever it is, right?
They just like, they are comfortable in their discomfort and I don't know if that's an entrepreneurial thing to be like, like, maybe, maybe we're missing something like, maybe I'm just a big weekly.
4:34
You don't mean, like, I just have such low tolerance for for anything, you know what I mean?
That's outside of like extreme Comfort, right?
And so it makes me not want to hang, you know what I mean?
With people who aren't constantly growing and so, What ends up happening is that like your business forces you to grow like you have no choice if you own a business but to grow, because if you don't grow the business won't feel right.
4:56
And the, at some point you make that realization, you realize that the deficit in the business is the deficit in skill set that you no longer have, which is why the business is capped, right?
And so and I wanted to make this just because I want you guys to know, like I don't have a lot of friends like I have maybe maybe two friends, maybe, right.
5:20
And, and like, these are people that like, I would say, I've only one friend that I talk to friends that I talk to you on a weekly ish faces, right?
And none in person, my G, I don't have any impact like real and person friends.
And, and it's I think it's okay.
5:39
I'm just I'm just I'm just telling you, I like just wear like where I'm at with it, like, I think it's okay.
I think that like for like the reason that we're Layla and I are so Pro entrepreneurs bringing their wives not live.
So I'm a guy.
So your spouse's into the business Beth.
5:57
I see you around here.
So you know, husband's into the business is that you were in this environment, this high growth incubator which is what being an entrepreneur is like, you're just high growth, requiring skills, acquiring skills.
So, And problem solving problems solving problems and inevitably you grow, right?
But if the person that you were with isn't exposed to that, it's like you're constantly evolving over here and then they're doing the same thing.
6:20
And I'm not saying it's impossible.
I'm not saying that, like, your spouse has to be involved.
I'm saying that the reason that we so strongly encourage it is, because if you're both involved, then you're both in the incubator together and you can both keep growing and that way you can grow together, right?
And so to go back to the title, why being around from Arizona These that most people a don't grow and second if they do grow, people don't grow at the same rates, right?
6:44
Like, I had entrepreneur friends when I got into the entrepreneurs face, who are still at the same level of business that they were when I met and in some ways it's like awkward, you know, I mean not purposefully, it's not like I like it's not like a oh you know we're better.
7:01
You're like it's not like you don't have mean it's just that like you're still dealing with the same things.
You were dealing with.
With and have an identified, a confronted them or grown past them yet.
And so you just kind of in this like well I mean, it's pretty clear what you need to do.
7:17
You don't?
I mean, it's so and and then it just kind of gets into this weird like well, you know, Pope you handle that and then you don't really talk again, right?
And so like, maybe it's like, why being an entrepreneur and why being a high-growth entrepreneurs?
Lonely, is that like you continue to evolve like the person's?
7:34
And that's why I like you have to break at least in my opinion.
You have to break the Concept of your identity because it's fluid its Dynamic.
You need to become whatever the business needs you to become for that next step.
And so I guess for those guys real quick, if you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
7:58
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless This way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
8:20
We were on here.
Who if you do feel alone?
Nice, entrepreneur one, I can say I feel you but second I think there's different.
There's there's a difference between being alone and being lonely and so maybe I should change the title because I'm not lonely but I am not with people really much at all.
8:40
And I'm okay with that, you know, and as if you have people who are in your business, who are growing with you, which is why sometimes like honestly when we had all of our Executives fly out For our strategic meet up.
So we had our, we had 11 11 of our directors fly out.
8:58
And then for bar, the EAS came out to, to meet kind of talk about the queue for planning and things like that.
It honestly felt like a family reunions because everyone who's in this company, this is the environment that we created that we choreographed.
They all are growth-oriented.
9:16
I mean, one of the core tenets of Jim launch.
Probably the one that is most frequently cited his Broward I write and so they believe in that just like we do and so You can create your environment and sometimes like family doesn't grow them, you know what I mean?
9:33
But like, you have your ties, and when I feel like sometimes they don't go the, we doing sometimes that can be awkward, and I don't think they're like, I think there's lots of things that people can say, but it just sometimes you grow apart from family.
I'm not saying that it, I'm not saying that you disarmed them, or you disrespect them or anything like that.
9:51
I'm just saying that.
I think it's okay.
I think it, I think it happens, you know, and it's the same thing with initial friendships and when you get into this space, sometimes you grow faster than the other person does.
That's okay.
You know, it's just a fact of life.
And so, sometimes we beat ourselves up about this.
10:08
Like maybe I'm not social maybe in whatever, you know, but sometimes the things that you need to do in order to grow or not, even things that are conducive to like social stuff like Layla and I pretty much calculate everything that we eat for all meals of every day.
So if we go out, It's kind of a pain is I like having my routine, you know what I mean?
10:25
From a food sample because that gives me attention back to focus on the business that I'm trying to grow, right?
Like Leyland, I'm going to bed, like, we're like in bed at 8:45.
Not like, I'm out by, like, 9:15 like Colt.
Like I woke up this morning at 2:30, you know, I only need like five hours a day.
10:42
And so, I got a ton of stuff down the first four hours a day before, 6 a.m., but if someone's like, hey man, like to go to the concert with me.
You know it's like 8:00 at night is when the concert starts like you just say no you know what I mean?
10:58
If someone was to go to a restaurant and it's like 30 minutes away, they want to do the reservation, at 7:15, like I know that we're going to be done it, you know, 8:30, like maybe we'll do that one, but that's probably won't get served by until I ate, will be done.
They 13 job back, its nine and then we like, decompress, whatever.
I don't know, probably won't do it.
11:15
And so like, if you put it that way, like I'm just here to kind of say like to show you at least on our side like it's okay.
You know, like you do what you have to do to grow you and your environment will like you will change your environment according to that.
And so any you this just felt like something that I don't know if it's one person we needed to hear it but like it's okay you know, it's okay to just be you it's okay to grow and it's okay to fall to fall apart from from people, like it happens, it's part of life.
11:47
And being in this high growth environment that you are as an entrepreneur constantly controlling variables constant.
About your skill set constantly focusing on this child that you're trying to grow like it's okay.
You know you're fine and so anyways maybe that someone who needed to hear that but there's a lot of you guys like I love this community so much if you're new to this group.
12:12
Hello welcome.
This is less of one of the least technical things that have probably ever made but I hope I hope you found some value in it and maybe some peace about changes our relationship.
A ship that you have going on in your life and you're like yeah I wish I was still friends with that person.
Maybe he's not that you wish you were still friends with that person because we already would mean is that you because you don't actually wish you were the person who still friends that person.
12:37
You really wish that that person would have grown with you to be the friend that you need them to be.
Now Ryan for the type of person that you want in your life now and you can't force that on something.
And so It just happens sometimes you won't part.
Anyways I hope you guys have an amazing week and I hope you have an amazing day and I hope you crush all of your dreams and goals and that you grow relentlessly and that you have outpaced everyone that you're looking leash or a lone AF and not lonely at all.
13:07
Because you love your staff, you love your community and everything else.
So you guys have an awesome day and









0:00
Most Nation real quick.

Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there but everyone welcome happy Friday.
0:20
Hope you guys are having an amazing or have had an amazing week.
I wanted to talk to you about something that I bring up a lot with in our gym Lords.
See.
But I don't think I've talked too much about it publicly and it's why I tell people to close locations and so it's kind of an interesting topic because a lot of people were like, wait, what?
0:41
You tell people close locations and the honest truth is.
Yes, and the reason is because I think a lot of gym owners were really business owners and entrepreneurs in general tend to open locations not based on.
Math.
0:57
But they open it based on emotion and ego.
And so what ends up happening invariably in this has happened?
So many times when we've had so many gym, or to come to our world, who, when they watch a video like this, or what I'm about to say, or like, I feel like you're speaking to me, but the reality is that if you have a single location and it starts to make you money, right?
1:20
I can't tell you the amount of times that we've, you know, we've even turned a gym around and then within 12 weeks the gym owners, like, hey man, I'm looking at my firm my second location and it makes me want to run my head through the wall because they forgot what the objective was.
And I think the reality is that they didn't forget with the objective was the objective was always for them and ego thing, it had nothing to do with making money and that's because a lot of entrepreneurs are driven by status.
1:45
And the interesting thing is that you can't eat status, you can't pay rent with steps, right?
You can't do anything with - but you can with money and money Works different than status does.
And so a lot of times, the things that it takes to grow your status, are contrary to what it takes to grow your bank account, right?
2:03
And so, if we have a look at a single location owner, and they're like, okay, I mean, 10 grand, net, last month, and this month, like, immediately in their mind.
They like, I can't wait to have 10 locations that are doing this.
I'll make 100,000 a month that like, whatever, right?
The thing though, is that What it takes to make one location.
2:22
Really, really good.
Is a lot different than what it takes to take two locations or three locations are 10 locations, right?
And the reality is that most times what happens is if they go in open the second location the amount of time and effort that they can put into that first location goes down and then within the margin of the industry, right?
2:40
So let's say you're running a 25 percent margin okay.
I know you're making your 10,000 a month that then all of a sudden that one location because you're not focused 100% on it, even if you Split your attention.
Having a 25% decrease in sales is actually fairly fairly normal, especially if you go from owner-operated to remote, right?
3:00
And so what happens is they start another location and then that one does usually not even as high as the first one.
Does it does maybe two-thirds of what the the first one did and now both of them are basically running at break even and so the gym owner says, okay, well if I open a third location then now I've kind of covered this and then I'll be able to make a little bit.
3:20
More on all three of them and then obviously you kind of know how the story goes because then they stretch themselves extremely thin and then obviously they get into this really horrible situation where they're stressed out all the time continually and the solution for that is not to like let's double down the solution.
A lot of times is to is to simplify is to get rid of locations so that we can focus on one location and make it better, right?
3:43
And so like for me the benchmarks that we have for our gym large community for.
Like I don't even want to hear you talk to me.
About you want to open a second location until you have made 20,000 a month, net for 6 months in a row, without being there.
3:59
And on top of that, it should have grown.
So during the six months, that you've been away, your gym should grow.
And when I say a way, it doesn't mean that like you're checking on everything every day and you're just remote, but I mean, like, gone, like you can totally your hours to five hours a week. 10 hours tops tops.
4:18
True. 10 hours, not where?
You say you're doing 10 hours but you're still working like a normal 40 hours because you're thinking about the other 30 hours and you're doing stuff.
You're messaging people and you're talking your coach like, no, I'm saying a legit 10 hours because what happens is if you have a second location, you're going to put more time into that one and very realistically, you won't even have 10 hours really, to give that first one.
4:38
And so, once I like, those are the benchmarks that you need to give to yourself.
Now, the twenty thousand dollars a month net.
It also assumes that you've already taken care of your personal need for money.
So if you have, let's say ten thousand dollars saved up and then after six months, you have a hundred thousand dollars saved up.
4:57
Do you think it's a good?
It's a good time.
At that moment to go open the second facility.
My argument would be no, why, because you're about to drain your account again.
You be down to zero and, you know, now you have twice liabilities, right, and less ability and attention to make sure that they're both working.
5:14
And so, a lot of the advice that I have is really boring and not sexy but it will keep you out of trouble.
And so what's happened is that every every gym Lord that has has taken this advice.
All right has shut down locations for has said, you know what, we're going to just double down on this location makes way more money than the guys who have three or four location.
5:34
So if you go to one of these these a conferences or these events are, you know these masterminds that sometimes get help and some guys like yeah I've got I've got four locations you should immediately be like cool.
This guy's probably Making anything, he's probably really stressed out.
Like, I immediately think that.
So if I hear a gym owner, like we get on the phone with the gym owner and he's new and and he's got, you know, four locations, some like cool man, you probably really stressed out.
5:55
Are you making anything?
And then no joke nine times out of ten.
They're like dude I'm strapped right now and then I tell the same story, I'm guessing your first location that was making ten maybe fifteen thousand left that you open your second location and now drops down to, to making five or to making 2500.
6:11
They like, okay, well maybe I'll make 25 footer from each one.
You open your third one and now you have Three that are breaking.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world kidding.
6:28
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you do you have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
6:44
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
Right?
And then you hiccup and your screw and now you have not just your family, but you have all the trainers in all their families that are relying on you.
And the decision was made based on status and not money, right?
7:02
And so, if the goal of the business is to actually make a profit and actually make you money, then don't forget to do the thing that it actually was supposed to do which is make money, right?
Like, what do I do after this month, when I make 20,000 a month, do it again, right?
Do it again and do it more efficiently and then next month do it again and do it more efficiently.
7:20
Awesome.
Now, what up to Circle back to what I was saying, earlier, every gym that we've had who said, you know what I'm going to stick with one location.
I want to see how vertically high, I can go right because their fixed costs within the gym.
And then, as you scale up a higher and higher percentage of the revenue contributes to margin, okay?
7:38
So it's the inverse of diminishing marginal returns meaning Let's say, let's say you have a gym that does thirty thousand dollars a month and you have twenty thousand dollars of overhead, okay?
And then you add ten thousand dollars a month of Revenue to that 30,000.
7:55
So let's see.
We're knitting 10 from the from the 30, right?
And then you add another 10, it might cost you another 2,500 dollars to make the extra 10 but your margin on that next ten thousand dollars might be a 75 percent margin and for you to make that from your second facility means, you're going to have to go all the way up to Twenty Eight twenty nine thousand, To make that same additional 75 hundred dollars and so what happens is that most times don't know.
8:24
Most people don't know that you can make a lot more money from one gym because they just don't know.
And so like well I just assumed that ten thousand dollars a month is the maximum to be making the gym and so the question you should ask yourself and hopefully tie your ego.
To this question is, is this really the best I can do is this really the best I can do?
8:41
Is this is the best business I can possibly make?
No, well then don't open another one.
Right.
Work on that one and stacked vertically.
So instead of growing horizontally, which builds ego build vertically, and build your bank account.
8:58
And so the whole point here is that once we had Jim's who broke the four-minute mile and hit 83 thousand, hit 100,000 hit, 120 thousand a month, right?
In recurring, then all of a sudden, everyone believed it was possible.
And if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a month, Do you think that you'll probably be making more than you would from to making 40?
9:21
Absolutely.
Because you have a higher percentage of the revenue.
That is contributing to margin.
Okay.
And so it's just, I just wanted to make this quick video and I started with white better leads to bigger.
And so, most people think that I need to get bigger to prove to everyone that I'm better, but the reality is that you need to make your gym better.
9:41
And then only when you truly have a full Bank, Don't you have grown every month for the last six months you've been at the gym, well, at the gym 0, but working on your gym less than 10 hours a week during that period of time.
9:57
Would you then?
And only then be allowed to even think about the concept of a second location.
But the reality is that usually when you follow those first three steps, most gyms that we work with are like damn, that was awesome.
I wonder if I can stack 30,000 a month.
And then they do without taking on more liability and risk.
10:15
And so it's really shifting your main driver from a status driven driver, to a bank account driven driver.
And I will tell you, that's the big reason why I like we're not trying to be influencers.
It's not my game.
I don't really want to do that.
I want to have all the Instagram quotes and whatever this is just not my thing.
10:36
It's because like I just, I really, I did the status thing when I was when I had my gym.
And I was really stressed and it was a mistake.
And so I don't want you to repeat the same thing that I did.
10:52
Hopefully, I can tell you a lot more, a lot more comfortable.
Now with one vertically stacked business, then lots of horizontal businesses.
And so, for anyone who's out there, who's like me and maybe I'll open a second location.
Like, okay, I would use those Benchmark criteria.
11:08
And if you're in the Flip Flip scenario, where you're like, you Know what shit, I think.
That's right.
This, this does kind of resonate with me.
I'm making less than I was with.
I've making less with two locations than I was with one location.
That should be an indicator for you like, okay.
11:24
I did something wrong because I should be making more.
I should be making twice as much, right?
And used to have some economies of scale with multiple locations, ideally, right.
And if you don't, then it means like, even with economies of scale, even with shared labor cost for like admin things, things like that, even with shared subscriptions for software's and all that stuff.
11:42
You're still making less which means that the model that you used was not as strong as you thought it was.
And so what you should do is in my opinion cut, refocus, and then Watch What Happens because every time we have done this with a gym and they refocus their attention on one location, like, imagine how easy it would be because when you have three locations and I said, imagine if all you have to do is make one, Jim make money, how easy would that be like really easy?
12:07
And I'm like, cool, why don't we do that, right?
And then actually make money, which is the point.
Right?
And so then we focus on making that one, so good.
So amazing.
That it starts growing.
Super, super vertically.
You take home, tons of cash.
You have some of the bank account you don't need to work as much on the facility and then you can make the decision from an in-form standpoint of abundance rather than from a scarce ego standpoint of like I need more status.
12:34
So anyways I hope that makes sense to anyone.
Thank you guys for dropping in on a Friday.
I know that at least here.
It's a rainy day in Austin.
But maybe you know shoot it shoot a like if you're if you're feeling super rambunctious tag, someone who is in your facility has been like, let's open another one.
12:52
And then like this is just my video of like, pump the brakes.
What's the point?
Are we making as much as we want to and have we made as much as we needed to make in that we set up to make when we started this business original.
So, hope that makes sense.
I hope you guys are having an amazing, amazing day.
13:07
I'm sorry, I've been late on the content.
I've had got tons of amazing science coming on the back.
Ground for us, that is coming down the pipeline for everything.
So do is have an amazing day.
Keeping awesome.
Ground for us, that is coming down the pipeline for everything.
So do is have an amazing day.
Keeping awesome.

Happy Sunday.
0:30
Hope you guys are having a miraculous Sunday, rest day, and then everything is treating you.
Well, I wanted to make a quick little video here because this is a lesson that I'd really don't like talking about mindset stuff, because I think a lot of its fluff, but this one was kind of good.
0:48
And so I wanted to share with you and this was actually a true mindset shift that I ended up having earlier on my career that has still reverberated, you know, through my life since it's also used two stories.
One of them was the first time That I encounter the mindset reality.
I didn't learn the lesson fully then, but I was aware of it.
1:06
And the second one was right?
I learned the lesson.
And so what it was is, Running a business to actually try and make money.
And I know this sounds really crazy but there was a time when I had a actually had a partner at a couple occasions that I ended up buying out and the cost of buying that partner out was ten thousand dollars a month that was the deal that we made.
1:33
So I'd have him ten thousand dollars a month in addition to what, you know, how we staking, you know, from from the gyms are went up.
And what was interesting is that as soon soon as I had to start making the payments to this partner I immediately for the next 12 months May ten thousand dollars a month more and what was weird is that after the payments to that partner ceased, or they had to stop, making them the income that I made immediately drops by ten thousand dollars a month.
2:03
And the whole time as I was making this money, I was thinking to myself, I was like, why can't wait till this is over?
I was like, I'm going to take on an extra 10 grand a month and that this would be great.
And when it didn't happen on the 13th month, in the 14th month and 15th month, it really kind of rattled me because I was like, what is going on?
2:21
Like what is happening?
And the reality was I didn't actually and this is why I talk about having a need that's much greater than yourself is that I was a single dude and like all of my Youth were very much financially met and I was comfortable, I lived in a nice place like I never wanted for anything, but I didn't need the extra 10 grand a month and the issue is that I wasn't really driven by my clients to fulfill a higher need and so I made the extra ten thousand dollars a month because I had to and then when I no longer needed to I stopped making it and it was very, very weird for me to go through that.
2:59
And so that was something that like it rattled me, but it didn't actually force me to break.
Break through it or something that I noticed, but I still didn't actually make the next step.
Now, later what ended up happening the year or two later, I was running a campaign and this is, gosh can remember.
3:18
But I knew I wanted to average x amount in up cells per person.
And so I remember I was I'd like 150 weigh-ins or something and I was I was doing all of them myself and I was about Out, I want to say two thirds of the way first.
3:36
So I probably weighed in about hundred of the hundred and fifty people and I was averaging about $110 per head in additional upsells and I knew that I wanted to get up to 150 on average per person and so immediately, what I ended up doing was I just started selling people more stuff because I wanted to get to that average and the next 50 sales, I averaged an additional $80 so that I could bring the average up to 150 and it was in that moment that I realized that.
4:17
I had been making less money because I was choosing to make less money.
I don't know if that's real for anyone who's listening right now, but that was the moment that that became real for me.
And so I guess the rhetorical question that I would ask anyone.
4:32
Here is like, have you ever needed to make money pay rent, pay payroll, okay, whatever, right?
That was coming up the next month and then you made it, right?
And if you look back on the last, 12 months, 24 months, right?
And you think how many times have I needed to make X right?
4:51
Maybe.
Car breaks down, or you've got a merchant family thing or, you know, you've got you something, the sign break, whatever it is something that's urgent and you need to make money in a certain amount of time, right?
And then what's crazy, is that most people who are watching this right now are still here and not homeless, right?
5:12
Because they were able to make the money that they needed to make to make this thing go away.
And so what's weird is that we respond In these times of crisis, with a different type of thinking really think differently about our business.
5:27
We think differently about money in those instances because we think I have to make this money and so when you rewind the clock right and so I had that the the partner that I do make ten thousand dollars a month extra net, right per month, the moment I sign the agreement, right?
5:45
And then that next month we made ten thousand dollars a month.
Net extra from what we were making before crazy.
Right?
But the thing is, is like, is it crazy?
And then the question is, can you use that approach and trick yourself into making more money?
6:02
And so, the more rhetorical question is like, are you not making as much money as you want to, because you're choosing to make less money?
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
6:19
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
6:40
I know this sounds weird to say but just think about it.
Are you choosing to charge less than you?
Could are you choosing to not up?
So people because you just don't want to make the emotional effort.
And every time in the past you had needed money when it was for someone else and not you you were able to make it.
6:58
And so it's one of these key Concepts around like the energy of money and how you perceive it?
That influence, how you go and get it, right?
And so one of the biggest shifts that I at and why I tell everyone like, I don't think like I think, the reason that people who are married and have kids, make more money is because they have to There's, they have to they have no other choice, right?
7:24
And the question is, can you give yourself?
No other choice but to make more money and so there's two ways of doing it.
One is by like trying to mind trick yourself and the others to not think about money at all.
And only think about how much more you can serve your customers.
And I can tell you that right now within Jim launch, like I was able to transition at the end of my gym career to that.
7:44
The second thing that I was talking about where I just I chose to make more money was an active choice.
I was like I'm choosing to make more money.
Any like, I demand more money, right?
And so I'm no longer, could you not sell people because I'm just choosing not to sell them more.
I'm no longer willing to accept lower prices because there's no reason for me to accept lower prices.
8:03
I'm no longer going to spend money on things just because it's there.
I'm going to bank that I'm going to take that money, right?
Because the money will always flow to the person who gives it the most attention and up until recently.
Maybe for some of you, the person who is paying the most attention to the money.
8:20
Person who needed it from.
And so you immediately went and got it and gave it to her, right?
Because he's paying attention.
The money just flew through from one person from that from the clients to the person.
He needed to take it.
Whether that was your mechanic, Mayweather was a broken equipment person.
Whether it was the the plumber who had to fix the water leak in your gym, whatever it was that person is now that person might turn around and hand it to the next person, right?
8:42
But eventually that money will stick to the person who's paying the most attention to it.
And so, the first way is to is to actively make the decision and Like, I'm going to make more money because I choose to for no.
Other reason I choose to, I refuse to not make money anymore, right?
8:58
It's a choice and the second is sort of what we've gotten into you now with Jim launches and I don't have the secret, I don't know, I'll be honest, I don't know, but I know that I am much more connected with gym owners that I am to my weight loss customers.
9:14
When I had my job's be really candid with you.
I never struggled with my weight.
I've had a six-pack my whole life.
I genetically have good genes.
I can eat fast food and still probably get away with looking very in shape.
I'm being very honest with you and so it wasn't real for me to have their struggle.
9:30
Right.
What became more real for me is to connect with the fact that I wanted to be an exceptional business owner and then as a corollary to that, I knew I needed to serve my customers but I actually didn't directly connect with my customers.
Now, with Jim launch, I have an emotional tie to the gym words in our community to the gym owners.
9:47
I got I Let them down, right?
And if you can tap into that more money will flow to you than you have ever had any idea like to what to do with it, because you're not actually acting like you're serving a purpose, that's much higher than you.
10:04
And then the amount of value that you're creating is far in excess of anything that you are creating part of that, and then and then a lot more money will flow to you.
And so, the two basic takeaways from this are decide and it's a choice, whether you want to make more money. and then, if you do act like it, act like you have to pay your car off in the next 14 days, And then do that.
10:32
And then next month do it again and the next month do it again, and instead of giving that money to someone else.
Thank you.
It's for you.
You earned it, keep it.
Don't spend it on stupid shit.
Don't don't just choose to spend some unit profit for no reason on something because it's, they're right, don't let the money burn a hole in your pocket for no reason.
10:52
So that's the first way, and the second way, if you can tap into this, it will give you more money than you'll ever know how to do what to do with.
But it's genuinely getting into what we call weapons great compassion, but, like, going deep into your customers and really connecting with the needs that they have and thinking, how can I do better, how can I do more?
11:09
How can I do more?
How can I do more?
And by extension, How can I charge, how can I deliver more value and then by extension charge more, so that I can give a more exceptional experience that those people because they truly deserve.
And you have to think that way and when you do think that what you don't look at the competitive Marketplace, you don't look at your competition.
11:29
You don't look at what they're charging because they're doing the same thing that I just said, they're charging.
Just enough to get by because they have no reason to make more money.
And that's why I married people and that's why people with kids make more money because they have to, they have no choice.
So give yourself, no choice but to make more money.
11:45
So anyways, just to somebody thought for you.
I hope either of those stories were over.
I'll go for you when I had to buy my partner out, I mean, the amount of money that you can make.
There's no, there's no limit like if you had to you would.
12:01
And so just put yourself in a state where you have to and then you will Like for real like do that and I don't know I don't know how to I don't know how to break this belief for you because it took me such a long time and like I literally paid ten thousand dollars a month for over a year and then was not able to recreate it until much later.
12:25
Until like this became real for me.
And so I wish I could save better words to you right now to like make that real for you in your mind.
So that tomorrow, you act like you have to pay a bill but the bill is to you, you're the recipient, your your own landlord, right?
12:43
So anyways, I hope this was valuable for you.
Maybe tag manager who needs to hear it or a trainer or maybe.
No.
But anyways throw a like up If you, if you found it valuable, but have an amazing Sunday.
I hope you guys are crushing your goals, and I hope you get greedy with your business so that you can take the money to help other people.
13:05
All right?
Lots of love.
Have an amazing day.
Keeping awesome.
Let me guess.0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, but everyone happy And a make it happen.
Monday, moneymondays go, make it happen.
So anyways, I wanted to make this little video for you and it's 6:30 in the morning and I've been working since for.
It's like three days a week.
0:41
I wake up at four without an alarm and I just start working.
Anyways, we're like 20 pages of AD copy that.
We're testing right now.
We're doing a little test inside of Jim launch.
We're spending like twelve thousand, dollars a day, testing a bazillion different versions of ads.
0:57
Copy headlines, etc.
For our More community.
So these will be the ads that all our competitors.
Copy six months from now and get the much the lower result as a result.
Anyways, I want to make this video because even though 6:30 this morning is not the time to make videos because that is not good watch but we're going to break the mold and do it anyways.
1:18
So I'm calling this how to never lose and the biggest transformation that stood with our most successful gyms and how it kind of ties in a gym.
Launches Three core tenets.
So I was talking to Josh pun yesterday.
And I was thinking about and Jonathan's Rano.
You were like a beautiful example of this.
1:35
I mean, there's a lot of times.
But anyways, when I see the gym owners who have the biggest, the most massive Transformations.
It's not, it doesn't come from something, tactical.
So this is a little bit, I know, two days in a row, might have videos, but, you know, here we go.
Josh pain.
When he came to us and John Spano was not a very different situation.
1:52
So Josh actually, like didn't even have the money to start the program.
You've maxed out all those credit cards and you have all those rent do I think he like 45 thousand dollars rent due within a week And he was basically in a do-or-die situation and now, 18 months later, he should hit his first 83k month this month, which is just like amazing, right?
2:14
And the thing that happened, it's not one thing.
Well, there is one internal thing and then it results in all of these external things that you take control over, right?
And I kind of gave a little hint away just now, but it's a shift in in Locust.
2:29
Of control.
So, like in Psychology, they see the people who were the most successful in life have an internal locus of control versus an external.
Locus of control, which is a fancy way of saying, some people have a victim mindset and some people have a victoire mindset, which is why I called this how to never lose.
2:46
Because at the end of the day in every Market, there's always a gym owner who is doing better than you are with less, right?
And so they have the same circumstances, they had the same external, circumstances the same mark.
The same clientele, the same, you know, the same access to trainers whatever and yet they're able to do better, right?
3:07
And so the question is like, okay, if winner, like Gary Vee said this, and I love this saying, since you can't stop winners from winning.
And so, if you aren't winning, then the internal locus of control person would say that I'm not a winner, right?
And so then the next question is like, well, how do I do that?
3:24
And I think it comes from One internal shift that then results in all of these Downstream effects that happens.
Words, which is they own their circumstances?
And so the third core Jim, the third core tenets of Jim launch is Be Your Own Boss, but the subject we have a couple examples for every core tenant is to own your outcomes in to own your circumstances, right?
3:45
And so if something does not work right, it is your fault, right?
And if something doesn't work, it is your fault too, right?
There's another saying that's that I really love that.
Everyone is self-made.
It's only Millionaires and billionaires that claiming I just always loved that like we're all self-made.
4:03
We've all made our own situations, right?
And so like the biggest like John Surratt is another example.
So for the first hope, Johnny don't mind because you're on here.
The first maybe four or five months Johnson trying to always had issues, right?
4:20
You always go up to escalations.
You have issues with, you know, trainers and people leaving and pricing and all sorts of stuff, right?
And making enough net profit and then all of a sudden, something switched right?
And he messaged me one day and was like, dude, everything's totally transformed.
4:35
Like my gym is making all this money and what did end up happening is?
I hope I'm not paraphrasing because like, I was acting like a little bitch, right?
And I just, I just wasn't taking responsibility for my situation.
And so he had the same access to information.
4:53
The same access to coaching the same access to trainers the same.
Access to the same market, right?
And then yet at one moment, everything changed.
And then his gym started to grow, right name is because he owned a situation.
And so, the way that you can never lose is that if you are losing in the short term, right?
5:12
You can make it a win in the long term by owning the fact that you have a deficit, right?
Because once you have a deficit that it means you can identify the Gap and then you can solve it.
Because if you are complaining or you point fingers, right?
And you say, well, my, my My my area sucks, right?
5:28
You can't change that.
So then what?
Then you just sit there and keep sucking or you're like my trainer suck.
Okay.
And now what?
And so when you, when you take it in and think, okay, Even the situation even the situation will location.
5:45
I have a poor ability to judge locations if you really think that's what it is, but it isn't.
If you have trainers, that aren't good, right?
Then you do not have the skill set of how to find higher on board and manage trainers.
Hey guys, love that.
6:02
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, That's your deficit, right?
6:24
And so, one person points in the other person points inwards and says, what am I lacking?
And I'm telling you.
So I was talking to another friend of mine who I think he does 45 million a year.
He doesn't all he's an online business based on Amazon and stuff and he's stealing his company right now and he's like I think I can get up to half a million a month just by me doing sales, right?
6:46
And I was like, well obviously the next step man is you're going to have to step out of that boat sales team and and he has Like man, I haven't been able to like do that.
Well, every time I have tried to do that knows and he's like, so I'm trying to figure out another way and I just said, you just lack the skill of how to create and manage a sales team.
7:07
He's like, I haven't thought about it like that.
And the thing is, is like when you think about everything in terms of skills, that everything becomes quantifiable.
And if you come solvable right, which means all of the obstacles that you have in your life, just become growth, right?
Right?
7:22
And that's why when they had, like when you hear these entrepreneurs who are, you know, billionaires, whatever, and then they lose everything into they become billionaires again afterwards, like, Elon Musk, for example, right?
He has the skills because he has done it once and so once you have these skill set to get to get 2x, you can do it again and that's why it's repeatable.
7:43
And so that's why the biggest investment you can always make these in yourself and information and coaching in my opinion because it's the only thing that no one can ever take from you.
And that was something that my dad talked with my entire life, because he was from Iran, he had to flee because of the Revolution, he came here with nothing and, you know, he's a doctor and so he he did everything on his own, didn't speak English.
8:01
Watch television in her to learn.
English.
Right?
I know crazy story.
This is a story in and of itself but his family had everything taken from them because like right now imagine the government just takes everything you have and just says sorry like that's what happened.
8:20
Right?
And so assets, money land, all that stuff, disappeared, families Generations worth of stuff.
And the only thing they were left with was what they had in their minds.
And the successful business owners left Iran, right came to the US and started all over getting crushed it how?
8:43
Because they had the skill.
And so if there's a single the single greatest transformation that I see, with all the gym owners who are Jim Lord's, right?
And and I, look at what's happened, they just own their outcomes, everything when something's when they're like, man I can't I can't generate leads Maya.
9:00
We are converting their like, I need to make better videos, right?
That's the skill.
That's the action.
My trainers aren't being as responsible.
I have to figure out how to be a better manager.
How to be a better Coach, right?
Those are the questions that they ask because those are solvable and then once you have problems that you, once you have an equation that all you have to do is solve it.
9:22
And so if you can look at your business from that lens and say like okay I'm at 300 thousand dollars, Here, I would like to get to a million dollars to you.
Right now.
I lack the skill of how to get to a million dollars a year, okay.
9:38
Well, then, what are the sub skills underneath him?
That?
What are the things that are holding me back?
Well, I don't know how to get people in the door so you lack the skill of marketing and acquiring customers.
I'm not really good at sales.
Cool, then you suck at IJ identify that way?
I don't know how to get people to sign up.
Cool.
Then you suck at sales, okay?
9:54
And once you are good at sales, I can't get anyone in here to replace me who's as good as I cool.
Then you don't know how to teach Each sales which is another skill, right?
A more valuable skill because it's a scalable skilled allows you to move to impart.
This go on someone else, which is even more valuable than having which is why you know that I mean just being super candid being able to make a million-dollar gym is less valuable thing.
10:22
And then being able to have hundreds of people than teaching, hundreds of people how to have million dollar gems that make sense.
So anyways, if you think about everything and Of skill set that you have deficits of and then the next natural step of, once you acquire that skill set, being able to impart on other people, then you will be able to move quickly through the transitions as an entrepreneur and you will then never lose from any circumstance because it will always just point back to you and say, what am I missing in order to overcome this and then life happens for you instead of to you and you never think the victim thoughts because they don't serve you.
10:56
They don't do anything for you.
But allow you to wallow Which doesn't make you more money.
So, anyways, I hope that makes sense.
That is Jim launches their tenant which appear on boss, which is owning your outcomes independent of circumstance.
And identifying the skills that you lack, which cause something to not be successful or to be successful.
11:17
So anyways, I hope that was about before you, that was the thing that was on my heart this morning.
So I figured I would share with you hope, you're having an amazing day, make it happen, Monday, throw a like comment tag, whatever but keeping Amazing Love.
You guys and your why we do it all?
11:34
Catch you soon?
All right.

And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the gym Secret.
Our podcast today, I want to talk about the really cool topic.
That's one of my favorite topics, but it's how you can afford any type of traffic.
So, wouldn't that be TV?
0:41
Radio, Facebook, YouTube, whatever, right?
How you can afford any type of traffic, obviously, places where traffic is the most cheaply priced is where most people will go because they don't have a conversion process, that is extremely profitable.
And so, what I want to kind of break down here is like kind of numbers behind how this?
1:00
Works, right?
So where to begin in the affiliate world in the online marketing world, there's something called epcs, which is earnings per, click all right?
And so if you have an offer that converts really well too cold traffic so something that most people could want, for example, a flashlight good buddy of mine Trey Llewellyn.
1:19
They did 20 million dollars in sales in two months because they had crack this code that I'm about to talk about and what it comes down to is that for every click That he would get to the page.
He was able to pay out something like $2 $3 to the Affiliates and so then the question became to the Affiliates people who are sending him traffic.
1:40
How could I like, is it possible for me to send clicks to this, you know, page / offer for less than, you know, three dollars?
And the obvious answer for most of them was, yes, they could a lot of them could send clicks for 10 cents or 50 Cent's.
1:55
And so for them, they were able to get 6 to 18 to 1 10 to 1.
Back on their traffic, right and so the same concept applies to how you're building yourself pipeline, right?
And that's why having.
2:12
So, there's two main things that will feed into this, right?
One is the conversion percentage, right?
The percentage of, in this case, clicks converted into sales and then obviously the price, okay?
And so, I've talked about this in an earlier podcast but I was explaining the difference between like an lbo like a $21 trillion, a promotion versus amid ticket from Ocean.
2:38
But When you when you kind of unlock this equation and really start applying in your business, it opens a whole new level of security for your business because once you have a promotion and an offer and a process that allow you to make the most money per applicant lead, whatever you want to call them.
3:02
Then you strengthen your position in your Marketplace and like if you're a local gym and you have other gyms you're competing, against the person who can spend the most to acquire their customers to acquire leads or win, okay?
So I can break it down like this.
3:20
Let's say I'll use trays example and then I'll make it relevant to Fitness.
So Trace example, his average cart value for his, you know, flashlight.
I'm just going to make this number.
Let's just say it was a hundred bucks.
Okay.
So he was able to engineer, a beautiful sales Pipeline upsells and down cells and great copy, and all this kind of stuff to get the average person who was going to buy a $100, right?
3:46
And so we can back out that number that for how many people would click to that page 1 out of 30, right?
So, those three dollar epcs, right?
Earnings per click one out of 30 or so 3.33 whatever.
4:03
Would buy a hundred dollars worth of merchandise.
Right?
And so with that same concept, let's say we're using, let's say we're selling a thousand dollar program, fitness program, okay, you sell a thousand dollar fitness program.
I do, most people can afford a thousand doctors for a lot of people.
4:20
Like other people were listening to this to like, not in my Marketplace, that's not true.
I guarantee it because I used to literally just send people out to other peoples markets, all day long with 8, Min sales team and we just send them out to other peoples him.
First class, modicum thar, She was selling her boot camp at the time for $99 a month.
4:38
And she had a program like an eight week challenge, some yourself like 200 bucks, right?
And I sent my sales guy there who was this was his first month, but I had just told him that this is the price.
You are selling it for.
So he really didn't have any options to.
He didn't have to fight against limiting beliefs or whatever because I just told him, that's what we're saying that he was like, okay.
4:56
And so she saw a guy who didn't really know her gym or her program or her clients Come in and sell, you know, a bunch of people.
I think this is his first Monday, we still like 80 people in the first 20 days, right?
I heard you him at six hundred dollars a pop for six weeks.
5:13
So she's charging her dollars a month and we were charging her dollars a week, say Marketplace and we able to get it, right?
And so that's just a little foray into pricing but let's just say you're selling a thousand dollar products, okay?
Or service.
Hey, guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
5:33
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show. now, let's say that you can get out of a thousand clicks to your page, okay?
6:03
From whatever traffic Source you want, I'm trying to be traffic agnostic right now, but from whatever traffic, first, you want to get a thousand clicks to the page.
Now, here's where the conversion starts to matter.
Right.
So from those thousand clicks, let's say, your page converts at 20%, okay?
So that means you get two hundred leads for your campaign, okay?
6:21
So, 200 name phone or emails, here's where the second part of the conversion process is important.
Let's say, you have someone doing sales for you or you're doing the sales for you and of those two hundred leads you convert 20 percent, okay?
6:39
So as you get 40 people to buy your thoughts on our program, right seeing 40 thousand dollars, you make 40,000 dollars from those 1,000 clicks, right?
Which means that you're making $40 per click.
6:58
And this is where I always believed that brick-and-mortar selling services will always be very protected because the amount of margin that you can make per click something, the online marketing space out.
Does anything that anything in the online world has ever seen?
Which means we'll always be able to outbid people who are online retailers, which are usually the ones who know the most about online marketing.
7:17
But if you know a little bit about online marketing and you have an offline conversion process, it allows you to leverage far, far far, higher price points.
Seeing them in person, right?
So, if someone's willing to buy something online for $200, without even talking to a human being, this is where my argument for, like, yes, you should probably all raise your prices, anyone's listening this.
7:35
But if someone's going to take the time to decide to, to opt in for programming in the phones, talk to someone and then they take that to like you to put a time in the schedule to take time out of the day because their car, the driver your gym, then we invested this point.
And so as long as you have a sales process that really makes sense and you can provide service, you should be charging a lot more for it and believe it or not.
7:53
They'll actually get a better experience.
They will perceive it as Because they paid more for like these three bottles of wine.
Already tested this, right?
Three bottles of wine.
All exactly the same one they charge $10, one $50 and $100 people who drink it and thought it was 2:00 enjoyed it more than everyone else.
8:10
Crazy, right.
Mind blown.
They literally enjoy it more because they thought it had more perceived value.
So if you want your people to enjoy your service, more charge more for it and they'll get better results.
It's crazy.
So, back to the point of the EPC is though, is that he had when he had Ed, what is considered the number one affiliate of up affiliate offer of the last?
8:30
I mean, they see of all time but minimum the last decade.
Okay.
And she was able to get a PCS that were like three dollars, okay.
The funnel that I just explained to you is something that we do in our business all the time and we're getting $40 species 10 times, the greatest affiliate off of all time, all right?
And so when you think about it like that, you understand that you can really buy traffic from anywhere as long as you are earning per click.
8:52
All right.
And so let's say your traffic source.
Increases your lead cost from, I don't know. $10 to $30, right?
So if you're paying $30 a week, we just ran a promotion with one of one of our guys who did it.
9:10
He was getting on average. 40 dollar release, any of the marketing agencies are in, listen to this and try and tell say how we're bad at what we do.
Go for it attack away, but you're gonna have to disprove my next point, which is that he paid $40 lead and you convert it. 52% that is leads.
That's why the conversion process is important. 52% of those leads into a 25 hundred dollar sale.
9:31
Oh, okay, so he paid $80 two times, right?
50%.
So one out of two leads would turn into a 2500 shell.
So he paid $80 and got twenty five hundred dollars back.
So he made a hundred, thirty thousand dollars in 22 days, just using that.
9:49
In new sales you make 61 sales like 2,500 bucks.
A couple people pitiful, whatever but that was the that was the total gross 130 Grand.
So you take for granted advertising, most people don't have that kind of return.
And now do I think that Ryan is going to be very protected in this Marketplace and not really have to worry about any competitors to try to update him, probably not.
10:12
Because I would guarantee that most of you are listening.
This would ever even played close to $40 a week, right?
Because you have a conversion process for your earnings per click earnings per lead, are sufficient that you'd be the one playing them all get, but he can do it all day.
He does even look at his markings.
But just like, I don't look at my either because I know how I know how profitable is.
10:30
So whether or not, I pay $200 or thousand dollars per application for gym owners, we know the conversion process we have in place and the level of value that we can provide them is sufficient that it really becomes irrelevant.
I don't need to worry about it.
And so if you, if you're constantly monitoring trying to get Ali cost down a lot of times, the focus doesn't really need to be there in the focus really needs to be on your conversion process and the pricing, right?
10:55
And so he was able to convert a very high percentage of athletes at a very high price, which really, really, really protects you in the long run.
So that's the little nugget for today, is look at the conversion process.
Look at what your how much money you're making per customer on the front end.
11:10
I don't like doing back in numbers because then people get really exaggerated and Like a nice but like what are you making on the actual program?
You're selling The Upfront, right?
Because that will allow you to see how much you can really spend to acquire a customer and do so profitably.
Alright, so, I hope that was useful for you.
11:25
Look at the look at the pricing models, look at how much you're converting, what percentage of our Leisure converting.
And then you can back out how much you can pay for acquisition of a customer.
All right?
So really, really, really important numbers.
If you, if you know that, then you can start spending more confidently, you can buy, you can acquire more customers, you can do it faster, do it.
11:44
More confidence.
And then ultimately in your in your Marketplace, you can be far more strongly positioned to outbid all of your competition and they won't know what hit.
Hope you have an awesome day and I'll talk to you guys soon.
More confidence.
And then ultimately in your in your Marketplace, you can be far more strongly positioned to outbid all of your competition and they won't know what hit.
Hope you have an awesome day and I'll talk to you guys soon.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur coming from downtown Austin?
I am I've been Sort of like this this this content piece has been bogged, you know, ping pong in my head for a while and either it's going to turn out.
0:38
Really, really epic or it will be really not epic but hopefully it's epic.
So I'm calling this, the three Horsemen of the sales apocalypse which are the only three obstacles that you will ever need to overcome.
Now I contemplated making this super super, super super tactical but like I have probably 20 overcomes for each one of these things that are like, here's a paragraph.
1:00
This is the line of reasoning behind it, but I thought it might be more valuable for you to kind of understand the theory behind each one of them because once you understand the theory behind each obstacle and what you're really overcoming, then it's the difference between executing, you know, cooking a recipe and being a chef right?
1:16
Like a line cook just follows the steps in the recipe and then they can reproduce What the chef is making.
So if you were trying to be a chef of sales, then understanding these three things at a theoretical level will help you continue to develop new things.
New overcomes that are specific to how you talk and your personality and your facility trainers, Etc.
1:36
Okay, so for those of you don't know the three main obstacles that you have to overcome in any sale, not overcome, but that can come up in a sale.
And this is typically when someone, when you have not provided a sufficient Gap, basically saying like you want to get here, you are currently here.
Here's your Gap and there's no pain that you're going to want to cross it.
1:53
And here's my bridge right now.
If that bridge that you made was not good enough, right?
In the three obstacles are price delay as installing saying, hey, I need it so prices like, hey, that's too expensive.
I don't have that kind of money.
Etc.
The second is delayed being like, hey, I need to think about it, let me go home, let me sleep, you know, I never make decisions quickly all that kind of stuff, right?
2:16
And the third is decision maker.
So like, you know what, I have to talk to my husband.
I never make decisions without him.
We have a rule that over $100.
We do, you know what, BS they're going to tell you, right?
So what each of these is and then the subsequent theory that you need to understand.
2:31
So anything that has to do with price is a question of value.
Meaning that person doesn't think that you've described enough value to what you're selling them.
And exaggerated an example of this that will show you that.
I write when I say this is that if you were to say, hey for 500 dollars, I'm going to give you this house, they would find $500, right?
2:51
Because the value is so high in clear, right?
And so if you have that in your mind, then you can always think if this a price You then it means I didn't establish the Gap and I need to build value.
But you don't necessarily need to build value in terms of what they get, sometimes it's decreasing what they need to do, right?
3:10
And if you remember, one of my past videos, it was like the the value equation is magnitude of outcome likelihood of achieving, which is conviction where they actually believe that they're going to get their / time and effort.
And so typically it's going to be the conviction piece where they actually believe you that you need to work on and then sometimes it can be Decreasing time and effort.
3:31
Usually, you don't need to increase the the magnitude, the outcomes is most people get that part.
It's usually the believing the perceive likelihood of achieving it and then the time and effort, they're like, you know what, this sounds like a lot of work and so breaking down how easy you have made it for them, build the value, right?
3:47
So that in it, in a nutshell is all of all the price.
Overcomes that you will ever hear will be based around value comparing other things that they've spent to what they're doing now.
Do they really like we vote with our dollars, but the things that we care about Like all of that stuff is going to come down to Value, right?
4:03
The second is delay, right?
So any delay closes, I have to think about it, I'm not sure.
Whatever right?
There's a million of the overcomes, you're going to do it sooner or later might as well do it now.
So you can start enjoying the benefits sooner or whatever.
I there's a million of these types of closes but the thing is that all of them in common have one key thing, which is that you're going to confront the decision and you're going to identify the variables that that Prospect.
4:29
Needs to use to make the decision.
And so most people don't like making decisions because they're afraid of being wrong.
Right?
Making a mistake.
And so will you have to do is say, okay, cool.
Well let's just walk through to the, you know, like I need to think about it.
Cool.
What do you need to think about?
4:45
And then they're like, you're like cool.
Well let me tell you what most people use to make the decision.
Right?
There's three main things you know what they are and they're like, I don't know.
Like one do you believe that this program is going to help you get to where you're trying to go, okay?
To do you want to do with me and this facility?
Three.
Do you believe that you can do it and they're like, yeah, like, Okay, cool.
5:03
So like there's nothing to think about.
Let's go, you don't have meaning.
So it's just that everyone fears actually making decisions and so you have to walk them through that process.
There's a million different obstacles like closes for delays, but at the end of the day, you're going to force them to confront the decision.
That is it, that's all it is.
5:20
You're explaining to them that there's going to be no difference in information tomorrow than there is right now.
And like, you can even walk them through the fact, like most people are afraid of making decisions because they're afraid to make Steaks on my right.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
5:37
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like 8, Straight weeks really fast.
6:04
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
Right.
Okay well let's look at what the best case would look like.
Look like let's look at what the worst case would like, right?
And so you helped them confront and make the decision and that is everything that has to do.
So when you hear I need to think about it, think confirm right?
6:22
Identify variables, help them make the decision price think value.
I must not, I probably need to increase their conviction, right?
And I probably need to increase in in their perception of how little time and effort, they will need to have.
And that means that I need to show them the value by saying how I have made this for them and how unethical it is, right?
6:42
And you cannot miss it.
I'm cruising through.
This is right, this is probably my least favorite one because I think these people are victims and they're annoying so that I could even sack up and tell me that they they don't want to do something.
They have to say, I have to talk to my husband about it, which is drives me up a wall.
7:01
But anyways, here, what you're going to try and do is feed off of past agreements that you already know are there.
So, an example would be.
Well, does your husband already know that you are, you know, dissatisfied with how you look.
7:16
Yes.
Is he happy with the fact that you're dissatisfied with how, you know?
Okay.
So he agrees that you like that, he supports you in the fact that you should do something.
Yes.
Okay, then why would he not support here, right?
So it's like you have to feed off a past agreements to get the current one.
7:32
So it's kind of like a logical step that you have to go through because at the end of the day, if someone says they cannot make the decision Then then like you can't close them.
And so you're basically trying to establish that they've actually been given permission, they just weren't aware of it.
And so you just need to logic them through the fact that they have been given permission like, does your husband know you're here right?
7:51
Yes to see support the fact that trying to get healthy.
Yes, right.
Like it's you're stacking.
These is almost like knocking.
Oh my God, you're stacking.
These agreements to lie to the Natural outcome of.
Yes, you're empowered enough.
They agree with you enough that you can make this decision, right?
And then you can tack on little things like, hey, it's better to Forgiveness than permission.
8:10
Hey if your husband's anything like my wife, they've never really stopped me to do something that I was really passionate about.
Is this something that you're really, you know, interested in of course it is.
Okay great.
So then, you know, like there's little things that you can say like that but the main the sticking of it is that you find past agreements and then you drag them to the present and apply them to the current situation.
8:27
All right?
That's how you get over decision-maker closes.
So, hopefully this was value for you.
But understanding those three main obstacles and what are the real key?
Key drivers that we're trying to bring home with price.
You're going to work on conviction in a year and increase your going to decrease the time and effort or their perceive time and effort for it right?
8:47
Increasing the perceived Maxi tobacco.
Most people do that pretty decently in the sales like if your if your future pacing at all and talking about what they're going to feel like what they're going to look like and what do you know what it feels like to step on the scale at xmx pounds.
You've kind of you painted that picture, right?
And so usually most people will act on the conviction side and then make it the time and effort seemed more reasonable because of the effort you've put it on your The way confrontation and identification of variables, that's all you're doing right, making them confront the decision and then giving them the variables that they need to make the decision.
9:17
So that they feel good about it paint, the best case, paint the worst case scenario for them.
And then decision-maker, like I just said past agreements.
Now there's one that could be like the hidden fourth Obstacle of this, which would be like all like fitness-related obstacles or like outside circumstance perceived obstacles, which would be, you know, I hip injury.
9:37
Like what do you guys?
He's due for that, right?
They're not real obstacles.
You just have to be prepared with answers like I can't work out on Tuesdays.
Is that going to be a problem?
I hate broccoli.
Is there broccoli on the meal plan?
Like like those types of things are not real obstacles but sometimes people like a sales person who's nervous will get tripped up on someone says something like that.
9:54
Think it's a deal breaker but throughout is so you just have to know what you're going to say there and so any any type of, you know, time-related thing the he's like there's a million ways to get around those things which is just like kept like, let's walk through your schedule together and let's figure out a time that works and Can you things are s?
10:09
Just problem solving but they're not real obstacles.
So anyways guys, if that was valuable for you, I hope it was rather than giving you a super say this.
And then say this and say this which there's always time for that.
Those are the three main ones that your sales guys need to overcome and understand what's the what's the actual mechanism behind it that actually makes the makes the overcome work.
10:28
Hope that makes sense.
You throw a thumbs up so that other people can see it.
That be swap.
Otherwise have an amazing hump day.
You guys are awesome.
I love you all and I'll catch you guys.
All right.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, everyone happy motivation Monday, you know, Monday madness, Monday, make it happen, Monday moneymondays Etc.
Anyways, I this this This little mini piece of content has been starring in my head for probably a little bit over a week and it started with a conversation that I had with Dave, Linda Mom.
0:38
And so, I guess I'm calling this.
We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
And anyways, Dave's a really high high selling Amazon Seller.
He's got an e-commerce business and he also has like 9,000 other businesses, and he was saying he's like hell, bro.
Like I haven't talked to you about business stuff because well, Let me, let me tell you something.
1:01
So any Grace is a mutual friend of ours, and she has a New York Times bestseller on how to quit drinking, right?
He's like, so like talking to you about businesses like talking to Andy about drinking is like I haven't talked to her about drinking because like I really like drinking.
1:16
He's like and so I kind of want to keep drinking and I know that if I talk to her I'm going to have to stop drinking and I know it's going to work because she's really good at and he's like so the reason I don't want to talk to you about like the stuff I need to do in business is because like I know that it's going to work and then I'm going to have to like do it and he's like and he said that he meant it as a compliment obviously but it made me really think a lot and he was like some people just aren't ready even though they know what they need to do, they're just not ready.
1:47
And so as like the the sub points for this, I would conjecture that a lot of people have the life that they really want, not the one that they wish they want.
But the one that they really want because if you know, what you need to do, which most of us really do know what we need to do most of the time, right?
2:08
Like like you don't like we need to be reminded of the things that we need to do.
More than we need to be taught me things because we know what to do.
Like, you know, you should take care of your customers, you know, you should reach out with them.
Like, you know, you should check in on them if they didn't show up to the gym by the second or third day of the week.
2:25
Like, you know, you should do that, but sometimes you don't, because it's easier to just not not right, and when I say it's easier it's like it's like I wanted to watch Netflix more than I wanted to go reach out to my customers, do the retention stuff, right?
2:44
And so the life that I have the business of that I have, as a result of my wants is exactly the life that I want, right?
And so it's not a question of like, am I am I happy with like you are maximally happy with the choices that you've been making?
3:02
Because you beacons are continuing to make them.
And so if you Don't want the outcome that you were achieving then you have to change the desire right or associate it differently.
And so I know this is like super abstract, but it just the final thing is just that like we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught and a lot of times we need to do the things that we already know we should be doing rather than try and find something to wear sexy because it's the boring consistency.
3:32
That makes things work right?
Like we still add Jim launch have not come up with.
Anything new, in terms of memory, we come up with lots of new stuff in terms of what we provide for our customers.
But in terms of what our programs are, we have a gym launch program, which is 16 week intensive.
3:48
And then we have an EFT sort of just like a gym because it was exactly what I modeled it after because that's the business I knew.
And so, if you're getting into all these other things like Dave, Linda mom, was with all of his other businesses that he knew that if you talk to me, I would tell him to stop and you have all of these side distractions that, you know, you should not be doing.
4:06
And you should probably just listen to The Voice in the back of your head.
That already knows the right answer.
Thank you.
This is the point I was trying to make so Dave, Linda Mom Hey Mose, a nation quick break.
Just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
4:24
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Said he didn't want to talk to me about business yet because you knew what I was going to say.
4:45
And so any knew that it was going to work and so he knew what to do.
He didn't even need me to tell him.
He already knew what to do and was choosing not to do it.
And so I guess the rhetorical question is like how many things do we know we should be doing that?
5:01
We're not actually doing and like do you do you really need to pay for and this is me being like the person who gets paid For information and Coach, right?
Do you really need to pay for someone to tell you what to do when you know what?
5:16
Like you already know what to do like in the back of your head?
You know, that you should probably not be looking at the girls on Instagram when you have a wife, right?
You know, that and so you shouldn't do it right?
Like and just like if you just listen to that voice rather than enrolling in the, hey, I need to, you know, improve my marriage program.
5:37
And then it says like, hey, You know, compliment your wife like hey, ask her if there's anything you can do and like, you know, give first like give without expectation.
Like you know, that's what you need to do, we're just not doing it.
And then we need to have someone tell us to do the thing that we already know we should be doing.
5:54
And so, I guess to wrap this up in a, in a little bow to the best of my thank you for staying with me is like How many things do you feel like you need?
Like, do you really need to learn about your business?
And how many things do you really just need to do that?
6:10
You already know how to do when Chris and Robin Barnett flat.
Hopefully, they don't mind.
So they won a contest that we had internally.
And so we flew them out for the, for the weekend and I think they were planning on having like really in-depth business chats with us about like, okay, where do this, and we remove this price point in like all the stuff and and at the end of like, the full time that we were there, They concluded and you know we concluded with them or like you guys have all the skills.
6:37
You guys know what your suppose you guys know how to sell.
You guys know how to Market.
You guys, just need to do that consistently and they're like, yeah, you're right because they were trying to, you know, break the million-dollar barrier and they're really close.
They hit 70 grand, but in their last month, but they're like, I'm just trying to break through that and it's, there's nothing new.
7:01
Like, there's nothing new at all.
It's literally just being consistent and doing it all the time whether you want to or not.
And so that's why I guess I'm calling this, like, we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
We know the things that we should be doing.
7:17
We know how to take care of customers.
Most people know that you should smile, most people know, you should greet people by name, you know, you should have a high-energy class, you know, you should probably change the playlist and make them fresh on your regular basis, right?
We know we should reach out to them, you know, once or twice a month, just to check and see how they're doing.
We know this stuff, we just don't do it and so I guess this is me.
7:36
Reminding you do the thing that you know you should probably be doing in your marriage and your business rather than spending all the time to seek out something sexy or something new.
Because the reality is that, if it's sexy new, it's probably not going to last because the things that are Timeless like smiling being kind caring, reaching out, having constant communication with people whether that's your employee or your employees with, it's your customers, whether it's your spouse.
7:59
Like those are Timeless, I heard Jeff Bezos was talking about the Investments that they do and Amazon and he's like, we will always invest in things that make products get to our end consumers faster.
We always invest in things that make things cheaper.
8:16
Is it?
Because we believe that those are things that customers will always want.
And so, you can think of, like, some business principles are more Timeless, like, communicating being kind like caring keeping clean facilities, like having trainers that great people by name, you know, Reaching out to people who did not show up just to make sure to show them, you care.
8:36
Like those are all the things that we know we should do and we just don't do them.
So Maybe it's just time to do it and I think about what new sexy thing is.
Anyways, I hope you guys are having a money Madness Monday, and I hope this maybe be a monotonous Monday for you, boring?
8:53
But rich and I hope that you take this harder, I hope it was valuable to you.
And anyways, have an amazing week and I love you all.
Thank you for giving me a small drop of your attention today.
Catch you soon.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
It's good morning.
I'm really excited for this podcast video because I've actually had this concept on my mind.
This this this piece probably for the last Student half weeks.
I feel like it's been like in the back of my mind like percolating and whatnot, and it's combining with like four or five other ones that I like felt it this morning.
0:37
As I was eating breakfast, I was like all right today's the day I'm gonna make it so originally I wanted to call this, why?
I don't go home for the holidays and there's probably going to be some things that I say that are a little bit controversial, but there are things that have absolutely been some of the keys to our continued growth and success and I thought you might want to hear them.
0:58
And so I put the It was this for, at least for right now is Success equals ingrained intolerance.
And so, one of the reasons that I don't go home for the holidays, is that a lot of people haven't haven't grown?
Since I left, right?
They haven't had 10 years of growth, they've lived the same six months, 20 times, right?
1:18
Since I was gone and when I go back, they want to meet me in my past.
And so, they want to speak things over me that aren't Who I Am anymore.
And then because It's difficult for them to to the word connect, right?
1:36
The, their perception of who I used to be and who the person is sitting in front of them, how they reconcile.
Thank you reconciling.
Those two things is really difficult for a lot of people because it's breaking the Box.
They want to put you in.
But the reality is that most people don't change.
1:53
Entrepreneur's.
Do because we have to write, we call it growth.
Instead of change for the outside world, for the non entrepreneurs who stay in their sandbox every day.
It's, it's hard to calculate and so I'll go home and they'll say, oh, like my dad says that.
2:10
So say you have a, you have the shortest fuse out of anyone.
You just have such a short temper.
And anyone who is in our company, my wife, like, I mean, anyone who knows me and spend time with me, would probably not say, And, and so, I will be, I mean, very aggressive in combating that immediately because I'll be like, don't speak that over me, that's not true.
2:33
That's not who I am.
And it makes people really uncomfortable and so there's a lot of times if I go see an uncle, you know what I mean?
If I'm at a holiday event and then they're like, oh Alexander, you've always been a little bit loose with the alcohol but I don't even drink anymore.
2:49
You know what I mean?
Like, you're speaking about my past and it makes people people really uncomfortable and I would implore you to meet those things head-on.
And the reason that I don't like going home for the holidays because I have to be on guard because when I when I leave I feel like I have to like wash myself of the things that people were trying to speak over me and it's constant.
3:12
It's uh, nits unending.
Its incessant right there.
Constantly.
Trying to put me back in the box.
That makes sense to the right.
And I Used to have that happen.
And so, when I have these conversations, it's passing comments.
3:28
It's little things.
It's never because most people aren't confrontational, right?
And so it's never like, you are, like, you don't even like, it's not like that, but it's just like, oh, you know, how you always are.
And they'll say, even with like a smile, like it's like, it's a good thing but like you have to catch it because you know how it makes you feel when you hear it.
3:46
You're like, that's not true.
That's not me, right?
I'm done with that.
That's in my past and so Like this is who I am and I have to take like a week to detangle and then basically re speak over the things that I am or that I choose to be right?
4:02
And so it's one of the main reasons that I don't go back for the holidays and I really, really don't like it.
And I definitely don't like spending any portion of extended time there is because it feels like I'm going backwards.
And and what, you know what?
We are.
All as a community trying to accomplish is not normal and we just have to come to terms with the fact that it isn't normal.
4:23
It's Hey, that is not normal but it also means that normal people aren't going to like it, right?
And so like the the higher up we go in business.
I think, at least this is just my subjective understanding of how, I'm how I'm perceiving it.
As I go through it, the more intolerant we become of people who try and I mean, it's even tones.
4:44
Like I'll be like, don't speak to me that tell them.
Even if they're saying their, I think I'm like, it seems disrespectful.
It bothers me and, like, you become more and more aware because you're like, Let me teach you how to treat me, right?
And sometimes you have to do that and especially when it's been a long period of time.
5:00
You have to teach people how you like to be treated now and a lot of times it's a lot different than it was when they first met you, right?
And it's the hardest with family because I'll be really real with you.
There's a lot of people that I'm connected with that.
I probably would never see again.
If I didn't have a blood relation and I manage our space very well and so if we, you know, we go back it's only going to be for a short period of time.
5:23
There's no other reason besides the fact that we share a biological bond that I would ever see you because you haven't, you don't have the same goals.
You don't have the same values.
You don't want to do the things I want to do.
When we see each other, you make me feel worse.
Why would I see, right?
Just being very real with you guys and maybe this is something that I look back at this video, five years from now, and I'll have grown more, and I'll have more perspective, but that's that's where we are.
5:46
Now.
Now, total total pivot.
Sometimes, you know what, I'm not going to Pivot like I'm going to I'm going to dive a little deeper in this.
Hopefully, you see you guys don't mind being so intolerant of this stuff is like is so key to being able to like grow I'm telling you because and that's why, that's why.
6:04
There's no we keep such quiet space, right?
Because it's like, the only place you don't have to have your guard up constantly fending off.
What other people are trying to tell you about yourself, right?
And so, you can kind of build it while it's while it's in its infancy, and you're not as strong yet in these new attributes that you're trying to have.
6:22
I was talking to High level entrepreneur yesterday, right?
And he's like, ah, I mean I'm just horrible to details and I was like don't speak that over yourself.
I'll say because your business might need you to be good at details when you go from 10 to 20 million, right?
Don't say that.
6:38
And he was like, you're right.
I was like, yeah, you choose your choosing to not be good at details.
Do you really think that if your kids were going to die?
Like, you need to look, learn to remember things to be able to do it.
Well, yeah, when we, all right, then you're choosing not be good at it.
That's your choice that your belief right?
And so like if you Identify these things like, man, I'm getting really deep on this, I know, but like the identities.
6:58
So fluid like we can change in an instant like Tony Robbins talks about this stuff all the time like like we can just like the only the only moment that we're actually able to live in is right now, right?
And so, all of the things that we had before us are only stories that we can either choose to replay because they're positive attributes or choose to ignore.
7:19
If they're negative attributes.
A lot of us just stay in these Loops of speaking these things over.
Ourselves that don't even serve us, right?
One of my favorite things in the world, probably one of my favorite scent.
Like one of the most profound sayings is we questioned all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those we never questioned it all and I always I love that because it just makes you aware of.
7:42
Like I love catching myself on a belief that I've always had that I believe.
So thoroughly that I never actually thought to question it because that's how much I believed it, right.
It's just been There and so like the higher up we go the more we kind of uncover these beliefs about what's possible.
8:00
What can we do?
How can we grow?
How quickly can change happen, right?
I mean if you look at our business if you look at our business, right?
Like we pivoted from a done-for-you model to the done with you model that we have now in April of 2017.
8:19
And so from April of 2017 until today, right?
That's like 19 months I think right.
We've gone from zero to arguably the biggest company like in the brick and mortar gym fitness world and we're like two or three times the size of anyone else who's like the second, runner-up and 2019.
8:38
We're going to probably three to four x that I can say that pretty with a lot of certainty.
And so like how quickly are you able to achieve what you want to achieve?
Is it supposed to take a year because you're choosing to believe that it's supposed to take a year.
How quickly can you onboard?
8:54
Someone, let me give you another story.
I was so we're about to do a very big launch for our Legacy group.
I can't tell you what it is, but a friend of mine launched a new service category and his business and it blew up overnight.
He had a huge explosion of traffic.
9:10
He was running like some ads and they just took off writing, couldn't do anything about it and so he hired Thirty people in 14 days first customer service team, 30 people in 14 days, Most Nation real quick.
9:25
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can fly anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
9:44
And so when we had our queue for planning, right?
Our core, our fourth quarter planning, we had our customer service director and and Lily, I love you to death.
Has nothing to be like this was what happened during that during the actual meaning she's like I feel comfortable saying that I can bring four people on every month between now and next launch date.
Right?
9:59
Which would, you know, get us to probably 16 or so people 16 to 20 right by the launch date which is going to be like three or four months away.
And so then I told that story about my friend who just done this, he hired Thirty people in 14 days because he Had to write.
10:15
And so, a lot of times, the necessity is one of the biggest things that allows us to break our beliefs because we have to we have no other choice, right?
And so I love thinking and that's why when we have scripts and whatnot and the show rates, double based on the fact that, you know, you actually are going to leave a location and you're not going to be able to sell that person.
10:33
The tonality of how you're speaking to the prospect, even though the words are the same.
The fact that it's just what you believe, that changes the outcome of the influence on the other person is like so cool to me.
And so the question is, like, how can we trick ourselves into believing, what?
10:49
We need to believe in order to grow faster?
I made this, I did this experiment, you know, three years ago where I put on like 35 pounds of muscle and six weeks, right?
And I started and they asked me to write an article is muscle strength and I did it natural.
You can choose to believe you or not, but I did.
And it was it was there by pounds of muscle, but it was 35 pounds and they're a lot of.
11:08
It was muscle within six weeks and I started the article off by saying like, what if you actually had Game 35 pounds in six weeks and get and at 100 to your Bachelor.
Would you do, right?
And so I try to put this confirm like these confines on myself and I was like, I probably wouldn't just lift, you know, twice a week right for that lift.
11:27
I probably lift it like once or twice a day and then that's what I did.
And then I got really, really strong really fast.
I added 100 pounds in my pitch in six weeks and I was natural, right?
And I did that because of the confinement like the confines that we put ourselves under and so sometimes I wonder like What things are we allowing to be spoken over ourselves by others first and then second what?
11:51
Things are we speaking of ourselves?
That we don't even know that we're doing.
And so constantly questioning like those things that we speak over ourselves has been honestly, one of the biggest things that has allowed us to grow and so I know that I haven't been as tactful in the last few content videos.
12:09
I hope you guys don't mind.
It's just an what's on my mind.
We had Chris and Robin Barnett who flew out here.
Because they want a competition that we were holding in secret.
And anyway, so Christian Robin Barn came out and they were like, we feel like we're stuck, right?
We feel like we're in a bottleneck and like, we just can't, we're just trying to break through.
12:28
And when I talk to them about it, I the whole time they were here for the whole day, I didn't tell him a single tactical thing to do differently with their business, not one, but we identified was the things that they were speaking over themselves in the things that they were.
12:44
Choosing to believe about how quickly things can happen, right?
And so, I'll give you an example.
I hope they don't mind.
Robin is Chris's wife didn't want to be in the gym anymore.
She's like, it's not my passion, you know, like I like now we're comfortable.
Like, I kind of want to do my own thing and so it was causing some Strife in their relationship mostly because like, you know, She felt, you know, the truth to him that he had to keep doing it for the he felt guilty that she don't mean there's just kind of both sides of it, right?
13:11
And so they were like, what we're going to let Robin go.
You know, she's going to leave in four months, right?
So we're gonna get four months and then she'll get out of the business and I was like why didn't she just get out today?
Like she doesn't want to do it.
You don't want her there, like why don't you just get out today?
Like why are you choosing to believe that it needs to take four months?
13:29
No, I guess it doesn't.
It was like, right?
And so a lot of times like I've just this is just been recently for me.
I've had a lot of conversations with guys who are doing 5 to 12 million a year in their businesses and a lot of them have been doing this a lot longer than me.
13:47
And they're like, are you freaking grown?
So if like, how are you hitting the numbers you're hitting, how is the growth rate that you guys are having like, how is it possible, right?
And like, we've really just like, that's right.
Not to be weird about this.
But like we've just chosen to believe it's possible.
We've really just chosen to believe it's possible.
14:04
And a lot of times like, if you talk to them and like you look at it's like you see these guys who are really, really, really high up in the business World.
A lot of times I do talk very non-taxable very much mindset stuff and I think it's and I used to really not appreciate it, but now I think I'm appreciate a little bit more because the reason that a lot of people aren't successful is because of the beliefs that they have.
14:24
Because if you can remove and break those beliefs, a lot of times, they will go find the tactics that are Caesarea right to win.
And so and the higher up, you go, the the cleaner people keep their space and the reason they do that, the reason they keep it.
So quiet is so that they can pinpoint anything that comes in their area, right?
14:43
Anything that's going to break or chip it them or just like bother them in any way.
The keep this bubble around them.
And then what that does though is that it gives them such clean perspective, including Vision on, what's going on.
Because a lot of times when I have these guys Like I said, what you're doing, you know, five, six ten million a year and they're like, what's going on?
15:03
It becomes really obvious.
It's really, it's really apparent.
I'll give you another example.
I had yesterday, I talked to a guy who's doing, he's doing half a million a month right now, and he has a split between two businesses.
He's got one business does like four hundred thousand a month.
He's got one that does 100,000 a month and he's like well the big you know the form of thousand dollar month, business is my old business, it's the one that it's got all the complexity and hate the customers.
15:29
All this stuff, right?
And then he's like and then this business is really simple.
It's super profitable.
I'm running like three times the margin.
I run in that business and and he's like so I just I think I just can't figure out how to grow and also do you really can't figure out a girl?
15:46
He's like, yeah, just I got so much stuff going on and I was like, yeah, you should probably just get rid of the thing.
That is a big headache for you and do the thing that you really like doing.
I was like, do you think if you got rid of all of the attention, that that 400,000 Armand thing?
It's sucking up.
You be able to double the 100,000 or more things like yeah, like easy and I was like, cool.
16:04
Then why don't you do that, right?
And it becomes really apparent in obvious to you on the outside.
Like I mean these guys aren't dumb, you know?
I mean he's doing 698 like he's not stupid, it's just the beliefs that we truly believe are the ones that we don't see.
Right?
And so it's really interesting in like I think all the time about like I want to be wiser, I want to have more discernment and if you really if you start to dissect like what is wisdom, Wisdom is being able to see is that is if two people are looking at the same situation the wiser person sees things that the other person doesn't and so it's Vision.
16:40
It's being able to see what other people's don't see.
And a lot of times they're just unseen change that.
People have already chosen to tie themselves up with right?
And we're having a lot of gym owners.
I've had just recently last ring, a gym owners who you're stopping like Manna we're just stuck at sixty thousand a month.
Like I don't know what this bottleneck is and I always respond.
16:58
Like it's not the business model, right?
It's you.
And it's and it's and I should probably respond more specifically.
It's a belief that you have that you haven't identified them, that's holding you back.
A lot of times it's just because you're choosing to make less money like no joke, a lot of people choose to make less money so people like off we have gimenez right now who are ask like, hey like I've got this campaign it's crushing it.
17:24
I think I'm going to turn it off for next month, right?
Because like we have a lot going on and I'm like if you want to choose to make less money, that's your choice, you know?
And so, we make these choices.
Like, if you, if you order, articulate them differently, you probably think they were ridiculous and I had every Listen, I've had just in the last two, I start to talk to, for entrepreneurs last two weeks that are doing 5 million or more per year and each one of the conversations ended with like what when you put it like that.
17:50
I sound like an idiot and I was like, well are you so cool?
No, no, it's like, then you should probably change the way you're doing it, right?
And so it's just these emotions in these beliefs that get in our way of like, what is seems so obvious.
And it's just because some, we are emotional beings, right?
18:05
We are, we make decisions with emotions and we try and logic it later, but when you look at things, We a lot of times, some of the, some of the, the answers are obvious, right.
Well, I've got this trainer that I've had for two years, but they're such a pain.
They never want to do anything other than anything that's new, but I have some clients that that's the like, mm?
18:22
Okay.
Do you think that if you had a new trainer that was like, bought in that you would be able to grow more.
So, red it is, is the fear of losing these few clients that are attached to this one trainer is outweighing the potential growth.
You would have from the key player that you know you need in order to make the model work.
18:40
Right and then when it's phrased that way it becomes obvious.
Yeah, I got to let him go duh, but you don't have the perspective it and so sometimes you just need someone on the outside.
But anyways, guys, this was just something that was on my mind and I just like it was like stirring in me, but be mindful of the things I speak people speak over you and the tone that they do it and just like if you feel weird after someone says something stopped the conversation catch it and then address it and be like, please don't speak to me like that.
19:08
Please don't say those things.
Things about me.
It really bothers me.
I'm really working on this where I've worked a lot on this and I don't I don't appreciate it.
It really bothers me and if that person cares about you they will change and if they don't get him out of your life, you don't need that right and and the most important person to make sure that you're doing that with you like if you were the one who saying man, I'm just not good at details man.
19:31
I'm just I'm just I hate employees Good Luck running a business.
I hear something like these are things I over here even in our group like, please you're idiots and like do you really think that that is a good belief to grow and repeat inside of yourself if you want to grow and scale a business, probably not right, but be mindful of things that you're saying because and then ask yourself, like does this belief certain and if it doesn't get rid of it, so anyways, I hope you guys have an amazing weekend.
20:03
Love you all.
Thank you guys for four Your attention.
I know it's your most valuable resource, so thank you.
I hope I gave you a good return on it and I hope you guys have an amazing, amazing day.
All right to love









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hey, what's going on?
Everyone?
Happy.
To a tactical Tuesday, get stuff done.
No talk to use days.
We actually have a policy at Jim launch.
That on Tuesdays, we don't do meetings so that people can get stuff done.
That being said, I've been, I've been I've been slacking on the constantly least.
0:44
I'm trying to try to up, get my up, my game and in reality, I have all these things that I, that will come up during the day that I want to bring up, but if I'm like in the middle of something, I can't make it and then usually, like, I lose my, my zest for it.
Anyways, I was literally just talking to Dave Dunham.
And about this.
1:02
He's like, hey, you know, we went from scarcity to abundance.
We've hit all of our EFT membership goals, we hit our income goals and he's like, I'm just really having trouble pushing through, you know, like just really wanting to get to that next level, right?
1:17
Like it just there's diminishing returns and it you know, it's like, you know what did you do to stay motivated?
And the reason I want to make this video is because I also talked to our sales team last night, about something really similar to this, right?
Because one of the things that Evans.
And I'm not saying our sales team suffers from this book, like systems are generally suffer from this is that especially if you have a good team, they will make enough money to satisfy what their goals were coming into the job, right?
1:42
So the make enough money that they have satisfied.
Their needs.
You don't want to when a, when a sales guys taking home 150,000 a year and he's a single guy.
Most people have pretty much satisfied, their needs at that point and so that's one of the main points why I say like, people with kids and people who are married, tend to make more.
1:59
But what that Is they've expand their they be larger personal need and so that they make more money because they have no choice.
Now, the key here to, like, breaking through the product to be Plateau, or whatever you want to call it for, like making sure that the business can continue to grow, is that you have to not be fulfilling your own need for fulfilling the needs of your clients.
2:20
And so for those of you who know how, like we run a gym launch, there's so much stuff that we were building constantly because the need that we're trying to fill is The Gap is the problem that we see in the industry, like, why is there no software that like actually makes end to end from click to EFT seamless?
2:40
That's a huge need.
You know what I mean?
Like how is retention?
All the retention systems.
Why are those not automated yet?
It's a huge need, right?
Like, how can we create continual Legion for our gyms on a regular basis?
We had to build an entire department to do that and that took time and now it's done and it's cranking but like each of those things.
3:00
Huge needs that were trying to fulfill.
And so right now if you're in your gym right now and you're like man I don't know.
It's do I don't know how to like get motivated again it's because you're trying to get motivated based on your need, right?
You're trying to get motivated based on what you need and the reality is like the amount of money that Layla and I make every month and I promise you, I say this not to brag but I say to demonstrate is more like we could retire off the amount of money that we met every month.
3:26
It's insane.
And it's because we don't like it's just a by-product.
Like we don't even think about what's coming in all.
We're use, like, we just take that stuff and we're like, what can we use this for to build something sick, and even more epic for the gyms that we have?
And so if you can connect and this is why this is like the, like the really real, this is like the non-sexy stuff that, like, no one wants to talk about.
3:48
Is like, if you don't love your customers, right?
And you're not in sync, if you don't feel their pain, that they're feeling then you won't be as driven to solve their problem, right?
And it's the difference.
Prince between shooting for a goal and solving a problem right goals.
4:05
You can tap you tap them, you know, you tap the board and then everyone comes down, right?
Like, Hey, we're going to hit this is nothing, sometimes you do, but then the next month you almost make up for the fact that you doubled your sales one month because you actually tried right.
Then the next month, your sales drop in half of you burned out, right?
4:21
It's because you're trying to hit a goal rather than solving a problem because we try me think about things from a problem-solving standpoint.
You have to think about them in a way that you want them to to be solved and stay solved, right?
Because probably like Hey guys, real quick.
4:36
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
4:59
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
That's the difference in terms of how you're thinking, right?
And if you don't know, your clients problems are because you're not connected to them, then you won't have a desire to go solve them.
5:15
And then we set these artificial goals that are for our self based on needs that are irrelevant, right?
Because we don't need any more, right?
And so this is definitely me talking to the gems that are more in abundance.
You have been with us for a while who are like, we're doing well, right?
And so it's like how do you break out of the?
The like I went from barely making it to being stressed out too.
5:33
Like now, I have a cushion I've got cash flow and we've got regular profit every month.
Like how do I go to that next level?
And it's just understanding that it's not about you.
Like you set the goals initially because you needed to you made the money that you had to because you needed to you set the systems in place because you needed to.
5:49
But now it's not about your needs to about your customers needs, and it always should have been.
But like you couldn't even see that in the beginning because you were in so much scarcity, right?
But once you're out of that, you have to Sheree shift.
You have to Pivot.
And the, the like, the real.
Real question is like, how do you actually connect with those?
6:05
Client needs, because let's be real, a lot of the gym owners that we have, a lot of them are guys, who were skinny, and then got jacked, and then opened a gym that serve predominantly females who are 38 years old, who are trying to lose weight after their second kid.
There's a lot of Disconnect right?
You're like I don't really feel your pain right because I've never been over with, I've had great genetics.
6:25
I was powerless thing I was doing cosplay competitions or whatever it is and so like your reality is not real for me, I'm only saying this because I know that now that we've connected with gym owners on such an intimate level and like I feel the pain of everything, like the amount of stuff that we need to do as a company is overwhelming, the amount of things that we want to do.
6:43
Do you like the amount of mountains that we want to climb and we cannot hire fast enough, right?
We have 70 employees, remember hundred by mid-January like the amount of huge projects that we are trying to push forward to move the entire industry forward to take it from its knees to Standing Tall on its feet.
6:59
Like if you can think about your clients like that and their problems like that you will win but it's not about winning and that's the thing, right?
Like it's about like how can I really, really solve this problem for these people?
And if you are always thinking about it from that angle, I guarantee you, they will always be more to do because customers are never God ever, right?
7:19
Like now, if Amazon Prime takes Tuesday to show up, I'm like, what the hell?
Jeff like, what's going on, bro?
Like, come on, like Tick-Tock.
Like I ordered this thing yesterday.
Like, where is it, right?
But if you were to say that five years ago, you'd be an absolute idiot, right.
7:34
But like, now, it's expected because customer needs will always move forward, right?
And so if you have that and you, over-deliver, don't worry, they'll be dissatisfied soon.
And so it forces you to continue to innovate.
We continue to improve and when you only About them, you don't need to worry about competition because they're not doing shit anyways because they're stuck in the well I you know, I satisfied my needs or their in scarcity and they can even think about anyone else.
7:56
It seems besides their own, right?
But once they get out of scarcity and they get into complacency, that's the next big rut that most people staying.
And the only way, the only way to break through that is to fall in love with your customers and I'm being real.
A lot of people, I don't love my customers.
If you're really, really real with yourself, right?
Like, I don't really love it.
8:12
Okay, that's fine.
Now, like you have two options, leave the business here and And finally customers that you love or realize that you love being in business, right?
Like a good friend of mine has a cookie store.
He's personal trainer.
Does he really love cooking?
8:28
Like does he really love cookies?
Is he passionate about cookies?
I mean, sort of, you don't have anybody's not like, I'm gonna change the cookie world.
No, he loves business and he wants to be excellent at business.
He's an addiction to Excellence, right?
And so if you can, think about it from that angle and then you can connect with, okay, how can I be more?
8:46
Excellent.
It's really looking at the customer problems and saying, how can I solve the next week?
How can I solve the next one?
Here's a huge list of all of them and I promise you, if you ask them, what are the things you're struggling with, you will get a laundry list that is longer than you can handle and if you feel overwhelmed by it, that's a good thing because then you know that you're on the right track.
9:04
So anyways, um, you probably know the difference between the content that's curated but that's like fresh on my mind.
Anyways guys, hope that was, you know, bow before you.
And like if you're in that complacent spot like you have to really Get into your customers needs and the problems that you need to solve for them and then prioritize those problems and then attack them.
9:25
Because if you do that, your customers will see that you care.
They'll see how hard you're trying for them.
And then they'll want to stay.
They will talk to their friends about how much you really give a shit.
So, lots of love.
Hope you guys have a tactical Tuesday, get stuff, done Tuesdays, and thanks for being awesome and amazing.
And, you know, will tap a little like, or tag manager under anything, if you think it was worth it, all right?
9:47
Lots of Guys, have a great day and I'll talk to you soon.









0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
What is going on, everyone?
I wanted to make a sequel to I guess.
Probably one of the most popular podcast video podcast that I've made in a little bit.
The last one about success equals ingrained in tolerance, had more people reach out to me to visually after that one.
That I think I've had in a long time and so I think I touched a little bit of a vein there.
0:36
And so I wanted to do a little bit of a follow up, but instead of having the topic, be how to be on the defensive, which is sort of what the last one was about kind of like basically, controlling your space both, you know, like physically and mentally and making sure that no one that's in there, speaks over your puts things on you, that are not what you want.
0:58
This one is about it.
Same concept, on the offensive, how to manipulate others into creating the environment that that you want.
And I want to tell three very short stories that should illustrate the concept.
And just a quick thing before I get into it, the difference between manipulation and help is intention.
1:17
If you are manipulating someone and I purposely is a negative thing because it's more Salient as a headline.
But manipulating is where you want, someone you're trying to get someone to do some that has a negative outcome for that.
Well, as helping them is getting someone to do.
Something that has a positive outcome for that, right sales and helping should be the same thing right now.
1:35
Now that we've made that definition clear, there's a story, it's a middle eastern Parable.
So, maybe some of the Americans, the crowd haven't heard of it, but there was a Mulla Mulla nasruddin.
He's kind of like the jokester that a lot of the children's Parables for about and one of them was one asked me getting goes to a restaurant, right?
1:53
And he goes there, and he gets horrible service, right?
And he's and he's not dressed very well.
He's dressed in plain clothes and The guy just totally dismisses them and treat them.
Horribly is late is rude.
All I kinda stuff, right?
And so, then the guys, so then he leaves a huge tip for the guy, right?
2:10
And he comes back like two or three days later and the same guy is at the restaurant, the same waiter and the greets him at the door.
But this time, he greets him with a huge smile and he's like, oh my gosh like like how's it going, sir?
Let me see to your table bubble butt, right?
2:27
And who gives him five star outstanding?
Service.
Right.
And then at the very end of this meal, he gives him like a terrible tip right?
And the guy finds him after the meal and is like hey what the heck man?
Like I give you a horrible service the first time and you gave me a huge double, you know, double the bill tip and today, you gave me nothing.
2:45
Like how does he makes?
That makes no sense like, what's wrong with you and Melissa aspirin?
He's like well, I tipped you this time for the service I got last time and last time I gave you the tip, the shirt she gave today.
And so I think that is a really good illustration of the Concept of I like to use labeling as a great way of manipulating positive behavior.
3:07
It's also a really ninja way of getting people to do things from selling perspective.
If you want to talk like more advanced influence, this is definitely it.
So one of the ways that I use this and basically what it is is when I say labeling is you give someone a positive attribute that, you want them to live up to, by giving it as an affirmative compliment that as though they have already done it.
3:30
So, an example was when I assume being Treasurer in my little fraternity back in the day, I know.
But, you know, we still at 120,000 dollars every semester that I had to go collect.
I literally had to go get these my buddies to give the money that they said they were going to pay right?
Like there's like there were some suaveness that was kind of required and niknash was one of the guys who would never release was renowned for not paying, right?
3:53
And I had, I like, but he had a reputation for not having paid the last few treasures and And the guy before me was like he'll never pay like don't even bother with him bottle of, all right.
Any kind of calling you names all the stuff, right?
And so I was like, well how did him and calling him - names is probably not going to work since that's what everyone else has done up to this point and so as soon as I became Treasurer I called him up and I was like hey man just to let you know.
4:20
I am treasure now and I know that you owe dues and I'm not going to bother you at all about it because I know that you're a trustworthy guy in an honest and so on not going to fall for you, I know you're good for it.
The next day, he showed up at my room with the entire amount for the whole semester peeking for me.
4:40
Because he had a positive label that he did not want to break, right?
So when someone says wow, you're so great at this, right?
You want to not make that true.
And so then you act in accordance with the Positive label it.
Someone gave you right now, here's how you can use this in business.
So I tend to have very good vendor relationships.
4:59
And what I mean by that is that like the people who help us who, you know, help us develop things, whether that's on the tech side.
Or whether that's were sourcing materials or whatever it is, right?
We have really good.
Good relationships with them.
And it's because one of the things that I do early on in the relationship because I set a precedent and so as soon as they I mean, let's say they hop on on the phone on time, right?
5:21
I will go above and beyond our first few calls saying, you know what, I really appreciate about you guys I just want to say this like you guys are so timely you're so professional and you're just buttoned up like you just everything's dialed in with you guys and I just can't tell you how many times we've gone to people and they haven't had that.
So I just wanna let you know that, I super appreciate it, just the level of dedication.
5:39
Nation the work ethic your turnaround time has been phenomenal.
If you have super responsive and I just I just want you to know that I really appreciate it.
Like it goes a long way to show how great of a company you are and how good you are what you do.
And when I set that tone, what happens is, everyone all of a sudden becomes really professional really on top of it, great turnaround times, they're on top, they're buttoned up.
6:03
They always get everything back to us before the deadline and then what happens is you get this flywheel get this virtuous cycle of Of, I keep praising them, I praise them before.
They did the activity, just like Mulla nasruddin tipped before, he got the good service and then got the good service, right?
6:19
It's the same thing and it's just interesting because like it almost works the same thing.
Same way with in value H, right?
Like if I were to sell someone something that's really expensive, I need to create a value discrepancy early on in the relationship.
So that when I sell you, a sixteen thousand dollar thing like Jim launch, it delivers 20 times the value.
6:37
So that when I say, hey, do you want the next thing?
You see of course, right?
Because the value is so high.
The discrepancy was already there to reinforce the first transaction.
So what's really interesting about labeling right?
Is that it works even if you know, it's happening to.
6:54
So even if Layla decides to say Alex, you just, you know, you just, I love how clean you are, probably wouldn't say that, I wouldn't believe it.
But like, what you have to say, can't be like crazy on the interstate you don't, I mean, but like if you were like one or two, Fades away from what you're trying to or the person is.
7:11
Why don't you show?
It's your Shades away from the activity or just did something that could be indicative of a character trait that is positive.
You can label them with it and then they will want because think about it even.
So if Leila said, you know, Alex, your people positive Edge to shoot.
7:29
Give me your so complementary, you know, I just really appreciate how much you compliment me.
I'm not going to try and prove her wrong and stop complimenting her right?
Like even if I know what she's doing I'm still going to want to fulfill that if there's just like this little child inside of all of us that wants to fulfill the things that people speak over us which is why you have to be.
7:49
So mindful of the things that people do speak over you and make sure that those things are serving, you aren't aligned with the identity that you want to have, right?
But you can use that as a good person and give people positive attributes that they can live up to that.
Improve your relationship with them and their ability to certain right from my vendor standpoint and center, right?
8:08
Like they serve us well we're going to continue to Biz with them.
It's good for both of us right now.
Here's something that I'm going to speak out against that I probably would have brought up in the last one that was in my notes that I didn't get a chance to bring up because just flow and doing my thing.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world getting but it would mean the absolute world to me.
8:34
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now, it'll take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
8:50
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
Was one of the reasons that I'm not for a and now I know that there's probably a lot of people who have had a lot of positive experience with it and that's phenomenal.
And I'm not in any way to crying that, I'm not going against that anyway.
9:09
I will not discount the, the success that the programs have for a lot of people that being said, one of the things that I do not like is that the daily affirmation that?
They begin every single meeting with is hi.
My name is so-and-so and I'm an addict or hi.
My name is 7.
So I'm an alcoholic.
9:24
I don't even like saying Like really bothers me as I'm saying it, even though I'm using as an example.
And so the insist that people speak over themselves over and over and over again that they marry themselves to this identity that they no longer 1/2, right?
And so it I think it just further perpetuates this issue this issue of addiction because we keep telling ourselves that we're addicted to this thing rather than eventually dealing with all the other things that are the main route of the thing that we're trying to shove down, right?
9:54
Because that's like, you're addicted to a substance.
It's usually because it's covering up something or allowing you to be aware in the because it can cover up all of the noise in your life, right?
Because if you have stress at work stress with your family, stress with your kids, just see the parents just with your wife, whatever it is, right?
10:10
It's easier to just drink something in the moment immediately be there because you can wash away that no one's right in the issues that when you stop doing it, life gets loud and noisy and you didn't develop the capabilities to go deal with those issues, right?
10:26
And the longer, you stay addicted and the music quotes here.
The more difficult it is because the more Or skills that you need to acquire.
Because the more of those issues are stacked up.
So it's like you're even weaker because the longer you stay addicted and the louder.
Your life has stacked up with all these issues as time goes by, which is why it's so hard for a lot of people like to get to get off.
10:46
And so, but the thing is that the end of the day you still you need to like, I mean, it's just like that's the fact is you need to, and the way you do it is by confronting each of these micro things and going successively, bigger and bigger and bigger problems so that you can gain momentum from them.
So you can Re-access the attention in the will power to be able to break through those one at a time.
11:05
And in my opinion, starting every day by saying, hey, I am.
Alex is not a good way to do it because then you couple yourself with that identity change yourself, sir.
And so, I would love it if they started by saying I'm a champion, you know, me or whatever like whatever you want to speak of yourself.
11:20
Like and I will, and I will overcome and I will be able to handle.
I'm just, you know what I mean?
Like, that would be nothing.
I'm DEA expert, so I'm sure that I'll catch some Flack for saying this, but this is just My opinion.
In terms of the things that have helped me break through some of the issues that I've had.
Now, the last point that I wanted to talk on with something that someone commented on, I think it was dathan was talking about a TD right now.
11:43
It's super common for entrepreneurs to be diagnosed, right?
With ADD Haven - attention deficit disorder.
Writes a disorder already giving you something that's bad.
And what's interesting is that your perception of what, a DD means to you, right?
12:00
Will dictate whether it's a positive thing in your life are negative.
And so the example that I wanted to give us that my mother is diagnosed, you know, with ADD and it was something that was super traumatic for her like it was extremely traumatic emotional for her.
12:18
It's probably 15 20 years ago.
I think she was diagnosed, right?
And obviously, we've learned a lot since then while, right?
But in the, in that time, it was crippling for her for her identity, because she had this disorder, And and she gave all of her power over to it 100%.
12:37
And it's one of the, it's one of the lasting Stripes that we have in our relationship is that I'm like, you continue to give power to this thing that you've named right, all right?
And maybe D as hell, right?
And so are a lot of you guys because you're entrepreneurs, right?
12:53
And even just using the term, it's like, it's not even, it's not even have a negative connotation, sometimes the Power Sphere as entrepreneurs as it does.
In the normal world, because for us like EDD also, if you didn't know, this has the flip side.
If you read up on it periods of hyper, elevated attention for extended periods of time, like, most people can only focus for 45 minute periods.
13:14
Only have to take a break, right?
Whereas people who have this disorder cannot concentrate on, like, without relenting for 10 12, 15 straight hours at a time.
And sometimes weeks at a time, meaning you don't need as much sleep for some extended periods of time.
13:30
Because you're so focused on something that has stimulated your attention right.
And so to me that doesn't sound like a disorder at all.
It sounds like a superpower and so I never saw as a disorder, right?
13:46
I saw this is human-powered, I saw it not as crippling but something that is enabling something that gave me an edge on my competition on anyone who also else who wanted to compete in our world, right?
But my mother on the flip side so what is a depilatory debilitating crippling?
Lling disease and her life has never been the same sense and this is something that she and I will talk endlessly about and then she had to encrypt.
14:09
It has crippled her and I will say this, you know, she listens to the podcast, has crippled her When it really doesn't need you have, because it is purely how you choose to identify that label for yourself.
I mean, in furthermore, if you didn't want to even call it attention deficit disorder, right?
14:26
And just called a personality trait, like, I am someone who tends to be more creative and so, I can jump from thought to thought a little bit more quickly, which allows me to connect dots, a little bit more out of the box than most people can, which allows us to innovate at a faster rate, right?
And then when we catch onto an intubation or two dots that connect together, Then we go all in and we take 1015 out, you know, straight hours, just crushing it and then maybe that means a few weeks at a time where like I just can't think of anything.
14:51
But this one thing that I want to get done right, I'm sure some of you guys have experienced hyper elevated attention, right?
And it's an entrepreneurial trait, it's a good them, right?
At least as I see it.
But all because of the connotation that she put on the label that she was given, because she did not control her space.
15:09
The way we talked about in the last one, she didn't control her.
Her surroundings in the labels that were put on her.
She became a victim to it.
And so, I guess to wrap up today in a little bow, ingredient owns part 2.
How to manipulate your environment to sue.
15:25
You one beware of labeling when it's being used against you when it's being used.
In ways to not serve you to use labeling in a way that does not manipulate people but helps them right.
Helps them help you so you can teach them how to treat you by giving them a positive label.
15:42
That's in Alignment with how you want to be treated, right?
And you'll have really, really good relationship.
Benders better release kids better, they should be spouse because you continue to applaud them to success.
You continue to compliment them all the way until the new behavior is changed as long as it's in alignment with what they want and what you guys want etcetera.
16:01
Right.
And the last one is just if any of you guys do have ADD think about what that means to you and I wouldn't even I'll just call it entrepreneur.
Personality type, not EDD, but think about if there's ever been a time where it has had a negative connotation for you.
16:20
And then think about the times that it has given you a superpower that has enabled you to do things that no one else can do.
And then I would I would ask you or beseech you to consider thinking about as a superpower, instead of something that's crippling.
And then maybe just maybe the way that you see yourself and how much you can do and what gifts you've been given the change.
16:42
So anyways, You guys are awesome.
Thank you for giving me a little bit of attention, but miss lots of love and what you should drink.0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it.
So I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast today.
I wanted to say, Some things that will probably bug a few of you, but it still from a conversation that I had on Friday, on one of our Legacy calls with a gym, owner who, you know, is taking our advice or trying to figure out how to take our advice, where we say you should transition your large group classes to three sessions a week, and that's purely math.
0:51
I have no beef with training more.
It's just that simply like given the amount of space and how many people you can train per session.
The math does not work out, you'll actually reach a point of full capacity before your gym is profitable to the extent that most of us sign up for.
1:09
So you can probably make to three thousand dollars a month of profit where your gym is at full capacity at its main sessions, but you're still not making any money.
And that's because you've basically sacrificed the capacity, the facility, so that you could train people every single day because that's the belief that we had as gym owners are Fitness people, right?
1:28
And so, I I came and I just want to like kind of tell you the story of how I came to this because when I started my first location, I wanted every single person to lift weights and Count Their macros, right?
Because that's how I treated, right?
And so I wanted to preach the gospel, right?
1:45
Of Truth.
The issue that I that I ran into is that Everyone who I was training was not me and everything like the the, the, the further along in this path, I go the more reserved and more General.
2:01
I am when it comes to Fitness stuff because I'm going to try and tie like a few different.
Like big things into this one video about training.
So one of the things is that people are actually.
If you really look at this on a longer scale, like what's the goal here?
It's light is lifetime commitment.
2:17
For those people, like lifestyle change and I don't know if you've noticed this but Powerlifters tend to act like powerlifters crossfitters, tend to act like crossfitters yoga.
People tend to act like yoga people Runners act like Runners and if you've noticed but like, like they're completely different personality types and you could make one jump, which is that, could be associative of the environment, like, they're in that poultry and then they start to adopt those things.
2:44
But the other is that some people's brain, chemistry is actually more wire towards a certain type of activity.
Have you noticed that people who are Runners and measure all their volume, like tend to be more particular.
They tend to have more planning.
They tend to know how much money they're going to at each point in this, like Olympic lifters are totally different than bodybuilders are right there, like it's a totally different beast in terms of personality types and so certain personality types are actually attracted different types of exercise and if our goal, our self-proclaimed will so we're actually trying to make people healthier then it doesn't mean giving them what we want.
3:20
Now we And to look the way we do because our personalities were attracted to a certain type of exercise.
Like we'd love to say that like I mean I would love to say I'm super disciplined and that's the reason that I got into training, not really like we all train because we liked it, right?
3:35
And then we kept doing people like, ah, you're so just when I wish I had your discipline, the road is like, we just liked it, that's it.
I mean like maybe some of you guys did, but like most of us just liked it, right?
So the first point is that what you are prescribing for yourself, in no way is related to what Is good for everyone, right?
3:52
That may seem obvious but the brain.
Chemistry thing is something that's been coming out more recently.
I think it's really fascinating because you could actually test People based on personality type and then match them to the exercise thing that they're wanting most attracted to and most likely to stick with based on who they are.
4:08
Which I think is like I think that's I trip out and I think it's super cool from the Fitness side.
Now, the reason I'm bringing this up also is that I have these conversations because lot of drummers don't want to switch to going from.
The the all day, like we train back on Mondays and we train push on Tuesdays and you train legs on Wednesdays when we train, you know, Matt, come on Thursdays, whatever, right.
4:30
The reality is that most of your clients aren't even going to hit all the workouts anyways.
And so it's a why I need to give them a balanced routine.
Simple.
Most of them aren't showing it, like Susie shows up on Tuesdays every because that's the week, the day that it's convenient for her and then once of having issued Just Hits back every single day like every single week and doesn't hit any other muscle groups and So that was one of my major life transitions where I went from like a push-pull leg split to a full body split every day.
4:58
Because then from a business standpoint, everyone could come at different days and if they had Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week and the next week they hit Monday and Friday and Saturday, it's okay because they're still getting a full body workout.
Now the conversation I had with the gym owner was Claire was like you know, what can people still get a good can people still get good results, training full body which I thought was goose I'm only laughing because like, I think I trained the first, like, you like eight years of my career, where I sit multiple State records training full body and so the answer is yes.
5:33
I mean and I'm only like some guys are Fitness practitioners and I get that and I'm not trying to preach down into this, not my intention at all.
I'm just saying that.
Like you're not doing your clients a disservice by switching from a body part.
Split to a full-body split, it's matching the training that you have the realities of their circumstances and their goals.
5:50
Now here's Is one that might get you really tripped up.
So I I've been training for 15 years and I would say like, training training.
Like I had programming, I started like messing around with weeks before that, but I've been training hard for 15 years.
Now, I have been, I've had back injuries.
6:06
I've had knee injuries.
I've had hip injuries shoulder trap bicep, I mean, like everything that you can name, right?
And I went to Bill Hartmann, who's in his eye fast?
He owns.
I fast in Indianapolis, and he's like, Dr. Fly in just to be with this guy because he's truly a savant when it comes to biomechanics, right?
6:27
And so I flew in there and I was like listening fix me dr.
Kashi told me that you were the best and that you would be able to like, basically get me.
So I could not not feel like I got kicked in the balls and my hip every time I want to pull Sumo, right?
And so he was like, before we get to that.
6:44
Let's let's look at your, let's look at your mobile.
And so what he had to do is I was sitting on this bench, right?
And he's like, I want you To put your hands like this and then turn, right?
See a little, I can turn now that's normal for anyone who's really strong.
6:59
So if you've been weight training or Bob or training, for any extended period of time, you put on an appreciable amount of muscle mass, what happens is the stronger, you get the less mobile you become because disturbing you, you are right.
It's specific adaptation to imply demands said, principle, right?
And so we want to Output power right from the ground, that's when you're squatting your dead lifting, or doing whatever, right?
7:20
And so your body.
Is more rigid so that you can transmit, power more efficient, right?
So you get stronger, you can lift more weight.
But here's the thing, I'm sacrificing My Lifestyle because of the training that I have done for so long and so my body looks fit.
7:38
But most of the people who come in, if I were to say, hey, like the body that you want is going to have massive sacrifices in terms of what you're able to do from a Mobility standpoint later down the road when you actually achieve what you want.
I don't know.
And I'm being really honest with you, I don't know if I would have signed up for this if I had known what I know now.
7:58
So real quick guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
8:13
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was View.
If it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Bill basically took a picture.
8:30
He's like this is what a normal man.
I wish I had my whiteboard but basically you drew this nice Circle and was like, this is what most people look like.
If you look from the top down spine, is in the, you know, in the back nice and Round, right?
Because they can breathe in the but whatever.
He's like, this is what yours looks like and it was like a rectangle like this who's wider and basically compressed like this.
8:51
Okay.
And so what happens is my skeleton, right?
Has literally compressed in It's so that I can handle more weight, right?
I'm more sturdy.
It's a wider base.
Right in my hips are so rotated down.
Right?
9:06
Like I can touch my toes like this, I mean like I have a lot of mobility and why?
Because my hips are totally forward, right?
Because power transmits more easily to the ground, but what does that mean?
It means when I get out of my car, I still have to lift my leg up, sometimes because the hip pain is, so right now means I have a really good deadlift and I could squat a lot.
9:27
But like is it really good for like life?
Maybe the trade-off of where performance and Aesthetics and health benefits were there stopped probably a year and a half two years into my training and then everything after that is was really no longer beneficial for my health, right?
9:49
It was really just an obsessive pursuit of growth and progress despite the physical outcomes that it was like the physical opposite side of my body. so, I'm going back to the headline of this, which is like why I stopped reading my clients like myself because They're not us, they don't have the goals that we have and the reality is that most of them have bowls of just looking better and feeling better.
10:15
And those are all those that can be accomplished three days a week training, 45 minutes a day and those are things where you can have some metabolic conditioning.
In addition to the resistance training that you have.
Now, most people are going to achieve 80% of their muscular gains in their first, nine months, 12 months of training, real talk, right?
10:33
And that's like, that's the talk of like, we're genetics really plays like a factor.
Like I haven't gained an appreciable amount of muscle mass, but the last 15 years or last, probably, 10 years, I haven't really gained any muscle like any real amount of muscles, right.
10:49
All I have done is gotten stronger and stronger and made my body more structurally efficient, right?
My tendons harder.
Right?
So that I can transmit power.
So I can lift an arbitrary amount of weight that means nothing.
Right.
I'm just being super real with you.
11:04
And so, if I look back on like my own training for, like, I don't know if I would have made the decisions that I have now.
And so, I'm just saying this to you so that if you have guilt around like, well, I don't train that way.
It's like, okay, but they're not.
You and probably, if informed about all of the trade-offs that are going to happen as a result of some of the decisions that you're putting them through right now, they might not make the same decision, right?
11:23
And so to bring us full circle, if you want to have a profitable gym which means that you actually want to train these people for life, Needs to be around for life, which means you need to make it profitable actually, which means that most of their goals can be achieved at three days week so you can have a margin and hit and have the amount of capacity to fulfill those people and actually stay in business long enough to see them through the goals that you originally promised in sign them up for.
11:49
So that is my long-winded argument for why it's okay to have some cardio during the workouts because the Endorphin levels of they're going to be much higher and it's more addicting.
Then we train and Some people to be more responsive to that.
And if you hit both that you're going to cover both aspects of Personality, which means you're going to have training, that is more likely to attract everyone and actually keep them in because there's going to be some aspects of the Lycans I'm S6.
12:14
They don't, but that's okay.
They need both the, you need to make sure that you have both within your sessions so that they get more likely to be addicted and that you actually help them in the long term, which is what you promised, right?
So, it's okay to Train full body, it's okay to have people trained three days a week, they're going to get great results.
12:33
As long as they stick with it.
And so, all of the, all of the things that we do should be geared around, how can we get them to stick with it?
How can we make exercise?
That is, that is exciting.
That is addicting.
That is actually not going to have like is not going to be likely to expose them to more risk than is necessary.
12:50
What is a house, mom?
Really get from Death from increasing or death?
Are there other ways that we can train her glutes?
So that she has has more developments that aren't dead lifts?
If you don't know the answer to that.
You should the answer is yes.
There's a lot of ways we can train.
13:06
Someone's glutes.
That isn't a deadlift that doesn't expose some the amount of risk, right?
And just because we power lifted and we think it's cool to add weight to that it's probably exposed to her too much risk, giving the reward for her, right?
It doesn't hurt her.
Life was not going to really get any better.
13:22
She adds 50 80 pounds to a deadlift, she develops her glutes.
There's lots of ways to do that aren't nearly as risky and they're not as risky for your business.
So Anyways, that was a bit of a rant, but I hope you found that valuable in terms of like being, okay, with, with not training people, the way that you train because they are not us, they're not.
13:46
And so we shouldn't treat them that way and they're not also running a business.
And if we had okay, every single session is two hours, right?
Or an hour and a half and you do Mobility, right?
Which a lot of us do is that going to be a profitable business do?
So you need to optimize it?
14:02
Based on like the maximum good for the maximum amount of people, so they can have a business.
You want to train people individually, want to do things like that, then by all means do it.
But like it's it doesn't, it's not going to be a scalable model, which is hopefully why y'all are here is like how can I make this thing that I love into something that can actually pay.
14:20
So anyways, guys, have an amazing tactical Tuesday.
Lots of love.
Keeping awesome and I hope you found out about that.

Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What is going on, everybody?
I've got a short little tidbit for you today and it comes from, I've been diving super deep into entrepreneur books and kind of like, history of Entrepreneurship.
0:42
Like some of the huge startups kind of studying those oftener CEOs, you know, now billionaires and I it brought into Clarity, one of the things that I think is difficult to Define as an entrepreneur, which is like, what is your continued roll.
Right.
And so I called this the real job of The entrepreneur and the secret to finding talent.
1:01
And so you know for us as entrepreneurs a lot of times the secret to growth is how quickly can we learn and acquire a new skill before giving it to someone else.
Right before we teach someone else how to do that thing so that we can move on to the next scale that we need to have.
And there's there does reach a point where and this is just I'm telling you from our experience and this is not necessarily for James but this hopefully used to find it.
1:25
I will is that there gets to a point where you want to bring people in, who are better than you at the thing that you need.
Right?
So people who actually have experience doing this thing and they're better than you at it and when you can find that that's like the best case scenario.
1:42
And so when that happens, what is the role of the entrepreneur at that point, right?
Because this is something that I've Been trying to Define for myself, which is like, okay, if we bring in, you know, Josh Kyle's for marketing, he is as good and he will probably become you know, much better than I am.
Right?
And so like, what is, what is my role shift into?
2:00
And so this is really, I think this is really interesting.
And after reading, all these, like, biographies this weekend listing, all these podcasts are billionaires.
Like this is just, I've been deep diving into this.
I think that the simplest way to say it is that for us the entrepreneur, our role Is to maintain higher standards than anyone else.
2:20
So, our role our job is to maintain the highest standards out of anyone else.
We were the ones who need to hold our.
And what that looks like is a lot of times breaking beliefs around what is possible for your team.
And so, an example would be.
2:36
So I was talking to an entrepreneur.
So, we went to dinner with attributes that I met on a plane on the way home from Laguna, and he was sitting right next to me, and he was like, I want a tech company and Bob line is he he's an awesome.
Here.
So we had dinner last night and an example of that was, he had a, he's a whole bunch of Engineers that build out, you know, his sophomore and whatnot, and they had four different databases and they were like it's impossible for us to merge, right?
3:00
Like we can't merge them and he was like, okay.
We need to do it in the next 60 days and all of his engineers said, no.
And so not all of them, but most of them said no.
And so he actually on the spot, let go of the two or three people who are the biggest naysayers and then we looked at the rest of his team.
3:19
He's like, here's your two months Severance and look to the rest of his team was like.
Okay.
So if we're trying to build, we're trying to consolidate these databases in 60 days, how do we do it?
And so they again said it, you know, it's really not possible.
And so one by one, he was trying to break down.
What is what does that do?
3:35
He's not a tech guy, he's like, okay, what does that wire do?
What is this wire do?
What is this wire do, right, and he was able to, after having them systematically explained each of these things to him.
He's like, why can't we do this?
And they're like, I guess we could.
But that'll probably take 16 hours.
He's like, okay, well, you said it was impossible.
3:50
So 16 hours are.
Let's do that.
Okay?
And then, what's the next thing, right there?
Like well, that'll take, you know, two guys three days.
It's like, okay, cool.
Well, then was so we got 16 hours, then we got three days.
All right, we're getting there, right?
And so, he was able to actually get the entire Entire thing done, the database is all for them, Consolidated into one within 30 days and it was because he believed that it was possible, right?
4:14
And one of my favorite sayings from Elon Musk is and someone tells him that it's not possible to do something that's not possible to build a car that's electric.
That's faster than gas, it's not possible to make it achievable on certain, you know, level he says, bring it down to physics.
That's what he's has to be to break it down to physics and it means like physically, why is it impossible?
4:33
And usually, when someone breaks down to physics, it's not impossible, right?
It's just a limiting belief and that gives that goes to show you the level of what a super, super super high entrepreneur.
Like Elon Musk believes is that, he just doesn't really believe anything's possible, Right?
Like unless it's physics, like unless the laws of physics say that we can't do it, there's no reason we can't.
4:51
And so as entrepreneurs a lot of, like, what we have to do is we have to, we really have to The first to believe in the impossible, right?
We have to think like, okay, how could I give every single customer personalized video every single morning, right?
Like like start asking these huge questions and thinking like why is it impossible?
5:11
Like let's go from there, right?
And so we have to maintain these standards that, no one else will maintain right and so as we grow as a company, one of the interesting things is that and this is I'm partially making this for my team because they don't have to watch all of our stuff, but they end.
5:27
Watching a lot of my stuff is that in order to move up, right in a company.
And this is why the second half is in the secret to finding Talent, right?
Real eagles, is that the person whose highest up in a department or division should be the person who has the highest standards, right?
5:44
If I have somebody who's directing customer service and really, this is nothing to do with you.
I love you.
You're awesome.
But I'm saying is an example if you had somebody who's directing customer service and they have standards that are let's say out of 100, their standards are Right.
And then there's somebody else who's below them who has standards that are 94.
6:04
What customer service should be like?
How good should it be?
How fast should we respond?
How cordial should be how knowledgeable should each of our Representatives be right?
And so if that person is a 90 in the person above them, is the 80 that person's a 90, should be the one running the department because they are going to have a higher standard of Excellence, then the person who's leading and so Oh, me as the entrepreneur should identify that and say, like, okay, you should be the one holding the the mantle, right?
6:33
You should be the one holding the torch.
And so, our job as the entrepreneur is to identify the people who have the highest standards, who are the ones who like are sticklers for everything being perfect, right?
For being amazing.
Like, why wasn't like great that was good?
6:49
How can we get better?
Right is having the people who ask those types of questions because those are the ones who are going to do the job that we can't do at a certain point.
Because it is Big because the organization grows beyond me, being able to handle every customer service.
While me being able to handle every sales, call me being able to, you know, manage the product development, right?
7:06
Like all of those pieces.
I need someone who's going to have as high of a standard of Excellence as I do, right?
Because obviously it's our company as entrepreneurs.
It's our companies, our business, and we're going to care more about it than someone else does.
But there is a point where you find people who care about that thing.
7:26
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, As much as you do.
7:48
And so our job is to maintain these really, really high expectations, right?
That's our job and then to break the beliefs of those who are underneath us in the organization were following us to make them believe that it's possible, right?
And ask the questions that are big and say like why not, why can't we write?
8:07
Like why is that not possible?
Why can't we?
Here's another another really good one that I could store the illustrates us so I think It's all this but I think it was something that broke my beliefs so thoroughly that, I hope it breaks yours.
8:23
So friend of mine, many people in humans lady boss.
They had they had a huge campaign and it totally crushed and it mean like it took off, right?
And so they within So within like a matter of a month and a half they quadrupled their business and they had a big business already.
8:47
They had any figure business already and they quadrupled it.
Right?
And so what had to happen is that he had to hire 30 support reps in 14 days and so every single time like every person up to that point when they were, like if they were trying to build that department before this explosion had happened, they probably said what's reasonable like, what's reasonable for us to do.
9:08
It would be reasonable for us to hire an onboard one or two people a week.
You know, that might be a reason that still a fast rate, right?
That's fast.
But that's reasonable to believe.
And so it doesn't take a super person to believe that that's possible, Right?
But he chose to believe.
9:24
Then we because of necessity that we have to do this in 14 days.
Otherwise, this huge thing is going to blow up in our faces.
And so, he sat down and met with group interviews for 14 days, in hired, Thirty customer service reps, to maintain to maintain this huge explosion that happened and keep it where it needed to be, right.
9:42
And so a lot of questions are a lot of standards that we have to maintain as entrepreneurs are around speed how quickly can something happen, right?
Some people believe that it can't happen that fast.
Why break it down to physics?
Why can't we right?
Right, Sheryl Sandberg, who's the CEO of Facebook oversaw, the company going from?
10:01
I think she had four employees underneath of her to 4000 within 24 months, It's possible.
Right?
It's possible.
And so we as the entrepreneurs have to believe that and then break the beliefs of those underneath of us and that's a speed that's that's all other.
10:19
I just talked about is is beliefs around speed and how high of a standard.
Well, I'm maintained as how quickly can we achieve the goals that were setting out to achieve, right?
Another one would be around like product Excellence, like how good can it be right?
And so like an example of that would be, you know, if we're coming out with Like the concept of us doing beta tests for anything is completely like, nah, I don't know anyone in our space at least who even does that right now.
10:48
Really not, not in a measurable way, otherwise they're just using his in a marketing Ploy, but like really legitimate like okay, let's take the best people.
Let's consolidate the information, let's modularize it.
Let's provide it to people who aren't doing well, and let's see how they do it in a measurable way.
11:05
Using the same common methods that we were planning on using.
And If they don't achieve the outcome then he failed and we need to do it again.
We need to do it again and how many times do you do it?
I don't care.
Until it's right right.
And so it's like having those beliefs at the end of the day is the real job of us as entrepreneurs is like how high the standard, can I maintain for my company and our products and our delivery and how tall amazing contrast more service be and for every person who tells you it's not possible, ask them break it down to physics.
11:34
Why not?
Why is it?
Why is it impossible, right?
It's not possible.
Given the belief set that you have right now given your experience that you have behind you, but that experience that you have behind, you hasn't no way any impact on what is possible, right?
11:51
And making people believe that.
And so if you want to move up and Jim laughs, here's my little plug for our employees.
You want to move up in gym, lunch, like you have to believe in the impossible, more so than anyone else.
Does you have to have higher standard of Excellence at how quickly?
Things can get done and how well they can get done because most of the time.
12:09
It's just our beliefs that stop us, right?
And so a lot of us have these goals and we say I want to hit this by by next year, right?
And then the question is, why can't we do it in two months?
Like break it down and physics?
12:25
Why can't we do it in two months?
What would need to happen for us to achieve that in eight weeks, why not?
Right.
And so we ask those types of questions and a lot of times it is asking the right questions.
You get the the right answers because it's not the conventional answers, because conventional answers are usually conventional wisdom in.
12:41
Conventional wisdom, just wrong, right?
Because that's why most people have conventional results, which is why everyone has this Fierce competition in the middle.
Because no one knows because no one's falling conventional wisdom, right?
So, you need to be unconventional because you have to have the strongest beliefs out of everyone else in your company about what is possible, Right?
13:00
And it's everything, right?
And that's and that's our job is to continue break our own beliefs and then broke broke those of our team in those underneath of us.
And then finding the people finding the true players who believe what we believe, and then they can, and then translate that conviction over to their teams, and bring those beliefs on your behalf.
13:20
And that's really how you're able to scale, a company at a fast rate and then maintain a level of Excellence because of the hardest things as you scale is, The quality of service quality of product quality of all these things.
And so anyways I hope this hope that you found this valuable for you in terms of growing your James and whatnot and finding and identifying Talent.
13:42
As you need someone who believes more in customer service than you do who's stronger in that than you are, who believes that like how high of quality should it be.
And if they believe that it should be higher than you believe, then you found the right person, right?
13:57
And he was constantly questioning, how can we make this better?
Why can't we write?
If you can throw a like and, you know, maybe even drop a comment for feeling super generous, I appreciate it.
But anyways, that is what I think as we continue to evolve, it's no longer about skills for me that I need to acquire.
14:18
It's more about, how can I continue to push the limits of what's possible?
And then make those who are underneath of us believe that?
When I say underneath those, I mean org chart, Not underneath it any other way.
But really those who Our side by side with us, walking, this journey along with us to the promised land, like how can I get them to believe what I believe?
14:37
So anyways, guys, have an amazing day have an amazing Monday and for those of you who are Jim Lord's, the Super Bowl is on Friday, be there.
All right, back.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Sometimes you have to go slow to go fast, one of the real issues that plagues entrepreneurs Especially if you're starting out and I dealt with this, and I still continue to do with this is that there are so many things that can move your business forward.
0:39
It's difficult to pick.
And so a lot of times we get lost in in the the busy work of going from thing to thing, to thing, to thing, to thing.
And so, one of the I think most telling stories that influence my perspective on this has been so Tim Ferriss had a somebody asked him at one of his meds.
1:00
You know what, you know, what is your normal day look like and he said, you know, I think he'd be incredibly bored to see what my normal day looks like.
Because most of the time it's like, I wake up.
I meditate I go for, you know, I work out, I drink my kombucha or whatever and he's like, I usually spend three to four hours, just thinking about my business and about what I'm going to do.
1:21
And what I'm trying to find is not all the things that I have to do.
But what's the one thing?
The big, Domino that if I push, That one Domino down.
It makes all of the other things that I have left to do, either either accomplishes them or makes them irrelevant.
1:38
And I think that's incredibly telling because as we, you know, grow as entrepreneurs and as the, you know, the business that we have a reason was grow.
I know, Sarah Goosen, asked this a while ago, she's like, you know, my gym is really running on its own for the most part.
Like I'm trying to figure out what I need to do.
And what happens is that as you grow, what you need to do, goes down what you need to think about what you're going to do.
2:00
I was up and so there's only one of you, right?
There's only one of you and that means that there's a really limited amount of things that only one person can do right.
Like, we have teams now and I can, I can say this now from experience, because we have the size team that we do that, like so many more things can get done at a much larger scale at a much faster rate because we have a team, right?
2:20
But if you are the sole entrepreneur, right?
And you were, then you're really the one who drives most of these, you know, projects for Words.
The difficulty is, when you write down, are you Come back from a mastermind, right?
And you're like, oh, I have, I have two pages worth of ideas, right?
The reality is that most of them won't get done, but what I will push to you or what, I'll pause it is that most of them should not get done.
2:43
And so, my point here is, I had a mentor early on.
He said sometimes because I used to I used to just always want to work work.
Work work, work, work, work work work, right?
And so he'd be like, I don't know, he's like slow down.
It's like sometimes you have to go slow to go fast and I always like, it always trip me up on Stuff like that.
3:00
I'd be like, all right Sage goo, you know, Guru like what does that even mean?
It's like sometimes you gotta go, slow to go fast and it's the same.
Same type of saying, is like, you should spend three hours or six hours, sharpen your blade and only an hour cut it, right?
And so if you were to look at my day and like what my weeks look like, I would say I do an astonishingly small amount of work but what we focus on or what?
3:25
I focus the work on.
I try to make sure that it is the biggest Football that I can personally move forward, right.
So like I have tons of requests of me all the time from clients or employees from other managers directors Etc that come and ask for my time, right?
3:42
And so they're like hey can you build this thing out?
Can you make these videos for this?
Can you make us a training on this?
Can you like there's all of these different things and 100% of them would make our business better, right?
But as the entrepreneur, you have the one resource you have, which is time and attention, right?
I'm going to just put those together.
3:58
And so, I have all of these requests that are coming in rather than being reactive and thinking, like I have to start this one.
And then, another one comes here, I have to start this one.
Like you're constantly bouncing from the same thing and then either you're a more effective entrepreneur getting all of these little things done, right?
4:16
And they're all moving the ball forward a little bit, a little bit at a time, or you just step back and look at everything and then think which one of these things will make me the most money.
And give me the highest return on my time and attention.
4:34
And a lot of times when you look at that whole list, you can easily cross out three-quarters of it right off the bat.
And that's like, one of the keys to keeping your anxiety lows in our spinner because like the higher up, you get the more the more noisy life becomes right.
4:50
And so dealing with stress and dealing with anxiety and dealing with pools, on your attention, is like a real skill that you need to develop.
And a lot of times it comes from being able to say no.
And it's not that you're saying No, this idea is not good.
And I want to be clear about that because Almost 100% of the ideas that I get that potentially need me, you know, to implement our advise or whatever on would make our business more money.
5:13
But the question is, are you doing things that would make your business?
This much more money instead of doing the one thing?
I'll make your business, this much for me.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
5:31
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype four hundred dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under the real leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
5:52
Because last time I sold out for like 8, Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And losing sight of that because usually the one that's this big a lot of times requires more effort, right?
And so we get busy doing these little fix, it's rather than focusing on the big thing, right?
6:11
And so, when I A lot of times when I have like not fun or who come in and like, you know, I'll do like sort of a, I do want to say coaching call because it's not part of our business, but like I had people who right now are doing between 5 to 15 million that I've a regular communication cycle with and I talk to them about their business.
6:28
Most, the time, the Astonishing, simple.
I'm just saying like cool where you at right now.
What's the biggest me like?
What's the major bottleneck that you have?
Is it like in I just go through it.
I'm like, is it Legion?
Is it getting people to show?
Is it getting people to give you money?
6:44
Is it like is your churn, the issue?
So fulfillment related, like, what's the problem, right?
And then once we identify with the problem is based off of numbers, not off emotions, but based off of numbers, then we say cool, ignore everything else that could Probably make you more money.
7:01
Just do that, right?
And so it sometimes, it takes someone from the outside to give you the clarity or the permission to say no to everything else that is being asked of you.
But around is like the really effective entrepreneurs.
Have the same amount of time that every other entrepreneur has.
And the only thing that they're doing is they're doing activities that are more productive that will move the ball forward much further than their counterparts and the people who are competing against them.
7:25
And so it's like everyone has the same hours.
And so you have to ask yourself like and I Just like myself all the time.
So I'm not saying like I'm separately like we're together in this.
Like okay, Richard Branson has the same 24 hours that I go.
He's making way more than right.
7:41
So what is he doing with his time that I'm not doing with my time?
And a lot of what a lot of that comes from?
Okay.
What are all the things that I don't need to do?
And what's the one thing that I do?
That will actually move be way further forward than everyone else and if you look at that, your anxiety goes down and then you Claire. 31 with the actual objective of what your day is supposed to be becomes really clear.
8:03
And then when things get clear things get easy, right?
A lot of times when you have these struggles, I'm like, what am I supposed to do?
Like, I feel so busy, I'm so pulled.
Like, whenever you have that anxiety of, like, I feel like I have so many things to do, slow down.
Look like, look around, look at your business.
Look at, look at the big picture.
8:21
What am I struggling with, is it lead generation?
Is it getting people to show is to getting people to give me money?
Is it getting them?
An amazing?
Variances to get him to stay, that's it.
Like, which one is it?
And if like, and when you look at those, then you can look at all the projects you have on your plate and forget about all of the ones that aren't related to the one that you have an issue with.
8:43
And when you do, just do that one, that's it.
And you will make way more money because you're only focusing on the things that matter, right.
And that's how your more effective and that's how everyone's like, how do they get so much stuff that we don't actually get more done than anyone else?
8:59
Else does, right?
We just get the things that matter done more than everyone else does.
I mean, we sit on top of a community thousand-plus Jim's who have ideas for us to do every day.
You don't.
I mean I have a million ideas.
They get shot to me every single day from our own community and our employees.
9:15
It's a sifting through that to say like then how is it that we make Jim's the most money more than everyone else?
Is because we have an ability to say no to most things, not that it's not valuable, not that it wouldn't work.
It's just that of all of the opportunities.
This is the one that's We've identified as the highest impact and that's what we're going to focus on.
9:33
So anyways if you feel spread thin or you're like I'm not sure what I need to do, slow down look around.
Look at those that pipeline of how your money comes in a generation, leave nurture sales fulfillment, and the resale retention, right?
9:49
Look at all of those different things and figure out which one is the issue, right?
And sometimes the problems don't manifest the way that would be obvious, right?
And so, Right now, I feel like I can't keep my gym will grow, right?
Sometimes everyone looks at acquisition, right?
10:05
And acquisition for a lot of people means like getting people in the door getting cash flow, which is important.
But if the issue is really that everyone keeps falling off the back end, which is why you need so many people to come in on the phone and your actual processes, requisition might be actually pretty strong.
It might be actually with keeping you in business, but the thing that's keeping you out of growth is not your acquisition system, that's not where you should be focusing, it should be focusing on the retention piece.
10:29
Right on getting on cutting down that turn.
So that all of this effort, you're putting into acquisition that you're really good at.
Now, can actually grow the business and so taking a second to look at it and then really say like, which one of these things is that is, that is the bottleneck to my growth, which is the hole in my bucket, and then focus on that.
10:49
Put the other ones on, on your 80/20.
Like, okay, if we go red line on this on acquisition, we might be able to hit, you know, 80 sales this month.
But if we go like blue line on Acquisition.
Maybe we hit 40.
Okay.
Are we are?
We cash flow?
Good enough to be able to just do 40 so that I can focus.
11:06
All of my attention on the real whole that stopping growth and then if you take a month and you fix that hole, then you can go red line on your acquisition again but then at everyone's sticks, right?
And if you look at your business piecewise like that and then you focus your time and attention in the effective ways, then all of a sudden, your life gets less noise at your anxiety, goes down and then all of a sudden, all of these things that Would benefit your business become irrelevant because the things that actually are going to grow your business, become really simple, and the only things you need to do.
11:37
So, anyways, guys, as my little tidbit for today, sometimes you got to go slow to go fast and just think about all the things that, like, I'm giving you permission to say no, to all of these things that are great ideas.
They're awesome ideas and they will all grow your business but not as much as the one that you're big hole and just focus on that.
11:57
Alright guys, have an amazing day and I'll catch you guys.
On the flip side.
Alright.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show.
0:18
Hey, what's going on guys?
Hope you're having an amazing evening.
I am Well you've caught me in a reflective State.
I don't normally make action, don't think I've made it.
Is it content at night in?
0:34
Really I think since I've started this thing.
It's been, it's an interesting evening for me.
And so I want to First apologize because this may be one of the only pieces concert that I make, that is entirely for me.
But I wanted to document something and I wanted to document it before it faded from my memory.
0:58
And so I actually just wanted to tell you how this all started for me.
And I'm not talking about you much, I'm just talking about my first gym and so there's there's no lesson here at all and it's just it's just crazy to me.
1:16
So Layla has actually already asleep and we have a huge thing that's going out tomorrow that we're releasing and, you know, we've spent so long on it and I think there are moments where you just That, you know, the world kind of stand still for you and you just, I'm not sure if it's just like the emptiness of your mind or that you're more, acutely, aware in the moment.
1:39
But like, moments were memories, get like etched into your brain, like their sins, they become moments, that you remember.
And I feel like tonight is one of them, and I feel like it's always before, the thing that happens, is really where you think about it.
1:55
The most, we become the most reflective.
And so earlier today, are Team asked for the new hires, we tried something new, which was they just wanted to know more about how it all started, you know how the who Leyland I really works.
You know, we're approaching 70 employees now and they're like, who are you?
2:12
You know and it was weird.
Is Layla had to keep asking these kind of more pressing questions and say, you know, Tom about this and talk about this and like I think you you bury these things, you know what I mean?
Not purposely the like because you're you have to be so focused on the business and doing all this The things that you try not to think about that stuff.
2:32
But I think talking about the earlier today, really brought these memories to light now that she's asleep and I'm obviously, like, wide awake because we had this big thing went out of our own.
So I'm just just pensive and it just reminded me, you know, it's crazy, you know, like it's a crazy story.
2:52
I was a Management Consultant, I got out of college.
I graduated a year early and I really hated my job and I'm really great for the Act grateful for the fact that I hated my job because I don't think I would have ever left that world that Academia had gotten me in like the degrees.
3:08
And like, I don't really good school.
That was relatively recognized had.
I not hated it.
Like if I'm just not liked it, I would have said, I would have suffered through it, but like, I hated and I and in the moment, I was so angry about the fact that I picked this job that I just hate it.
3:24
I was like, I feel like I got gypped by life but now when I look back like that hatred that I had.
It was the only thing that would have ever gotten me leave.
And so I had this job and I saved up, you know, like 50 Grand over the span of two years and I was applying to to go to business school because the only thing that I knew that I was supposed to do next.
3:46
And so I applied and the I didn't apply out.
I took the GMAT and I was filling out the applications.
In the first question from Harvard was How hard would it be a help you along short-term bows?
And I stuck, I, it's at with me for, like, two days.
4:03
I couldn't answer it because I realized it wasn't going to help me with my longing towards rumbles at all, because I wanted to start a business.
And so I knew that going to hundred thousand dollars in debt and then not making money during the, to your side at the stop making money and then pay two hundred thousand dollars and then be able to start making money.
4:19
That was only like 30 grand more than what I was make.
It just didn't the math, didn't make sense, and I hated what I was doing so much that I saw with the path of with I was going to We either going Investment Banking or being a Management Consultant, I was like I hate both of these things and so I decided I was like I'm just going to do something I like and so I left and so I emailed 40 gym owners and two of them got back to me.
4:39
One of them was saying backyard in Orange County to responded back.
He said, hey you can come on out and so I sold everything I had.
I packed my car.
My dad was livid that I was throwing away all of the schooling that he had paid for You know, I don't really want swollen.
4:59
He, that was dead.
The prodigal son.
And I just threw it all away and I left, and I basically didn't tell anyone what I left because I didn't want them to try to talk me out of it.
And so, I like all people when I was like, in Ohio, it's like halfway there.
5:16
But I packed all my food in a container.
So I wouldn't have to stop.
So I had I had, I had all my meals packed in this cooler.
That was sitting on my, on my passenger seat.
It was like the faster I took with me and Anything I couldn't fit in my sit in I left and so I showed up I got there and I mean I literally pick the spot off a map whose Inland Empire.
5:35
I'd known that was right.
I'm from Baltimore, I mean it's kind of crazy but in some ways and so I got there and he was like, yeah, you know, I Like I don't have a cheat but he was like, you can join.
6:01
Anyways, that's like, okay.
And so I joined and then during that time period, I, you know, I sat there, I just, I just was there 14 hours a day just because I wanted to learn.
And then in three months, I opened a gym in Huntington Beach and I knew no one there either.
6:21
So, what I wanted to kind of remember a remind myself of, so, hopefully it maybe at a later time when I Read this when you tell the story you're like oh I was super freaked out when I signed the lease I wasn't freaked out because I didn't know any better.
I didn't know I should have been freaked out because I because now I know going into it.
6:40
The skill set that I had, I should have been totally freaked out but I didn't know any better which is I think one of the gifts of being naive, I signed it and I was, I was really excited.
And what's interesting is I, when I signed it and I was five thousand dollars a month and I didn't even make 5,000 logical.
6:55
Like, I had no idea.
How do you mean fine?
I've never made anything like this and it was just crazy and you know people like what you gonna do and I was like well I'm not going to be you know he's my apartment anymore.
I wasn't listening apartment was renting a room for three hundred dollars a month and one of the gym members from the gyms you know that I met whatever.
7:18
And but anyways I start I told every once again, I'm going to sleep in the in the gym and they're like, oh, that's so cool.
You're like dedicated to your your goals and I, you know, I felt I felt like it.
Badass.
But, you know, the first night when I actually like had to actually sleep in the gym and there was no one there, I didn't feel like as much of a badass, I was just really lonely, you know, and so, you know, I was just looking around and I just remember that first night, I was like, where am I gonna sleep even like had a pillow or so you have anything.
7:49
I just like I told her was I going to sleep on the floor?
Because I heard that, you know what I mean?
But like I didn't know like what that even meant and like there.
Is a mat that I put there like the squishing man that everyone works out on.
And so I was like, I guess I'll sleep on that and and and I was actually under a parking garage and so you know there's the metal strips in this parking garage is new here like to and and so I heard it would go off like every 30 minutes.
8:17
There be a car that would go over it and that was like all night long.
It's just like a gunshot now.
It's like man sleeping on the floor in the gym is not cool and it really did.
Get better.
It just like, I'm just kind of got used to it, I guess, but I get so hot because the summer, when I, when I started, I would try and sleep shirtless, but I was on the turf, rose on the mat, and then I got like, rashes all over me because like, it was nasty, but and I, there was no shower there.
8:45
So I like to go to the fitness and shower but like my clothes are still dirty because there was no cleaning machine.
And so like my clothes always smelled like crap, even though if I.
So like I just constantly was in this, like, once a week shower thing.
And I'm sure it was really horrible for everyone and I guess they're just like some things, like those little details of like the cars that would bang over the top and like the turf that I had was like six years old.
9:10
So it wasn't like new Turf.
It was like sweaty Old Turf and I would have it like peeled the my face in the morning.
I didn't actually get a sleeping bag until someone recommended, I guess, even back.
So, I hadn't even thought about it.
I like, I like almost was like, yeah, this is what sleeping on the floor is like they're like, you know, you can actually like having Him like gonna Sleep Pillow but I was like embracing the concept of suffering.
9:31
Like and I remember calling my dad and just being like, this is really hard.
It's like this, like I really this is like, not fun and he was like, you know, look back on these moments.
You're, you know, you're gonna, you're gonna appreciate them all the while.
9:47
I know, he really didn't believe in it whatsoever and really wasn't proud of me for the choice that I made, which I could hear, you know, what I mean, but tried to cover that.
But unfairly Of the, and which was hard to hear, but maybe some of you guys have had that.
But anyways, I tried to, I tried to embrace that.
10:06
I tried to think to myself, like, I'm going to really enjoy this.
I'm going to embrace the suck, but I think there were some moments where I was like, this is the hardest thing I've ever done and it it was, I think it is.
It was definitely the hardest thing I've ever done.
I didn't understand that you should have employees.
10:24
Like, so sometimes I share the things that like we have now on.
I would like Alex always had it put together like I had no fucking clue what I was doing.
Like at all, like none like nothing.
I didn't understand that you should have employees.
And so like the the read, like, I didn't clean my gym because I didn't know you were supposed to.
10:43
And so what happened is, like I started having members saying like Alex like this place is filthy, you know what I mean?
And I was like, oh shoot sorry.
I like I was so tired.
And you know what I mean?
Like, because I was doing, I had no one.
Please.
And I was doing everything.
I was living there.
10:58
Like I didn't know what to do and there were like it's fine, like will clean it and so like my first clients would like come early and stay late and like clean for me and then they were like, what are you eating?
And I was like, there's a in and out.
11:13
I get a burger that I get two double-doubles and that was like I'd have that like some protein shakes and I was like, what I would eat every day and so they would like start bringing me food and it's interesting because like there's this moment where it feels nice to be pitied.
But I knew that wasn't like, who I was because like I was like, this isn't me like, I'm not the I'm I am the one who knocks.
11:37
I was like, this isn't feel right.
And it's interesting just as like a looking back.
Note that like there's a moment where everyone always wants to root for the American dream.
Right?
Everyone wants to root for the underdog.
But there's a moment where the underdog becomes the man through the man, right?
11:58
And I'm not sure where that transition happens it might be when you pass the people who are perceiving use level of success in their own mind.
So like everyone wants you to be successful just not more successful than them.
And so everyone roots for you when you're down because everyone is better than you at that point.
12:16
But one by one is you passed them in their perception of what passing is.
Is right.
All of a sudden you go from.
I like things as they were before.
Like you were, you know, you were here more as a cat because I slept here like a chakra here.
Like, of course I was here more like you can drop by in the middle day.
12:34
I was here, right?
But you know, there were there were like, I didn't know anyone.
And so like, when Friday night would happen like I would be there and then like one Saturday would happen I would still also be there because like I had nowhere else to go and like my phone wouldn't ring is like, no new, you know?
12:54
And so A most a nation quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
13:12
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
I just that was it, you know and so that's in some ways it was a blessing because I was like well this is all I've got and I think that you know, maybe if I had friends or like the potential distraction of the say, social life or whatever, maybe I will, maybe I wouldn't have like just started reading about this stuff because I had nothing else to do but just like want to end like this level of misery those it.
13:42
And so I just I guess I just wanted to make this to remember because you know, as we sit You know, tonight, we have this big releases having tomorrow and I'm just like, no, just adds.
It's just crazy.
There's no way I can say it.
Otherwise, it's just crazy.
13:58
What's happened in such a short period of time.
And I think the Grateful posts are always like a little bit right there.
Little overused.
But there's just like an overwhelming feeling of like it's not even real.
And I don't know how to convey that in words because like I feel like they Don't have the meaning that I wish I could make them have.
14:22
But it's just, I'm just so grateful for what's happened.
And there's so many things that have been so bad.
And I'm like, that's me but I'm saying, everyone has gone through those things.
But, like, in the moment, they were just so terrible for me or like my perception of them was so bad.
And, like, those things really became the cornerstones of the things that that we teach now, you know, like I sucked it sales.
14:46
I literally was offered a sales job at a finance guy, like, at an investment, like any better.
Nothing like a good job by my Dad's friend because he was trying to convince me to not do this.
Jim thing and I got on the phone with him, I was like, I'm not a sales guy, I'm not a Salesman, that's not me.
15:03
I was like, I'm an academic and lo and behold, like, that's the thing that were known for which is just, it's crazy to me.
And so, I don't know where you're at right now.
15:23
I just I wanted to just remember this moment for, for honestly for me I'm trying to be selfish.
It's just I think that I'll maybe look back on this video and try and Savor this moment because there aren't that many of them.
I feel like in our lives that we get to really save her.
And tomorrow is going to be really big for me, I mean for everyone else is just going to be another thing, right?
15:46
You know, for you because you're alive, sir, don't mind but I just know how much has gone into it and And the things that had to be like the lessons that had to be learned the hard way in order to give the lessons that are now going to be the easy way.
16:01
I think you just kind of, like all hit me at once.
Just like, just the overwhelming.
Like, just the amount of conversations, the amount of failures.
The amount of times, people said, no.
And the amount of times they left and then sometimes, you know, people insulted me and, and, you know, just how my parents were disappointed in me and like, you know, the friends that I went, you know, went to college with.
16:20
I was I was the guy who, you know, I was president of all the Means I left to your early, I got Harvard GMAT score like I was, I was that guy and to go from that to having all those people kind of be like, I don't know what he did.
You know what it means to him?
He's doing some Fitness thing around, you know, like and to like hear those, you know, those conversations are going on and not have the like emotional, you know, security, whatever you want to call it, you know, just the age that I think that protects you, as you get older, maybe you just care less that But like, you know, it just like it.
16:57
I wish I could say that I was so motivated because I loved my clients at the beginning.
But I did it.
I just I really just didn't want to fail.
I just did want to be seen as a failure and I didn't want my parents, you know, I do my dad.
I didn't want my dad to be right.
Honestly, I just don't want him to be right.
17:15
It's just such a short pants off to not have to be right.
And I wish it was from this, like, really virtuous place, but it wasn't.
It wasn't, I just, you know, in the beginning, it's like, you're fighting for survival.
17:30
Like, you're not like, you're like, love your customers are, like, I'm just trying to fuck up your rent, you know?
And so, and I know that sometimes, like, I can seem unlikely can see.
We had this, you know, crazy, you know, we these things that have been, you know, put in our in our laps that Just seem unrealistic in like you know, maybe they're just like on this hill but like it hasn't been that long.
17:51
It hasn't been that long like I almost filed bankruptcy in at the end of 2016 like nothing and I had all these gyms and then they I sold them all and then it's beyond the scope of this.
18:07
But you know, like I almost lost everything.
I mean I did lose everything.
I just did go under everything.
Luckily and so like I remember screenshotting all my bank accounts and the total of everything was $1300 and I just I just remember being like who like, Man, like this is this is what this is it like this is like, okay here we go.
18:38
Like I, you know, and I had six gems before that me working capital and not on the saying I was wealthy but like I, you know, there was enough.
And so I don't know where you're at.
I don't know.
And I wish I had a cooler story for you.
I just wanted to share this with you because I partially wanted to share it with me.
18:58
Maybe I want to share it with my kids or maybe want to share it with all.
Me, who's like, man?
Look, I used to be in shape but Whatever paint.
You know, one of my favorite sayings is Proverbs 14:34. 14:23 is like in all labor, there's profit and it says all labor, not some or like when it's supposed to be right?
19:25
It's all labor.
And I think that's so profound because it just means that it always counts because your work works on you more than you work on it. and so, like, it's not for Like, it's not for that, like, it's not for what we think it's for, you know, it's for what we're becoming as we do it.
19:48
And, and it just becomes really apparent to you when you hit these these moments you know that you're like man like this crazy.
This is absolutely not like it's just it's not us.
It's crazy and I'm just really grateful for you guys and you know the community and it's just it's just crazy.
20:11
And I feel like we've been we've been given this. this opportunity, you know where So many people have trusted us with with, with their futures. and, and we just want to do right by everyone, you know, and We don't take it lightly, you know, with the position that were in because I mean we feel like we were genuinely trying to take industry from its knees to its feet.
20:44
And that's what I told our team every day, because that's how I felt.
I felt like I was on my knees and begging and I wanted to elevate an industry to Stand Tall on its feet, probably and not be something where people are like they take their their gym owner.
21:04
Boyfriend home and the parents are like shit man, like know, everyone's like I said Doctor you know because it's meant something for me and and we have this position.
21:24
Now we have the capital and have the resources that I don't think any gym ever has had coupled with the one thing that's always been missing, which is the desire to actually do something. and so, We do and we will do everything that we can with all the resources that I have to fix.
21:44
All the problems that that I can that we can, it's me so that hopefully the the scars that that we've all gone through.
It's not just me obviously, but that hopefully other gym, owners won't have to go through them or won't have to go through as long because like I think that's what it's about, right?
22:10
Just making it better and I think we are and I think that we as a community need this, this whole, this whole game that much better.
So, anyways, you know, I went wrong on this but I'm really grateful for you guys and like, I just wanted to really, really taste the moment.
22:33
No way to say it, just kind of like, I'm sure some of you guys have had this for you, turn off the lights at the gym or like after everyone's gone, and it's weird because it's so empty.
So quiet.
And it's like, so bustling with energy, normally wears like the music in the people, and all that stuff.
22:49
But like, when you're always the last to know, like, Like it's like this small piece like this is mine, you know?
Like I made this you know and maybe that's an ego thing.
I'm not sure but it was definitely something.
23:05
I was proud of And, you know, continue to be and it formed a lot of who I am and a lot of that was through failure, a lot of a whole lot.
And so I hope that I hope that the rest of the things that I put on here which are usually not going to be in this nature.
23:27
I think they say they don't know one cares how much, you know, until they know how much you care.
And I can only like, you know, how do you say, like, I care so much.
I feel like that doesn't really mean anything, but I can just say that I Care, except in there.
23:43
And I just don't want anyone else to have to be there is it was really hard for me, it was really hard.
So lots of love, Jim Lords and for those of you who are not in our community, love you guys.
24:01
If you're a gym Lord.
Sorry.
I gym owner.
You have my respect, whether you just for being who you are, and for doing what you do every day.
So, lots of guys have an amazing night.
I will try to get to sleep.
Which is unlikely I'll probably just be reviewing slides for tomorrow which is exciting for me.
24:21
I hope you guys liked it a lot to it but you guys are just the best community in the world and there's no one I'd rather serve ever.
People always ask they're like oh you know you could do this for dentist.
24:36
You could do this for chiropractors.
I'm like yeah but I don't like them but I wasn't a dentist.
Like I'm sure we could but like, I don't And like the reason I think that we've got to where we are is because I love us, you know?
And it's that love.
I love what we're about is that it's because you get it, is we get it, it's like an unspoken thing.
24:58
Like we all know what it's like when someone always wants to change the music when someone shows up three minutes late for the 5:00 a.m. and everyone's freaking out.
Right.
You know, in the bathrooms are never clean enough.
Like I get it, you know, I totally get it.
So anyways guys have an amazing night.
25:15
I'll see you guys tomorrow and I salute you guys for everything.
Talk soon.0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
I've this want this, this piece contents and kind of percolating and today felt like the day to make it.
So I'm calling this why you should make content and I've made one other piece of content.
That's good.
It's dripping in irony.
As I'm making contact of all I should make content.
But this is why I don't recommend.
Most people don't make cuts, and I think, especially in our space for Fitness.
0:34
It's like everyone wants to be an influencer.
And I think the reality is and that's why the people that I have in, you know, all of our gym launch engine Lords.
Don't I them to not really make constant because I don't think the our own that Roi on the time for them is necessarily there and there's a couple reasons.
0:54
So, first off, if you were to look at how much time it takes to prepare content and then make the content and then you Look at how much Roi you're actually getting from that unless you have massive distribution there's not a lot of Roi on it, right?
Like for us, I have super high ticket but a very small amount of customers.
1:11
You know what I mean?
I mean, in the big scheme, right?
And fitness, you need to have a very large, very large amount of customers.
And in order to do that, you need huge distribution.
If you don't have it, it takes a super, super, super long time to get there.
A but B.
And this is the one that like no one wants to talk about the reality, is that most people really?
1:29
They aren't good enough to make good content because think about how many people are going to talk about.
Like Quito is bad.
Quito is good.
High carbs are bad, high carbs are good, like like count your calories.
You should never count calories like, so you needing versus not clean eating iifym, you know me like there's a million ways you can cut it in, like none of its new or different, you know, different or original.
1:48
And so like it's really, really, really difficult to stand out.
And so that's kind of like the first major piece, which is why I like, I like I heard Gary Vee say this.
And like for this, I'm actually a big fan of guarantees.
He was like, you know why I didn't have content for the first 15 years of my career is like because I wasn't good at shit.
2:06
He's like I was doing the shit that got me good.
That then allowed me to make content.
He's like, but I wasn't making content for the first 15 years because I didn't have, I didn't have stuff to say.
I didn't have any value to provide and there's so many people that I see right now.
I mean, like, I see all the time, especially in the Internet space.
2:21
We're guys here, dude, say yeah, like, you need to make content and so they go on and like every day, I'd like my Facebook live challenge, I make a Facebook live.
Every single day and then like they just talked about nothing can remain an expect like and I think that's the surest way to never be heard.
2:37
I think it's the like people only have like, you only her like a New Prospect.
You've got like, 15 seconds, maybe 30 seconds, if it's a recommendation to actually hook someone enough to provide enough value that they're like, I'm going to keep listening, right?
And then, you've got that one piece of content with their going to make adjustment of like either.
2:54
I'm never going to listen to anything from this guy again, or I'm going to listen to the next one, right?
And so you have this like so Super, super short window time and you don't know which one they're going to consume, which is why I like my rule for content is like only make good shit.
And if I have nothing to say for two weeks, I don't say anything for two weeks as I have nothing to say and I value your time and so and I don't want any new prospects to come in and consume my piece of concept that was like, right.
3:18
And then be like he's okay, you know, didn't say anything.
I didn't really think about already.
And so, like the amount of people, the amount of time that I see Fitness, entrepreneurs, right?
Go post on Instagram and spend this time writing their paragraphs and taking Just the right picture and like how many clients you're getting from that, right?
3:33
Not really.
Let's be real.
You're not right versus like just focusing on paid actors.
Used to grow your distribution, your network, and then and only, then if it sometimes makes sense and then you, I think the best way to start is by really making content for your existing Community who already know like and trust you who are going to now, listen to you because you've already gotten their money, right?
3:51
Because when they pay their pay attention and then that allows you to develop and get better.
So they eventually you can be good enough for coal traffic.
Who doesn't give a shit about, right?
So Overall number one, I probably would say.
That's a really bad Roi your time and just focus on acquisition Marketing sales because that is going to be a skill that is going to pay your bills today and not something that's going to be, literally a 10 or 15-year investment that may never pay off because you might not be good enough and you don't, you don't know if you're not good enough until ten years from now.
4:17
When you might still not be good at right?
I'm just being real with you, right?
And then that whole time, you could have spent spending time and attention on marketing and sales where you would actually make money and like know immediately, if you're Eating better, right?
Like it's immediate feedback which is why I love it so much.
4:33
So, and for someone who's new, like if I need to solve their problem, like we need to do this today.
We need to do this now.
So the first one second thing is kind of reference act with what give you saying there in that, in that little quote that I said were you said, you know, for the first 15 years of my career, I didn't make any content because I'm getting good at the thing that I would, then later talk about, right?
4:52
And so I was literally just boxing back and forth with Russell about this, this morning, Russell Brunson, he's a, he's healed, models for those you don't know, big software company and I've been I've been noticing of all of the friends that I have who do it's really the people who do 10 million Yeah, I think I would say five million or more a year that I know like I'm thinking off the top, my head, every single one of them and I'll get I'm gonna give you names.
5:22
So Brian Burke right now.
I think they've got a five or six million dollar Runner, a company.
They're growing, really, what?
They're grown really fast, he is now growing at the Superfast rate now, he's thing is mid 30s, mid to late 30s.
But he spent the first like eight years of his of his career selling Auto Glass to cold strangers.
5:41
People on the road, you find chips on their thing.
NG and then he would sell them Auto Glass, like auto glass repair in the moment, right there on the spot.
And yet it seemed like 20 guys, they're really 25,000 a day early on in his career, but he spent all this time, on his own going there, and learning how to pitch cold people.
5:59
Okay, that was Brian Bird Story.
Dan Kennedy spent years as a door-to-door Salesman years, door-to-door salesman pounding, the pavement knocking on doors trying to sell people who never had met him before Taki more, who we just USD get his his black bottom it right like he's now you know he's got his he's coaching on me to do about 10 million a year and I was talking to him about this and also tell me how you started and then he told me I was like oh no like before that like before that and I guess hip going and then it turns out he did two years of cold calling and then after doing two years of cold calling he then started doing cold Live Events where he would do cold calls to get people to life events through then pitch them at these.
6:43
Live Events, right?
And so this whole time before he became talky more, that's what he did, right?
And then like for for us and just like my little story and people say this all the time, they're like man, Alex you're so good at like sales and saying the right things to get people to do stuff is like I need four thousand one one closes.
7:01
Before anyone knew who I was, you know what I mean?
Like, people here that but like when I was doing that, I wasn't making content I was like spending all day selling shit.
You know what I mean?
And like I pulled that from like, Mind Body report.
So, like I don't even know how many consoles that was because like 4,000 was just like the closes.
7:18
I have no idea how many people I met with right.
And so, it's like, like because we get on these calls and play.
How do you say this?
And how do you respond to this?
And it's always like on the spot for me because I've said it 100 times, like I haven't just overcome that thing.
Once I've overcome in a hundred times because I did it so many times, it's not that I was good at it.
7:35
I sucked at it was like, huh, what can I say next time?
Or I was like inflow one day and like someone said something and I said something right back out, booming right now.
On Darrell's nailed it, right?
How is the sales training works so well, is because we actually had to do it to sell shit, right?
Like how to like the sales training that I give the gym owners who go into Jim launch is what I gave my guys, to sell memberships, right to sell challenges?
8:00
Like, if they, if they didn't, like, if I put them through the training and on the other side, when someone came in, they couldn't close them.
The training didn't work.
And so like, it wasn't meant to be something.
That was like 20 Brazilian modules of whatever.
Like my entire so streams like 45 minutes right but I knew that if I put someone in one side and they go up the other side, the result is that when they say these words, in this tonality they make this type of statement, they make this joke at this moment.
8:29
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can fly anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
8:50
It works and people bought, right?
And so, like the last piece that I wanted to add to this piece of content is like my three main core pieces about this was, um, so I just watch Rocky Creek to last night, which was great.
By the way.
You should see if you want to.
9:05
I mean, it's a Rocky movie.
So like you're going to know exactly is going to happen, but it was still a very joyful movie.
And for those of you who have read expert Secrets, talk about the heroes to Journeys, I wouldn't recommend reading that just one second, but here's your Journeys and then watch the movie.
So with that in mind of like, you know, his first, his early triumphs, his point of conflict, what things that he has to overcome, his big external goal is to, you know, be world champion.
9:31
But then he is internal struggle that he's facing his wall, which is like feeling of self-worth and who he's really doing swords.
You're doing it to please.
Others, is he doing to?
Please is dead, or is he doing?
Please himself, right.
And so like at the very end, you see him, you know, obviously achieve XYZ Bowl but then the thing that the audience really cares about is the internal Imagine that happens as a result, which I just think is really cool.
9:52
And she totally check it out.
But with back to the rocky cutscene, so every single movie in every single Rocky cutscene movie or every, whatever every movie that every Rock movie has a cutscene right?
It's like that did it into that.
You know, they have the island tiger moment, right?
And so, I feel like in business, there's this, I have the tiger moment, right?
10:13
We're just getting our reps in except instead of it lasting 90 seconds, like it does in the movie, it last six years.
Years, 10 years, right before you get to that moment.
We're all of a sudden you are the Rocky got, right?
But you're like and so I think a lot of times I see people trying to make content and this is like this is more a little bit of a statement on the, on the, on the internet marketing Community.
10:39
But also the fitness Community people making content around stuff that like they're not Masters out, you know what I mean?
Like they're proficient and it takes this much time to be proficient and takes.
Much to be a master right?
At something.
And a lot of times doing all of that extra work, is it fun?
10:57
Because it's repetitive and boring shit and the route is it?
Like it is super boring.
And so my that was kind of actually how I originally wanted to start.
This was about this, like, are you in your Rocky cutscene right now and aren't recognizing them?
Because if you are, then let that encourage you and let that inspire you to keep going because Like all of the reps are all the parts that no one sees but they're the parts that build the foundation to the castle that build the foundation of the Legacy, right?
11:28
And so like, we like it, there is not a single person who's hitting that 10 million plus Mark, not one, not one that doesn't that doesn't have massive amounts, massive amounts of coal traffic experience doing really unsexy stuff.
11:49
So Sonia was boxing.
Russell about this morning I was like, hey man, I'm going to make this piece of content today.
What's your backstory?
What were the?
What were they like?
What are the things that see?
Like and Russell doesn't even talk about this, which is, which is I told him.
I was like, dude, you need to share this because people need to hear it so Russell's like everyone's like wow Russell so good at making webinars blog about what, right?
12:10
So Russell spent two years every single weekend, pitching a cold audience after that he got tired of being away from his family and he did that every every single weekend for two years.
Okay?
After that he went home because you wanted to be with his family and then did teleseminars every single weekend for three years.
12:30
Then after that, this internet thing started really like taking off, right?
And he started doing webinars for seven to eight years, okay?
Every single week, right?
He did webinars pigeon, right?
And then on top of that, through this whole duration of time, he sent me this, this document that has And 10 funnels on it so he built 110 profitable funnels before he built clickfunnels.
12:58
Hmm, and so like, no one talks about that everyone wants to be a funnel Master, right?
Everyone's to be a funnel King and they have like one funnel and I'm like, I'm self-proclaimed the worst little person ever like, I still haven't even split test, our original funnel because I'm all about the back end.
And I think that if you can spend more to acquire customer, the funnel, doesn't matter as much.
13:16
And that's kind of more of a conversion specialists in a funnel specialist.
So like I'll be the first to say it, but that's not my hat.
You don't mean, I'm like talk about proficiency versus Mastery.
I'll do the 80/20 on the reverse side like I just want to do the 20% here.
That'll get me proficient so that I can move on in my life, right?
13:32
I will never be like I have no desire to be a funnel cake that's just not my not my thing.
If I want to do that then I have to do an entirely different route than I am, right?
But you see guys we have one funnel making content about being a funnel cake.
Except their content is shit because it has no value because they never did The Rock cutscene that Russell did.
13:49
Right?
And that's the difference.
And so number one, why I think most people should make content is because I think a lot of them haven't even started the rocket.
You were there in the middle of the rocky cutscene, right?
You're in the middle of the eye of the tiger, you're not at the end yet and so the things that you have to say aren't relevant.
14:05
Enough aren't different enough.
That anyone hasn't heard it because you haven't, you haven't had enough.
Like, mental attention that has gone to it, that you start looking at the same water bottle in 19 different directions, because you've seen it so many different times that you start really processing, because it's just how much time and attention you put to it.
14:21
You start creating these neural connections around this tiny skill set because you've done it so many times.
Times, right?
And that's the thing, the boring, but consistent boring, but rich like we preach it all the time because like, it's the truth and it's not sexy.
It sucks, right?
Like embrace the suck.
14:37
Like, how many times did I have to sit down?
Like I tell the story because it was like this moment for me where I was like, sitting down with this lady, I had like, two people in the waiting room.
I'm trying to close this credit card and she literally had her 24 year old, who has a permanent markers and he's drawing on my wall, right?
14:52
And I'm trying not to be like Angry as shit this kid, right?
Well, trying to spikes.
Smiling and closes mom.
Because now I need to close them up because I got to repaint the wall with the money that she's about to give me for this challenge, right?
And so like I was like this moment for me that I was like, man.
15:08
But guess what?
I didn't make content that day because I still had sales the next day, right.
And I was so busy doing that, I'll still busy building.
And so anyways, if you're in your Rocky Cuts me, like, invasive, be cool with it because like, it's what's going to make you great?
It's the thing that's going to separate you from everyone else and so rather than sure Certain most people never actually said shit to be your most, people started and dip out, or they become kind of a fraud.
15:35
They do a little bit and then they inflict how much they did, right.
But you can know if it's inflated because if it if it's legit and the things that someone's has to say about it are going to be you new and unique because like there aren't that many people who have actually gone through the full Rocky cutscene to the end, and a lot of that was it like if you talk to all these dudes, who are, who have the You know, like they figure plus businesses, whatever.
16:00
It's not that they're smarter, they're just more persistent.
You know, they just keep going, they just keep going and they try and learn the whole what, you know, like the whole time.
It's not like they're going blindly like they try and improve trying to improve trying to prove and that's one of the big elements of Mastery is like, constant feedback and Improvement right?
16:18
But like, it's not after two months or selling that they're like, I'm a sales expert, right?
Like you only sold for peanuts, you know what I mean?
Like you're proficient which is great and that will feed you, but in order to gain like the influence, at a lot of people want to have and that's mostly because they just want to have influence, people talk to them.
16:37
I have zero desire to that.
I want to have wealth, that's my goal.
I don't have the reverse effect on to be super, super wealthy.
And then have influence because of what I have done, not gained influence to then create wealth.
I think everyone has it backwards.
Elon Musk has like eight that 8 million followers.
16:53
Do you think he gives a shit on Instagram?
No, because he's Elon Musk in.
He got influence because it when he did he didn't get influence to then game off, and that's why I think everyone's backwards on it.
So that being said, that's why I think you should make content.
I think that's what you should embrace the rocky cutscene.
17:09
And realized the rocky cutscene is truly going to be the highest Roi on your time because that's what's going to make you, right.
You guys have heard me say Proverbs 14:23 and all labor.
There is profit and it's one of my favorite.
I think it's one of the most hopeful Proverbs in the Bible, because it says, in all labor, there's profit.
17:26
Not some, not the ones that feel good, but because like every sale that you miss you grow, right?
Because it's really just Every piece of effort that you put forward, grows you, and the difference is that the more effort that you put forward and this is where like when you're just not doing nothing, you're grown.
17:43
And so, it's like just do because you will improve inevitably and it's just the willingness to keep doing when you don't want to do anymore.
And I think that's the only thing that really separates those guys from our goals.
So, anyways, lots of love, have an amazing, amazing day.
17:58
Did you guys tomorrow?
Every piece of effort that you put forward, grows you, and the difference is that the more effort that you put forward and this is where like when you're just not doing nothing, you're grown.
And so, it's like just do because you will improve inevitably and it's just the willingness to keep doing when you don't want to do anymore.
And I think that's the only thing that really separates those guys from our goals.
So, anyways, lots of love, have an amazing, amazing day.
Did you guys tomorrow?0:00

I owned six Gems.
0:16
By the time I was 26, and I did all of cash flow because I had a kind of cool way of doing things and work pretty well for us.
And we got some attention from that.
And over time, as we worked with now, over hundreds of gym, owners to help, Them scale their businesses and double triple quadruple, 5x or businesses usually within a hundred day period.
0:36

Totally turn their gyms around full capacity, opening multiple locations within a year or so.
And I want to take you on this journey and hopefully What will be exploring is the Sales Systems Marketing Systems, the retention systems, and all the little pieces.
1:08
The nuances that make owning a gym that when you start opening your gym, you don't know about.
And hopefully I can just pass on some experience.
And so you can avoid a lot of the pitfalls that I ran into and then piggyback on some of the successes and little things that we figured out that are, you know, they say small hinges, open big doors and a lot of the things that I'll be sharing will be tiny hinges.
1:28
That open huge doors and Revenue.
