We now have a core offer built and guarantees chosen.
Next up, Now all we have to do is put a bow in this puppy and actually name it.
Naming an offer correctly determines how well your advertising converts, how big of a response you get from outbound emails, cold calls and texts, and how many inbound responses you get from organic comments.
35:11
It matters.
That being said, I will show you how to generate unlimited names or wrapping paper for your offer.
That way it never fatigues, no matter how small your market may be.
This is the key to Evergreen Lead Generation Free Gift #9.

No opt in required.
And for those of you who don't know what's coming up next, I'll tell you what's coming up next.
We go over naming execution and closing credits all right.
Execution is not Terminator style, it's actually how to turn this.
36:22
Real in the real world.
But the naming section is a sleeper.
I think it's it's one of the big ones that you can sometimes.
I mean, this is going to sound crazy to you, but.
You can literally change the cover or the the image that you have for an offer that you're selling and 5X the amount of people who buy it without changing anything about it.
36:42
That's how important naming it the right way is, and that's where we're going to go over next episode, acquisition.com Volume One, $100 million offers How to make Offers so good people feel stupid Saying No Written and performed by Alex for Mosey Copyright 2021 acquisition.com Audio production copyright 2021 acquisition.com.








0:01
Hey guys, welcome back to the last episode of $100 million Offers.
We covered 3 chapters today, naming, execution and closing.
Credits naming is going to be the biggest heater here.
It is a dark horse.
It is one of the things that's useful for if you're a local business, if you're an ecommerce store, if you're a software company, if you sell services or anything in between, if you sell stuff to people.
0:20
Naming it the right way will get the right people to buy it, the wrong people not to buy it, and ultimately make you.
Way more money.
Enjoy.
Chapter 14.
Enhancing the Offer Naming Implicit Egotism Effect.
We are generally drawn to the things and people that most resemble us.
0:39
Magic headline formula Like the tree that falls in the forest that no one hears, Having a Grand Slam offer will not make you money if no one finds out about it.
The goal must be that upon hearing about your offer, your ideal prospects are interested enough to take action.
Naming it properly is an integral part of this process.
0:57
Here's an example.
Say you see a free six week stress release challenge and a float take center session.
While they may be the same thing, just name differently, you're much more likely to respond to the first.
Now here's the rub.
Overtime offers fatigue, and in local markets they fatigue even faster.
1:14
Why?
In a local market it cost relatively little to reach an entire population.
On most platforms you can reach 1000 people for about $20.00.
So if there are 200,000 people in your addressable area.
That it would only cost you $10,000 to reach all of them one time.
Important disclaimer Reaching an audience one time in no way means an offer is fatigued.
1:34
Most people don't even notice an offer the first mention.
That's why you need to create new creative videos and images and new hooks, stories and copy around the same offers.
You can still use offers for a long time, but when we're talking about years of use, not months, offers can eventually fatigue over time.
1:51
You can rename the offer to refresh it.
This one concept will get you leads forever.
I mean it, So pay attention.
We are not changing the actual offer.
We are only changing the wrapping paper.
If you've put together a bundled offering, you're still ultimately going to be doing the same things.
2:07
The work you do, the services you provide, and the products you offer will remain Unchained as the name shifts.
Again, we're simply changing the wrapper.
Here's the simplest formula I've come up with for this process.
Magic.
Headline.
Formula.
MAGIC.
2:24
M for magnet, A for Avatar, G for goal, I for interval, C for container.
Important Not all these components are mandatory.
You will typically use three to five of them in naming A programmer service.
If you can fit them all in, great, but it's likely the name will become too long.
2:42
The shorter and punchier the better.
So it's a balance between brevity and specificity.
The only way to really know what works is to write the names out and test them.
Let's run through the components now.
Author note marketing theory if you like understanding the concepts behind my chosen MAGIC or magic formula, each roughly translates to attention for magnet, discrimination for avatar, purpose for goal, timeline for interval, and method for container.
3:11
Let's start with M make a magic reason why we start the name with a word or phrase that tells people the reason why we are running this promotion.
I like to tell people think like a fraternity party planner.
When I was in college, we had a party once because a guy got his wisdom teeth removed.
I say this to say the reason why can literally be anything.
3:29
It really doesn't matter so long as you believe it and you can even make a joke of it like the fraternity example.
But this should answer one or both of the following questions.
Why are they making this great offer or why should I respond to this offer?
What's in it for me?
Examples Free 88% off giveaway.
3:48
Spring, Summer, Back to School Grand Opening, New management, New building Anniversary, Halloween, New year Note I will discuss how to monetize free and discount offers in volume three money models, but having a promotion or discount gives a good and strong reason why.
4:04
You can also cite the season or an occurrence that will also give you a strong reason why for the promotion announce your avatar.
This component calls out your ideal avatar, who you are looking for and who you are not looking for as a client.
Do you want to be as specific as possible, but no more.
4:20
When in a local area, the more local you can make the headline, the more it will convert.
So don't do a city.
Try and go to the submarket or hyperlocal area.
Not Baltimore, but Towson, MD.
Not Chicago, but Hinsdale, etcetera.
Examples, Bee cave dentists, Rolling Hill moms, brick and mortar businesses, salon owners, retired athletes, Brooklyn busy executives, etcetera.
4:43
Give them a goal, Gee.
This is where you articulate your prospects dream outcome.
It can be a single word or phrase.
It can be an event of feeling and experience or an outcome, anything that would excite them.
The more specific and tangible the better.
Examples Pain free, celebrity smile, first place, never out of breath, perfect product, Grand Slam, offer, little black dress, double your profit, first client, high ticket 7 figure 100K, etcetera.
5:10
I indicate a time interval.
You're just letting people know the duration to expect here.
This gives an example of how long your results will take to achieve.
Note, if you're making any sort of quantifiable claim like income or weight loss, most platforms will not approve this type of messaging with a stated duration to achievement because it implies a guarantee.
5:29
It implies they're going to get this outcome in a period of time, which goes against many platform rules.
So don't give a quantifiable outcome with the duration unless the platform allows it.
That being said, a duration is a powerful component of a Grand Slam offer, and you should definitely use it anywhere you don't need to deal with compliance.
Alternatively, if the goal you help them with is not a claim per se, then absolutely use a time interval $10,000 in 10 days versus make your first sale in 10 days.
5:54
Examples a A minutes, BB hours, CC days, DD weeks, Z months, four hour, 21 days, six week, two-minute, 3 month, etcetera C complete with the container word.
The container word denotes that this offer is a bundle of lots of things put together.
6:11
It's a system.
It's something that can't be held up to a commoditized alternative.
Examples Challenge, Blueprint, Boot Camp, Intensive Incubator, Master Class, Program, Detox, Experience, Summit, Accelerator, Fast Track, Shortcut, Sprint, Launch, Slingshot, Catapult, Explosion System, Getaway, Meet up, Transformation, Mastermind, Game Plan, Deep Dive, workshop, Comeback, rebirth, Attack, assault, Reset Solution, Hack, Cheat, Code, Liftoff, etcetera.
6:38
Pro tip Find time to rhyme good rhymes stick in people's minds.
Rhyme your program name to win the game.
Google rhyming dictionary for an easy shortcut.
Note don't try and force it.
It's not a requirement, it's just a nice to have.
Example 6 pack, fast track, five day book Print Sprint Marriage Thrive.
6:58
Deep dive 12 Week 2 putt shortcut 12 month.
No debt reset.
Celebrity but shortcut.
Get some ass master class.
Just thought it was funny.
Et cetera.
You get the idea.
Next pro tip.
Alliteration.
Alliteration is where you make all or most of the words start with the same letter or sound.
7:15
An alternative approach to rhyming is to use alliteration when you're naming your program.
This is easier for most people than rhyming.
Again, you don't need to rhyme or alliterate.
Don't force it.
But if you can, I think it sounds better.
Example, make money master class, change your life challenge, big booty, boot camp, debt detox, real estate reset, life coach, liftoff, et cetera.
7:35
That might be weird, but naming offers is one of my favorite parts of this process.
What I want to highlight yet again is that your actual money, model, pricing, and services will remain largely unchanged.
Changing the wrapper simply means changing the exterior perception of what your grandson offer is.
Below you'll find a few examples of named offers for different industries.
7:52
Wellness Free Six Week Lean by Halloween Challenge 88% Off 12 Week Bikini Blueprint Free 21 Day Mommy Makeover 60 Minute Make Your Friends Jealous Model Hair System.
Six weeks Stress Release Challenge Free Bend Over.
Back Pain Free in 42 days Healing Fast Track Doctors $2000 off Celebrity Smile Lakeway Moms $1500 Off Your Kids braces.
8:16
Lakeway Moms 12 Months to a Perfect Smile $1000 off for 15 Families Back to School Free Braces Giveaway Grand Opening, Free X-ray and Treatment.
Instant Relief.
Back Sore No more 90 day.
Rapid Healing Intensive 81% Off Tightness $1.00 Massage New Client Summer Special Coaching 5 Clients in five days Blueprint 7 Figure Agency 12 Week Intensive 14 Day Find your perfect Product Launch Fill your gym in 30 days free.
8:42
I can keep listing these, but hopefully you get the idea.
Now it's time for you to give it a try for your Grand Slam offer.
Again, you don't necessarily have to use all the power components of the headline.
Using three to five will typically create something that is more unique and desirable, allowing you to separate yourself from the competitive field.
8:58
And create an offer that will get clicks and engagement and ultimately make you money.
Furthermore, you don't need to do them in the magic order.
Do what sounds puncher to you.
After doing this for a while, you'll see that some offers convert better than others.
That's natural.
And every once in a while you'll get a name that takes off like a rocket.
9:15
I honestly have no idea why some names win and others do not.
So don't be emotional about it.
Keep trying, keep striking out, then try more.
You'll get there.
Now that you have several working names for your offer, you can use two or three of your best names in your advertising campaign.
Quickly note the winner, then use that as a control to test against with new names.
9:32
That is how you promote pro tip name sub items and bonuses.
Use the magic headline formula for each item in your stack and bundle.
It will automatically enhance the value of your offering simply by naming it in a way that resonates with your prospects.
What happens when offers fatigue?
9:50
As you market offers, you will need to create variations over time as the taste of the market change over time.
Here's the order in which you will change things to keep lead flow consistent.
First, change the creative the images and pictures in your ads.
Next, after that doesn't work, change the body copy of your ads itself.
10:08
If that doesn't work, change the headline or the wrapper of your offer.
So free six week lean down challenge turns into free six week tone challenge or.
Holiday hangover to New year, New Year.
If that doesn't work, change the duration of your offer.
10:24
If that doesn't work, change the enhancer of your offer.
You're free or discount Component 6.
If that doesn't work, change the entire monetization structure.
The series of offers you get, prospects and the price points associated with them that is much more covered in book two and three.
10:40
I follow this variation framework because most of the time it's the first handful of items that need to be changed typically.
They need to be changed again and again without touching anything on the bottom of the list.
For example, when ads fatigue, we don't change our entire business.
We run the same ad again with a different video or image.
Once that stops working, we change it again.
10:57
Eventually you need to change the words on your ads and repeat the process.
Then and only then would you change the wrapper.
So let's say we change from a six week stress release challenge to a 42 day relaxing holidays challenge for a massage center.
Same core offer, just a different wrapper.
Then of course, you can change the duration of your offer, six week to 28 days or 8 weeks, etcetera.
11:17
The lower on the list you go, the more operationally heavy it is.
To be really sure you've exhausted the earlier quote, lighter ways of varying the offer.
Once you've monetized the offer, rarely should you change it.
Just rinse and repeat over and over again.
This can be hard because we are entrepreneurs and we love change.
11:33
Change here usually just creates inefficiency and operational drag, costing you money.
No bueno.
So use your entrepreneurial ADD on the wrapper.
First the look and feel of the offer.
Copy creative headlines.
Then change the seasonality of the offer.
Then change the duration.
11:49
If you're stuck, change what you're giving away for free or discounted.
Change the entire machine behind it only as a last resort, and for darn good reason, especially once you get traction.
But how do you get initial traction?
Good question.
Try the offer structure and headline you think has the highest likelihood of working.
12:06
Then stick with it and if it doesn't, convert it first.
Don't worry, you'll get better.
Oftentimes if you're using these types of models, many of them will work.
In that case, stick with the one that gives you the highest return.
You can also rotate between offers if it doesn't create lots of operational drag for your business.
This is the ultimate position of power.
12:22
You have multiple aces in the hole that you can play at any time, which keeps your marketing converting at an even higher level.
Author note marketing for local businesses.
Ironically, local business marketing is both easier and harder than national level marketing.
It's easier to get to work, but harder to keep working or scale.
12:41
And the reason is in local markets it's easier because there's trust in the familiar to selling in person at higher prices.
In a local market is inherently easier.
It means you will convert a much higher percentage of your leads.
This makes marketing work most of the time.
The downside of local marketing is that offers fatigue rapidly because there's only a limited radius that a local business can serve to reference an earlier concept, the Tam.
13:02
Total adjusted market for a brick and mortar is only its immediate radius most times, so by extension the smaller radius the faster the offer fatigues.
This is a double edged sword of local learning to rapidly vary my offers.
Headlines and creative.
When I had my local businesses was a cornerstone skill that made my expansion to a national level advertising much easier for me.
13:21
So if you are in a local market, just remember you aren't going to change the value stack of your offer, you're just going to change the way it looks to the marketplace in your marketing naming summary.
We must appropriately name or offer to attract the right avatar to our business.
True to the moniker, people do judge a book by its cover.
13:39
Halfassed Naming your product or offering can ruin its conversions.
Don't fall victim to lazy naming.
Follow the steps here to name your product or service offering and watch the same law.
Forget 2 * 3 times or 10 times the response rate.
You'll believe it when you see it.
I know I did.
Enhancing your offer section recap.
13:57
Congrats, you figured out how to make your offer valuable.
How to break your services into component parts and how do we bundle them into more valuable whole?
You added a guarantee to get more people to buy your offer and actually consume it so they could be more successful.
You presented it with urgency and security, so you get more people to desire it.
And now you've named your offer so it attracts the right prospects and repels the bad ones, all while containing a big promise everyone can understand.
14:18
But we covered a lot so I want to give you a quick breather before we forge into book two to help you attract clients and monetize your offer.

For the rest of the last episode, Section 5 Execution How to Make This Happen in the Real World Chapter 16, your first 100,000.
15:39
The 1st 100,000 is a bitch, but you got to do it.
I don't care what you have to do if it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn't purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on 100 grand.
After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit.
Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman, Berkshire Hathaway, March 2017.
15:57
My heart was racing.
I could literally feel each beat pounding into my chest.
I clenched my jaw to fend off the knot in my throat that I knew would lead to tears I wanted to give in.
Years of emotions were bottled below the surface.
Years of ignoring my reality and lack of success.
Years of putting off how I felt, just focusing on moving forward.
16:14
The pressure was shooting to the surface.
I could feel it.
We did it, I said.
Leila, my wife now looked up at me.
She was in the kitchen making dinner and stopped, spatula in hand.
What do you mean we did it?
We hit 100 grand.
I could barely say the words because I didn't want the tears to break through the tremble in my voice.
16:33
Like revenue?
No, like in our personal bank accounts.
Holy shit, Really.
That's amazing.
She ran over to me, disregarding the food on the stove, and wrapped her arms around my neck.
Spatula is still in hand.
I'm so proud of you.
She squeezed me.
I slumped into her arms.
It was like every night in my body that I had been holding onto.
16:51
Melted all at once.
I could barely contain myself.
But when I think back to it, the feeling I had wasn't happiness.
It was relief.
I'd moved from fear to security.
I treated feeling like a failure every day, Watching my work and effort yield nothing to realizing a dream.
17:07
The constant anxiety and fear of what are we going to do finally replaced by something else.
I finally had time to let myself feel something.
I felt like this struggle chapter of my life was finally over.
Look, I said.
It's for real.
I nozzled my head out of Layla's arms.
17:24
I didn't want to look her in the eyes because I knew it would put me over the edge.
I pulled my phone out and put it between us.
We both stared at the unmoving screen with our personal bank account balance, $101,018.
Our gaze remained unbroken as it confirmed our new shared reality.
17:41
It wasn't an illusion.
It wasn't revenue.
It wasn't profit that was still in the business account, only to be taken out later by some unforeseen emergency.
It wasn't earmarked money that had to be used to pay off some debt.
It was ours.
It was real.
We could fuck up and now make another dollar for three straight years and still be Okay.
17:59
At the time, $33,000 per year was more than enough for us to live on at our current expenses for three years and some years of ups and downs.
Years of plowing money into my businesses only to watch it vanish in overhead payroll and mistakes.
Years of seminars, courses, workshops, coaching programs, masterminds had finally turned into wealth.
18:19
It felt like I had broken into a new plane.
The relative increase in wealth was more than I have ever felt. 10s of millions of dollars in the bank later, it was and still is the richest I've ever felt in my life.
It was the beginning of the next chapter of my life as a business person and entrepreneur.
Some people get there fast, some people get there slowly, but everyone gets there eventually.
18:38
As long as you don't give up, keep moving forward, keep getting up, keep leaving, it can happen and it will.
In a nutshell, we've covered a lot and I think it's important for information to sink in that it be consolidated and restated.
So this is the back of the napkin bullet list to summarize what we've learned so far and why.
18:54
One, we covered why you must not be a commodity in this marketplace.
Two, why should pick a normal or growing market and why niches get you riches. 3.
Why should charge a Lot of Money 4.
How to charge a lot of money using the four core value drivers 5.
How to create your value offer in five steps 6.
19:12
How to stack the value, deliver it, and make it profitable. 7.
How to shift the demand curve in your Favor using scarcity 8?
How to use urgency to decrease the action threshold of buyers 9.
How to strategically use bonuses to increase the demand of your offer. 10 How to completely reverse buyer risk with a creative guarantee and 11 how to name it in a way that resonates with your avatar.
19:35
You now have a valuable, high margin, decommoditized grant slam offer.
This is the first building block of a wonderful business, a product or service that people desperately want and truly solves their problem for many.
This will be enough to make far more sales at higher prices with more profit.
Your first true grants time offer should be able to get you to your first 100 grand.
19:54
For others you will still want more, which is 100% your right.
As a capitalist.
There's so much more to building an acquisition machine profitably.
I could not cover it all in one book.
Out of respect for you, I wanted to make this thorough but manageable.
That being said, the next book is dedicated to exactly that, getting more through generating leads.
20:11
In that book I will break down exactly how to acquire customers at a profit, meaning.
If you structure promotions properly, you should never have to pay for a new customer again, and that is the subject of acquisition volume to $100 million.
Lead generation, Final Thoughts Entrepreneurship is about acquiring skills, beliefs, and character traits to advance.
20:30
I find that we must determine which skills, beliefs, and character traits we lack.
Most times we simply need to improve.
The only way to do that is through learning from experience and or high quality sources.
I've received terrible advice from people who are ahead of me at a time, and though experience is the best teacher, she is not the kindest.
20:48
It is my most sincere hope that what I produce provides the guidance I so desperately needed when I was coming up on my entrepreneurial journey.
And I wish I could cover it all in a single book for my sake and yours.
But to do you the service I wish I'd had, I cannot.
The devil is in the details.
Excellence exists in the depths of knowledge and nuances.
21:05
That's what separates the greats from everyone else.
I hope that in all the content I produce, you see my dedication to this detail and nuance that makes all the difference.
These lessons were hard won.
I hope you enjoyed the first volume in my $100 million series.
Before we move forward into volume to what we'll be focusing on lead generation as mentioned above, I want to circle back to where we started after reading this book.
21:27
I hope one you're well on your way to creating your first Grant Slim offer or at the very least can take components of that you were missing in your offer to make it more compelling to your market.
I also hope that I've delivered on my promise from the beginning of this book that investing 2 to 3 hours of your time here would yield you a far higher return than just about anything else you could do.
21:45
And thirdly, I hope in return I've taken one small step turning the thing that I value most from you, your trust.
Finally, I hope this book creates a small dent in improving the world, because I believe no one is coming to save us.
It's up to us as entrepreneurs to innovate our way into a better world, and that's something I'm willing to vote my life to, and I hope you are too.
22:02
I'm grateful for your attention, You could have given it to anything, and you chose to invest it with me.
I take that in the highest regard, so sincerely.
Thank you.
Stay hungry, Alex.

How to Get Strangers to Want to Buy Your Stuff by Alex Hermosi Narrated by Alex Hermosi Guiding Principles Do more Thank yous to Trevor.
Thank you for your true friendship.
Thank you for your tireless effort to extract the ideas out of my head and for your continued support and slaying the nihil as a monster.
0:59
People say you were lucky if you have one real friend in your entire life.
Thank you for the being the best friend a man could ask for to Layla.
Even though Lady Gaga said at first it doesn't make it any less true.
You found the light in me that I couldn't find.
The part of me that you will never die.
Section One.
1:17
Start here.
It's hard to be poor with leads banging down your door or Mosey family Jingle.
You have to sell stuff to make money.
It seems simple enough, but everyone tries to skip to the make money part.
It doesn't work.
I tried.
You need all the pieces.
You need the stuff to sell an offer.
1:33
You need people to sell it to leads.
Then you got to get those people to buy it.
Sales.
Once you put all those in place, then you can make money.
My first book, $100 million Offers, covers the first step and gives you the stuff.
It answers the age-old question what should I sell?
Answer an offer so good people feel stupid saying no.
1:51
But strangers can only buy your stuff if they know you exist.
This takes leads.
Leads mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but most agree they're the first step to getting more customers.
In simpler terms, it means they've got the problem to solve and the money to spend.
If you're reading this book, you already know leads don't magically appear.
2:09
You need to go get them.
More precisely, you need to help them find you so they can buy your stuff.
And the best part is, you don't have to wait.
You can force them to find you, and you do that through advertising.
Advertising, the process of making known.
Let strangers know about the stuff you sell.
If more people know about the stuff you sell, then you sell more stuff.
2:26
If you sell more stuff, then you make more money.
Having lots of leads makes it hard to be poor.
Advertising lets you have a terrible product and still make money.
It lets you be terrible at sales and still make money.
It lets you make a ton of mistakes and still make money.
In short, having the skill gives you endless chances to get it right.
2:41
And in the unforgiving world of business, second chances are hard to come by, so you might as well load up.
Advertising is skill worth having, and this book, $100 Million Leads, shows you exactly how to do it. $100 million lead sits atop the foundation of my first book, $100 million offers.
2:58
It assumes you already have a Grand Slam offer to sell the stuff.
Once you have an offer to sell, it creates the next problem.
Who do I sell it to?
This book is my answer to that question.
Leads lots of leads.
And before you know how to get leads, life sucks.
You don't know where your next customer will come from.
3:14
You scramble to cover rent and pay bills.
You worry about laying people off, putting food on your table, and going under.
You work your hardest to succeed and others laugh at you for trying.
It feels like death.
I've been there.
I get it.
This book puts you in a better situation when we've got more leads than you can handle and more money than you can spend.
3:31
Here's how.
First, explains how advertising works.
Second, reveals the four core ways to get leads.
Third, it shows you how to get other people to do it for you.
And finally, it wraps up with A1 page advertising plan you can use to grow your Business Today.
Once you know how to get leads, life gets easier.
3:47
As for why you should blindly listen to me about getting leads, don't make up your own darn mind, but in the spirit of walking the talk, here's my track record.
I advertise in a variety of industries through my holding company, acquisition.com.
Our portfolio includes software, ecommerce, business services, consumer services, brick and mortar chains, digital products and plenty of others.
4:05
Together they make $250 million per year in annual revenue.
And they do it by getting 20,000 plus leads per day selling offers from $1.00 to $1,000,000 plus.
On a personal side, I have a lifetime average return on advertising of 36 to one.
That means for every $1.00 I spend on advertising, I get 36 back, a return of 3600%.
4:24
Some people built their wealth in the stock market, others in real estate.
I built mine advertising.
This year I surpassed $100 million in net worth at age 32.
And if you're from the future, that's in 2022 U.S. dollars, which much to my dismay came with no Flyers, no awards, no parades.
4:40
I'm still 2000 times poorer than the richest man in the world.
My life is pretty much the same.
I'm still the same height, married to the same woman, and graying faster than when I was poor.
In these pages, I share the skills responsible for the bulk of my material success.
I did it all using the advertising methods in this book.
I left nothing out.
This isn't a book of theories or armchair analysis.
4:58
This is a book built on what worked for me, and I wrote it hoping it'll work even better for you To answer a question I got after releasing my first book, Why do your books look like they're written for kids?
The answer is simple.
My books must be books I would read, and I have a short attention span.
As such, I liken my reading preferences to that of a child.
5:15
Short in length, simple in words, and with lots of pictures, these books are my attempt to do that. $100 million leads is about getting strangers to show interest in the stuff you sell, and once I transfer that skill to you, it's your turn to use it.
With that out of the way, let's get rich, shall we?
Pro tip faster, deeper learning by reading and listening at the same time?
5:36
Here's a life hack I stumbled on eight years ago.
If you listen to an audio book and read the physical book or ebook at the same time, you read faster and remember more.
You store the contents in more places in your brain.
Nifty stuff.
This is how I read most books worth reading.
I also do both because I struggle to stay focused if I listen to the audio while reading.
5:54
It helps me avoid zoning out.
It took me two days to record this book out loud.
I did it.
So if you struggle like me, you don't have to anymore.
If you want to give it a try, go ahead and grab the alternative version that you don't have in your hands right now or listening to right now to see for yourself.
I've made my books as cheap as the platforms let me so this isn't employed to make some extra coin.
6:12
I promise.
I hope you find it as valuable as I have.
I figured I'd put this hack early on.
This way you'd have a chance to do it if you found the first chapter valuable enough to earn your attention.
Pro tip, Hack for finishing books.
I get distracted easily so I need little tricks to keep my attention.
6:27
Like this one.
This one helps me a lot.
Finished chapters don't stop in the middle.
Completing a chapter gives you positive reinforcement.
It keeps you going.
So if you meet a tough chapter, finish it so you can start fresh on the next one.
How I got here.
Hope is being able to see the light despite all the darkness.
6:46
Desmond Tutu, March 2017.
I felt hurried taps on my shoulder while working at my desk.
It was Leila, my then girlfriend and business partner.
What's up?
You all right?
We have a problem, she said.
But now I thought, look at this.
7:02
She shoved a stack of books out of the way to make room for her laptop.
What am I looking at?
I squinted.
A disaster.
She ran her fingers down the screen to direct my gaze.
Minus $99 -, 499, -, 400 and $99, -, 200 and $99, -, 300 and $99, -, 400 and $99 -, 499 dollars.
7:22
Every other number was more than my rent.
What are these?
She started scrolling.
Refunds, all of them, from the two gyms we launched last month.
Wait, how?
Why?
She scrolled more.
I got lots of weird texts last night from members we sold at the Kentucky gym.
7:38
I guess the owner stood up on a chair and told everyone to refund and go home.
He didn't want to deal with all the new customers.
That's insane.
I said she was still scrolling.
Yeah, and the other gym owner told his new customers he would take them for half the price if they asked for refunds from us.
7:53
And then paid him and said, wait what?
They can't do that.
I said, well, they did.
She scrolled faster.
The numbers blurred.
Have you called them?
That's not allowed in the agreement.
I said yeah, I know, they're ignoring my calls.
I put my hand on hers.
8:10
The refund waterfall rose in place, Hundreds of droplet sized reminders of how much I sucked.
How bad is this?
How many refunds just cutting profits or enough to go negative and owe money?
I tried to keep my voice steady.
I failed.
Leila paused before answering.
8:27
It's 150 grand.
The number hung in the air.
We won't be able to pay my friends.
Their faces flashed through my mind and the little hope I had drained from my chest a month earlier.
I got her friends to quit their jobs for this.
Now I had to tell them I didn't have the money to pay them, she continued.
8:44
We can't sell our way out of this either.
It'll just create more refunds to deal with and we're out of money.
Her eyes meant mine looking for answers she deserved.
I had nothing.
I felt sick a year earlier.
I was good at getting leads from my gyms.
I scaled to five locations in only three years.
9:00
My claim to fame was opening my gyms at full capacity on the first day, so I opened as many as I could, as fast as I could.
My fast pace started getting attention.
I got asked to speak at a conference about my advertising method.
To me, though, I didn't think my process was special, I figured everyone was doing it.
9:16
So I walked through my presentation, hoping I wasn't boring the audience.
They were silent.
The moment I stepped off stage, a mob formed around me.
They hold questions at me left and right.
I could barely keep up.
They even followed me to the bathroom.
I felt like a celebrity.
It was wild.
9:32
To this day, I've never been more bombarded in my entire life.
Everyone wanted me to teach them how to do what I had just presented.
They wanted my help me.
But I had nothing to sell them.
Although over 100 people left me their phone numbers and business cards in case I did.
9:48
Then a wild idea came to me.
I could make some money doing this stuff.
Three months later, an idea turns into a business.
Since I used advertising to launch my gyms at full capacity, I thought maybe I could launch other people's gyms to full capacity, too.
I called the company Gym Launch Original.
10:05
I know my offer was simple.
I'll fill your gym in 30 days for free.
You pay nothing.
I pay for everything.
I sell new members and keep the first six weeks of membership fees as payment.
You get everything else.
If I don't fill your gym, I don't make money.
You spend nothing.
Either way, it was an easy offer to sell.
10:23
I'd fly out, turn on my lead machine, work the leads, then sell the leads.
Except instead of selling them into my gym, I'd sell them into whatever gym I was camped out for the month.
Every month I'd go to a new gym, rinse and repeat.
It worked.
Word of this kid who'd fill your gym for free got around fast.
Unless I hired help, referrals would have booked me out for more than two years straight.
10:42
I couldn't keep running my gyms and doing this, so I sold my gyms and went all in on gym launch.
I saw a problem though.
I filled their gyms and they got to keep all the long term profits.
I left so much money on the table, but if I were part owner of some of the gyms, I could stack revenue month over month.
10:59
Bingo.
Not much later.
One of the gym owners made such an offer.
We'd be 5050.
I would fill the gym with members and he would fill it with staff.
With this new model I could open up one to two gyms per month and own them all.
This would work much better than only collecting the upfront cash.
A winwin partnership.
11:15
A slight hitch in the plan though.
My new partner had quote poor financials.
So nice guy.
Alex offered to pay all the expenses to take on all the liability for the first launch.
I personally guaranteed the lease and would spend my time and my money to fill it with members.
Once filled, I would hand the gym over to him.
11:31
I put all the money from selling my gyms, including my life savings into this Quote launch and go model.
It took everything I had.
A few weeks later, halfway through the launch, I woke up to find all the money in my account gone.
All of it.
The partner accused me of stealing and took the money as his share of the profits, but we hadn't made any profit.
11:50
Then he sent the money to a foreign contact and filed for bankruptcy.
That's what he told me anyway.
When I offered to walk through the financials and account for every dollar he refused.
That's when I knew I'd made a terrible mistake.
It turns out he'd been indicted for fraud a few years earlier and to make matters worse, I already knew.
12:07
He told me it was just a big misunderstanding.
I believed him.
And as the saying goes, when money meets experience, the money gets the experience and the experience gets the money.
Lesson learned.
In three months I went from a successful multi location gym owner to selling on my gyms to a cool new gym launching thing to completely broke.
12:27
Everything I made from selling my gyms was gone.
My life savings was gone.
Wiped out all of it.
Four years of work, saving, sleeping on the floor, erased in Oh no, Leila.
Leila quit her life as she knew it to do this with me.
She weathered my constant changes.
12:43
She supported me in the half baked partnership even though she opposed it.
Even with this huge failure she never once hinted I told you so.
Instead, she told me the gym lunch model is still good.
Let's do more of those.
So we did.
I put $3300 per day on a credit card to pay for ads, airfare, hotel, rental cars, etcetera for six sales reps Layla's friends.
13:03
I say this lightly, but I covered what a nightmare it was in the first book, so I won't repeat it here.
In the first month, we launched 6 gyms and collected $100,117.00.
We made enough to cover the $100,000 credit card bill.
And for the record, that meant I was still broke.
So next month we made $177,399 with 30 to $40,000 in profit.
13:23
It gave me some room to breathe, finally.
And that's when Leila tapped me on the shoulder to share the $150,000 worth of bad news.
Now you're caught up.
The morning after Leila told me we had $150,000 in refunds and lost all our money again, a honking horn startled me.
13:39
At 3:00 AM, my problems flooded back to me.
Well, I'm awake now.
I pulled myself out of bed and slinked to my work corner.
I walked over out of habit more than desire.
I slid the chair out and plopped down, notebook and pen at the ready.
I had to make $150,000 in profit, not revenue, in 30 days.
13:58
And I had to do it with no money to my name and no experience making that much profit in a month ever.
So I started scribbling ideas, charging up from free for new gyms.
Ask for a percentage of revenue from old gyms.
Get gyms.
I already launched A prepay for future launch.
Call every old customer and sell them supplements over the phone.
14:14
I kept penciling the math.
None of these would make enough money.
Not in 30 days, anyway.
I felt glued to the chair.
I have to figure this out.
I stared at the notebook, hoping it knew something it didn't.
God, I suck.
A few hours later, Layla woke up like clockwork.
14:30
She walked in the kitchen and poured a cup of coffee.
She got straight to work at the kitchen table behind me.
What you doing?
I asked, trying to distract myself.
Checkins with online fitness clients, she said.
What does that bring in again?
3600 last month.
What do you charge?
14:46
300 bucks a month?
Why?
How long does it take you?
A few hours a week.
And there's no overhead, Just time.
Yeah.
Why?
I plowed on.
I know these are old personal training clients, but do you think you could do it with strangers?
I don't know.
Probably.
What are you thinking?
I think I have something.
15:03
I said wait for what?
To come up with 150 grand.
What?
My online training.
How she looks skeptical.
We just cut the middleman and sell direct.
I think I can just run ads to a sales page that book phone appointments.
Then we can sell the fitness programs we've been selling at the gyms, but sell them as an online program.
15:21
We already have the materials.
We already know the ads work and there won't be any cost to fulfill.
Plus, no more flights, no rentals, no motels and no gym owner telling them to refund.
She hesitated.
You think it could work?
Honestly, no idea.
But every day we don't do something is 1 less day to come up with the money.
15:38
She thought hard.
All right, let's do it.
And that was all I needed.
I work 38 hours straight to make an offer, go live.
A few hours later, lead started flowing.
She took her first call.
The next day.
I walked in as the call finished $499.
15:54
Yeah, and What Car did you want to use?
She had the Candorver Pro a few minutes later.
I asked with anticipation.
Is that a sale?
Yep.
Dang, she is a pro.
I even snapped a picture for the zero listening audio of Layla in this exact moment when she closed the first credit card, just because it felt like a big moment.
16:11
Within days we were doing $1000 per day in online fitness sales.
We also got the cash upfront with almost no risk of refunds.
This was working, but we were still way short of the 150 grand.
At lunch, she listened to my master plan between mouthfuls, okay so the sales guys can stay home and sell this over the phone.
16:28
If they do the same thousand per day you are with eight guys, we should hit 8000 per day.
In 30 days we'll make 240,000 after ads, many commissions.
We'll have enough to cover the 150 grand.
What about the gyms we're supposed to launch?
I'll call them and tell them we went in another direction.
16:45
They haven't paid us anything, so there's not much they can object to.
I'll start calling them after lunch.
The first call was to a gym owner in Boise.
ID.
Hello.
I looked down to read my bullet points on my little script.
Hey man, we're not doing launches anymore.
We're selling direct to consumer weight loss, so we won't be coming out.
17:02
And he interrupted.
But I really need this right now.
I just refinanced my house and maxed out all my credit cards to keep the gym afloat.
I put my life savings into this place.
Is there any way you can help me?
You launched my buddies gyms.
I know what you can do.
Give my worse than your situation.
I didn't care how bad his finances were, so I tried to sound polite.
17:21
I get that it's a hard time or we're not flying out.
I'm sorry.
Okay, okay.
I get you can't fly out.
But is there any way you can just show me what to do?
We really need this.
I was beat up, exhausted, broke, and felt betrayed by the entire industry.
I should have said no, but instead I said fine.
17:38
I'll show you how to get the leads, but I'm not flying out there to save you.
If you can't sell totally get it.
It's on me.
I can close.
I just don't have anyone walking the door.
I need leads.
How much to show me how to launch.
I look down at my script.
This is not how I was supposed to go.
17:54
I wanted to see no one hang up.
Our weight loss offer was working and I didn't want distractions.
He'd already told me he was broke.
So I said the biggest number I could think of to get him off the phone. 6 grand.
Consider it my selling my secret sale 6K.
Yes, 6000, I said, articulating the whole number, hoping to scare him off. 6 KOK.
18:15
Done.
What?
I stood there, slack jawed, frozen in disbelief, $6000.
I floated out of myself and watched the conversation happen.
I still get choked up sometimes thinking about it.
Oh great.
What?
What card do you want to use?
18:31
Now I'm trying not to scare away the $6000.
Panicked, I wrote down his card information on the flap of a cardboard box.
When do I start?
He asked.
I'll send you everything Monday morning.
Given the insane task of packaging my entire gym leads and sales system in 48 hours, he agreed.
18:47
I hung up and sat in shock.
Once I came to my senses, I ran the credit card $6000.
Success.
Is this real?
I desperately wanted to tell Layla, but she was on a sales call. 15 minutes later she walked in.
Got another one, She said.
You won't believe this.
19:03
I just sold our gym launch system for $6000 to a gym owner in Boise.
What?
I thought we were doing weight loss.
Yeah, I know.
So did I.
But she waited.
I think we're still in the gym business.
I think we're just doing it wrong.
She needed more details.
19:19
I didn't have any yet.
I'm going to call the gyms we plan to launch next month and see if they'll buy it too.
Okay.
She said The next call went the same.
When he said how much.
I said 8000.
He agreed.
Next call, same thing, except I said 10,000.
19:36
He agreed.
All a gyms we plan to launch said yes to licensing the launch materials instead.
In a single day I collected $60,000 selling something with 0 cost to fulfill.
In a single day, I was 1/3 of the way out of my $150,000 prison.
I spent five years developing that advertising system.
19:53
It finally paid off.
Doing the thing that scared me most.
Giving away my secrets led to the biggest breakthrough of my life.
I can't believe it.
I said I think we can get out of this.
So are we not doing the weight loss thing?
Leila said.
No, I guess not.
I think, I think we had something here all along.
20:10
We had to put the pieces together.
Do you think anyone else will buy it?
I'm going to call the 30 gyms.
We already launched.
They know our system works because we did it in front of them.
We also had some gym owner leads from that conference that should cover the 150 grand and give us a clean slate okay.
Then what is this, what we're going to do?
20:26
She looked for some well deserved stability.
I mean, I think so it makes more money than the other thing and it's way easier to deliver.
She agreed.
So after I call these leads, I'll start running ads.
I'll post our success stories in a few gym groups to get leads from there, and I'll also tell the gyms I'll pay 2000 in cash for any gym they send that signs up.
20:45
That gives us ad leads, constant leads, and referral leads.
In the next 30 days we made $215,000 in profit.
We covered the 150 grand in refunds with cash to spare.
We did so well because the average gym owner using our advertising system added an extra $30,000 in cash in the 1st 30 days and made them more money than they paid for.
21:03
It get delivered in spades.
Plus they got to keep all the cash they loved it.
Referrals poured in.
I found the processing records from May to June of 2017, the month it all happened.
You can see them below.
We finished that year at 6,820,000 in revenue.
21:21
The next calendar year we did $25.9 million in revenue and $17 million in profit.
Yeah, 10s of 1,000,000.
It was insane.
Like nuts.
The company continues to this day with 4500 plus gym locations and counting and no one is more surprised than me.
21:39
Something I made actually worked.
Finally, in 2018 we started Prestige Labs to sell supplements through our gym client base.
We used Prestige Labs and the Gyms as an affiliate network to generate weight loss leads for each other.
In 2019, we started Allen, a new type of software company that worked leads for local businesses.
21:55
In 2020, we founded acquisition.com, a holding company for our business interests.
In 2021, we sold 75% of Allen to a bigger company.
I'm not allowed to say for how much, but Allen did 12 million in revenue the prior 12 months.
So you can use your imagination.
We sold 66% of our supplement and gym licensing business to American Pacific Group at a $46.2 million valuation and that was after taking $42 million in owner pay over the first four years.
22:20
I show this because I can still hardly believe it.
All of this was because of a girl who believed in me, a credit card and the ability to get leads.
Important disclaimer.
Knowing how to get leads, save my business, my reputation, and likely my life.
It was the only way I stayed afloat.
It was the reason I kept getting 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th chances during my hardest days.
22:39
I repeated the same phrase to myself.
I cannot lose if I do not quit.
I advertised a lot of different things in a lot of different ways.
I advertised to get online weight loss leads for Layla.
I advertised to get gym owner leads to sell business services.
I advertised to get affiliate leads.
For our supplement company, I advertised to get agency leads for our software.
22:57
And so on.
Getting leads has been my get out of jail free card with no expiration date, and at this point it's faded and worn with use.
I'd like to share this skill with you.
I can show you how to get more leads.
And here's your first piece of good news.
By reading these words, you're already in the top 10%.
23:12
Most people buy stuff and never crack it open.
I'll also throw out a spoiler The further you get, the bigger the Nuggets get.
Just watch.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you for allowing me to do work I find meaningful.
Thank you for lending me your most valuable asset, your attention.
I promise to do my best to give you the highest return possible on it.
23:29
This book delivers.
The world needs more entrepreneurs.
It needs more fighters.
It needs more magic.
And that's what I'm going to share with you.
Magic.
Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book right now.
If you don't know this, the mission of acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone.

And the only way we can reach everyone is if you choose to share this.
And so if you've been enjoying this, you've been getting value from this chapter and any of the rest of the podcast episodes.
If you could just take a second and ship this to a friend, just click the one button and send it to somebody, or share it on your stories, it would mean the world to me.
And it would ultimately send this message to more people.
24:02
So if you could do that now, it would mean a lot.
The problem this book solves leads.
Lots of leads.
You have a problem.
You're not getting as many leads as you want because you're not advertising enough.
Period.
As a result, your potential customers are ignorant of your existence.
24:18
How sad.
This means less money flows your way.
So now that you know you have a problem, unless you hate helping people and making money, you kind of have to solve it.
Have this book solves it.
To make more money, you've got to grow your business.
You can only grow your business in two ways.
Number one, get more customers #2 make them worth more.
24:35
That's it.
I grow our portfolio companies with this exact framework.
When $100 million leads focuses on #1 getting more customers, You get more customers by getting number one.
More leads #2 better leads #3 cheaper leads #4 reliably Think from lots of places.
24:52
Bottom line All else being equal, when you double your leads, you double your business.
This book shows you how to transform your business into a lead getting machine.
Once you apply its models, you instantly increase lead flow.
And like cash flow, when leads flow, it's hard to not make money.
This book will solve your not getting enough leads problem for good.
25:11
In a nutshell, I will show you how to get strangers to want to buy your stuff.
What's in it for me?
In one word, trust.
I give this book and the courses that come with it for free or at cost in the hopes of earning your trust.
I want this book to provide more value than any $1000 course, $30,000 coaching per hour, or $100,000 degree.
25:29
Although I could sell these materials that way, I don't want to.
I have a different model.
I'll explain it below.
Who am I looking to help?
I want to provide value to two types of entrepreneurs.
The 1st is under $1 million per year in profit.
My goal is to help you get to $1 million per year in profit for free, and in doing so, earn your trust.
25:47
Try a couple of taxes from this book, Get some leads, try a few more and get more leads.
The more leads you get, the better dude enough and you become the second type of entrepreneur, the type making over $1,000,000 of EBITDA, fancy word for profit per year once you get there, or if that's you now, it would be my honor to invest in your business and help you scale.
26:04
I don't sell coaching masterminds courses or anything like that.
I invest.
I buy equity in growing profitable bootstrap companies.
Then I use the systems, resources, and teams of all my companies to fast track the growth of your company.
But don't believe me yet, We just met author note our investment criteria have changed since the last book.
26:23
If you notice some changes in our investment criteria, you're right.
We changed our minimum investment threshold from 3 million in revenue to $1,000,000 in profit.
On top of that, we used to primarily invest in education and service businesses, but our portfolio has expanded.
We've done quite well outside of those industries.
26:39
So now as long as business meets our size requirements and is profitable, cash flowing and growing, we consider investing in it.
My business model, acquisition.com.
The business model is simple.
Number one, provide better free products than the markets paid products.
Two, earn the trust of entrepreneurs who make over $1,000,000 in profit per year.
26:58
Then invest in those entrepreneurs to fast track their growth, and then finally help everyone else for free for good.
Our process reverse engineer success.
The winners know my models work for them because they already have, and I know the winners will use them because they already do.
So we operate on shared trust.
27:15
This approach avoids failures and increases the likelihood of success.
Win, win.
Easy to say.
But let me show you how much of a difference our process makes.
Within the first 12 months, our average portfolio company 1.8 X's revenue and 3.01 X's profits and we partner for the long haul.
That's just the first 12 months.
Our average portfolio company who's been with us between 12 and 24 months 2.3 X's revenue and 4.7 X's profits.
27:36
As a fun exercise, plug your numbers in to see what it would look like for you.
This stuff works.
That's how I know the models I'm about to share with you work.
They already have Acquisition dot com's mission to make real business accessible to everyone.
Businesses solve problems.
Businesses make the world better.
27:53
There are too many problems for any one person to solve, and I can't cure cancer and hunger or solve the world's energy crisis for now.
But I can provide value to the entrepreneurs who build the businesses that will.
I want to help create as many businesses as possible so we can solve as many problems as we can.
So I share these business building frameworks rather than the hoard them.
28:11
Fair enough.
Cool.
Let's press on basic outline of this book.
I laid this book out from zero clients, zero leads 0 advertising 0 money, zero skills Section 2 to Max clients Max leads, Max advertising, Max money and Max skills Section 4.
We need to learn more skills as we progress in the book and when we have more skills we can get more leads in the same amount of time.
28:30
So we finished with the most complex skills that get us the most leads for our time spent.
We save them for the end because they take lots of skills and money, and getting good and having money takes time.
I want this book to help a person get their first five clients and crack their first $10 million month and beyond.
This order also reminds those with skills and money, myself included, of the basics we stopped doing.
28:50
Our businesses deserve better respecting the tried and true methods that got you to your current level.
We'll probably get you the next one.
Masters never don't do the basics.
So we go from getting your first lead all the way to building $100 million plus leads machine.
Here's the breakdown, Section One.
29:05
You're about to finish reading it right now.
Section 2, I reveal, makes advertising really work.
Most entrepreneurs think about advertising the wrong way, and since they think about advertising the wrong way, they do the wrong stuff to get leads.
You want to do the right stuff to get leads.
This is the way Section 3, we learn advertising is core four.
29:23
There are only four ways to get leads.
So if there's a most important How to section, it's this one.
Section 4, we learn how to get other people, customers, employees, agencies, and affiliates to do it all for you.
And this completes the assembly of your fully functioning $100 million leads machine.
Section 5 we wrap up with A1 page advertising plan you can use to get more leads today.
29:43
Golden Ticket We invest in companies doing over $1,000,000 in profit to help them scale.
If you would like us to invest in your business to scale, go to acquisition.com.
You can also find free books and courses so good they'll grow your business without your consent.
Hope you enjoyed the first chunk of $100 million leads.
29:59
I wanted to make this book absolutely free for everybody, independent of whatever your financial means are.
If you want to, the next chunk is going to be how you can engage your leads, what types of leads are the ones to be going after and ultimately how to 10X the amount that you get for the work that you put in.
30:17
And unlocking this one concept was what dramatically enhanced my brick and mortar locations.
It's what enhanced my licensing business and has been key to the amount of leads that been able to generate today at acquisition.com across our portfolio.

Welcome to The Game.
This is a special edition $100 million leads podcast.
These are the actual chapters from the audio book that I've made free for everyone.
Here we're going to be covering Get understanding why leads alone aren't enough and how to engage your leads.
These have been huge lessons for me and I hope that they serve you.
0:23
Section 2.
Get Understanding Advertising Simplified.
In this section, we cover three things to make sure advertising does exactly what we want it to do.
First, we talk about what a lead actually is.
If we want more of them, we better be darn well sure we're talking about the same thing.
Second, we learn how to separate leads that make you money from the leads that waste your time.
0:41
Third, we show you the best way I know to get the leads that make you money to show interest in the stuff you sell.
Let's dive in.
Leads alone aren't enough.
If you can't explain something in simple terms, then you don't understand it.
Doctored Richard Feynman, A Nobel Prize winner in physics.
0:59
I'll let you in on a little secret.
This book started because somebody asked me what a lead was.
You'd think it would be simple, but I couldn't give a straight answer.
And after six months of trying to figure it out, I was more confused than before.
It became clear I didn't know as much about leads as I thought.
My search for a clear definition of a lead snowballed into the massive project that became $100 million leads.
1:17
All this to say, we've got to agree on what the heck a lead is before we dive Head 1st and trying to get them.
So what's the lead anyways?
Someone who clicks an ad, a phone number, a person that schedules a call, a list of names, a door you knock on, a walk in, an e-mail address, a subscriber, a person that sees your content, etcetera.
1:33
You see words matter because they affect how we think, how we think affects what we do.
And if words have us thinking the wrong way, then we'll probably do the wrong stuff.
I hate doing the wrong stuff.
So do the right stuff more and the wrong stuff less.
It's best we know what words mean and how to use them to cut the suspense.
1:49
A lead is a person you can contact, that's all.
If you bought a list of emails, those are leads.
And if you get contact information from website or database, those are leads.
The numbers in your phone are leads.
People in the streets are leads.
If you can contact them, they are leads.
2:04
But what I came to realize was leads alone aren't enough.
We want engaged leads, people who show interest in the stuff you sell.
If someone gives their contact information on a website, that is an engaged lead.
If someone follows you on social media and you can contact them, that's an engaged lead.
2:20
If people reply to your e-mail campaign, they are engaged leads.
The leads showing interest are the leads that matter.
Engaged leads are the true output of advertising.
Getting more engaged leads is the point of this book.
But I couldn't call the book engage leads because no one would get it.
But now you do.
So the next question is how do we get leads to engage?
2:38
Engage your leads offers and lead magnets.
I don't do drugs.
I am drugs.
Salvador Dali, April 2016.
I paid $25,000 to be in a group and everyone told me to do a webinar.
In fact, my mentor at the time told me do webinar every week until you make $1,000,000.
2:56
Until then, don't ask me about anything else.
This is my only path to success.
I've got to figure this out.
A webinar as I understood it was a magical presentation with a zillion slides.
If somebody watched it, it would hypnotize them into buying my thing.
There's so much I didn't know.
Landing pages, registration pages, follow up emails, replay emails, car close emails, presentation software, website integration, writing ads, making ad creative, figuring out where to put the ads, who to show the ads to, building a payment page, processing payments.
3:22
Never mind making the actual webinar, the list.
Overwhelming.
So I started with what I understood the most, the landing page.
I built a few of those for my gyms.
My mentor made millions with webinars, so I modeled his landing page.
But I didn't need to make millions.
I just needed to make something.
OK, now the thank you page.
3:39
An entire Sunday later, the thank you page went live.
Now for the big test.
I put my e-mail into landing page and clicked sign me up and waited.
My brand new thank you page loaded.
Success.
I still wasn't a millionaire sad face, but it was something.
The following Sunday I sat down for my regular work on the business.
3:56
Not in the business ritual.
I had 10 hours to figure out the next piece of this webinar puzzle.
After my first cup of coffee I decided I'd really didn't want to work, but I still wanted to feel productive.
So I went on to my advertising groups forum to get some tips.
I just got off my webinar. $32,000 in an hour.
4:12
IROY the entire tuition in my first week webinars rock.
I'm never going to make this work.
He joined the same month as me.
He was in the same industry as me.
He figured out how to make money with his webinar before me.
He was stealing all the clients before I even got a chance.
Everyone is making money but me.
4:29
Desperate, I called other people in the group.
I'll do anything for your business.
Build a sales team, write your sales scripts, fix your sales process, anything.
Just help me finish this webinar, please.
One person agreed to help.
Thank God.
Eight Sundays later, the little circle next to my ad campaign turned green.
It's alive.
4:45
I was officially spending $150.00 per day on ads.
All I had to do now was watch the money pour in.
I was going to be rich.
Three days $450.80 leads and zero sales later, I shut it all down.
I suck.
No one even watched my webinar.
Meanwhile, that guy posted again about how much money he was making off this webinar stuff.
5:04
Why do I suck so much?
I spent most of my money to join this group and I just set another $450 on fire.
I didn't have the money to fail again.
I needed the next thing to work.
And if I couldn't even get anyone to watch, what was the point?
The case study.
I scrolled my news feed to see what other people were doing.
5:23
An ad caught my eye.
Free case study on how I spent $1.00 and made $120,000 in a weekend or something like that.
I punched in my e-mail and the page sent me to a video of walking through a successful advertising campaign.
Nothing fancy, no slides, no presenting.
Just the dude explaining how his stuff worked.
5:39
This I can do.
I fired up my screen recorder.
OK, everyone, so here's the ad account of a gym we just launched.
Here are the ads we ran.
This is how much we spent.
We sent them to this page with this offer.
You can see how many leads we got here.
They got this many people scheduled.
This many people showed.
5:54
This is how many they sold.
This is how much the gym owner made.
This is everything we did.
If you want to help setting up something like this, we'll do the whole thing for free.
And we only get paid off the sales you make.
If that sounds fair, book a call.
It took maybe 13 minutes.
Simple.
I swapped the webinar out for this video and changed the headline free case study how?
6:12
We added 213 members and $112,000 in revenue to a small gym in San Diego.
They would book a call on the next page.
I set up a fresh ad campaign and went to bed the next morning.
Alex, what did you do, Lee last?
What do you mean?
Strangers have booked my calendar solid for the next week.
6:28
Really.
Yeah.
Did you start a new campaign or something?
Yeah, but I didn't think it was going to go live so fast.
Wait, people book calls?
Yeah, tons.
Seeing Layla's calendar stack with appointments filled me with joy.
It's working.
I learned an important lesson.
They didn't want my webinar, but they did want my case study.
6:46
This accidental discovery showed me how getting leads actually works.
You have to give people something they want.
The best part is, it's easier than you think.
Author note webinars still work.
Obviously they work for the other guy in the group, but I didn't have the skills of the time to make it work.
I was so scarred from my first experience, I didn't try another webinar for years.
7:04
Spend your time testing the offer rather than perfecting an untested product.
This was my break for I just needed to give people something simple they wanted.
For gym owners, it was a case study showing how I filled gyms in 30 days.
Lead magnets get leads to engage.
Offers are what you promised to give in exchange for something of value.
7:23
Often a business promises to give its product or service in exchange for money.
This is a core offer.
If you advertise your core offer then you go straight for the sale.
The direct path to money advertising your core offer might be all you need to get leads to engage.
Try this way first.
Sometimes though, people want to know more about your offer before they buy.
7:41
This is common for businesses that sell more expensive stuff.
If that's you, then you'll get more leads to engage by advertising with the lead magnet first.
A lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrow problem.
It's typically a lower cost or free offer to see who's interested in your stuff, and once solved, it reveals another problem solved by your core offer.
8:00
This is important because leads interested in lower cost or free offers now are more likely to buy a related higher cost offer later.
Think of it like salty pretzels at a bar.
If someone eats the pretzels, they'll get thirsty and order a drink.
The salty pretzels solve the narrow problem of hunger.
8:16
They also reveal A thirst problem to be solved by a drink which they can get in exchange for money.
The pretzels have a cost, but when done right, the drink revenue covers the cost of the pretzels and Nets a profit.
So your lead magnet should be valuable enough on its own that you could charge for it, and after they get it, they should want more of what you offer.
8:35
This gets them one step closer to buying your stuff.
A person who pays with their time now is more likely to pay with their money later.
Good lead magnets get more engaged leads and customers than a core offer a loan and do it for less money.
So let's make a lead magnet, shall we?
Pro Tip Even free stuff has a cost.
8:51
People will give you time before they give you their money, but time is still a cost.
If your lead magnet isn't worth their time, it's overpriced.
And free or not, they won't buy from you again.
So look at it this way.
If they think your lead magnet is worth their time, they'll think your core offer is worth their money.
9:07
Seven Steps to Creating an Effective Lead magnet.
Step one Figure out the problem you want to solve and who to solve it for.
Step 2 Figure out how to solve it.
Step 3 Figure out how to deliver it.
Step four, Test what to name it.
Step 5 Make it easy to consume.
Step 6 Make it darn good.
9:24
Step 7 Make it easy for them to tell you they want more.
Something to keep in mind before we start.
Grand Slam offers work for free stuff as much or better than they'd work for paid stuff.
So make your lead magnet so insanely good.
People feel stupid saying no.
And yes, this means that you may have a few insanely valuable offers even if some are free, but that's a good thing.
9:44
The business that provides the most value wins.
Period.
So let's get started.
Step one, Figure out the problem you want to solve and who to solve it for.
Here's a simple example we can walk through together.
This book is a lead magnet.
You are a lead.
I want to solve an engaged lead problem and I want to solve it for businesses making less than $1,000,000 in annual profit.
10:03
With enough leads, they can make more than $1,000,000 in annual profit.
Then they qualify for my core offer me investing in their company to help them scale.
The first problem is picking the problem to solve.
I use a simple model to figure this out.
I call it the problem solution cycle.
You can see it below.
For those of you listening, it's just a circle of problem and solution that continue to go around and around.
10:23
Every problem has a solution.
Every solution reveals more problems.
This is the never ending cycle of business and life.
And smaller problem solution cycles sit inside of larger problem solution cycles.
So how do we pick the right problem to solve?
We start by picking a problem that's narrow and meaningful, then solve it.
10:39
And like we just learned, when we solve one problem, a new problem reveals itself.
Here comes the important part.
If we can solve that new problem with our core offer, we've got a winner.
This is because we solved this new problem in exchange for money.
That's it.
Don't overthink it.
Example, Imagine we help homeowners sell their homes.
10:57
This is a broad solution.
What about the steps before selling a home?
Owners want to know what their house is worth.
They want to know how to increase its value.
They need pictures.
They need it clean.
They need landscaping.
They need minor things fixed.
They need moving services.
They may need staging, etcetera.
These are all narrow problems.
11:13
Rate for lead magnets We pick one of the narrow problems and solve it for free, and although it helps, it makes their other problems seem more obvious.
They still have to sell their home, but now we've earned their trust, so we can charge to solve the remaining problems with our core offer and help them achieve their broader goal.
11:30
Action Step Pick the narrowly defined problem you want to solve, then make sure your core offer can solve the next problem that comes up.
Step 2 Figure out how to solve it.
There are three types of lead magnets and each offers a different type of solution. 1st, if your audience has a problem they don't know about, your lead magnet will make them aware of it.
11:48
Second, you could solve a recurring problem for a short period of time with a sample or trial of your core offer.
Third, you can give them a one step and a multistep process that solves a bigger problem.
All three solve one problem and reveal others.
So your three types are one reveal problems, 2 samples and trials.
12:06
Three one step of a multistep process.
Those are the three lead magnet types #1 reveal their problem.
Think diagnosis.
These lead magnets work great when they reveal problems that get worse the longer you wait.
Example you run a speed test that shows their website loads at 30% below the speed it should.
12:24
You draw a clear line between where they should be and how much money they lose by being below standards.
Example you do a posture analysis and show them what their posture should look like.
You draw a clear line between what their pain free life would look like if their posture were fixed and how you can help.
Example, You do a termite inspection that reveals what happens when bugs eat their home.
12:44
If they do have termites, you can get rid of them for a cheaper than the cost of, let's say, another home.
If they don't, they can pay you to prevent the termites from coming to begin with.
You can sell them either way.
Win, win.
Those are examples of ways you could reveal their problem.
Two samples and trials.
13:01
You give full but brief access to your core offer.
You can limit the number of uses, the time they have access or both.
This works great when your core offers a recurring solution to a recurring problem.
Example you hook them up to your faster server and show their website loading at lightning speed.
13:17
They get more customers from your faster load times.
If they want to keep it, they need to keep paying you.
Example you give a free adjustment for their bad posture and they experience relief.
To get permanent benefits they must buy more.
Example, food, cosmetics, medicine or any other consumables.
13:34
Consumables by their nature have limited uses and solve recurring problems with recurring use.
So single serving, fund sized, etcetera.
Samples are great lead magnets.
It's how Costco sells more food than other stores.
They give out samples pro tip be a drug dealer.
Many people make money selling drugs legally and illegally.
13:52
A free drug sample is a lead magnet.
They can afford to give a quote hit away because once people try it, they're hooked.
It's so good they come back for more.
This is why we don't dilute the value of our lead magnets or give away sucky fluff.
If anything, like a drug dealer, you'd want to give the strongest hit first.
14:09
It keeps them coming back for more.
Your lead magnet is your first hit.
The next one they have to pay for.
Be a legal drug dealer and you'll make money like one.
PS:.
Whatever you do, make sure it's legal.
Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book right now.
Something that took me way too long to learn when it came to learning in general was that if you consume a piece of content in multiple formats, it's stored in different parts of your brain, so you're more likely to recall it in different settings.
14:34
And so I started reading and listening to books at the same time, and it dramatically enhanced how quickly I could get through things and how much I recalled them.
And so if that's at all interesting to you, there's we've made versions of the book available on Amazon and there's there's obviously physical copies of the book there as well.
14:52
And if you're a video learner like I am, you can go to the site and you can concern the entire course that goes with this absolutely free.
Like you don't even have to opt in like all the courses, the videos and the downloads are available at acquisition.com.
You just click courses and you can see all the courses that we have available there and you can go through all of them if you want to.
15:12
They're absolutely free.
Three One step of a multi step process.
When your core offer has steps you can give one valuable step for free and the rest when they buy.
This works great when your core offer solves a more complex problem.
Example this book.
15:28
I hope you get to $1,000,000 per year in profit.
Then you'll have a new problem we can help you solve and scale from there.
Example you give away a free wood sealant for a garage door, but the ceiling process requires 3 different codes to protect from all weather conditions.
I do the first one free, explain how it only gives partial coverage, and offer the other two in a bundle example.
15:50
You give away free finance courses, guides, calculators, templates, etcetera.
They're so valuable, people really can do it all up by themselves.
But they also reveal the time, effort and sacrifice of doing it all.
So you offer financial services to solve all that action.
Step pick how you want to solve your narrowly defined problem.
16:08
Author note what we can learn from dressing rooms.
Try before you buy.
Years ago, you weren't allowed to try things on before you bought them.
Then one savvy business owner created a fitting room.
Their sales presumably skyrocketed, so much so that it's now a standard practice in all clothes stores.
16:25
Here's why the dressing room is so powerful.
It's all three types of lead magnets in one.
You get to try something on, like a trial.
It also reveals a problem, as once you try one thing on, you might find that you need something different than you intended.
And once you find a shirt you like, a good salesperson would say, do you want pants to go with it?
16:42
It becomes step one in a multi step process of creating an outfit.
So if you can, try and get a lead magnet that does all three reveal a problem, give them a taste of the solution and show it as a small piece of a total package.
Step 3.
Figure out how to deliver it Delivery mechanisms There are unlimited ways to solve problems, but my favorite lead magnets solve them with software, Information Services and physical products.
17:08
And each of those works great with the three types of lead magnets.
From Step 2, I'll show you what I've done to attract gym owners.
Using each lead magnet type software, you give them a tool.
If you have a spreadsheet, calculator or small software, your technology does a job for them.
17:23
Example, I give away a spreadsheet or dashboard that gives the gym owner all their relevant business stats, compares them to industry averages, and then gives them a rank 2 information.
You teach them something.
Courses, lessons, interviews with experts, keynote presentations, live events, mistakes and pitfalls, hacks and tips etcetera.
17:41
Anything they can learn from.
Example I give away a mini course for gyms on how to write an ad.
Three services you do work for free, adjust their back, perform a website audit, apply the first layer of garage sealant, transform their video into an ebook, etcetera.
17:58
Example, I run gym owners ads for free for 30 days. 4 physical products.
You give them something they can hold in their hands, a posture assessment chart, a supplement, a small bottle of garage door sealant, boxing gloves to get them into a boxing gym, etc.
18:15
Example, I sell a book for gym owners called Gym Launch Secrets with three different types of lead magnets and four ways to deliver them.
That's up to 12 lead magnets that solve a single narrow problem.
So many magnets, so little time.
I make as many versions of lead magnet as I can and rotate them.
18:30
This keeps the advertising fresh and low effort.
Plus, you see which ones work best.
Like my case study story at the beginning of the chapter, the results are often surprising and you won't know until you try action step as a thought exercise.
Think of a lead magnet and then a version of it for each delivery method.
You always can, I promise.
18:48
Then pick how to deliver your lead magnet.
Step four.
Test what to name it.
David Ogilvy said when you've written your headline, you spent $0.80 of your advertising dollar.
What that means is five times more people read your headline than any other part of your promotion.
They read it and make a snap decision to read further or not.
19:05
Like Ogilvy hints, leads have to notice your lead magnet before they consume it.
Like it or not, this means how we present it matters more than anything.
For example, improving the headline name and display of your lead magnet 2X3X or 10X your engagement.
It's that important.
Besides, if no one shows interest in your lead, no one will ever know how good it is.
19:23
You can't leave it to chance.
So listen up.
Here's what you do next, You test.
The three things you want to test are the headline, the images, and the subheadline, in that order.
The headline is the most important.
So if you only test one thing, test that.
For example, I had no idea what the title of this book.
19:39
So here's what I did to figure out which name would do the best.
I tested.
The results may surprise you as much as they surprised me.
Here's some of my headline tests, $100 million advertising versus $100 million promotion in round one.
Advertising beat promotion. 69 to 31.
Round two, advertising versus leads.
19:56
Leads beat advertising 58 to 42 Leads versus marketing.
Leads beat Marketing 54 to 46, and I finally settled on Leads image test real versus cartoon.
Real one Subheadlines How to Get More People to Want to Buy your Stuff versus How to Get Strangers to Want to Buy your stuff.
20:17
Strangers One round Two, How to Get More Strangers to Want to Buy your Stuff versus How to Get Strangers to Want to Buy your Stuff As minors.
It sounds the second one beat the first one is 71 to 29.
Crazy, right?
Round 3 How to Get as Many Leads As you don't well, please versus How to Get Strangers to Want to Buy Your Stuff Again, How to Get Strangers to Want to Buy Your Stuff wins Round four Get Strangers to Want to Buy Your Stuff versus How to Get Strangers to Want to Buy Your Stuff How to Get Strangers to Want to Buy Your Stuff 17030 Note two things with the sub headline tests How to get Strangers to Want to Buy Your Stuff Overwhelmingly beat Get Strangers to Want to Buy Your Stuff.
20:57
The only difference is 2 little words.
How to And it also beat How to get More Strangers to Want to Buy your Stuff with a single word removed.
More small changes can make big differences.
Two Since so many people asked, I figured I'd answer it here.
I didn't subtitle the book How to Get Strangers to Buy Your Stuff, because that's sales, not getting leads.
21:16
The point of this book is to get strangers to show interest, not to buy.
Yet a raised hand is where this book ends.
Sales will be a future book, $100 million sales.
But let's solve one problem at a time.
Action step test.
If people engage in droves, you've got a winner.
21:34
And if you have any following at all, you can run polls like these.
You don't need a lot of votes to get a directional idea.
If you can't do that, make a post on every platform and ask people to respond with a one or two and then count them up.
If you still can't even do that, then just message people and ask.
There's always a way, and this is one of the highest leverage things you can do with your time.
21:51
Make sure how you package it gets engagement and give yourself a big head start.
Bonus points if people respond to the poll and ask when they can get their hands on it, You've got a mega winner.
Step 5.
Make it easy for them to consume.
People prefer to do things that take less effort.
22:07
Duh.
So if we want more people to take us up on our lead magnet and consume it, we've got to make it easy.
You can see 2X3X even 4X plus increases in take rates and consumption simply by making it easier to consume one software.
You want to make it accessible on their phones, on a computer, and in multiple different formats.
22:27
This way they'll pick the one easiest for them.
Information people like to consume things in different ways.
Some people like watching, other people like reading, others like listening, etc.
Make your solution in as many different formats as you can.
Images, video, text, audio, etc.
22:43
Offer them all.
That's why this book comes in.
Every format people consume.
Services be available at more times, in more ways.
More times of day, more days of the week via video call, phone call in person, etc.
The easier you are to get a hold of, the more likely people will become engaged.
22:59
Leads to claim the free value for physical products?
Make it super simple to order and fast to get to them.
Make the product itself fast and easy to open.
Give simple directions on how to use the product.
Example Apple made its products so well they didn't even need directions.
23:15
And the packaging is so good most people keep the boxes.
Action step package your lead magnet in every way you can.
It dramatically increases how many engaged leads come your way, and more leads engaging with your lead magnet means more leads getting value from it.
This is huge fun fact.
23:31
My book $100 million Offers has a near perfect one quarter, one quarter, one quarter 1/4 split between ebooks, physical books, audio books, and videos which are free on acquisition.com.
Making the book available in multiple formats is the easiest way I know to get 2-3 to 4X the amount of leads for the same work.
23:49
If I only made it available in one format, I'd miss out on three to four times the people who wouldn't have read the book otherwise.
What a shame that would have been and what a waste.
Step 6.
Make it darn good.
Give away the secrets.
Sell the implementation.
The marketplace judges everything you have to offer, free or not, and you can never provide too much value.
24:09
But you can provide too little.
So you want your lead man to provide so much value people feel obligated to pay you.
The goal is to provide more value than the cost of your core offer before they've bought it.
Think about it this way.
If you're scared of giving away your secrets, imagine the alternative you give away.
24:25
Sucky fluff.
Then people who might have become customers think this person sucks.
They only give away sucky fluff.
Then they buy from someone else.
So sad.
Not only that, they tell other folks who might have bought from you not to.
It's a vicious cycle.
You don't want to ride.
But remember, people buy stuff based on how much value they think they'll get after they buy it.
24:45
And the easiest way to get them to think they'll get tons of value after they buy it is drummore please to provide value before they buy it.
Imagine a company scaled from 1,000,000 to 10 million just by consuming my free content.
The chance to partner with acquisition.com is huge because I paid for my share before you even started Action step. 99% of people aren't going to buy, but they will create or destroy your reputation based on the value of your free stuff.
25:10
So make your league magnets as good as your paid stuff.
Your reputation depends on it.
Provide value.
Stack the deck.
Read the rewards.
Step 7 Make it easy for them to tell you they want more.
Once leads consume the lead magnet, some of them will be ready to buy or learn more about your offer.
25:27
This is the time to give a call to action.
A call to action.
CTA tells the audience what to do next.
But there's a little more to it than that, at least if you want your advertising to work.
A good CTA has two things.
One, what to do 2 reasons to do it right now.
25:43
What to do Cta's tell the audience to call the number, click the button, give the information, book the call, etc.
There are way too many to list.
Just know Cta's tell the audience how to become engaged leads.
Good Cta's have clear, simple and direct language.
Not don't delay, but instead call.
25:59
Now read the next paragraph to learn more.
See what I did there Reasons to do it right now if you give people a reason to take action, more people will do it.
But a couple things to keep in mind.
First, good reasons work better than bad reasons.
And 2nd any reason, even bad ones tend to work better than no reason at all.
26:17
So to get more people to take action, I include as many effective reasons as I can.
Here are my favorite reasons to act now.
Scarcity.
Scarcity is when there's a limited amount of something, especially when there is a small supply compared to demand.
When something is scarce, like your lead magnet or offer, people also tend to want it more, and This is why they're more likely to act right now.
26:38
The fewer you have, the more valuable people think it is.
But there's a catch.
The fewer you have, the fewer engaged leads you can get before running out.
So the best strategy I know for scarcity is reality.
Let me explain If you sold 1000 times the customers tomorrow, could you handle it?
26:54
If not, you have some limit on how much you can sell.
Maybe you're limited by customer service, onboarding, inventory, time slots per week, etcetera.
Don't keep it a secret.
Advertise it.
This gives you ethical scarcity.
If you can't handle more than five new customers per week, say so, Draw attention to the natural scarce in your business.
27:14
If you have limitations, you may as well use them to make you money.
Example.
The most convenient class times.
Fill up fast.
Call now to get the one you want.
Example, I can only handle five people per week, so if you want it solved, soon do XYZ.
Example.
27:30
We only printed one batch of shirts and we'll never reprint this design.
Get one so you don't regret missing out forever.
Urgency.
You can have unlimited units to sell, but let's say you stop selling them in an hour on purpose.
I bet more people than normal will buy your thing in that hour.
27:46
This is urgency in action.
Urgency is when people act faster because they have a short amount of time, and the less time people have, the faster, more urgent they tend to act.
So if you make the time they can act on your CTA shorter, you can get more of them to act on it faster.
You can also use the same urgency with discounts or bonuses that go away after X minutes or hours, after which this offer will never be available again.
28:09
Example, our July 4th promotion ends Monday at midnight, so if you want it, take action now.
Our Black Friday promotion ends at midnight.
They're only four hours left.
Get it?
While the getting's good through Friday, I'll also threw in a free hat to anyone who buys more than three books.
So if you want to look slick in an acquisition.com at Buy Now Pro, tip the urgency tactic I use most.
28:31
I put time limits on bonuses.
This way I don't need to change my pricing or products all the time, I can just change the bonus.
I like to make a handful of valuable bonuses and rotate them each week, and if they don't take action by the end of the week, they'll actually miss out on the bonus.
The best part is, it's an easy way to make the CTA more effective without capping your sales.
28:51
See, Fraternity party Planner.
My favorite make up a reason.
Fraternities don't need a reason to party, but they sure make up some doozies.
John got his wisdom teeth out.
Kegger, Margarita, Monday, Toca Tuesdays, Thursday, Thursdays, etcetera.
Your reason doesn't even have to make sense and it will still get more people to act.
29:10
In fact, Harvard ran an experiment showing that people were more likely to let someone cut in line if they only gave a reason.
The number of people that let other people cut increased if the reason made sense, like scarcity or urgency.
But any reason still works better than no reason.
So I always try and include one.
29:26
Think the stuff you have to say after the word because examples, because mom knows best.
Because your country needs you.
Because it's my birthday and I want you to celebrate with me.
Action step.
Give a clear, simple action oriented CTA.
Then give them a reason why using scarcity, urgency and any other reasons you can think of.
29:45
And do it often.
Don't be clever.
Be clear, even if your lead man it costs money to deliver, it should still lower your cost to get a new customer.
This is because more engaged leads means more chances to get customers and the extra customers more than cover your costs.
That's the point.
30:01
Let's say you make $10,000 in profit on your core offer, and it costs you $1000 in advertising to get someone on a call for it.
If you close one out of three people, it costs you $3000 in advertising to get a customer.
Since we have $10,000 in profit to work with, that's fine.
30:18
But we're savvy.
We can do better, so let's do better.
Imagine you advertise a free league mannet instead of your core offer.
Your lead mannet cost you $25 to deliver, and because it's free to them, more will engage.
The extra engagement means it only costs $75.00 in advertising to get someone on a call.
30:36
All in, that's $100 per call, $75 plus $25.
By delivering value before they buy, you get 10 times more engaged leads for the same cost.
Note this happens all the time when you nail the lead magnet.
Now let's say one out of 10 folks who get the lead magnet buys your core offer.
30:53
This means your new cost to require customer is $1000 because it's 10 people times 100 bucks.
We just cut our cost to get a customer by three X.
So instead of spending $3000 to get a new customer by using a lead magnet, we spend only 1000.
Given we make $10,000, it's a 12:50 return.
31:12
So if we keep our advertising budget the same and use a lead magnet, we triple our business.
Remember, the goal is to print money, not just make our fair share.
This is where experienced business owners beat newbies.
With a $25 budget to deliver your lead magnet, you can provide far more value than a $0.00 budget.
31:28
Crazy.
I know.
You track more customers because your lead magnet is more valuable than other people's, oftentimes by a lot.
This translates into more strangers becoming engaged leads.
It also translates into more sales because you provide more value in advanced.
Win Win Win Action Steps Step zero If you're struggling to get leads, make an amazing lead magnet.
31:49
Step one Figure out the problem you want to solve for the right customer.
Step 2 Figure out how you want to deliver it.
Step 3 Figure out how to deliver it.
Step 4 Make the name interesting and clear.
Step 5 Make it easy to consume.
Step 6 Make sure it's darn good.
Step 7 Tell them what to do next.
32:05
Why it's a good idea.
Do it clearly and do it often.
Section 2 Conclusion.
My goal with this book is to demystify the lead getting process.
In the first chapter, we covered why leads alone aren't enough.
You need engaged leads.
In the second chapter, we covered how to get leads to engage a valuable lead magnet or offer.
32:22
And a good lead magnet does 4 things.
One, it engages ideal customers when they see it. 2 gets more people to engage than your car for a loan.
Three is valuable enough they consume it.
Four makes the right people more likely to buy.
So more people show interest in our stuff, we make more money from them, and we deliver more value than we ever have all at the same time.
32:44
Next up, we've armed ourselves with the powerful lead magnet.
Now I'll show you the four ways we can advertise it.
In other words, now that we have the stuff, we gotta tell people about it, Let's get some leads.

In the next episode, we're going to have a 29 minute banger on getting leads, the Core 4, and warm outreach.
33:24
If you don't have customers and you are starting a business, you do not want to miss this one.
I probably spent more time on these two chapters than any chapters in the entire book because I knew that these two chapters would apply to the widest amount of the people who listen to my content.
So if there's ever a chapter or two that you listen, it's this next episode that's coming up.
33:43
And it'll show you how to get your first five clients, which I think most of you, if you don't have a business, will need, or your next 5 clients if you have one.
This has been $100 million.

I'm super excited.
About the episode today.
This is a special.
Edition $100 million Leads Audio Book Podcast collab Between myself and myself, I'm going to be covering getting leads in general and warm outreach.
This is how you get your first five customers.
0:16
This is how I got my first five customers.
If you want to start a business, you have a business and you're you're doing less than 500. 1000 A Year Like This Chapter I Wrote for You, Section 3.
Get Leads.
The core 4 Advertising methods We get engaged leads by letting know about our stuff.
0:36
And there are two types of people we let know people who know us and people who don't.
And there are two paths to letting them know about it, 1:00 to 1:00 and 1:00 to many.
Those combined into the four basic ways one person can let another person know about anything.
Let's break down how we can use those four ways to get us leads.
0:52
Two types of audiences, warm and cold.
Warm audiences are people who gave you permission to contact them.
Think people who know you a KA Friends, family, followers, current customers, previous customers, contacts, etcetera.
Cold audiences are people who have not given you permission to contact them.
1:07
Think strangers, AKA other people's audiences, buying contact lists, making contact lists, paying platform for access, etcetera.
The difference matters because it changes how we advertise to them.
Two ways to communicate 1:00 to 1:00, private, one to many.
Public We can contact people one to one or one to many.
1:27
Another way of thinking about this is private or public communication.
Private communication is when only one person gets a message at a time.
Think phone call or e-mail.
If you announce something publicly, many people get it at the same time.
Think social media posts or billboards or podcasts.
1:43
Now automation can make this seem confusing.
Don't let it.
Automation just means some of the work is done by machines.
The nature of the communication stays the same.
E-mail for instance is 1 to 1.
Emailing a 10,000 person list once is more like 1 to one really fast by a machine.
2:00
Automation, which we cover later is one of the many ways we can get leads on steroids like audiences.
The difference between public and private communication matters because they change how we advertise.
Section 3 Outline get leads.
Combining warm and cold audiences with one to one and one to many leads us to the only four ways we can let anyone know about anything.
2:18
The Core 4I Combine them below for you, one to one to a warm audience, warm outreach.
One to many to a warm audience posting content. 1:00 to 1:00 to a cold audience, cold outreach 1 to many to a cold audience paid ads.
These are the only four things you can do to let other people know about the stuff you sell, and each method takes us one step close to the land of overflowing leads.
2:40
I refer to the Core 4 throughout the rest of the book, so get to know them.
In fact, make them part of yourself.
Once you do, you will have your own get out of jail free card to carry around forever.
It will give you as many chances to succeed at business as you could ever want for the rest of your life.
Or at least it has for me.
2:56
So if you aren't getting as many leads as you want, you're not doing the Core four with enough skill or with enough volume.
We cover all the stuff in lots of detail, how they work, how to do them, when to do them, and show how to measure your progress along the way.
This simplifies the overly confusing world of advertising into four core actions.
3:12
Either do them and get as many leads as you darn well please, or get crushed by those who do free gift bonus training the Core 4 framework.
I did a live training where I explained the 50 plus iterations that created this simple two by two box.

May 2013.
Starting out for the third time that day, I pulled out my phone and checked my bank account $51,128.13.
I let out a small sigh.
Relief.
It's amazing how years of work and saving can fit into such a tiny screen.
Feeling good for the moment, I switched over to social media to get some more dopamine.
4:09
Friends from college were applying to Business School.
Acceptance letters filled my news feed.
I too started the Business School application process.
I had a choice.
I could either quit my job and go to Business School, or I could quit my job and start a business.
The application stared back at me.
How will Harvard MB A help your short and long term goals?
4:27
That question changed my life.
I spent three days trying to answer it.
At the end of the third day, I saw the truth.
It wouldn't. 150,000 in loans in two years without income wouldn't help me start a business.
At least not as much as starting a business and taking two years to figure it out.
I could make the same amount by the time I graduate and skip the debt.
4:44
Or at least that's what I told myself.
So I quit my job and took the steps to start my business.
I set up Impetus Group LLC.
Check.
I set up a business banking account.
Check.
I set up a merchant account to process payments.
Check.
There still wasn't any money coming in, but at least I felt legit.
5:00
Impetus Group LLC say it out loud, which you guys can now already hear.
The first person I told about my new business said Impotence.
God, I suck.
No wonder the name was available.
I immediately changed it to the Free Training Project name.
That doesn't suck.
Check.
5:15
I was in business, but I had a problem.
I didn't know anything about advertising or sales, but I did know I needed clients.
So I just asked around where I could.
I called, I texted, and I sent Facebook messages to a bunch of people I knew.
Hey, do you know anyone who's trying to get in shape?
I'm training people for free for 12 weeks.
5:31
On top of that, I'll make them a custom nutrition and grocery list.
All they have to do is donate to a charity their choice and let me use their testimonial.
Only six people said yes. 62 high school friends, one college friend, and three people they referred.
I emailed everyone fitness plans and we got to work.
We texted during the week to keep taps on progress.
5:47
Thankfully they were all friends of mine so they gave it their all.
They encouraged me more than anyone in the beginning.
A decade later I still have their before and after pictures and this is where the decision to skip Business School started to come back to haunt me.
A few months into this I was less sure of myself.
My pile of money didn't look as big without new money coming in every month and it started turning into a real problem.
6:05
So after 12 weeks of the pay a charity period, I asked him to pay me instead.
I was the charity now.
Ha.
I worried they'd be upset to pay me instead, but they didn't seem to mind.
Once they got results, I asked them to send their friends over.
To my surprise, I got another five or six clients from their referrals.
6:21
I asked the referrals to pay me directly.
Again, none of them minded.
That little business made about $4000 per month and replaced the income from my first job.
It gave me enough money to live on and some my savings started to grow again.
Sigh of relief.
If this business sounded straightforward, it's because it was.
6:37
I emailed clients their plans and they texted me questions they had along the way.
That's about it.
So if you're starting, you don't need a lot.
All you need is a tax Ida bank account, a way to take payments, and a way to communicate with people.
But that last part, a way to communicate with people, is the most important part, It's how you get leads.
6:53
So even though I had no idea I was doing more reach outs, one of the Core 4, it's how I got my first leads.
I still get leads this way, just with bigger numbers.
And I'll show you how you can too, how warm reach outs work.
Warm reach outs are when you make one to one contact with your warm audience, AKA the people who know you.
7:11
It's the cheapest and easiest way to find people interested in the stuff you sell.
It's super effective and most businesses don't do it.
Don't be like most businesses.
Also, you do have a warm audience, even if you don't know it.
Everybody knows somebody, so your personal contacts are the easiest place to start.
7:29
Warm reach outs usually come in the form of calls, texts, emails, direct messages, voicemails, etcetera.
And like we learned in Section 2, you advertise one of two things.
You let them know about your lead man.
It's something free and valuable.
Or you let them know about your core offer, the main thing you sell.
When you start doing warm reach outs, you don't get many engaged leads for your time.
7:47
You do everything on your own and make each message personal.
But for that reason it is reliable.
As certain as the sunsets and rises, it works.
Note reaching out to your warm audience works where they have 100 contacts or a million contacts.
So as your business grows you will use automation and employees to make it more efficient.
8:05
The system starts small with you, but the scale all the way up.
I detail how to scale these systems to larger audiences in Section 4.
How to do Warm Reach Outs in 10 steps Warm reach outs are a fantastic way to get your first five clients for any new product or service.
Advanced folks think reengagements and new product lines.
8:23
Here's how to do it.
Step one, get your list.
Step two, Pick a platform.
Step 3.
Personalize your message.
Step 4.
Reach out.
Step 5.
Warm them up.
Step 6.
Invite their friends.
Step 7.
Make them the easiest offer in the world.
Step eight.
Start at the top.
Step nine.
Start charging.
8:39
Step 10.
Keep your list warm.
All right, let's rock'n'roll.
Step one.
But I don't have any leads.
Everyone has a list.
You know other humans.
Let me prove it to you.
Grab your phone.
Inside you have contacts.
Each contact has subscribed to communication from you.
They have given you the means and permission to contact them.
8:57
Pull up all the e-mail accounts you've ever used over the years.
Pull your contacts and address list from each.
Bingo.
Look at all them leads.
Now go to your social media profiles.
See your followers, subscribers, friends, connections or whatever the kids call them these days.
Eureka, you got more leads.
9:13
Add up all your contacts from all the platforms.
Seriously, figure out the number between your phone, e-mail, social media and other platforms.
You will have more than enough contacts to get started.
For many of you, this will be your first thousand leads.
Would you look at that?
I don't have any leads.
9:30
Just found some, and if you're terrified you'll have to talk to people, relax.
You'll like what I'm going to show you next Step 2, but I don't know where to start.
Pick a platform.
Pick the platform you have the most contacts on.
Phone, e-mail, social media, mail, carrier pigeon, etcetera.
9:45
It doesn't matter.
Just pick the one with the most contacts.
You'll hit them all eventually anyways.
Step 3.
But what do I say?
Personalize your greeting.
Use something you know about the contact as your actual reason to reach out.
If you don't have much personal info, you can check their social media profiles, etcetera to learn a bit about them First.
10:03
Don't be a weirdo.
Pay your social dues.
Remember, you haven't asked for anything, you're just checking in and providing value.
So relax.
Example saw you just had a baby.
Congrats.
How's the baby doing?
How are you?
Step 4.
Now what?
Reach out to 100 people every day to get what you want.
10:22
You have to deserve what you want.
Charlie Munger.
Now.
Reach out to 100 of them per day with your personalized messages.
You'll call, text, e-mail, message, send, a postcard, etcetera, and you will reach out to them up to three times, Once per day for three days or until they respond, whichever comes first.
10:39
Once per week with physical mail, pro tip, rip off the bandaid.
The first reach out is always the hardest and takes the longest.
Your second reach out will take minutes.
Your third seconds be okay with sucking.
It's new.
This is how we learn when thinking about starting new things.
I remember this Chinese proverb.
10:55
Everything must be hard before it can be easy.
Step five.
What do I say when they respond?
Act like a human.
Now we can break the ice without sounding icky.
Reply using the A/C A framework A.
Acknowledge what they said.
Restated in your own words.
This shows active listening.
11:11
Example.
Two kids and you're an accountant.
Dot dot dot C Compliment them on whatever they just told you.
Tied to a positive character trait if you can Example wow Superman, so hard working managing a full time career and two kids dot dot, dot A.
11:27
Ask another question.
Lead the conversation to whatever direction you want.
In this case a topic closer to your offer.
Examples.
If I were selling therapy or life Coaching, do you get time for yourself?
If I were selling fitness or weight loss, do you have time to get your workouts in?
If I were selling cleaning services, do you have anyone who helps you keep the house tidy?
11:45
The A/C A framework is great because it helps you talk to anyone.
It just so happens it's also useful for letting people know about your stuff.
This means you can learn about the person and guide the conversation towards your offer.
People love talking about themselves, so let them.
They also love to be complimented, so do that too.
12:00
And if people feel good when talking to you the like and trust you more, you want people to like and trust you more.
Besides, it's solid practice to find the good in everyone anyway.
Speaking of practice, this will take practice, and that's okay pro.
Tip on e-mail.
You'll be more upfront.
On e-mail, you will have a personalized opener to show you actually took the time to research them in some way.
12:20
Think two to three sentences.
Then you'll transition directly to your offer.
League men, which we'll talk about next.
You sort of do it all at once with e-mail or voicemails.
Step 6 How do I know if they're interested?
Make them an offer.
Get through a quote, normal amount of conversation.
12:36
Think 3 to 4 exchanges if on the phone or messaging, and three to four minutes if in person.
Then you'll make them an offer to see if they're interested.
When I make an offer from scratch, I refer to the value equation.
If you're wondering what's the value equation, it was the core concept of my first book. $100 million offers value as I define it, has four elements, 1.
12:54
Dream, outcome, what the person wants to happen the way they want it to happen.
State the best possible results your product can get.
Big bonus points if those results come from people like the one you're talking to.
Two perceive likelihood of achievement how likely they think it is for them to achieve their goal.
13:10
Include reviews, results, awards, endorsement certifications, and other forms of third party validation.
Also, guarantees are huge.
Three time delay, how long they believe it'll take to get the results after they buy.
Describe how fast people start getting results and how often they get results when they start and how long it takes to get the best possible results. 4 Effort and sacrifice.
13:35
The bad stuff they'll have to endure and the good stuff they'll have to give up in their struggle to get the result.
Show them the good stuff they can keep doing or get to do and still get results.
And show them the bad stuff they can get rid of or avoid doing and still get the results.
The goal is to maximize the first two and minimize the 2nd 2:00.
13:52
So all you have to do is now show someone you have exactly what they want.
They're guaranteed to get it insanely fast without lifting a finger or giving up anything they love.
No biggie, right?
Obviously that's ideal.
We got to get as close to that without lying or exaggerating, so let's just do it with a real life offer.
14:08
Dot dot dot.
By the way, do you know anybody who is described their struggle looking to dream outcome in time delay?
I'm taking on five case studies for free because that's all I can handle.
I just want to get some testimonials for my product or service.
I help them dream outcome without effort and sacrifice.
14:26
It works.
I even guarantee people dream outcome or I work with them until they do.
I just had a girl named XXX work with me.
Dream outcome.
Even though she described the same struggle that contact has, I also had a guy dream outcome and it was his first time.
14:43
I just like more testimony to show it works across different scenarios.
Does anyone you like come to mind?
Pause if on the phone if they say no, say haha.
Well does anyone you hate come to mind Ha.
This breaks any awkwardness.
Protip implied perceived likelihood of achievement.
15:02
You'll notice besides the guarantee, there's no slot for a perceived likelihood of achievement.
But how we explain the testimonials fulfills that need.
After all, we're not going to say, hey, I can obviously help you because I've helped someone exactly like you.
But we imply that by selecting the testimonial that's as close to their situation as possible, and the longer you are in business, the more perfect fit testimonials you'll have to show.
15:23
So the easier it'll be to show testimonials that perfectly match the person you're speaking with.
Then, once you can show one perfect testimonial, the only thing better is a buttload of them.
There's an important feature here.
We're not asking them to buy anything, we're asking if they know anyone.
And of the people who say yes, most say they are interested.
15:42
This entire thing is engineered to boost their perceived likelihood of achievement.
It's why we show struggles and results from people like them who have struggle like theirs.
But we let them connect the dots.
Since you didn't ask them to buy anything, you don't come off as pushy.
15:57
Some people will show interest in your stuff, some will refer you to those who might, some will do both.
In all three outcomes, you win and you win without pushing anything on anyone.
If you have even less time or space to deliver it, just use the value elements back-to-back.
I help ideal customer get dream outcome in time period without effort and sacrifice and increase perceived likelihood of achievement.
16:21
Look at the pro tip below.
Note these work well for emails, text direct messages, calls and in person.
Touch points in an elevator Just fill in the blanks.
Pro Tip 11 Ways to Increase Perceived Likelihood of Achievement Here's how you Increase the Perceived Likelihood of achievement so more people take you up on your offer.
16:39
Include one or more of the following one showing proof we have done what they want.
Our own story 2.
Showing proof of people just like them getting what they want.
Think Testimonials 3.
The sheer volume of happy reviews we've received.
16:56
Think lots of five stars.
And if you don't have reviews yet, even the number of people you've helped works. 4 certifications, degrees, third party accreditations that were legit, 5 numbers, stats, research that support the outcome you want them to believe 6 Experts vouching for us 7 Some new unique characteristic they haven't failed with before so they think it might work this time. 8 Celebrities who have endorsed us.
17:25
They trusted them.
So should I. 9.
Guaranteeing they'll achieve it.
So we put some of our own skin in the game too. 10 How will you describe them or the current pain they're experiencing?
The more specific the better.
They should think he really gets me.
17:40
They must know how to help.
Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book chapter that you're listening to right now, $100 million leads I took a long time putting together for you.
And so my only ask is that you just take a quick second and leave a review for the book on Amazon.
17:56
It's the number one way that people.
Find books and this is a way of getting more people into our world.
And so our mission, acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone.
And I need your help.
And so if you could do that, just that one, one small action.
And it has a trade for the two years that I took putting this book together for you.
18:14
It would mean the world to me.
So thank you. 11 if possible.
Demonstrate the outcome live or show a recording of it happening.
Example, advertising agency plays a recording of a call that a gym owner has to make to a lead on a sales call.
18:31
Could you handle making a call like this to a lead if we got them for you?
It demonstrates the outcome of the advertising services.
People don't want leads, they want customers, they just don't know a better way to ask for them.
Step 7 How do I get them to say yes?
Make it easy for them to say yes and make it free.
18:49
After people show interest, make your offer easy to say yes to.
I like to start with the easiest offer enhancer in the world, free, and don't try to look advanced if you're not.
People aren't dumb.
Just be honest and keep it simple.
Since I'm only taking on five people, I can give you all the attention you need to get brag worthy results and I'll give it to you all for free so long as you promise to one, use it.
19:09
Two, give me feedback and three, leave a killer review if you think it deserves one.
Does that sound fair?
This sets reasonable expectations upfront and boom.
Now you're just helping people for free winning pro tip stack yeses to build early momentum.
Early on I felt terrified to ask for money.
19:25
So if you recall from the story above, I told people I would work them for free as long as they donated to charity of their choice.
I still got them invested in their results, but asking them for a feel good tax write off felt like a much safer way to do it.
By the way, this was the first thing I ever sold.
Looking back, I wanted easy low pressure yeses under my belt and those early yeses built my first business and they can build your business too.
19:47
My recommendation?
When you launch a new product or service, make the first five free.
The exact number matters less than knowing why you benefit from it.
Here's why.
One, you get the reps in and become comfortable with making offers to people.
It'll calm your nerves knowing you're just helping for free for now, Winky Face two, you probably suck.
20:07
For now.
People are far more forgiving when you haven't charged them anything. 3 because you probably suck.
You need to learn how to suck less.
You suck less by doing more, so it's better to have a few Guinea pigs to get the kinks out.
You learn a ton from the people you help for free.
I promise, even though it may not feel like it, now you're getting the better end of the deal.
20:25
Four If people get value, especially for free, they're far more likely to a leave positive reviews and testimonials B give you feedback.
C send their friends and family.
And if that's not awesome enough, free customers can make you money in three other ways.
One, they convert into paying customers.
20:41
Two, they send you paying customers via referrals.
Three, their testimonials bring in paying customers.
So no matter what you win.
Pro tip apply the hinge method to referrals.
If you ask for a referral, get a three-way introduction.
My favorite way to do this in person is to grab the customer's phone, take a picture of the two of us, then text that picture to the referral and your own number.
21:04
If I'm virtual, screenshot a video call and do the same thing.
If you can't do that, then at least get a three-way conversation with the customer making the referral initiating it.
What if they say no?
Often the most expensive part of what you sell isn't the price, it's the hidden costs.
21:21
Hidden costs are the time, effort, and sacrifice it takes to get results from the thing you sell.
In other words, the bottom part of the value equation.
If you struggle to give away your stuff for free, it means either people don't want it, dream outcome they don't believe you perceive likelihood of achievement, or the hidden cost, time, effort, sacrifice are too high.
21:39
In short, your free stuff is too expensive.
So figure out the hidden costs.
Once you do, you unlock even more value that you'll eventually be able to charge for.
To build your understanding of hidden costs, ask.
So when someone says no, ask why.
What would I have to do to make it worth it for you to continue?
21:56
Their answers give you a chance to solve their problem, and if you solve that problem, they'll probably buy from you.
And even if they don't buy from you, they'll give you the ammo to get the next person to.
And remember, failure is a requisite for success.
It's part of the process.
So rack up failures as fast as you can.
22:12
Get them out of the way to start paying down your no tax.
If you get thousands of Nos, you will get your yeses.
I promise.
I always tell myself, yeses give me opportunity.
Nos give me feedback.
Either way I win.
Author note Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham Before Warren Buffett became the greatest investor of our time, he offered to work for his hero, Ben Graham, for free.
22:33
Want to know Graham's response?
You're overpriced.
Graham knew what was up.
The most expensive thing about hiring Buffett wasn't a paycheck, but the time to train him.
Graham would actually be working for Buffett, and in the same way your early customers are working for you.
They're training you for free, and you want to minimize that cost to them.
22:51
Know your hidden costs.
PS Buffett still managed to get Graham to take his free offer.
The rest is history.
Pro tip Learning or earning.
If anyone tells you not to quote undervalue yourself by giving away your services for free in the beginning, tell them to hush.
Sure, you're a special snowflake, but the stuff you sell isn't.
23:08
It isn't valuable yet.
You barely started.
The objective right now is to learn not to earn.
We'll get to the earning once we've learned more, but we must crawl before we run.
Don't get the objective mixed.
The earning will come, I promise.
Step 8.
What do I do once I've reached out to everyone?
23:25
Start back at the top.
After reaching out to all the leads on one platform, switch the platform you have the second most leads on.
After you reach out to those leads, go to the platform you have the third most leads on.
And so forth.
Let's say you follow this to the tee, because being poor sucks more than helping people for free.
If between all platforms you have 1000 leads, that gives you 10 solid days of work.
23:43
A month of work, including follow-ups.
By this point, I promise five or more people have accepted your free offer and some will have converted into paying customers.
If you did a good job, they'll send their friends and they'll become paying customers too.
So let's make our first dollar step 9.
24:00
But I can't work for free forever.
Start charging.
This is important.
This is your litmus test to know when you're good enough to charge.
Once people start referring, start charging.
When that happens, swap out free in the script above to 80% off for the next 5, then 60% off for the next 5, then 40% off for the next 5, and so forth.
24:22
The I increase my prices.
Every five rule also adds urgency because prices actually go up.
And if you're curious, you don't have to stop raising your price.
Feel free to keep raising it by 20% every five until you find your sweet spot.
It's your business.
You can do what you want.
Charge more as you get more experienced, a nice reward pro tip.
24:40
Get more cash upfront and more yeses.
Prepay plus guarantee Offering A guarantee gets more people to buy because it reverses risk.
Here's a nice twist on a guarantee that'll get you more yeses and more cash.
You can offer a guarantee only to people who pay upfront.
24:56
Reason why?
People who invest upfront are more committed and as a result we're able to guarantee their outcomes.
So if you'd like our guarantee, you can prepay for our service.
Another version of wording I got from my good friend Doctor Cashy.
After the person agrees to buy you say would you rather pay less today or get all your money back?
25:12
Paying less today equals a payment plan, so less money down.
Get all your money back equals prepayment and get a guarantee that you get the result you want.
Example pay less equals 2000 a month for three months, which is $6000 with no guarantee.
Or get all your money back equals $6000 upfront with a guarantee.
25:33
Presented this way, the majority of people take the upfront cash option with the guarantee.
So if you plan on offering one anyways, you might as well weaponize it to incentivize people to pay more upfront.
Step 10 What do I do from here?
Keep your list warm.
Give regular value to your list through e-mail, social media, etcetera to keep it warm.
25:51
A warm list stays prime for your warm reach out in the future.
We cover exactly how to give that value in the next chapter.
Once you've given value for a while or see who wants value, probe your list with Dean Jackson's timeless 9 word e-mail template.
Are you still looking to forward desire?
26:06
No images, no frills, no lengths, Just a question, nothing else.
This message is money for getting leads to engage and it's among the first things I do when I invest in a new business.
Here are a few examples.
Are you looking to dot dot dot?
Buy your dream home dot dot dot get more sales leads dot dot dot tone up your arm dot dot dot, open an online store dot dot dot start a YouTube channel.
26:27
You get the idea.
Swipe and deploy.
You make the ask to see who replies aka engage leads and these replies should be your top priority for warm reach outs.
I'll end step 10 here because I break down the give ask process in the next chapter.
The main point is that a warm list is a huge asset because it's a consistent and growing source of engaged leads.
26:48
If you treat them well, your audience will feed you forever.
Advertising Checklist Summary Now let's look at this in 10 lines because we took 10 pages to get here.
Warm reach outs daily checklist.
Who yourself What Your first five for free?
Where?
Phone, e-mail, physical mail, SMS, etcetera.
27:04
To whom?
Your contacts when first four hours of your day, Why you want to get customers or introductions?
How personalized messages using a CA.
How much?
100 attempts per day.
How many fall up two to three more times after the first.
27:20
How long until you get customers benchmarks.
How well am I doing?
Warm reach out should get you about one in five contacts to engage.
So 100 warm reach outs should get you about 20 replies.
Of the 20 reply, another one in five ish will take you up on your free offer.
27:36
So four people Of the four people who take your free offer now, you should be able to convert 1 into some sort of paid offer later.
Hooray money.
This framework allows you to predict how many customers you get per 100 warm reach outs.
In the example you would get one customer per 100 warm reach outs.
27:53
These numbers vary best in the value of your offer and how much they trust you.
But no matter what, with enough volume you will get a customer and the more you do it, the better your numbers will get.
It just takes effort.
You'll also learn a lot about what engages your audience, what they value, and how to make offers to them.
28:09
This knowledge can make you millions.
You get to learn while you earn score.
This process alone can take you to 100,000 per year with nothing else wild.
I know.
Here's the money math.
This assumes 1% of your list buys a $400.00 offer using only warm reach outs. 500 reach outs per week equals 5 customers per week. $400.00 product equals 5 customers per week.
28:31
Times $400 each equals $2000 per week. $2000 per week times 52 weeks equals $104,000.
Bingo.
Which as of this writing is still two times the median household income in the US.
Not bad.
Pro tip.
Join communities to learn even faster.
28:46
Join communities of people doing the same advertising method as you.
They're great for peer support and UpToDate tricks and tips.
Also, don't do anything sketchy.
There are lots of people who pride themselves on pushing the legal envelope.
Don't be that person.
It always comes back to bite you.
Do it the right way and you'll feed yourself for the long term.
29:02
You can get good enough at almost anything in 20 hours of focused effort.
The problem is most people spend years delaying the first hour.
You learn more in the first 10 days of doing 100 reach outs than you did from everything you've ever read or watched.
Get that learning done as fast as you can.
Remember we want to get rich, not just get by.
What's next.
29:18
Warm reach outs have two limitations.
The 1st is time when you're starting out.
Getting new customers should take the majority of your time.
Think 4 hours per day minimum.
It should be the first thing you do when you get up and you shouldn't stop until you achieve your goal.
Embrace the work.
It will be part of the story you tell.
One day it has been for me.
29:35
The 2nd limiter is the number of people who know you.
You'll eventually run out.
Don't worry though, we can get more.
A lot more.
Now we add the second of the core for advertising activities, posting free content, free gift, bonus training, warm reach outs.
If you like the stuff, I go deeper in a no holds barred breakdown of the many different strategies you can use within warm reach outs to get your first or zillion the customer.
29:57
If that sounds cool, go to acquisition.com/training/leads.
And if you needed another reason it's free, I hope you use it to get as many leads as you need.
I hope you enjoyed that short episode and maybe you're going to listen to it a couple more times if you are going to go implement that what I hope, which I hope you do.
30:13
Also, just to say it would.
Mean the world to me if you left the book a review.
On Amazon, so if you do choose to grab a copy of it.
Whether it's the Kindle version so you can read it while you're listening.
I just want you to win.
But it would help me help other people if you left it a review.
And next we're going to have episode 4, which is going to be 3 chapters.
30:31
One about posting content, the 2nd about monetizing content, and the third is going to be a surprise chapter that you will just want to hear.
You won't.
You won't be able to believe it until you hear it.
But it's a banger, it's a 47 minute hunk and it is basically the cornerstone of how we built Mosey Media, which is all the media and the content.
30:48
With that, we push out across all the platforms and how we get 150 million impressions a month.
Foe free, that's the whole framework.
You're going to not want to miss it.
Enjoy.

On today's 100 million Our Leads Collab podcast, I've got post free content, the cornerstone of how we built all of the free personal branding stuff that we do across LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, this podcast itself, YouTube, and my e-mail list.
0:18
All of those come from the core concepts that I explained in the next 47 minutes.
This one is a heater.
This is how we built a 5 million person audience in 24 months on a budget, only working or only recording two days per month and doing our real job. acquisition.com In the meantime, you're not going to want to miss this one, so enjoy this post.

Free content Part One How to Build an Audience to Get Engaged Leads No one's Ever complained about Getting Too much value January 2020 Did you ever hear about Kylie Jenner?
Late last No.
Why?
I replied She's now the youngest female self-made billionaire.
0:55
Wait, what?
Yeah, she's 20.
Forbes just put her on the cover.
I was 10 years older than her and not a billionaire.
Why do I suck so much?
How could she make so much more than me?
I thought I was pretty good at business.
We took him 13 million in personal income the year before, but I was clearly missing something and I felt horrible about it.
1:13
My ego protected me well.
Kris Jenner was her mother and she must have organized all this.
I wrote it off as rich parents and moved on.
A few months later, Leila looked up from her computer.
Dude, Buddha just sold a minority stake in her company at a $600 million valuation.
Who did?
The makeup Girl, I replied.
1:30
Yeah, holy cow again.
How could I have been screwing up so bad?
How is someone so young making so much more than me?
She's in beauty.
She can do that.
I can't, I told myself, then carried on.
A few months later, a headline caught my eye.
Conor McGregor's Proper 12 Whiskey Hits a $600 million Valuation within 12 months of launching.
1:48
Seriously.
Another person making gobs of money in what felt like seconds.
A few months later I saw another headline with an insane 3.5 billion worth.
Dwayne Johnson's Taramona sweeps the floor with Conor McGregor's proper 12.
Dwayne the Rock Johnson is now a multibillionaire and he never even talked about business.
2:06
What am I doing wrong?
If someone makes more money than you, they are better at the game of business in some way.
Quiet the ego.
Look for the lesson a few months later at a famous friend's house.
Up to this point, I stayed behind the scenes for the most part.
I didn't want to become famous.
2:22
I wanted to be rich, and I succeeded at that.
But seeing these successes chipped away at my beliefs.
Could building a personal brand be that powerful?
Simple answer, yes.
But I wanted my privacy.
We sat around his kitchen table and I asked him.
You get all these weird messages from strangers.
2:38
People threaten your family.
Are you still happy you became famous?
He replied with something that changed my life forever.
If getting weird messages and hate from people I don't know is the price I have to pay to make the impact I want to have.
I pay that price any day of the week.
I thought exposed.
I was being a Pansy.
2:55
I claimed I wanted to make an impact but wasn't willing to pay the price for it.
After that conversation, Leila and I went all in on building personal brands.
I have a core belief I'd like to transfer to you.
If someone is making more money than you, they are better at the game of business in some way.
Take it as good news.
It means you can learn from them.
3:11
Don't think they had it easy.
Don't think they had a shortcut.
Don't tell yourself they broke some moral code.
Even if it's true, none of those beliefs serve you.
None of those beliefs make you better.
Years ago I was vocal about making content.
I didn't see the point.
Why would I waste my time making something that would disappear in a few days?
3:27
I thought it was a stupid waste of time and let everyone know I was wrong.
It really wasn't about the content at all.
It was about the audience.
But I didn't understand was the content you create isn't the compounding asset the audience is.
So even though the content may disappear in time, your audience keeps growing.
This was a lesson my ego prevented me from learning for too long.
3:46
It took an entire year of getting hit in the face with solid evidence before I changed my ways.
Building an audience is the most valuable thing I've ever done.
I saw Kylie Jenner, Huda Katan, Conor McGregor, and The Rock become billionaires overnight.
My famous friend said a massive audience was crucial to his success.
The overwhelming evidence broke my belief, so I rewrote them.
4:04
I now saw the power of having an audience, but I didn't know where to start.
So I did what I always do.
I pay for knowledge.
Buying someone else's experience saves the time it would take to figure everything out yourself.
Leila bought me 4 calls of the big influencer had the type of audience I wanted to build.
She paid 120 grand on my first call.
4:20
He told me to post regularly on every platform.
So that's what I did. 12 months later, my audience grew by more than 200,000 people.
On my second call, he noted the progress, but I wanted more.
Do you have a blueprint for your personal branding?
How do you put out all that content?
He said.
Bro, anyone telling you there's some secret is trying to sell you something.
4:37
We just put out as much as we possibly can.
Pull up your Instagram and pull up my Instagram.
Look, you posted only once today.
I posted three times.
Pull up your LinkedIn.
Look, you posted once this week.
I posted five times today.
You went platform by platform.
I grew more embarrassed with each comparison.
You just got to do more, bro.
4:53
Simple, not easy.
Over the next six months I put out 10 times the content and over the next six months I added 1.2 million people to my audience.
Also, when I put out 10 times the content, my audience grew 10 times.
As fast volume works, content works.
5:09
A growing audience is the result.
And in this chapter I'll break down how I did it so you can do it too.
How building an audience works.
You post great free content.
Warm reach outs, don't get a lot of engaged leads for the time we invest.
If we want to reach 10 people, we have to repeat ourselves 10 times.
5:25
Lots of effort.
By posting free content.
We can say it once and reach all 10.
So posting content get us a lot more engaged leads for the time we invest.
Hooray, the people who think it's valuable become a part of your warm audience.
If they think other people find it valuable, they share it.
And if the people they share it with like it, they become a part of your warm audience too.
5:43
Rinse and repeat.
The sharing can go on indefinitely.
The more they share your stuff, the larger your warm audience gets, and once in a while you'll make them an offer.
If your offer has enough value, they'll take it when they do.
You make money, and the bigger your audience, the more money you make.
5:59
Look at it this way, posting free content grows your own audience, so constantly posting free content means you'll have a constantly growing audience of people more likely to buy your stuff.
Free content makes all other advertising more effective.
If you reach out to someone and they can't find content related to your services, they're less likely to buy.
6:16
On the other hand, if they find lots of valuable content, they are more likely to buy.
This is what my ego prevented me from learning.
Now the headlines with Jenner, Huda, McGregor, and The Rock all made perfect sense.
But posting free content isn't all sunshine and rainbows.
It has tradeoffs.
First, it's more difficult to personalize your message so fewer people respond.
6:35
Second, you compete with everyone else posting free content.
This makes it harder to stand out.
Third, if you do stand out, people will copy you.
This means you need to constantly innovate.
That being said, a bigger audience means more engaged leads.
More engaged leads means more money.
More money means you more happy.
6:51
Just kidding.
It won't do that, but it'll give you all the resources to remove the stuff you hate Anyways, This chapter covers only two topics.
First, we demystify audience growing content by showing it's all made of the same basic units.
A content unit has three components hook, retain, reward.
7:07
Second, how linking basic units together will make audience growing content for any platform or media type.
The next chapter Post Free Content Part 2 shows you how to weaponize this content to make money.
But for now you can't monetize content until you know how to make it.
7:23
The content unit 3 Components All audience Growing content does one thing, it rewards people for consuming it and a person can only get rewarded by the content if they one have a reason to consume it.
Two, pay attention long enough. 2-3 get that reason satisfied.
7:39
Thankfully, we can reverse those 3 outcomes into the three things we have to do to make audience growing content.
This means we have to A hook attention.
Get them to notice your content, B retain attention, get them to consume it, C reward attention.
Satisfy the reason they consumed it to begin with.
7:56
The smallest amount of material it takes to hook, retain and reward Attention is a content unit.
It could be as little as an image, a meme, or a sentence, meaning you can hook, retain and reward at the same time.
This is how short tweets, meme images, or even a Jingle can go viral.
8:11
They do all three.
I separate them so we can discuss them more clearly, but they all happen at once.
Let's dive into each of the things we do to create a content unit.
This way you can create effective content units that grow your audience.
One hook.
They cannot be rewarded unless we first get their attention.
8:28
The objective We give them a reason to redirect their attention from whatever they're doing towards us.
If we do that, we've hooked them.
The effectiveness of your hook is measured by the percentage of people who start consuming your content.
So if you hook attention well, many people will have a reason to consume your content.
If you do a poor job, few people will have a reason to consume your content.
8:48
Remember, this is a competition for attention.
We have to be every alternative they have to win theirs.
Make yourself the best option.
We increase the percentage of people who pick our content by picking topics they find interesting, headlines that give them a reason and matching the format of other stuff they like.
9:04
Let's dive into each topics.
Topics are the things you make your content about.
I prefer to use personal experiences.
Here's why There's only one of you.
The easiest way to differentiate is to say something no one else can say and no one else has lived your life but you.
I divide topics into 5 categories.
9:20
Far Past, Recent, Past, Present, Trending, Manufactured.
Far past the important past lessons of your life.
Connect that wisdom to your product or service to provide huge value to your audience.
Give them the story without the scar.
It's why I write these books.
Example a personal lesson where I broke my belief that I don't have enough time hook.
9:41
I complained to a friend that I didn't have enough time to do something while glued to my phone.
Retain.
They yanked it out of my hands and looked at its usage.
It showed.
I spent three hours per day on social media reward.
They looked back to me and said, hey, I found you some time.
It's a simple story other people can relate to.
9:57
This makes it an interesting topic to more people and it connects what I do, growing businesses to a struggle.
Many people experienced not having enough time.
The epiphany I give away makes this less invaluable for my audience.
People starting growing and selling their businesses recent past, do stuff then talk about what you did or what happened.
10:14
Anytime you speak with somebody, there's a chance your audience could get value from it.
Look at your calendar for the last week.
Look at all your meetings.
Look at all your social interactions.
Look at all your conversations with warm reach outs.
There's gold in these conversations.
Tell stories from them that would serve your audience.
10:30
For example, this is me reading a tweet.
As a marketing rule of thumb, if everyone else is doing it, don't do it.
This tweet came from a meeting I had with a portfolio CEO that was just copying the same off for everyone else in his market was making and was getting subpar results.
This means taking notes, recordings, and other records to make that stuff easy to access.
10:49
But it also means a free, easy, and valuable stash of content.
Testimonials and case studies fall in this category.
If you can tell a cool client story in a way that provides value to your audience, you'll both promote your services and provide value.
Win, win, present.
Write down ideas at the exact time they come to.
11:06
You always have a way to record your ideas in arm's reach.
I'll even pause meetings to make a note of text or e-mail ideas to myself.
People don't mind when you ask to take notes anyway, so it's not weird.
Then when you make content, you have a bucket of fresh stories to work with.
I note my ideas publicly.
11:21
I used to keep ideas to myself.
Now I tweet them publicly as they happen.
If a post does better than normal, I know it's something people find interesting.
Then I make more stuff on that topic.
Trending.
Go where the attention is.
Look at what's trending right now and make stuff about it.
Apply your own experiences to it.
11:37
If you have relevant commentary or touches your expertise in some way, talk about it.
Talking about trending stuff is very effective for getting the attention of a broader audience manufactured.
Turn your ideas into reality.
Pick a topic people find interesting, then learn more about it, make it or do it, then show to the world.
11:55
This cost the most time and effort since you have to create the experience versus talking about the one you already had.
But it can have the biggest payouts.
Example, manufactured experience.
I lived on $100 for a month.
Here's how.
Now I don't live that way, but I could manufacture that experience then make content about it.
12:10
Author Note Manufactured versus Documenting manufactured content has the most potential to grow and monetize an audience by far.
This is because skilled content creators can engineer the maximum reward for every content unit.
To give you an idea, as of this writing, the top 10 videos in the most popular video platform are all music videos, and they've racked up about 60 billion views watching or listing.
12:34
That's a lot of attention, but for us mortals, the lower cost of documenting our experiences versus manufacturing them lets us keep the volume high.
And I believe it's more sustainable over a lifetime.
A quote I heard from a famous content creator.
I don't want to be filling my living room with sand when I'm 50, and personally, I'd rather see entrepreneurs put out more content more often in more places.
12:55
Just one man's two cents.
Action step.
Life happens.
Profit by sharing yours headlines.
A headline is a short phrase or sentence used to grab the audience's attention.
It communicates the reason they should consume the content.
They use it to weigh the likelihood they will get a reward for consuming your content versus another.
13:14
Rather than give you a bunch of templates, I'd rather give you the timeless principles that make great headlines.
And there's no greater headline creator than the news.
So let's study them.
A meta analysis of news revealed headline components that drove the most interest in stories.
They are as follows.
Try and include at least two in your headline, a recency as reason as possible.
13:33
Quite literally the news example.
People pay attention to something that happened an hour ago, more than a year ago.
B relevancy.
Personally meaningful example.
Nurses pay more attention to stuff that affects nurses compared to stuff that affects accountants.
13:50
C celebrity, including prominent people, celebrities, authorities, etcetera.
Example Normally we wouldn't care about what another human has for breakfast every day, but if it's Jeff Bezos's, we do.
Since he's a celebrity, many people care D proximity close to home geographically.
14:08
Example a house on fire across the country doesn't get your attention.
If it's your neighbor, it sure does.
Make it as close to home as possible E conflict of opposing ideas, opposing people, nature, etcetera.
Example pineapple versus no pineapple on pizza conflict.
14:27
Example two good versus evil, hero versus villain, left versus right.
Example 3.
Freedom versus security.
Justice versus mercy.
You get the idea F unusual, odd, unique, rare, bizarre example.
Think of a six fingered man at the old time.
14:44
Circuses.
If it's outside of the norm, people pay more attention.
Gee, ongoing stories still in progress, are dynamic, evolving, and have plot twists.
Example if someone goes into labor, people want updates every 10 minutes because anything could happen.
15:00
Action Step.
Include one or more of those components to give yourself Meteor attention.
Grabbing headlines Format once we have a good topic and communicate it with the headline using one or more components.
We need to match our format to the best content on the platform.
People consume content because it's similar stuff they've liked in the past, and matching the popular format of the platform gets the most people to interact with it.
15:22
So we want to make our content look like the stuff they've liked before.
Format Example.
Since you're listening on audio, I display a meme that went viral a few years ago with LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Tinder.
All images of the same people formatted in different ways contextual to the platform, and it showed how different people display themselves on each platform back to the text.
15:43
This meme communicates the point better than I can with words.
All four images above are, well, images, but they have a different look and feel.
This is because formatting depends on the audience you want to hook and the platform your audience is on.
Bottom line, you've got to make your content look like what they expect will reward them.
15:59
Otherwise, no matter how good it is, better looking content will hook them before yours even has a chance.
Action step Format your content for the platform first, then tweak it so it hooks your ideal audience.
Use the best content on the platform that targets your market as your guide.
This concludes the hook step of our content unit.
16:17
Always following these basics will already put you in the top 1%.
At least it has for me.
Two, retain.
My favorite driver of retention is curiosity.
It's my favorite because if done correctly, people will wait years.
People want to know what happens next.
16:32
For example, I get messages daily for years about when I will release my next book on sales.
My favorite way to get the audience curious is to embed questions in their mind.
Unresolved questions can be explicit or implicit.
You can directly ask the question, or the question can be implied.
16:48
My three favorite ways to embed questions are Lists, steps, and Stories.
A lists.
Lists are things, facts, tips, opinions, ideas, etcetera, presented one after the other.
Good lists in free content also follow a theme.
17:04
Think top ten mistakes or five biggest money makers, and so on.
Giving the number of listed items in your headline or in the first few seconds of your content tells people what to expect, and in my experience, this retains more of the audience's attention for longer.
Example, Seven ways I invest $1000 in My 20s.
17:21
That paid off.
Big example, 28 ways to stay poor.
Example a content unit has three pieces.
B steps.
Steps are actions that occur in order and accomplish a goal when completed.
Provided that early steps were clear and valuable, the person will want to know how to do them all to accomplish their overall goal.
17:38
Example Three steps to creating a great hook.
Example how I create a headline in seven steps.
Example the morning routine that boosts my productivity.
Note here's the difference between steps and lists.
Steps are actions that must be done in a specific order to get a result.
17:54
So steps are less flexible, but have a bit more explicit reward.
Lists can have just about anything on them in any order you want, so lists are more flexible but have less explicit reward.
See stories Stories describe events, real or imaginary, and stories worth telling often have some lesson or take away for the listener.
18:12
You can tell stories about things that have happened, might happen, or will never happen.
All three Dr. Curiosity because people want to know what happens next.
Example, almost every chapter in this book has a story.
Example.
My editor made me do 19 drafts of this book.
Here's what I did to him.
18:29
Ha example My journey from sleeping on the bottom floor of a gym to the top floor of a five star hotel.
You can use lists, steps, and stories on their own or interweave them.
For example, you can have lists within steps and a story about each list item.
18:44
You can have stories to reinforce the value of a step.
You can have a list of stories, or many ongoing storyline, etc.
Your creativity is the only limit here.
That's why people who make a lot of content call themselves creators.
This chapter, for example, has lists within steps and stories interweaving them.
19:01
Action step.
Use lists, steps, and stories to keep your audience curious.
Embed questions in their minds to make them want to know what happens next.
Three, reward.
Anyone can think of cool hooks and organize their content using list steps or stories, but the real question is, is it good?
19:19
Does it satisfy the reason they watch to begin with?
Does it make people want to share it?
How good your content is depends on how often it rewards your audience and the time it takes them to consume it.
Think value per second.
For example, the same person who gets bored 3 seconds into a 10 second video may also binge a 900 page book, and that same person may binge a television series for 8 hours straight.
19:40
So there's no such thing as too long, only too boring.
Now, we can't guarantee a specific reward, but we can increase the chance reward happens by hooking the right audience with proper topics, headlines and formatting, retaining them with lists, steps, and stories to get them curious and wanting more clearly satisfying.
19:58
The reason?
The content hook them to begin with.
Example, if your hook promises seven ways to make up with your spouse, and you give a four ways B7 ways that stunk or that they've heard before, or C you're talking to a room full of single guys who don't have spouses.
You did a bad job of rewarding.
20:14
People will not want to watch again and certainly won't share it.
Example, if you hook promises for marketing strategies dentists can use and they can't use them, they will not share it or watch your content in the future.
You did a bad job of rewarding.
Bottom line, I've had tons of content I thought would smash records with the audience, smash the next button instead.
20:33
So no matter how good you think your content is, the audience decides.
Rewarding your audience means matching or exceeding their expectations when they decided to consume your content.
Here's how you know if you succeeded, your audience grows.
If it's not growing your stuff isn't that good Practice and you'll get better action, step.
20:51
Provide more value than anyone else.
Make good on your promises.
Clearly satisfy the hook you use to get their attention.
In other words, completely answer the unresolved questions you embedded in their minds.
So what's the difference between short and long form content?
Answer Not much if you recall from earlier.
21:07
The smallest amount of material it takes to hook retain and reward attention is a content unit.
So to create a longer piece of content, we simply link content units together.
For example, a single step in a five step list might be a content unit.
When we link all five together, we have a longer piece of content.
21:23
Here's a visual to drive it home for everyone who's listing.
It's just hook, retain, reward, cycled over and over and over again.
Shorter content hooks retains rewards fewer times, Longer content does it more times, and doing it more times takes more skill because you have to string more good content units in a row.
21:40
For example, a new comedian will typically only get a few minutes on stage to perform their bit.
Only a master comic gets an hour.
It takes practice to reward attention just off enough to keep it for that long.
So start small, then build from there.
Even if you start with longer content, which is fine, I suggest starting with shorter versions.
21:57
You'll have an easier go of it.
Many successful authors with epic length novels started by writing, you guessed it, Short stories Pro tip, Make all your content for strangers.
This is important.
Pay attention.
If you want to grow your warm audience, then you need to make content assuming the people consuming it have never heard of you before.
22:15
If you make it for strangers, then strangers will like it because you made it for them and they'll share it and your audience will grow that much faster.
And consider the alternative.
You litter your content with inside jokes that no one gets besides your audience.
Cool for you guys, but no one else will feel welcome and your audience growth will slow down.
22:33
This is one of the most common mistakes I see content creators make.
So don't make it so.
Make every piece of content.
Assuming the person has never heard of you before and everyone already knows you won't mind, they'll appreciate the reminders.
Once you understand how to make a content unit, all you have to do is more.
Then your audience will grow.
22:50
And once your audience grows big enough, you may want to monetize it.
I had too much to say to fit in one chapter, so talk about how to monetize the audience in the next one.
I'll see you there.
Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book right now.
If you don't know this, the mission of acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone.
23:09
And the only way we can reach everyone is if you choose to share this.
And so if you've been enjoying this, you've been getting value from this chapter and any of the rest of the podcast episodes, if you could just take a second and ship this to a friend, just click the one button and send it to somebody or share it on your stories, it would mean the world to me and it would ultimately send this message to more people.
23:25
So if you could do that now, it would mean a lot.
Post Free Content Part 2 Monetize Your Audience Give Give give give give, give until they ask.
The point of this chapter is to show you how to monetize your warm audience.
First, we talk about how we can make offers and not be a spam monster mastering the give to ask ratio.
23:44
Then we'll talk about the two offer strategies to monetize the audience.
After that, I'll talk about how to scale your output so you can grow a bigger audience faster and make even more money.
Then I'll share a bunch of lessons I've learned in building my own audience that I wish I'd known sooner.
Finally, I'll wrap this up with how you can take action on everything today.
24:01
Mastering the give to ask ratio Gary Vaynerchuk Poplarized Jab Jab Jab, Right hook.
It simplifies the idea of giving to your audience.
Many times before making an ask, you deposit goodwill with rewarding content, then withdraw from it by making offers.
When you deposit goodwill, your audience pays more attention.
When you deposit goodwill, your audience is more likely to do what you ask.
24:19
So I try to under Ask My Audience and build as much goodwill as possible.
Thankfully, the give to Ask ratio has been well studied.
Television advertises 13 minutes of advertising per 60 minutes of air time.
That means 47 minutes are dedicated to quote giving and 13 minutes are dedicated to quote asking.
That's roughly a 3 1/2 to one ratio of giving to asking.
24:37
On Facebook, it's roughly 4 content posts for every one ad on the news feed.
This gives us an idea of the minimum give to ask ratio we can sustain.
After all, television and Facebook are mature platforms.
They care less about growing their audiences and care more about making more money from them.
So they give less and ask more, which means give, give, give.
24:54
Ask is the ratio that gets us closer to maximally monetizing an audience without shrinking it.
But most of us want to grow, so we shouldn't model them.
We should model growing platforms.
So what do growing platforms do?
They display lots of content without many advertisements at all.
25:09
In short, they give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give.
Maybe ask.
They dramatically overgive and under ask why?
Because the more you roared your audience, the bigger it gets.
So if you want to grow an audience, give far more than you ask.
Most people don't make money because they can't wait 12 months.
25:28
And now that I have some experience with it, I've got a slight tweak on the traditional give as strategy that puts it on steroids.
Give until they ask.
People are always waiting for you to ask for money, and when you don't, they trust you more, they share your stuff more, you grow faster, etcetera.
25:44
But I'm not some altruistic saying I'm here to make money.
After all, I wouldn't be a very good businessman if I weren't making any.
So it's simple.
If you give enough people, start asking you, it makes people uncomfortable to continue to receive without giving back.
It's core to our culture and DNA.
They'll go to your website, DMU, e-mail you, etcetera to ask for more.
26:03
Not only that, when you use this strategy you get the best customers.
They are the ones who are the biggest givers.
They're the ones who, even as paying customers, still feel they get the better end of the deal.
And best of all, if you advertise this way, your growth never slows.
When you use the strategy you give in public, ask in private, you let the audience self select when they're ready to give you money.
26:24
That's why, in my opinion, give until they ask is the best strategy.
But if you feel like asking, I get it.
So let's talk about how to ask.
Because if you're going to do it, you might as well do it well.
Bottom line, the moment you start asking for money is the moment you decide to slow down your growth.
So the more patient you are, the more you will get when you finally make your ask action step.
26:43
Give, give, give, give, give, give until they ask pro tip, give in public, ask in private.
If you continue to give in public, people will ask you for stuff privately.
Bank on it.
The best of both worlds is to never stop giving it public and continue to get an increasing number of people to ask you privately to sell them stuff.
27:00
Give, give, give and you will get without losing goodwill or slowing down your audience growth.
How to make money from content Ask.
To be clear, I think you should use the give until they ask strategy.
But if you need to pay rent, feed your family, etcetera, I get it.
Sometimes you got to ask.
So let's talk about how to do that without sounding like an Inca food.
27:19
Think of asks as commercials.
You interrupt this program with a very important message since you are the one providing the value.
You interrupt your own content with commercials about the stuff you sell.
But since it's your audience, you pay the cost of potential loss of trust, slowing growth, and of course the time it took you to gather the audience in the 1st place.
But money wise, it's free.
27:35
Now I use 2 strategies to weave promotions into content.
Integrated offers and intermittent offers.
Let's cover both.
Integrated You can advertise in every piece of content.
So long as you keep your gift to ask ratio high, you will continue to grow your own audience and get engaged.
Leads win, win.
27:51
For example, if I make an hour long podcast, having 330 second ads means I have 58 1/2 minutes of giving to 1 1/2 minutes of asking, well above the three to one ratio.
On the flip side, I had a friend who had a podcast that blew up quickly.
Eager to monetize his new audience, he started making offers asking too frequently in the content.
28:12
His podcast only stopped growing.
It actually shrank.
Don't be like that.
Don't kill your golden goose.
It's a balancing act over give to protect your most valuable asset, the goodwill of your audience.
Action step.
I most commonly integrate asks aka Cta's after a valuable moment or at the end of a content piece.
28:28
Consider trying one of those places 1st and make sure audience growth doesn't slow.
Then add in the 2nd and so forth Pro tip PS statements.
The PS statement is one of the most read parts of any content, often because it summarizes the main thing the author wants the audience to do.
So I try to include them and everything I write.
28:45
Also, one of my favorite places to make asks PSC.
Everyone reads these Intermittent.
The 2nd way you can monetize is through intermittent asks.
Here's how it works.
You make many pieces of content of pure gives that occasionally make an ask piece.
Example, you make 10 give posts and on the 11th you promote your stuff.
29:03
The difference between the 1st way and the second depends on the platform.
On short platforms the intermittent way will dominate.
On long platforms, integrations are often your best bet.
When you make your asks, you either advertise your core offer or advertise your lead magnet.
That's it.
Don't over complicate this lead magnet example.
29:19
If I just talked about a way to get more leads on a post, video, podcast, etc.
I would then say I have 11 more tips that have helped me do this.
Go to my site to grab a pretty visual of them and as long as I have an audience that wants to get more leads this will get some of them to engage.
Then the thank you page after the opt in Page for my lead magnet would display my paid offer with some video explaining how it works.
29:39
Bonus points if your lead magnet is relevant to your content advertising it off.
For example, you can also go for the jugular with your core offer and go straight for the sale.
The direct path to money.
We model our offer from the last chapter.
I'm looking for five specific avatar to help achieve dream outcome in time delay.
29:57
The best part is you don't have to effort and sacrifice and if you don't get dream outcome I will do two things increase perceived like of achievement.
One, I will hand you your money back.
Two, I work with you until you do.
I do this because I want everyone to have an amazing experience with us and because I'm confident I can deliver all my promise.
30:14
If that sounds fair, DMV slash, book call slash comment below, slash, reply to this e-mail, etcetera.
After you make your ask, get back to providing value.
Pro tip $100 million Offers My first book, $100 Million Offers breaks down the offer creation process step by step.
If you want to know how to create a valuable offer that the right person would feel stupid saying no to go, check out that book.
30:34
The digital version is available for sale at the cheapest price that the platform would let me make it and still list it as a book if it helps you feel more comfortable.
More than 10,000 people left at a 5 star review in the 1st 15 months since it was published and it has sat at the top, the number one bestseller in marketing advertising sales list for the past hundred plus weeks and counting.
30:52
If you don't know what to sell, read that book to get it right the first time.
That was an example of an integration action step.
Pick whether you integrate or make an intermittent ask.
Then pick whether you'll advertise your core offer or lead magnet.
31:08
If you're not sure, do the lead magnet.
It's lower risk.
How to scale it?
Depth and width or width then depth.
After you start asking, you're going to start getting leads and making money, but you don't want to stop there, do you?
Didn't think so?
31:24
Cool.
So let's talk about scale.
There are two posing strategies to scale your warm audience.
They both follow progressive steps.
First you have the depth and width approach.
Then you have the width.
Then depth approach.
Both are right.
Here's how they work.
Depth then with Maximize a platform, then move on to the next platform.
31:42
Step one.
Post content on a relevant platform.
Step 2.
Post content regularly on that platform.
Step 3.
Maximize quality and quantity of the content on that platform.
Short form You may sometimes be able to get up to 10 times per day per platform.
Long form you may have to get up to five days per week.
31:59
See Soap Operas Step four.
Add another platform while maintaining the quality and quantity on the first platform.
Step 5.
Repeat steps one through 4 until all relevant platforms are maximized.
Advantages Once you figure out one platform, you maximize your return on that effort.
Audiences compound faster the more you do.
32:16
You take advantage of this.
Compounding Fewer resources are required to make this work.
Disadvantages.
You have less low hanging fruit of new platforms and new audiences.
You don't accomplish the feeling of quote omnipresence in the beginning.
You risk your business being reliant on a single channel.
This is a risk because platforms can change all the time and sometimes ban you for no reason.
32:33
If you only have one way to get customers, it can kill your business if it gets shut down.
Width and depth.
Get on every platform early, then maximize them together.
Step one, post content on a relevant platform.
Step 2.
Post content regularly on that platform.
Step three.
32:49
Here's where this strategy differs from the one before.
Instead of maximizing your first platform, move on to the next relevant platform while maintaining the previous.
Step 4.
Continue until you were on all relevant platforms.
Step 5 Now maximize your content creation on all platforms at once.
33:07
Advantages.
You reach a broader audience faster and you can repurpose your content so with a little extra work, you can capture tons of efficiency with minimal change to the format.
You can make the same content fit multiple platforms.
For example, it takes little extra effort to format a single short video across all platforms.
33:24
Distributing short video content Disadvantages.
It costs more labor, attention, and time to do this well.
Often times people end up with lots of bad content everywhere.
Sucky fluff, no bueno.
If you already have a sizable business, scale up faster and read the words of an asset that only gets better with time.
33:41
I said it before and I'll say it again.
The best day to start posting content was the day you were born.
The second best day is today.
Don't wait like I did.
Pro tip how I get it done.
I am not a full time content creator.
I run businesses.
But content creation is a part of my responsibility.
33:59
Here's my simple process for recording one.
I find topics using the five ways from the topic section of part one of this chapter.
This takes me about an hour.
Two, I sit down twice every month and record 30 or so short clips based on step 1/3.
On the same day I record 2 to 4 longer videos unpacking tweets that had more stories or relevant examples.
34:18
This creates my longer form content.
If that sounds simplistic, it's because it is just start.
You can add volume overtime, action step.
Take an approach, start posting, then go up the scaling steps over time.
Pro tip only one call to action at a time.
34:35
A confused mind doesn't buy is a common saying in the sales and marketing world.
To increase how many people do what you want, only ask them to do one thing per call to action.
For example, don't ask people to share, like, subscribe and comment at the same time because instead of doing them all they'll do none.
Instead, if you want them to share, only ask them to share and if you want them to buy, only ask them to buy.
34:54
Make up your mind so they don't have to.
Why you should make content, even if it's not your primary advertising strategy.
January 2020, I called all the major departments into a meeting to answer an important question.
Why isn't our paid advertising working like it used to?
Opinions flooded the room, the creative, the copy, the offer, our pages, our sales process, our price.
35:14
They shot back and forth at each other, every bit as invested as I was in solving the problem, Leila and I sat quietly as the team debated.
After the din died down, Leila and her wife's fashion asked a different question.
What did we stop doing?
In the months before the decline, a new debate arose and a unanimous answer surfaced.
35:31
Alex stopped making gym content and started talking about general business.
Now, I didn't know how important this was, but I had to find out.
So I sent out a survey to our gym owners.
I asked them if they consumed any content of mine before they booked the call.
The results astounded me. 78% of all clients had consumed at least 2 long form pieces of content prior to booking a call.
35:51
I had fallen into my old ways and given pay dads all the credit, but our free content was nurturing the demand.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
Your free content gives strangers an opportunity to find, get value and share your stuff.
And it warms people on the fence that go to and from the cold audience methods we dive into next.
36:08
So even if it's hard to measure, free content gets you better returns on all advertising methods.
Bottom line, start making content relevant to your audience.
It will make you more money. 7 Lessons I've Learned from making content.
One Switch How to to how I from This is the best way to These are my favorite ways especially when you're starting out.
36:28
Talk about what you've done now, what others should do, what you like not.
This is the best.
When you talk about experience, no one can question you.
This makes you bulletproof.
A I make my oatmeal this way versus you should make your oatmeal this way.
B.
How I built my 7 Figure agency versus How to build a 7 figure agency.
36:46
C My favorite way to generate leads for my business versus This is the best way to generate leads for your business.
It's subtle, but when you tell your experience you're sharing value.
When you tell a stranger what to do, it's hard to avoid coming off preachy or arrogant.
This helps avoid it.
Two, we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
37:03
You're a silly goose if you think 100% of your audience listens 100% of the time.
For example, I post about my book every day.
I surveyed my audience and asked them if they knew I had a book.
One in five.
That's all the post said.
They didn't know.
Keep repeating yourself.
You'll get bored of your content before your whole audience even sees it. 3 Puddles, Ponds, Lakes, Oceans.
37:24
Narrow the focus of your content.
If you have a small local business, you probably shouldn't make general business content.
Not at first at least.
Why?
The audience will listen to people with better track records than you, but you can narrow your topics to what you do and the place you do it.
Example, plumbing in a certain town.
37:40
If you do that, you can become king of that puddle.
Over time, you can expand your plumbing puddle to the general local business pond, then the lake of brick and mortar chains, and so forth, and eventually the ocean of general business.
Four content creates tools for salespeople.
Some content will perform well and get more people interested in buying your stuff.
37:59
That content helps your sales team create a master list of your greatest hits.
Label each quote hit with the problem it solves and the benefit it provides.
Then your sales team can send it before or after sales calls and help people decide to buy.
They work especially well.
38:14
If the content resolves the specific concern the prospects commonly face, 5 free content retains paying Customers.
How a customer gets value from you matters less than where they got it.
Imagine a person pays for your thing and then consumes your free content.
If your free content is valuable, they will like you more and stay loyal to your business longer.
38:33
On the flip side, if they consume your free content and it sucks, they will like your paid product less.
Here's something you may not know.
Somebody who buys your stuff is more likely to consume your free content.
This is why it's so important to make your free content good.
Your customers will include it in how they calculate their ROI from your paid thing.
38:50
Six people don't have short attention spans.
They have higher standards repeated for emphasis.
There's no such thing as too long, only too boring.
Streaming platforms have proven that people will spend hours binging long form content if they like it.
Our biology hasn't changed.
39:06
Our circumstances have.
They have more rewarding stuff to choose from.
So make good stuff people like and reap the rewards rather than whining about people's quote.
Short attention spans seven avoid prescheduling posts.
Posts I manually post perform better than the ones I preschedule.
39:24
Here's my theory.
When you manually post, you know that within seconds you will be rewarded or punished for the quality of the content because of that close feedback loop.
You try that much harder to make it good.
When I schedule stuff out, I don't feel the same pressure.
39:39
So whenever I post or my team does, we strongly believe in someone pressing the submit button because it gives that last bit of pressure to get it right.
Give it a try.
Benchmarks.
How well am I doing?
If our audience grows, we did good, but if our audience grows fast we did gooder.
39:58
So I like to measure my audience size and speed of growth monthly.
Here's what I measure 1 total followers and reach AKA how big follower.
Example, if I go from 1000 followers across all platforms to 1500, I grew my audience by 500.
Yay.
40:14
See reach example.
If I go from 10,000 people seeing my stuff to 15,000 people seeing my stuff, I grew my reach by 5000 people.
Two rate of getting followers in reach AKA how fast you compare the growth between months.
40:32
Example if I gain those 500 followers in a month that would make it a 50% growth month. 500 new over 1000 started equals 50% growth rate.
B example if I reach those 5000 extra people in a month that would make it a 50% growth month as well. 5000 new over 10,000 started equals 50% growth rate.
40:55
Remember we can only control inputs.
Measuring outputs is only useful if we are consistent with inputs.
So pick the posting cadence you want to stick with on a particular platform, then pick your ass cadence on that platform, AKA how you will direct people to become engaged leads.
41:11
Then start and do not stop.
It's amazing what you can accomplish if you don't stop once you start.
For reference, I posted a new podcast twice a week for four years before even getting picked up on the top 100 list.
Because I did the same thing every week for years, I knew I could trust the feedback in the beginning.
41:30
It didn't grow much.
It took time for me to get better, and I knew I had to make more over a long time for that to happen.
So if your listers go from 10 to 15 in a month, that's progress, baby.
Even with small absolute numbers, that's 50% monthly growth.
It's why I like to measure both the absolute and relative growth and pick the one that makes me feel better, ha.
41:50
As my friend Doctor Kashi says, the more ways you measure, the more ways you can win.
Be consistent, Measure a lot.
Adaptive feedback.
Be a winner.
To close the loop.
In its fifth year, my podcast The Game became a top ten podcast in the US for business and top 500 in the world.
This was only possible after five years of multiple podcasts per week.
42:09
Every week.
Remember, everyone starts at 0.
You just got to give time, time.
Your first post.
You've probably been providing value to other humans, knowingly or unknowingly for a while.
So the first post you make, you can make and ask.
My hope is that it gets you your first engaged lead.
42:26
If it doesn't, you need to give for a while, then make an ask once you've earned the right to to show you that I'm not making this up.
Below you can find my first business post ever.
Is that ideal?
No.
I had no idea what I was doing.
Should you copy it?
Probably not.
Main point, Don't be afraid of what other people think.
42:41
If someone won't speak at your funeral, you shouldn't care about their opinion while you're alive.
Honor the few who believe in you by having courage.
Here's the post, everyone.
For those of you who know me, you know two things.
One, I am terrible with all things technological.
For example, I just heard about Spotify a few weeks ago.
42:58
Seriously.
Two, I love training and nutrition and fitness more than, well, a whole lot.
So today is sort of special because it marks the day where my love of training vanquished my fear of technology.
What do I mean?
For the better part of a year I've been taking part in a free personal training project with the idea that I would give away free personal training to anyone who's willing to give their 500 to $1000 to A cause of their choice.
43:18
This way they wouldn't have to be motivated by the same thing as me, but be motivated to give to their cause and benefit themselves.
When I first introduced the idea, I was happily surprised at the amount of positive support I received.
So almost a year from my first client.
I now have a website to formally show some of the transformations that have gone underway using my programming and as a formal means of contacting me about signing up.
43:38
I currently have a few slots open on my roster so drop me a note quickly if you are interested.
Thanks so much.
Take a second to check out some of the ridiculous transformations in record time.
Check it out Whenever I read this I just think you goon, but hey, I was trying and for that I'm proud.
43:55
Recap.
We covered eight things.
One, the Content Unit Done 2 Short versus long Form Content done. 3.
Mastering the Give Ask Ratio Done 4.
How to Ask Done 5.
How to Scale It Done 6 Lessons from Content Done 7.
44:13
Benchmarks Done 8.
Your First Post Done Now You Know there's nothing stopping you So what Do I do right now?
Posting free content is less predictable than but complementary to warm reach outs.
So keep doing warm reach outs.
Also, posting free content grocery warm audience and a bigger warm audience means more people for warm reach outs.
44:32
So free content gets engaged leads on its own and keeps getting engaged leads through warm reach outs.
Instead of ditching one for the other, I recommend you post free content in addition to warm reach outs.
Let's fill out our daily action commitment for our first platform.
Post content daily Checklist Who yourself.
44:51
What value?
Give, give, give until they ask where?
Any media platform To whom?
People who already follow you When?
Every morning, seven days a week.
Why?
To build goodwill and get engaged Leads How?
Written image, Videos or audio posts.
How much?
45:06
100 minutes a day.
How many?
As many times as the platform shows it.
How long?
As long as it takes.
Next up, First we start with warm outreach.
We reach out to every person we have permission to contact.
Second, we post publicly about the successes and lessons we have from our first clients.
We post a simonials we provide value, then occasionally ask.
45:24
We commit to doing both of these activities every day.
With these two methods alone, you can eventually build a six or seven figure business.
But you may want to go faster.
So we venture from more room audiences who know us to cold audiences who don't.
We begin reaching out to strangers.
This begins the third step in our advertising journey.
45:41
Cold Outreach, Free gift.
Everything I've learned from posting content.
I had to cut out a lot of material to make this book manageable.
If you want to know the fast and easy way to make content that builds trust in an audience, go to acquisition.com/training/leads.
And if you need another reason besides, it'll make you money.
45:57
It won't cost you any.
It's free.
Enjoy pre goodwill.
He who said money can't buy happiness hasn't given enough away.
Unknown people who give without expectation, live longer, happier lives and make more money.
46:13
So if we got a shot at doing that during our time together, darn it, I'm going to try to do that.
I have a question for you.
Would you help someone who you've never met if it cost you nothing but you didn't get credit?
Who is this person you ask?
They are likely you, or at least like you used to be.
Less experience wanting to make a difference and needing help, but not sure where to look.
46:31
Acquisition dot com's mission is to make business accessible to everyone.
Everything we do stems from that mission, and the only way for us to accomplish that mission is by reaching, well, everyone.
This is where you come in.
Most people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover and its reviews.
So here's my ask on behalf of a struggling entrepreneur you've never met.
46:50
Please help that entrepreneur by leaving this book a review.
Your gifts cost no money and less than 60 seconds to make real, but can change a fellow entrepreneur's life forever.
Your review could help one more small business provide for their community, one more entrepreneur support their family, one more employee get meaningful work, one more client transform their life and one more dream come true.
47:09
To get that feel good feeling and help that person for real, all you have to do is and it takes 60 seconds, leave a review.
If you're inaudible, hit the three dots in the top right of your device, click, rate and review.
Then leave a few sentences about the book with the star rating.
If you're reading this on a Kindle reader, we're doing both at the same time.
47:26
Just go to the bottom of the book, then swipe up.
It'll prompt you to leave a review.
And if for some reason either of those change, you can just go to Amazon or wherever you purchased this and leave review right on the books page.
If you feel good about helping a faceless entrepreneur, you are my kind of people.
Welcome to Mosey Nation.
You are one of us.
I'm that much more excited to help you get more leads than you can possibly imagine.
47:44
You'll love the tax if I'm about to share with you in the next chapters.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.
Your biggest fan Alex PS Fun fact If you provide something of value to another person it makes you more valuable to them.
If you'd like it will straight from another entrepreneur send this book their way.
48:02
Hey, I hope you enjoyed Post Free Content Part one and Post Free Content Part 2 chapters of the $100 million Leeds book.
If you want to grab a physical copy, you can always grab it on Amazon.
And next we've got some good stuff for you.
It is the cold outreach episode.
48:19
It is one episode, 33 minutes, one chapter, and it's the way that I learned how to advertise to save my business.
So during COVID gym launch was struggling a lot.
As you can imagine, we were servicing brick and mortar gyms and our customers weren't allowed to be in business.
48:35
And it was by that pressure and by happenstance that we were forced to learn how to do cold outreach, which today accounts for over half of that business is revenue.
And so we learn trial by fire, how to make it work, and how you can make it work too.
This has been $100 million.

Welcome to Episode 5 Podcast edition of $100 million leads.
This is a one single Kahuna chapter cold outreach.
This is everything that I learned step by step on how to create a cold outreach system that ended up creating literally 10s of millions of dollars for me personally because it is what created or transformed Jim launch into a sellable asset.
0:20
So we went from just being able to run ads to having a cold outbound team that generated over half of our sales and we had to learn it from absolute scratch.
And so rather than you learning from scratch, let me just give you all the lessons.
So you.
Can have a big head start.
That's what this chapter's about.
I hope you enjoy.
And if you really love it, leave a review.
0:36
It would mean the world cold outreach.
How to reach out to strangers to get engaged leads.
Quantity has a quality all of its own.
Napoleon Bonaparte, July 2020, COVID-19 raged.
0:52
In a matter of months, 30% of my customers went out of business.
Protesters filled every platform with hate and anger.
Small businesses suffered in silence.
Unemployment skyrocketed.
The most tumultuous election ever was upon us, and here we were trying to generate leads to pay our bills.
Employees everywhere and their families depended on it.
1:09
All three of my companies at the time Jim launched Prestige Labs in Allen, relied on brick and mortar businesses staying open, and they were closed.
Brilliant strategy, Alex.
To make matters worse, Apple did a software update that crippled our ads.
The market was crap.
Our paid ads were crap and I carried the bucket.
I ran through worst case scenarios.
1:25
How much cash would it take to keep us afloat?
How long do I keep paying people when there's no end insight?
Should I dip into my personal accounts?
Give them a third of my life savings?
Half.
All of it?
What does that say about me?
I had no idea what to do early that Saturday morning.
I tried to sleep long enough for my alarm to wake me, but it was no use.
1:42
I went into my office and checked Instagram.
I had a new message waiting for me.
Hey, Alex.
Kel told me you guys don't need salesman anymore, so my offer got pulled.
I quit my job to accept it.
Super honored you considered me.
I hope you consider me again the next time you have openings.
Looking for context, I scrolled up.
1:58
Reading our earlier messages rewarded me with a pang of guilt.
I was the one who told him to apply.
He took the rejection.
While a sign of a good salesman, I felt obligated to reply.
You on.
I messaged.
Yeah, he replied.
Got five?
Yes.
We hopped on a call.
2:16
He sounded a little nervous, but I could tell he knew his stuff.
It's actually don't have enough leads for this guy.
I've wanted to work with you for a while now.
I read your book and used your scripts to become the top producer at my company, he said.
That's awesome.
I'm so glad to hear it.
What kind of company?
I asked.
A gym software company.
2:32
I hadn't heard of them before.
Oh, interesting.
How did you guys get your leads?
We're 100% cold outreach.
So you cold call and cold e-mail gyms, then sell them software?
Yeah, pretty much.
How big is the team?
We've got about 30 guys.
2:48
A team of 30.
What's your revenue?
If you don't mind my asking, we're doing about 10 million a month right now.
Insane.
Just from cold outreach.
Yeah, we run some ads, but we haven't really cracked that yet.
And you do this with a retention offer.
You're not even really making gyms more money.
3:05
Yeah, it's definitely not as easy to sell as the stuff you do for gyms.
Do you think you use the same outreach system here?
I've never started a team, but I bet I could figure it out.
All right.
What was the offer Kale pulled?
I was going to be a closer, but he said you guys didn't need one anymore.
3:21
I thought for a moment.
Well, given our current lead volume, he's probably right.
But if you can get your own leads, I'll give you the runway to get cold outreach going.
What do you think?
It's going to take a while to get going.
I'll have to figure out the scripts for your offer.
Yeah, that makes sense.
How long you think I'm confident I can make it profitable in 12 weeks.
3:40
All right, deal.
I'll let Kill know the plan.
To be clear, you'll be expected to figure this all out.
The software, the list everything.
I'll front you the time, but we can't support you much beyond that.
Understood.
Here's what happened in the following months.
September 0 sales Zippola.
3:55
Nothing.
Zilch.
Nada.
October 2 sales $32,000 in revenue.
Team asked me to pull the plug on the cold outreach.
December 4, sales $64,000 in revenue.
Team asked me to pull the plug again.
January 6 scales $96,000 in revenue.
4:10
February 10 sales 160,000 in revenue.
March 14, sales to 224,000 revenue.
April 20 sales 320,000.
Revenue.
May 30 sales 480,000.
Revenue.
Today, cold outreach generates 1,000,000 per month for our businesses.
Making this work took every legal code outreach method we knew.
4:27
Cold calls, cold emails, cold drag messages, voicemails, everything.
But piece by piece we built a reliable customer getting system.
I wanted something that would endure and that's what I'm going to show you how to build.
I learned 5 important lessons from this experience.
One, there was another company in my space making a lot more money than mine.
4:43
It broke my belief about how big the market really was.
Two, they made all their money through private advertising.
I had no way of knowing they existed unless they contacted me first.
So they kind of operated in secret.
Three, they built a very profitable cold outreach machine in my space.
If they could do it, so could I.
4:59
Four, it's good to have proper expectations.
Cold outreach veterans told me it would take a year to scale.
I figured we could do it in 12 weeks.
I was wrong.
It took almost a year.
Cold outreach takes a long time.
At least it did for me.
Five We tried cold outreach 2 times before and failed.
Working with a person that had done it all before was immensely helpful in getting this going.
5:18
I hope to be that person for you now.
At some point you'll want one of two things.
Either you want to grow faster than you currently are, or you want to increase the predictability of your lead flow.
Here's how we can do that.
We advertise to people who don't know us cold audiences and like before, we can contact them privately or publicly.
5:34
In this chapter, we focus on private one to one communication with cold outreach.
For added context, cold outreach sits atop the foundation of warm outreach.
So think of this as a more advanced cousin of warm outreach, no longer limited by your warm audience.
If you can figure out a way to contact somebody 1:00 to 1:00, you can use it for cold outreach.
5:51
You can knock 100 doors.
You can make 100 phone calls.
You can send 100 direct messages.
You can send 100 voicemails.
These are all examples of cold outreach that have made companies zillions.
It worked 100 years ago.
It works today, and when platforms change, it'll work tomorrow.
Cold outreach has one key difference from warm outreach.
Trust.
6:06
Strangers don't trust you.
And compared to people who know us, strangers present 3 new problems.
First, you don't have a way to contact them.
Duh.
Second, even if you can contact them, they ignore you.
Third, even if they give you their attention, they're not interested.
Let me describe what these problems look like in the real world.
6:23
If you're knocking on doors, you don't have the addresses.
Then even if you do, they don't open the door when you knock.
If they open, they still tell you to pound sand.
If you're making cold calls, you don't have their phone numbers.
Even if you do, they don't pick up.
If they pick up, they still hang up on you.
If you're sending cold emails, you don't have their e-mail addresses.
6:40
Even if you do, they don't open the e-mail.
Even if they do open it, they still don't respond.
If you're sending direct messages, you don't have a place to send it.
Even if you do, they don't read it.
Even if they read it, they don't reply.
If you're sending voice memos or text messages, you don't have their numbers.
Even if you do, they don't read or listen to it.
6:55
Even if they read or listen to it, they still don't reply.
Now that we got that out of the way, the order we solve these problems is this.
One, get a way to contact them.
Two, figure out what to say.
Three, contact them until they're ready and able to listen.
The result?
We find lots of ways to contact the most qualified strangers.
7:11
We reach out to a lot of them in a lot of ways a lot of times.
Then we overwhelm them with value upfront to get them to show enough interest to move forward.
Author note, it'll take a few more steps than normal.
As a personal rule of thumb, I sell expensive stuff.
I sell expensive stuff better when I do it in multiple steps rather than on the first contact.
7:30
So my priority is to get the prospect to show interest in the stuff I sell.
When they show interest, I schedule a time to sell them.
If my league magnet requires a second exchange to deliver it, I do that.
Then if my league magnet provides value on its own, then the next call is to talk about the value they received.
Either way works.
7:46
Cold outreach is a numbers game.
The more people reach out to the more engaged leads you get.
Once we figure out how much outreach it takes to engage the lead, then we only have one thing to do more.
Let's go hunting.
As there are three new problems strangers introduced, I divided this chapter into three steps, one step per problem.
8:03
First, we get a targeted list of leads.
Next, we need to know what to say to get them to reply.
Third, we make up for lower response rates by increasing the volume and type of our reach out attempts.
Problem number one.
But how do I contact them?
Build a list up until this point for more reach outs and posting free content.
8:20
You've had to accept the leads that came to you from your warm audience.
No more.
With cold outreach, unlike any other way of advertising, we get to be as specific as we want.
Only want to talk to hedge fund managers managing over a billion dollars?
Done.
You can do that.
Only want to speak to golf apparel retail owners?
8:36
Over 3 million in sales?
Done.
Only want to talk to influencers who get over 50,000 unique pages front Done.
Now we get to pick our targets rather than them picking us now.
You probably don't have a way to reach out to 1000 Perfect Fit strangers, and if we're going to get them to buy from us, we've got to 1st find a way to contact them.
8:54
Duh.
So let's solve that problem first, There are three different ways I get my targeted lead lists.
First, I use software to scrape a list of names.
Second, I pay brokers to assemble me a list of targeted leads, and if neither of those work, I manually scrape a list of names myself.
Here's the process.
Step one softwares.
9:11
I subscribe to as many softwares as I can that scrape leads from different sources.
I search them all based on my criteria.
The software then spits out names, job titles, contact information, etc.
I try out a representative sample, say a few 100 from each software I use.
Then if the contact information is up to date, the leads are responsive, and they are the type of person the software claims them to be, Bingo.
9:31
Then I get as many leads as the software will give me.
But if I can't seem to find the right audience, move on to Step 2.
Step 2 brokers.
I go to multiple list brokers and ask them to make me a list based on my audience criteria.
They then send me a sample.
I test out sample lists from each broker.
If I get good results from one or more brokers, I stick with their lists.
9:48
If they still can't find who I'm looking for, I move on to step three-step 3 elbow grease.
I join groups and communities that I think have my audience.
When I find people that meet my qualifications, I check to see if they have ways to contact them in the group's directory, like links to their social media profiles, etc.
10:04
If they do, I add them to my list.
If they don't, I can reach out to them within the platform hosting the group.
I prefer to find contact information outside the group, so I don't come off as solely trying to milk the group for business, but I will if I have to.
So I work my way up from the most accessible leads to the least accessible leads.
10:20
Here's an important point.
If you can search the database, so can everyone else.
But if you assemble list of names yourself, it's less likely That person has already received many cold reach outs from other companies, so they're the freshest downside.
It takes the most time.
Of course.
You can pay someone else to do this for you once you figure it out yourself, but we're only talking about getting started.
10:38
In this chapter, we'll talk about scaling in Section 4, Action Step.
Find your scraping tool by searching Outbound Lead Scraping Tool or Database Lead Scraping Find brokers the same way.
With a few clicks, you'll find what you're looking for.
Put your first thousand names together.
If you have more time than money, you might want to start at step three since it only costs time.
10:58
Pro Tip Interest groups are the warmest cold audiences you can get.
Interest groups contain the highest quality leads because they're concentrated pools of people looking for a solution.
Give them one.
Nowadays there's software that can script information from these groups.
Use it.
They're one of my favorite places to fish.
11:14
Problem #2.
I have my list, but what do I say to them?
Personalize, then give big fast value.
Now that you have your list of leads, you got to figure out what to say.
I went over a lot of scripting in the Warm reach Out section.
This section builds on that one.
At the end of this chapter, I also include three scripts you can model for cold calls, cold emails, and cold chat messaging.
11:33
That being said, there are two important factors I emphasize to get strangers to engage personalization and big fast value.
This is important because they don't know us and they don't trust us.
We got to overcome both issues in a matter of seconds.
A they don't know us.
Personalize it, act like you know them to get more leads to engage.
11:52
We want the message to look like it's from someone they know.
The best way to do that is to actually know something about the person you're contacting.
In essence, we want our cold reach out to look like a warm reach out.
Imagine your phone rings from an unknown number and area code.
Are you likely to pick it up?
12:08
Probably not.
What about if the number is from your area code?
A little more likely.
Why is that?
Because it might be someone you know.
So to take this concept further, imagine you pick up the phone, the person says your name.
Then pausing like a normal person, you'd say, yeah, who's this now?
12:24
If that person went on and said it's Alex, then pauses.
I watched a few of your videos and read that recent blog post you wrote on dog training.
It was killer really helped me out with my Doberman.
She's a beast.
That peanut butter trick really helped.
Thanks for that.
You'd still be wondering what's going on, but you know, you wouldn't be doing hanging up then you hear?
12:42
Oh yeah, sorry.
I got ahead of myself.
I work for a company that helps dog trainers fill up their bucks.
We like to partner with the best in the area, so I'm always on the lookout.
We work with someone about 1/2 hour north of you.
Johnny's dog care.
You heard of them.
You'd respond yes or no, it doesn't really matter.
And then they'd say, yeah, we ended up getting 100 appointments in 30 days using a combination of text and some ads.
13:01
Do you offer similar services to them?
Which you'd probably say yes.
And then they'd say, oh, that's perfect.
Then we'd be able to use the same campaign in your market and drive the leads over to you.
If you got a boatload of high paying new dog training customers, you wouldn't be upset with me, would you?
Ha ha ha.
You'd laugh lightly.
Okay.
Great.
13:16
Well, tell you what, I can walk you through the entire thing, soups and nuts, later today.
Will you be around 4:00 and you'd say sure or whatever.
The point is if that person has started the call with Hey man, want to buy some marketing services?
You probably would have hung up.
Personalization is what gets your foot in the door to get the sale.
13:33
Basically, one to three pieces of information we can find that a friend might know about the prospect.
Then we want to compliment them on it and ideally show them how it benefited us.
People like people who like them.
Even if someone doesn't know you, they'll give you more time if you know something about them.
13:50
This comes in handy for personal subject lines on emails, the first few messages in chat, or the first few sentences to someone hears.
Even if someone doesn't know you, they'll appreciate the time you took to research them before contacting them.
This tiny effort goes a long way.
Action step Do a little research on each lead before you send a message.
14:07
We can do this ourselves.
Pay people to do it or use software.
Batch this work.
Then use your notes to figure out the first thing you'll open with to feel more familiar.
Pro Tip 50% e-mail response bump I took our cold outreach template and rewrote it below a third grade reading level.
14:23
The results 50% more leads responded.
I recommend running all scripts and messages through a free reading level app online.
I won't recommend one because they go out of business all the time, but I promise you can find one.
Make your messages easier to understand.
And more people will respond.
B they don't trust us.
14:40
Big fast value.
The key difference between people who know you and strangers is strangers give you far less time to prove your worth, and they need a lot more incentive to move towards you.
So make your life easier by giving away the farm.
We're not trying to tickle their interest, we're trying to blow their minds in under 30 seconds.
14:56
Like warm reach outs, you can directly make your offer, or offer a lead magnet, or both.
It gives the person a strong reason to respond.
I specifically call out big fast value rather than your lead magnet as a reminder that it needs to be big fast value.
If it's not or it's mediocre, you'll blend in with the ocean of people trying to get their attention and they'll treat you the same.
15:17
They'll ignore you.
So here's how much it matters.
The first four months of our cold outreach felt like torture.
We offered a game planning session as our lead magnet.
Some gyms took us up on it, but most didn't.
We needed something better.
I tested many parts of our process, but swapped.
The lead Magnet blew everything else out of the water.
15:34
We swapped from game planning code for sales call to actually give them as much free service as we possibly could.
Our take rates 3X and cold outreach became a monster channel for us.
If your offer slash league magnet isn't working for you, up the ante.
15:49
Keep offering more and more until you make it so good they feel stupid Saying no.
They either buy from you or they have nice things to say about you.
Win, Win If you forget everything about this chapter.
Remember one thing.
The goal is to demonstrate big value as fast as possible.
16:05
Give yourself a downhill battle by giving away something crazy.
Give away something for free people would normally pay for and they will want it.
Note I didn't say so.
Good they should pay for it.
I said stuff they actually pay for.
Big difference.
Take this to heart and your results will show it.
16:21
Action step.
Provide the biggest, fastest value you can afford to with your league magnet or offer.
Then write your scripts and don't worry, I got your back there.
To give you a head start I provide some sample phone, e-mail and direct message scripts at the end of the chapter.
Note, phone and chat scripts are never more than a page or two and cold emails are rarely more than half a page.
16:38
So don't overthink it.
They are no rewards for prettiest script.
Get your first hundred conversations or 10,000 emails out of the way before tweaking it.
Get testing, then tweak as you learn.
Problem #3 I'm not getting enough chances to tell people about my amazing stuff.
What do I do?
Volume.
16:56
Once we have our list of names, personal info, and our big sexy lead magnet, we need to get more strangers to see it.
We do this in three ways.
First, we automate delivery to the greatest extent possible.
Next, we automate distribution to the greatest extent possible.
Finally, we follow up more times in more ways, say automated delivery to the extent we can.
17:15
Automating delivery unlocks huge scale as someone doesn't need to literally communicate the message to the prospect.
This means you get more engaged leads per unit of time, even if you are engaged by overall percentage.
Remember, you have far more people who don't know you than people who do, so you don't have to worry as much about burning through an audience.
17:31
Here's what the difference between manual and automated delivery looks like.
Manual examples a live person can say a script to someone over the phone.
You can send a personal voice memo to each lead.
A person can write a handwritten letter to every person on the list.
If it takes a person time to convey each message, then it's manual.
17:51
Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book right now.
If you don't know this, the mission of acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone.
And the only way we can reach everyone is if you choose to share this.
And so if you've been enjoying this, you've been getting value from this chapter and any of the rest of the podcast episodes.
If you could just take a second and ship this to a friend, just click the one button and send it to somebody or share it on your stories, it would mean the world to me and it would ultimately send this message to more people.
18:14
So if you could do that now, it would mean a lot.
Automated examples, we can send a prerecorded voice memo to someone's direct messages.
We can send a prerecorded voicemail to someone's voicemail box, we can send a templated e-mail to an inbox or a templated text to someone's phone, We can send a prerecorded video, etc.
18:32
You record your message one time, then send the same message to everyone.
Pro tip.
Use technology that gets you more engaged.
Leads for your time.
Everyday artificial intelligence, deep fakes, and other technology advance.
They become more indistinguishable.
From human communication.
This means we will be able to automate elements of what we currently are forced to spend time on, embrace technologies that comes out.
18:52
To read the rewards.
Ultimately, technology serves a single purpose.
To get us more outfit per unit of time, Use it, automate distribution.
Once we have our messages prepared, we got to distribute them, and there's no word for who works the hardest, only for who gets the best results, although one leads to the other.
19:10
And as you build your skills, you will find ways to automate portions of the work.
I encourage you to automate when ethical.
And available manual examples.
Dial each phone number, click send on each e-mail, direct message, text, etcetera.
Automated examples use a robot to dial multiple numbers at once, send a blast of 1000 emails, text voicemails all at one time, etcetera.
19:31
Generally speaking, you sacrifice personalization for scale.
Get a higher response rate with personalized message.
The fewer leads you have, the less automation you should consider using.
For example, if there are only 1000 hedge fund managers who meet your criteria, you're going to want to personalize every one of them.
19:47
On the other hand, if you're targeting women 25 to 45 trying to lose weight, and there are 10s of millions of them, you can get away with less personalization.
But if you personalize, you'll get even more wink pro tip personalization tech.
The perfect combination for Max leads is Max personalization with Max volume.
20:04
And with tech, you don't always have to sacrifice personalization for scale.
Every day data becomes more accessible to find personal data.
If you can set up tech to accomplish both personalization and volume, you create a deadly effectively.
Getting combo action Step Embrace new technology.
20:20
Allocate 10 to 20% of your effort towards brand new, untested technology.
For example, if you make phone calls five days a week, try out a new dollar or tech one of the days and see how it does compared to your standard dialer.
See.
Follow up more times, more ways.
There are two more ways you can get more from your list of names.
20:38
First, you try to contact them more than once.
Shocker.
But want to know something crazy?
Most people don't.
Here's a different way to think about it.
Imagine you really needed to get a hold of your parents because something important came up.
What would you do?
You'd probably call them, text them, leave a voicemail, etcetera.
20:54
And if they still hadn't responded, what would you then do?
You'd call and text them again, probably shortly thereafter.
It's the same way with prospects.
They are in danger of living life without your solution.
Be a hero.
Save them.
The more ways you try to contact someone, the more likely you are to contact them.
21:11
People respond to different methods.
For example, I never respond to phone calls, but I reply to direct messages far more.
Contacting someone multiple times, multiple ways shows them you are serious, and doing so quickly communicates you have something important to discuss.
Curiosity increases because they fear they're missing out.
21:27
Personally, I like to e-mail first.
You know why?
Because most people don't respond.
If someone doesn't respond to one of your outreach methods, use that as a reason to follow up with another method.
Hey, I'm calling you to follow up about my e-mail.
We either get a response or a real reason to reach out again.
21:43
Either way, we win.
And once you do get them booked for an appointment, expect more than one conversation.
Remember, we're contacting complete strangers.
Outreach takes more touch points with people who don't know you, so expect two or three conversations before I hire.
Ticket sale?
Shoot for less, but expect more when you're starting out.
22:00
Bottom line, act like you're actually trying to get a hold of these people rather than going through the motions.
And you probably will.
Action step, Contact each lead multiple times in multiple ways.
Pro tip, don't be a nincompoop.
If someone asks you not to contact them, don't contact them.
22:16
Again.
Not because there isn't a chance it could work, but because for the same effort you can reach out to someone who isn't already negatively inclined.
It's just more efficient to turn neutral to yes than no to yes.
On top of that, you don't want a bad reputation.
That kind of stuff follows you.
Try hard because you have a genuine desire to solve their problems, but be respectful.
22:34
Second, once you finish contacting your list, start back at the top again.
This actually works for three reasons.
One, because they simply may not have seen your first years of messages.
Only a fool would think 100% of people see what you put out 100% of the time.
So we make up for that discrepancy with follow up.
22:50
Two, even if they do see it, it may not have been a good moment to respond.
People's schedules change every day and there are times when people can't respond to you even if they wanted to.
So the more opportunities you give them to respond, the greater the chance they will.
Three their circumstances may have changed, they may not have needed you then, but need you desperately now.
23:11
Imagine a person you message about losing weight before the holidays.
At that time they fit into their skinny jeans so they feel no pain.
They probably wouldn't respond, but after they gained 10 over the holidays they may all of a sudden be in desperate need of what you offer and now they respond to your reach out attempt.
The only thing that changed was their circumstance.
23:28
So try again in three to six months and get an entirely new group of engaged leads from the same list.
Everything may be right except the timing.
So the more times you contact them, the more likely we will catch them at the time they're ready to engage.
Action step after you've attempted to contact them multiple times multiple ways, wait three to six months, then do it again.
23:48
Pro tip If you are new to an average team, shadow the best guy on the team and then double their inputs.
If they make 200 calls, make 400.
If that means you work more, duh, you will suck before you are good.
You can make up for your lack of skill with volume.
24:03
Volume negates luck and when you do twice as many you'll get good in half the time.
Once you beat their numbers, then you can get cute and try new things.
Replicate.
Before you iterate 3 problems strangers create solved.
I wrote the book in this.
Order to build on itself, start with warm range outs.
24:21
Get some reps.
Post some content to grow your warm audience.
Get even more reps, then you'll be ready for cold reach outs.
And now?
We solve the three core problems cold audiences create finding the right list of people, getting them to pay attention to you and.
Getting them to engage victory author note for people with low ticket products.
24:41
I had trouble making cold outreach profitable when selling for my direct to consumer business.
Cold outreach teams are expensive and my average ticket wasn't high enough.
But I learned I could make a low ticket product a high ticket product if I sold a lot of them at once.
So I switched from using cold outreach to get customers to using cold outreach to get affiliates who got customers for me.
25:00
There were two ways that worked.
Either I'd sell the affiliates lots of products in bulk upfront, then they'd sell my products to their customers.
Or I'd use cold outreach to recruit them, then get them to sell my products to their customers and receive a Commission after the sale. 1 affiliate sale can be worth thousands of customers.
25:18
Both ways transform my quote low ticket sale into a quote high ticket sale by selling many at once, so the numbers pencil out.
If you're having trouble using cold outreach for your direct to consumer business, consider going after affiliates instead.
More on this in the affiliates chapter later benchmarks how well am I doing.
25:36
The two times I failed at cold outreach, I hired people who'd never tracked metrics.
Well, the third person did, and Cold Reach Out succeeded.
The person who runs it may be you.
Has to know the metrics of the sales process like the back of their hand every single stat.
Let's break down the numbers with a couple of platform examples.
25:54
I cannot give an example for every platform because it would take too long.
My hope is that you can generalize the concept to whatever platform you use.
Phone example, let's say I make 100 cold calls per day and let's say I get a 20% pickup rate.
From there I'm able to get 25% of people to want to take my lead magnet.
26:13
That means I got 4 engaged leads.
If it took me 4 hours to make those calls, it means I got one engaged lead per hour.
I can do this at first.
Once the amount of engaged leads that convert to customers makes me more than it costs to pay a cold outreach Rep, I teach someone else to do it for me.
26:30
More on this in Section 4.
So you know you do well when you make at least three times the lifetime profit of a customer compared to what it costs you to get them e-mail Example, let's say you send 100 personalized emails per day.
From there, 30% open our e-mail.
26:45
From there 10% reply showing interest.
That means.
We'd have 3 engaged leads which is 30% * 10% = 3%.
The numbers will vary but shoot for 3% of your list turning into engaged leads.
Here's a sample from a new campaign for a very niche high ticket service business in our portfolio.
27:03
It shows a 4% lead to engagement rate and presumably a third of them convert into sales.
That would net US1 new customer per 100 reach out attempts direct message example.
Let's say I make a personal video or record a personal voice memo for 100 people.
27:20
I say their name and add 1 personal line before delivering my standard message.
From there, 20% of people reply.
Now we have 20 engaged leads.
From there we use the same ACA format from the Warm Outreach section to qualify them for a call.
And so forth, so like the phone example.
27:36
You know you do well when the cost of doing cold outreach is less than three times what you make in profit from a customer note you can do way.
Better than three times.
That's the bare minimum.
For context, the portfolio company above gets over 30 to one returns from its outreach efforts.
Costs.
27:53
This method is labor intensive.
Nearly all costs are in the form of Labor.
In order to calculate our return on advertising, we add up all labor and software costs associated with steps one through three in the section before last.
Let's imagine we have a team doing cold calls.
We pay them $15 per hour and $50 per show, an appointment or shows.
28:12
We have 3600 in profit per sale lead cost us $0.10.
They call 200 leads per day.
We would likely get about two shows per day from one Rep if they worked 8 hours per day.
We would pay $120.00 in labor and $100 in show commissions per Rep and $20.00 for the leads.
28:30
This means we would pay $240.00 for two shows or $120.00 per show If we closed 33% of shows.
Our cost to get a client excluding commissions would be $360.00.
Since we get $3600 in profit per new client we would make.
A 12:50 return.
28:46
That's how cold outreach works.
Then you just add bodies.
It is boring and tedious, but brutally effective.
Pro tip, give each Rep an explicit number of leads to work each week.
They should care for these leads like they are their children.
If you give her up too many, they will waste them.
29:02
If someone can work 100 leads at full capacity, I'll give them seventyish.
That way they have time and energy to squeeze everything they can out of leads they've got.
And since all reps get the same amount of leads every week, you can give them absolute quotas for deals.
Example, I give you 70 leads, you give me back seven appointments.
29:19
I pay you no leads left behind.
This sounds hard.
Why bother?
Most people dramatically underestimate the amount of volume it takes to use cold outreach.
They also underestimate how long it takes.
But there are 7 enormous benefits to using cold outreach.
Number one, you don't need to create lots of content or ads.
29:38
You focus only on one perfectly crafted message you convey to all your prospects.
Your only goal is to make that one message better every day.
There is no quote ad fatigue or quote banner blindness since your prospects have never seen anything from you.
So you don't need to be a marketing genius to make this work.
29:55
Two, your competition won't know what you're doing.
Everything is private.
By that fact alone, you can continue to operate in secrecy.
You're not educating your competitors about how you acquire customers.
They don't know what you're doing or even that you exist 3 It's incredibly reliable.
30:11
All you have to do to get more is do more.
A certain amount of input creates a certain number of responses.
It becomes like clockwork, bringing a reliable flow of new engaged leads into your world.
You can reverse engineer the amount of sales you want to make to the number of inputs at the top of your lead pathway.
Eventually you'll have an equation.
30:28
For every X people contacted, you get Y customers.
Then you simply solve for X for example.
Let's say for every 100 emails I get one customer.
If I want 100 customers, I need to send 10,000 emails.
That's 333 per day.
One person can send 111 emails per day.
30:45
Therefore I need three people sending emails every day to get 100 customers per month. 4 Fewer platform changes.
Private communication is rarely subject to platform changes, whereas public platforms change rules and algorithms every day.
You got to stay on top of rule changes to remain effective.
31:01
In contrast, rules for cold calling, door knocking, and cold e-mail have hardly changed in 30 years. 5 compliance is less painful.
Many platforms have stringent rules around claims you can make about the stuff you sell.
Some also ban certain industries altogether, tobacco, firearms, cannabis, weight loss, etcetera.
31:19
With cold outreach, you don't need to deal with any of this.
You still need to be FTC compliant, but you don't also need to worry about platform rules on top of that.
This makes life easier.
If you have a phone, you can make money.
If you have an e-mail account, you can get leads.
This makes you very hard to stop 6.
31:35
No spokesperson equals sellable business.
If an investor can buy it from you without worrying, your business will stop getting customers.
If you leave, your business is far more valuable.
Having an established outreach team is how we were able to sell gym launch.
The business could grow without me dancing in front of the camera or relying on me being super ridiculously good looking.
31:55
I don't think they would have wanted to buy us without it.
Or at least not for as much 7.
Hard to copy even if someone wants to.
Copy your entire code outreach system.
They'll often need to learn how to do each step, and many steps are invisible.
They don't know how you scrape your list, they don't know how you personalize your messages, they don't know what software is used to distribute the messages, etcetera.
32:15
On top of that, they still need to learn how to hire, train, and operate a team of people who can do each step.
Once you have a head start, it compounds with time.
It becomes very hard to catch you author note.
Belief Breaking Volume Scaling to 60,000 emails per month to break your beliefs around what's possible.
32:32
Here's an example.
To break past $1,000,000 per month, we automated the entire process of scraping, crafting, and sending emails for one of our portfolio companies.
One virtual assistant sends 2000 emails per day using multiple pieces of software.
This generates the business 40 engaged leads per day.
Note the response rate dropped because we took out so much personalization.
32:49
From there, they're really at 10% of engaged leads sold, meaning they get 4 new customers per day.
This got them past that 100 customers per month barrier.
Fun facts.
They started with us at 250,000 per month, our minimum size requirement for investment at the time.
The business makes $20,000 per customer with four new customers per day.
33:08
Do the math at how big they are Now.
Your return.
If you recall our advertising checklist, this kicks off your journey to get more engaged leads with cold outreach.
You start this as you run out of people to advertise to or because you just want more.
Here's a sample cold reach outs daily checklist.
33:24
Who yourself?
What hook plus league, magnet slash core offer Where?
Any private communication platform To whom?
A list scraped, bought or using software.
When?
Every day, seven days a week?
Why?
To get leads?
33:40
To engage.
To sell stuff.
How?
Live calls, voicemail drops, e-mail blasts, text blasts, direct message, text video messages, voice messages, direct mail pieces, handwritten cards, etcetera.
How much?
100 per day?
How many day?
33:55
One?
Twice.
Day two Twice.
Day Seven Once.
How long?
As long as it takes.
Pro tip count in hundreds.
This is a volume game.
You will need to do a lot of volume efficiently to get the results you want.
Don't set a daily goal below 100 and don't stop for 100 days minimum.
34:14
If you do 100 reach outs for 100 days straight, I promise you will start getting new engaged leads.

Welcome to The Game Podcast.
This is a special edition $100 million leads audio book version the chapter Run Paid ads part one and Run Paid Ads Part 2.
This is about making ads, which is part one and monetizing ads efficiently, which is Part 2.
I've run a lot of ads in my day and I would say it's the primary channel that I've made the most money from in my life.
0:22
It's what I feel is I'm most native to, despite the fact that most of my personal branding reputation has come from organic content.
This is the thing that's made me the most money and to this day is probably the thing that makes makes most of My Portfolio company's money.
And so I outlined the breakdown of how to structure ads, how I write copy, How I do call outs.
0:39
How I get attention, How I how I contrast that the message with the background of the ads.
All the little nuances that it just takes hundreds, hundreds of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars of mistakes to learn.
And this way you can get the lesson without the scar.
0:55
Hope you enjoy.
Run paid ads.
Part one.
Making an ad.
How to publicly advertise to strangers.
Advertising is the only casino where with enough skill, you become the house.
July 2013.
Let's try some Facebook ads for the gym.
1:10
I spouted.
Sam's eyebrow went up.
They don't work.
I already tried.
Now this was the brief time between quitting my quote real job and starting my first gym.
I wanted some experience, so I cold emailed more than 40 gym owners for a chance to shadow them.
Sam was the only one who responded to my pleas for mentorship.
He let me work at his gym.
1:27
With him for minimum wage.
I'm forever grateful for that opportunity.
I promise.
I really think they'll work, I said.
Let me give it a shot with the stuff I learned from that workshop last weekend.
I'll do everything.
That workshop took most of my puny savings.
Sam lean back in his chair, crossing his arms.
1:42
I'll tell you what, I'll give you 1000 bucks to play with.
If you lose it, then you have to shut up about this Facebook stuff.
If you make more, I'll split the profit with you.
Deal.
I worked with a freelancer to get everything set up.
We went back and forth until it was perfect.
A few days later, I marched into Sam's office to show him what I'd made.
2:00
It's ready, I said.
He spun his laptop to face me.
All right, Hermosi, show me what you got.
I placed the ugliest ad you've ever seen.
Picture this in all caps.
I'm looking for five Chino Hills residents to take place in a free six week challenge.
2:16
You must let us use your before and after pictures in our marketing in exchange for the program.
Click the link to sign up.
Link again.
No images, no videos, no frills.
Just words, all caps.
The ad went live.
We got leads within hours.
2:33
I called them all and booked appointments as fast as I could.
I also texted them about an hour before to remind them of our appointment and as soon as they walked in I started yapping about our six week challenge.
I had zero sales skills, my conviction made-up for my lack of skill.
They bought.
I sold 19 people at $299 each.
2:50
We made just under $5700 from the $1000 investment.
True to his word, saying cut me a check.
And handed it over.
He made it out for $2500 more than my share.
Sam, this is He cut me off.
Nice work, Hormozy.
Do it again.
The Six Week Challenge became the biggest promotion in the gym industry for seven years.
3:10
It drove at least 1 1/2 billion dollars in revenue.
More by now.
I taught it to over 4500 gyms and I bet more than 10,000 gyms use variations of the promotion without licensing it.
Maybe you saw ads for it in your local market.
And yes, if you're curious, it got more sophisticated as time went on how paid ads work.
3:30
Paid ads are a way to advertise 1 to many to cold audiences, AKA people who don't know you.
Paid ads work by paying another person or business to put your offer in front of their audience.
Think of it like renting eyeballs or earballs.
And because you don't need to spend time building an audience, paid ads are the fastest way to get the most people to see your stuff.
3:48
You trade money for reach.
A considerable advantage when you know what you're doing.
Ads are riskier, but when done right, then get you more leads than any other method.
With warm and cold outreach, we have to do more stuff to reach more people.
To reach more people with free content, we depend on the platform or audience sharing it if they feel like it.
4:06
Paid ads are different, The reach is guaranteed, but getting your money back isn't.
So it's a game of efficiency rather than reach.
Let me explain.
In principle, if you paid enough money, you could get every person in the world to see your ad.
And if every person in the world sell your ad, someone would buy, even if only by accident.
4:23
Ha.
So the question isn't do ads work?
It's how well can you make them work?
In other words, it's a push and pull between how much you spend and how much they buy.
And like cold outreach, paid ads go to colder, lower trust audiences.
So even with good offers, a smaller percentage of people will respond.
4:40
And like cold outreach, paid ads get over this hurdle by putting your offer in front of more people.
And if an ad isn't profitable, most of the time it's because the right people never saw it.
So to make an ad profitable, the right people have to see it.
This keeps our ads efficient.
This chapter reveals how I create more efficient paid ads by finding needles in the haystack.
4:59
I start with the entire world as my audience.
The haystack then narrow down to get a higher percentage of engaged leads the needle.
First, I pick a platform that contains my ideal audience.
Second, I use whatever targeting methods that exist within that platform to find them.
Third, I craft my ad in a way that repels anyone else.
5:17
Finally, I tell whoever's left standing to take the next step.
People overcomplicate it, but that's it.
That's all we're doing, narrowing down who sees our ad, so we have the highest chance of getting the right type of people to respond.
Once we advertise profitably in a small puddle of an audience, we expand to a pond, then a lake, then an ocean.
5:35
And as the audience gets bigger, it does have more of the wrong people, but it has more of the right ones too.
So ads decrease in efficiency, but at that point you can afford it.
In other words, the ratio between what you spend and how much they buy goes down, but the total amount of money you make goes up.
So instead of spending $1000 to make $10,000 with $9000 in profit, you spend $100,000 to make $300,000 with $200,000 in profit.
5:59
Your ratio goes down, but you make more money.
So the risk is higher because you spend more, but so is the reward.
This means we want to make the audience as big as possible while still turning a profit.
Paid ads give us 4 new problems to solve.
Let's break them down together, #1 knowing where to advertise, #2 getting the right audience to see it, #3 making the best ad for them to see. #4 Getting permission to contact them.
6:23
Step one.
But where do I advertise?
Find a platform where these four things are true.
Platforms distribute content to an audience.
If you're not familiar with any available platforms, I invite you to come join me on planet Earth.
If you've ever consumed content which you have, you've directly or indirectly used a platform and been a member of its audience.
6:40
And whoever, there's an audience, you can usually advertise.
So if you want to become a great entrepreneur, you have to learn about them.
Here's what I look for in a platform I want to advertise on.
One, I've used it and gotten value from it as a consumer, so I have some idea how it works.
Two, I can target people on the platform interested in myself.
6:57
Three, I know how to format ads specific to the platform, which I'll dive into in step 3/4.
I have the minimum amount of money to spend to place an ad.
And yes, platforms change all the time, but these principles stay the same.
Pro tip Place ads.
Where competitors place ads to start, platforms often have different ad types.
7:15
For example, on LinkedIn you can send message ads or you can run news feed ads.
On Instagram you can run ads to the news feeder stories.
On YouTube you can run ads on the sidebar, midstream, or pre roll.
So how do you know where to start?
Look at the ad placement of other people in your space and start there.
If they can make it work, so can you replicate before you iterate.
7:32
Action step.
Start with one platform that meets the four requirements and start watching, listening, or reading ads on the platform as a first step to learning how to make one Step 2.
But how do I get the right people to see it?
Target them?
So if we start with the entire world, which we kind of do, we need to be a bit more specific.
7:48
For example, if you choose a platform that's 100 million users, you've already cut out 99% of the world right off the bat.
And if everyone who buys from you speaks English, you'd also want to exclude the audience within the platform who don't.
If that's half the platform's users, you're already down to 99.5% of the world excluded.
8:05
Specific is good, The right message, the wrong audience will fall in deaf ears.
Doesn't matter how good your ads are.
If you're marketing to people in Florida about a local business in Iowa, it's probably not going to work.
You only have one goal when targeting.
Get the highest number of people you think will buy your stuff to see your ad.
We did our first round of targeting by selecting our platform.
8:24
We do the second round within the platform itself.
Modern advertising platforms have two ways to target.
You can use them separately or combine them #1 target a look alike audience.
Modern platforms can show your ad to an audience that is similar to and much bigger than a list you provide.
8:39
Advertisers call this a look like audience.
Modern platforms will make a look like audience for you so long as you upload their minimum list size.
The bigger the list and the higher quality the contacts, the more responsive the look like audience will be.
Start with your list of current and previous customers.
If your customer list is big enough to meet the platform minimum, use it.
8:57
If it's not big enough, add your warm reach out list to it.
If it's still not big enough, add your cold reach outs to hit the minimum.
This is exactly what I do.
Forcing the list size to the right size sometimes make the look like audience too broad, and that's OK because you can #2 target with factors of your choosing.
9:15
Targeting options include age, income, gender, interests, time, location, etc.
For example.
If you know no 1 / 45 or below 25 has ever bought your thing, then exclude anyone outside that range.
If you sell car parts then show your ad during car shows and on car channels.
9:30
If only people with pets buy your thing then include pets as an interest.
Basic filters on top of platform generated look like audiences are a simple way to get more of the right people to see your ads.
End result, More efficient ads.
Pro Tip Local targeting Since local markets are tiny in comparison to national markets, you won't want to add many more filters.
9:50
Be as specific as possible, but no further.
The local market on its own is already .1% of a nation, so you're already pretty narrow.
The more filters you use, the more specific the list.
The more specific the list, the more efficient your ads, but the faster you'll quote burn through it.
However, this specificity sets you up to get more wins early on.
10:09
Wins from smaller specific audiences now give you the money to advertise to larger and broader audiences later.
This is how you scale action steps.
Bring all your lead lists together into one place.
Separate them by past and previous customers, warm outreach and cold outreach.
10:25
Eventually you'll have a list of people that engage with your paid ads by giving you contact information but didn't buy.
That'll come in handy then.
If the platform allows, use these lists in order of quality to create your look like audience.
Then if the platform also allows ad filters on top of your look like audience to target an even higher percentage of people to engage with your ad if you're incapable of making a look like audience.
10:47
And simply start by targeting interests Step 3.
But what should my ad say?
Call out plus value plus call to action.
To this day, I don't change the channel when I see an ad.
I rarely mute or skip ads.
In fact, I have no premium subscriptions that remove ads on any media platform either main reason I want to consume the ads.
11:08
I want to see how businesses do three things.
One, how they call out their ideal customers.
Two how they present the value elements 3.
How they give their audience a call to action.
When I look at ads this way, it turns what was once an everyday nuisance ads into a continuous learning experience.
11:25
Consuming ads on purpose with the core elements in mind make me a better advertiser, and it'll make you a better one too.
Let's use the three chunks to make an ad Number one call outs.
I need to get them to notice my Ad 2 value.
I need to get them interested in what I have to offer.
11:41
Three calls to action.
I need to tell them what to do next.
Number one, call out.
People noticing your ad is the most important part of the ad.
By a lot.
The purpose of each second of the ad is to sell the next second of the ad and the headline is the first sale.
11:57
As David Ogilvy says, after you've written your headline, you spent $0.80 of your advertising dollar.
Focus your effort front to back.
As crazy as this sounds and all the pros are nodding their heads right now, my advertising became 20 times more efficient when I focused the majority of my effort on the 1st 5 seconds.
12:15
We need the audience's eyes and ears just long enough for them to realize this is for me.
I'll keep paying attention.
This first impression is the part of the ad I test the most.
Imagine you're at a cocktail party in a big ballroom, Lots of people talking in groups, loud music playing in the background, and all that noise.
12:32
A single sound pierces through it all and you turn around.
Want to know the sound, Your name?
You hear it and instantly look for the source.
Scientists call it the cocktail party effect in simple terms.
Even when there's lots of stuff going on, a single thing can still catch and hold our attention.
12:47
So our goal with call outs is to harness the cocktail party effect and cut through all the noise.
After all, if they never notice your ad, nothing else matters.
A call out is whatever you have to do to get the attention of your audience.
Call outs go from hyperspecific to get one person's attention to.
13:03
Not at all specific to get everyone's attention.
Let me explain.
If someone drops a tray of dishes, everyone looks.
If a child yells mom, then moms look.
If someone says your name only, you look.
But again, they all get attention and I try to make my call outs specific enough to get the right people and broad enough to get as many of them as I can.
13:23
So pay close attention to how advertisers use call outs, especially the ones targeting your audience.
Here's what I look for with verbal call outs using words to get attention.
One labels a word or set of words putting people into a group.
These include features, traits, titles, places, and other descriptors.
13:41
Example.
Clark County moms, gym owners, remote workers, I'm looking for XYZ, etcetera.
To be most effective, your ideal customers need to identify with this label a people automatically identify with their local area.
13:57
So with local ads, the more local the better.
A local ad with local area plus type of person call out is still one of my favorite all time ways to get someone's attention.
It worked 200 years ago.
It works today and it'll work tomorrow.
14:12
So think Americans is not as specific as Texans.
Is not as specific as Dallas residents.
Is not as specific as Irving residents.
If you live in Irving, you'll immediately think this ad could affect you so it catches your attention.
Two yes questions.
14:29
Questions where people answer yes.
That's me.
They qualify themselves for the offer.
Example, Do you wake up to pee more than once a night?
Do you have trouble tying your shoes?
You have a home worth over $400,000.
Three if then statements.
If they meet your conditions then you help them make a decision.
14:45
If you run over $100,000 a month in ads, we can save you 20% or.
More If you were born between 1978 and 1986 in Muskegee, Oklahoma, you may qualify for a class action lawsuit if you want.
Then pay attention. 4 ridiculous results.
Bizarre, rare, or out of the ordinary stuff someone would want.
15:04
Massage studio books out two years in advance.
Clients furious, this woman lost 50 eating pizza and fired her trainer.
The government is handing out $1000 checks to anyone who can answer these three questions etcetera.
Call outs don't have to be just words, they can also be noises or visuals in the environment.
15:21
Let's go back to the cocktail party.
Sure, a drop tray of dishes would get everyone's attention, but so would the cling cling cling of a knife against the champagne flute.
They both get everyone's attention for different reasons.
One signals an embarrassing disaster and the other signals important news.
15:37
But in either case, everyone still wants to know what happens next.
So if the platform allows, good advertisers use verbal and nonverbal call outs together.
Here's what I look for with nonverbal call outs, using the setting and spokesperson to get attention.
One contrast any stuff that sticks out in the first few seconds.
15:55
The colors, the sounds, the movements, etcetera.
Know what catches your attention?
Example a bright shirt.
Always gets more attention than a black or dull shirt.
Attractive people almost always get more attention than plain looking people.
Moving stuff always gets more attention than still stuff. 2 Likeness.
16:12
Think visually showing labels, features, trades, titles, places, and other descriptors that people identify with.
People want to work with people who look, talk and act in ways familiar to them.
And you may not look.
Talk or act in ways familiar to them.
So if you serve a broad customer base, use more ethnicities, ages, genders, personalities, etcetera, and your ads.
16:33
If you serve a narrow customer base, example medical devices for seniors, then use people who look like them.
Quack like a duck.
If you want to attract ducks, look like a duck, walk like a duck and quack like a duck.
If you want to attract plumbers, then dress like a plumber, talk like a plumber, and be in a plumbing environment.
16:50
Even with the same message, your ad will do far better if you look the part or find people who do.
If you see.
An ad for doctors.
Notice the spokesperson.
What age are they?
Gender.
Ethnicity.
Are they wearing a lab coat?
A stethoscope?
Are they in a medical facility?
17:06
All these things get a specific type of person interested in health related products and services to pay more attention than they would otherwise.
Mascots also work well because they don't age, never ask for more money and never take days off.
Think Mickey Mouse for Disney the GEICO Gecko, Tony the Tiger for Kellogg's, the Michelin Man, etcetera.
17:25
A mascot is a great way to create an enduring spokesperson for your business.
Advanced whichever likeness you choose.
If it's not you, the business becomes less dependent on you and therefore more sellable.
You may also just be an ugly son of a gun.
Plus pretty people convert better.
Anyways, good news is it doesn't cost much to get a pretty person to say stuff to a camera 3 the scene.
17:46
Think showing the yes questions and if then statements.
Example an ad with a.
Person tossing and turning in a bed.
Calls out to people with slip troubles.
BA pair next to an hourglass.
Can call out to people with a pear shaped body.
CA room full of stuff stacked to the ceiling.
18:03
Calls out to people with too much junk.
DA rock hitting a window.
Calls out to people with broken windows.
EA local landmark.
Locals think, hey, I know that place and pay attention now.
This isn't an exhaustive list.
Far from it.
I show you these to pull back the curtain.
This way you can see the infinite ways advertisers cut through the noise.
18:22
So you can too.
Pro Tip Infinite Ads.
Here's one of the highest ROI tips I can give you about making ads.
Record 10 or so new ads every week but thirty or more first sentences or questions to begin the ad, think 5 second clips.
These are the call outs people consume before deciding to watch more.
18:40
With 30 call outs and 10 main ads, you can make 300 variations in a matter of hours.
Once you know the best call out, you apply to all the ads action step.
I'm always impressed with the clever and innovative ways advertisers call out their prospects.
So instead of muting or hitting skip ad, look for the call outs.
18:57
Become a student of the game.
My goal is that for the rest of your life, when you see an ad, you turn up the volume.
Now, once they've noticed our ad, it takes us to the second check of the ad.
We need to get them interested.
Two, get them interested.
If people think an offer or lead magnet has big benefits and tiny costs, they value it.
19:14
They'll exchange money or contact information to get it.
But if the cost outweighs the benefits, they don't value it and they won't.
So the best ads make the benefits look as big as possible and the costs look as small as possible.
This makes an offer or lead magnet as valuable as it can be and gets the most engaged leads because of it.
19:30
A good advertisement, paid or not, uses clear and simple ways to answer the question why should I be interested in your thing?
It tells people why they should want your lead magnet or offer.
Now there are a million ways to do this, but I'll share with you my what, Who, when framework.
This mental framework hinges on knowing the value equation forwards and backwards.
19:48
So all you have to do is know eight things about your own product or service, how it fulfills each value element for your prospect, and how it helps them avoid their hidden costs.
Remember those?
Think of them like carrots versus sticks, how your offer delivers more good stuff and less bad stuff.
Then think of the perspectives of the people who would experience them, The Who, and then finally what time period when they'd have these experiences, positive or negative?
20:11
The what?
Who When framework?
In the words of David Ogilvy, the customer isn't a moron.
She's your wife, so you know what that means.
Write to her.
Ads cause the prospect to think questions to themselves, and a good ad answers the questions at the precise time they think them.
So if you can answer what they're thinking with your ad using the words they use, you've won.
20:31
So let's start with the what?
Eight key elements, #1 dream outcome.
A good ad will show and tell the maximum benefit the prospect can achieve using the thing you sell.
It should align with the ideal prospects dream outcome for that sort of product or service.
These are the results they experience after buying the thing.
20:48
The opposite of that is a nightmare.
A good ad will also show them the worst possible hassles, pain, etcetera of going without your solution.
In short, the bad stuff they'll experience if they don't buy 2 perceived likelihood of achievement because of past failures.
21:04
We assume that even when we buy there's a risk that we don't get what we want.
Lower perceived risk by minimizing or explaining away past failures, Emphasizing the success of people like them, giving assurances by authority guarantees, and how what you have to offer will at least give them a better chance of success than what they currently do.
21:22
The opposite risk.
A good ad will also show them how risky it is not to act.
What will their life be like if they carried on as they always have?
Show how they will repeat their past failures and how their problems will become bigger and worse.
Three time delay.
21:38
A good ad will show them how slow their current trajectory is, or that they'll never get what they want at their current rate.
The opposite of that is speed.
To get things we want, we know we have to spend time getting them.
A good ad will show and tell how much faster they will get the thing they want for effort and sacrifice.
21:58
A good ad will also show them the amount of work and skill they'll need to get the result without your solution, and how they'll be forced to keep giving things up.
They love and continue suffering from things they hate, or worse, that they work hard and sacrifice a ton right now and have gotten nowhere.
22:14
In other words, they waste more time and money doing what they currently do than if they just bought our darn solution.
The opposite of that is ease.
To get things we want, we have to change something, but then we assume that we have to do stuff we hate and give up stuff we love, and ease comes from a lack of needed work or skill.
22:33
A good ad disproves that assumption.
It tells and shows how you can avoid the stuff you hate doing.
Do more of the stuff you love doing without working hard or having lots of skill and still get the dream outcome.
Those are the eight key elements.
22:51
Now that we fully understand the what, how we deliver the four value elements and how we avoid their four opposites, we now go to the next W The Who.
Who humans are primarily status driven and the status of 1 human comes from how other humans treat them.
23:07
So if your product or service changes how other people treat your customer, which it does in some way, it pays to show how.
And talking about the value elements from someone else's perspective shows all the ways that'll improve the status of your customer.
So we want to outline two groups of people.
The first group is the people gaining status, your customers.
23:23
The second group is the people giving it to them.
Spouses, kids, parents, extended family, colleagues, bosses, friends, rivals, competitors, etcetera.
All of these perspectives gives us different opportunities to show how the prospect status may improve, and they give us a ton of bonus benefits.
23:39
As in, if you lose weight, do your kids have a new role model?
Does your spouse now decide to get healthy too?
Are you more likely to get promoted at work?
Science says yes.
Does your frenemy no longer make those little jabs at dinner?
Let's do business examples.
If I said something was risk free, I want to spell out how their spouse won't nag them about the purchase since there's no risk.
24:00
I talk about their kids would notice they weren't as stressed or distracted anymore about work.
How their competitors notice their phones don't ring as much because all their customers are flowing to your new customer.
How their business owner buddies say business must be good when they pull up in a new car at the golf range.
You get the idea.
These are all the added benefits to the prospect we'd miss out on if we only looked at it from their own perspective.
24:19
And we can apply each new who perspective to each value driver.
This is how you get.
So many different stories, examples and angles, etcetera to describe the benefits, more carrot and less stick.
That leads the third lens of the what, who, when framework?
24:34
The when, when.
People often only think of how their decisions affect the here and now.
But if we want to be extra compelling, and we do, we should also explain what their decisions led to in the past and what their decisions could lead to in the future.
We do this by getting them to visualize through their own timeline, past, present, future.
24:53
This way we help them see the consequences of their decision or indecision.
Right now, let's use the weight loss example from earlier.
From their perspective, we'd show them getting teased as a kid past, struggling to button their favorite pair of jeans present or moving up Yet another belt loop future.
25:11
What does that nightmare look like to their spouse?
To their rivals, How embarrassing.
Remember, we can also run the same timeline through someone else's perspective.
Their kid asking why other kids made fun of them because they passed on bad food habits past.
Or how their kids complain now that other kids dads participate in practice when they don't present.
25:30
Or how their doctor said they might not be able to walk their daughter down the aisle at her wedding.
Future note this is all the bad stuff they want to avoid.
Our next copy elements would contrast those with the good stuff that could happen present and future if they buy our thing.
We use both towards good stuff and away from bad stuff.
25:49
Then combine it with past, present and future of the Prospects Life to create powerful motivators in our copy.
Putting the what, The Who and the when together we answer the why they should be interested.
If I continued on with the weight loss example, I might talk about how their spouse who will perceive how fast what they fit into that suit your wife loves that didn't fit but does now in the future.
26:11
When or how their kids The Who month after month the when got more interested in eating healthy and tagging along during workouts.
The what or how they The Who catch a look at themselves in a reflection in the mall a few months.
The when and realize stuff actually fits me in the store.
26:28
The what?
Pro tip.
Make your ads as specific as you can, but no specific.
Or the more specific your copy, the more efficient it can get but also the longer it tends to get.
And if it gets too long for the platform it lowers efficiency.
So make the ad in its entirety as specific as you can in the most efficient space you've got.
26:48
If you've got audio and visuals at your disposal, then use contrast likeness in the scene itself to match your copy.
It becomes more specific without getting any longer and this makes your AD even more efficient and profitable.
When we combine everything we can to get the prospects moving towards the four value drivers while also getting them away from their opposites, the many perspectives we can show them getting status from and the timelines for each.
27:13
This adds up to why they should be interested, and now we have lots of ways to get them interested, and the more angles we cover, the more interested they'll become.
Also since you asked.
The only difference between long ads and short ads is how many angles we have time to cover from the copywriting framework.
Longer ads use more, Shorter ads use fewer.
27:31
So add or take away based on the platform, but keep the call outs the first few seconds and the Cta's what to do next.
The same pro tip get unlimited inspiration.
Many platforms have a database of ads past and present as of this moment.
If you search platform ad library in a search engine in a few clicks you will find them.
27:51
If you see an ad that runs for a long time, a month or more, assume it's profitable.
Then take notes on the callouts they use, how they illustrate the value elements and their Cta's.
Look for the words they use and how they demonstrate them.
Break down 50 or so ads and you will have a massive head start to creating winners of your own action steps.
28:09
Get as many advertising angles with your core offer as you can with the What, Who, When framework, What.
Know the eight key things about your own product or service, how it fulfills each element of value, and how it helps avoid their opposites.
Who Show how the eight key things about your product or service can change your prospect status.
28:25
Then show how the people they know give status to the prospect when they buy your thing or take status away if they don't.
When.
Get the prospects to see the consequences of buying and not buying through their past, present and future, especially their change in status with the people they know.
This way we help them see the value of their decision or indecision at this very moment.
28:44
Author note, you don't need to become a copywriting expert.
I'm certainly not.
You know, I thought copy was the limiter for most.
I'd have spent more time on it.
Sure, world class entrepreneurs have world class copywriting skills, but world class copywriters don't necessarily have entrepreneurial skills.
Don't sacrifice one for the other.
29:00
If you explain your offer clearly using the What, Who, When framework, you'll have enough skill to remove copywriting as the limiter on your growth, and that's all you have to do.
Get good enough to grow.
After all, if you call out the right people and have an amazing offer, you barely need any copy to begin with.
You just got to explain your offer.
29:17
They good enough to make your ads profitable.
Then scale and see what breaks next.
I also include a few more ad tips and tricks that have served me well in the lessons at the end of this chapter.
But even if you never use them, there's only one more thing you'll need to turn these interested folks into engaged leads.
Three, the CTA.
29:32
Tell them what to do next.
If your ad got them interested, then your audience will have huge motivation for tiny Time.
Take advantage.
Tell them exactly what to do next.
Spell it out.
Click this button.
Call this number.
Reply with yes.
Go to this website.
Scan this QR code.
Wink so many ads.
29:49
Still don't do this.
Your audience can only know what to do if you tell them.
Make Cta's quick and easy.
Easy phone numbers, obvious buttons, simple websites.
For example.
A common CTA is to direct the audience to a website.
So make your website address short and memorable instead of Alex's private equityfirm.com/free bookandcourses2782useacquisition.com/training note.
30:13
This comes from a guy who spent $370,000 on a single word domain, acquisition.com.
So I may overvalue easy domains, but I don't think I do.
I think everyone else just undervalues them.
Just my two cents.
Assume the audience has no idea who you are, what you do, how it works.
They're in a rush and they have a third grade education Beyond these basics, which most still forget.
30:31
You can also use all the tactics like urgency, scarcity, and bonuses from step seven from the Engager Leads chapter to make even stronger Cta's.
They apply here and everywhere else you tell your audience to do something.
So we can now pick a platform to advertise on Target who we show our ads to, make the ads they see and tell them what to do next.
30:47
All we have to do now is get their contact information.
Step 4.
Get permission to contact them.
After they take action, get their contact information.
My favorite way to get contact information is a simple landing page.
Don't overthink it.
It's simply your landing page.
The easier it is to test.
31:03
Focus on the words and the image.
Here are my three favorite templates.
Pick one and start testing.
I will describe the three layouts to you.
Layout one is headline, subheadline and then an opt in thing where they can put their e-mail in.
Layout two is headline, subheadline and then an image and then opt in where they can put their contact information.
31:21
And then layout three is headline, subheadline, image where they put their contact information, a submit button and then a few bullets that give them more benefits that are below the fold.
As in they would have to scroll in order to see it to further sell them.
There's the three layouts I use the most and make your landing pages match your ads.
31:38
People click an ad because you promised them some benefit, so care that.
Same look and language over to your landing page.
Make sure what you promised in your ad is what you deliver.
This sounds simple, but a lot of people forget and waste money until they remember it.
You don't want to end up with some Frankenstein experience where everything looks different.
You want to continuous experience from Click to close, get more people through more steps.
31:58
In Robert Kildany seminal work influence, he shows that people like to think of themselves as consistent.
So if you remind them of the action they just took the CTA and show them how taking the next action aligns with it.
You'll get even more people to take the second action, aka contact info.
For example, now that you just did A, you need to do B to get the most of A.
32:18
Or doing A makes you A.
Doing a kind of person doing A kind of people do B.
To be clear, we aren't selling anything.
We're asking if they're interested in the stuff we sell, and if they're interested, they'll give us a way to tell them more about it.
And when they do, they become engaged leads.
Whoo action step.
32:34
Build your first landing page.
I wasted four years feeling too scared to make a landing page and when I finally tried, I finished before lunch.
Nowadays there are tons of drag and drop tools to build websites in minutes.
And if you're still worried about it, freelancers will build a site probably using the same drag and drop tools on the cheap.
So just get it done.
32:50
Now you have engaged leads from paid ads.
Hooray, we did it.
Run paid ads Part 1.
Conclusion.
What has to happen for advertising to work well?
We have to show our ad to the right people.
So we picked the right platform and target people within that platform that have the highest percentage of our audience.
Once we do that, we have to get them to notice our ad.
33:08
Once they notice it, they have to consume it to get a reason to take action now rather than later.
We do that using the value equation and demonstrated the past, present and future from their perspective and the perspective of the people they know.
And once they have a reason to take action, they have to have a way to give us permission to contact them.
33:24
That action turns them into an engaged lead.
And since those things got to happen, they slowly but truly became the three core elements of every ad I create.
Call outs for them to notice it.
Value elements to give them a reason to do something.
Calls to action to give them a way to do it.
Now only one question remains, how efficient are we?
33:40
So let's talk about money stuff.
Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book chapter that you're listening to right now, $100 million leads.
I took a long time put it together for you.
And so my only ask is that you just take a quick second and leave a review for the book on Amazon.
33:56
It's the number one way that people find books.
And this is a way of getting more people into our world.
And so our mission, acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone.
And I need your help.
And so if you could do that, just that one, one small action and it has a trade for the two years that I took putting this book together for you, it would mean the world to me.
34:16
So thank you, run paid ads, Part 2 money stuff.
I'm just trying to buy a dollar and sell it for two proposition.
Joe The Wire.
We focus on efficiency with paid ads throughout this chapter and the last one because efficiency matters more than creativity.
34:33
All advertising works.
The only thing that difference between advertisements is how well they work.
Maybe people get crazy about making paid ads because they have words like copy and creative and media.
Then get hyper focused on getting all that stuff perfect, as if you can you can tweak all day and night until the cows come home.
34:48
The reality is that paid ads, any advertising really is all about the return on your investment.
And with paid ads, it gets clear as day because you put X dollars in for people to see the ad and Y dollars out if they buy your stuff.
So if you want a $100 million leads machine, you need to get it good enough to scale.
35:04
Why?
Because good enough is good enough.
Since efficiency matters most, we want to be as efficient as possible so we can scale as much as possible.
That way we get as many leads as our little hearts desire.
That being said, there's enough nuance to scaling paid ads that it felt better to break it into its own chapter.
This chapter answers 4 big questions about ads as I understand them.
35:22
One, how much do I spend the three phases of scaling ads?
Two, how do I know how well I'm doing costing benchmarks?
3 If my ads aren't profitable, how do I fix them?
Client finance Acquisition 4 What do I wish I had known before I ran my first paid ad lessons?
But how much do I spend on paid ads?
35:38
The three phases of Scaling paid ads There are three stages to spending money on ads as I see it.
Phase one, track money.
Phase two, lose money.
Phase three, Print money.
Let's break them down together.
Phase one track money.
Before spending a dollar on ads, set everything up so you can accurately track your returns.
35:55
If you don't track, you're going to get cleaned out.
It would be like going to a casino and playing your favorite game for as long as you felt like, rather than for as long as you could afford it.
But once you have tracking, you can do more of the stuff that makes you money and less of the stuff that doesn't.
It rigs the game in your favor.
So get a consultant, watch the tutorials, and get it set up.
36:11
End of story.
Once you have the tracking, you can start losing money like a pro wink.
Phase two lose money, half joking.
I prefer to call it investing in a money printing machine.
After all, when running paid ads, you pay first, so your bank account has to go down before it comes up.
I emphasize this because I'd rather prepare you You're going to lose money.
36:30
In fact, I've lost money more times than I've made money running paid ads.
But every time I make money with paid ads, I make back everything I lost and then a bunch more.
So the number of times I lose is high, but the amount I lose is low because I know when to shut it down.
And my number of wins is low because the amount I win is very high because I know when to hit the gas.
36:47
So think of it like this.
Imagine I spend $100 on 10 ads, $1000 in total.
Nine of them lose all $100.
Then one of them makes back $500.00 for the $100 I spent.
I'm still down $500.
Many people stop here because they see a $500 loss, but not us.
37:03
We see a winner.
So now we buckle up and 100 X down.
We spend $10,000 on the winning ad and make 50,000 back note.
I still lost nine times, but the one time I won, I won big.
And this is important because you might lose 9 or 99 times in a row before you win big.
37:19
But to win big, you have to see the winners and double, triple, quadruple, 10X down on them.
This is why paid advertising is a lot like a casino.
You'll often lose in the beginning to learn the game, but with enough skill you eventually become the house.
That being said, during this lose money phase, you can still be smart about it.
37:36
Here's how I do it.
I budget 2 times the cash I collect from a customer in 30 days, not LTGP when testing new ads.
I've wasted tons of money letting ads run too long before I realized they sucked, but on the flip side, I've lost even more money by giving up on ads before I gave them a chance.
Eventually I had a sweet spot by budgeting 2 times the cash I collect from a new customer in the 1st 30 days to test an ad.
37:57
For example, if I know I make $100 in profit from a customer in the 1st 30 days, I'll let an ad go up to $200.00 and spend before shutting it off as long as I'm getting leads.
If I'm not getting any leads from the ad at all before I spend 1X in 30 days of cash, I shut it off. 100 bucks in the example.
38:12
It costs money to build an advertising machine.
I worked with a business that took a year to get paid ads profitable.
It was tough, but other businesses in their space ran profitable ads, which meant we could too.
Once they were profitable, they made their years worth of wasted money back.
The next month.
It costs money to build an advertising machine and that's normal.
38:30
Just make sure you measure the returns over a long time horizon, not next week.
Can you think of anything more valuable than a machine that prints money?
It would be unreasonable for it to be cheap or easy.
Once you start making more money than it costs you to make it, you're in phase three.
Phase three, print money.
If you're making back more than you spend, the answer is simple.
38:48
Spend as much as you can.
After all, if you had a magic machine that gave you $10 back for every $1.00 you put in, what would your budget be?
Right, All the money.
But realistically, you probably have some other constraint on your business that prevents you from unlimited customers coming in.
So here's how I scale my budget.
Instead of asking how much money should I spend on an ad, I ask how many customers do I want or how many customers can I handle.
39:09
So once ads break even or better, I reverse my budget for my sales goal.
If I can only handle 100 customers next month, and customers cost me $100 to get, I need to spend $10,000 to get them.
That's 100 customers times $100.
But since ads get less efficient as they scale, I usually pad my budget by 20%.
39:25
So that means $12,000 / 30 days or $400.00 per day in ad spend.
I reverse my daily ad budget for my lead getting goal, then I commit to it.
If the number terrifies you, then you're doing it right.
Trust the data.
This is how you scale, and that's why most people never do.
How well am I doing?
39:42
Cost and returns efficiency benchmarks.
Efficient paid ads make more money than they cost.
If that sounds painfully obvious and good, you've already got most people beat.
I measure paid ad efficiency by comparing the lifetime gross profit of a customer LTGP with the cost to acquire customer CAC.
I expressed this ratio as LTGP to CAC.
40:01
And measure LTGP instead of quote Lifetime value or LTV.
Here's why.
Lifetime gross profit is all the money a customer ever spends on your stuff, minus all the money it takes to deliver it.
For example, if a customer buys something for $15 and it costs $5 to deliver it, your gross profit is $10.00.
40:18
So if that customer buys 10 things over their lifetime, then they bought a total of $150.00 and stuff.
But it cost you a total of $50.00 to deliver that stuff.
That makes the lifetime gross profit $100.
Gross profit is important in general because it's the actual money you use to acquire customers, pay rent, cover payroll, and everything else to run your business.
40:35
So if you've ever heard me say I'm getting 3 to one on this, I refer to my LTGP to CAC ratio.
I could bear how much I made against how much I spent.
So if the LTGP is greater than CAC, you have profitable advertising.
If it's lower than CAC, you're losing money.
What's a good LTGP to CAC ratio?
40:54
Every business I invest in that struggles to scale has at least one thing in common.
Their LTGP to CAC ratio was less than three to one.
As soon as you get it above 3 to one, either through decreasing CAC or increasing LTGP, they take off.
This is a pattern I personally observed, not a rule.
You have two big levers to improving LTGP to CAC.
41:11
One, make CAC lower, get cheaper customers.
We do this through more efficient ads following the steps we just outlined.
Or two, make LTGP bigger, increase how much you make per customer.
We do this with a Better Business model for maximum money.
I prefer to do both.
For example, if you made a billion dollars per customer, then you could spend $999 million to get a customer and still have $1,000,000 left over.
41:33
You can spend pretty much whatever it takes to get a customer.
No matter how crappy your ads, you'd still probably win.
On the flip side, if you made one cent per customer, you'd have to get each customer for less than a penny to make it work.
Even with the best ads, you'd fail.
I bring this up because we speak to hundreds of entrepreneurs every month.
They often think they have crappy ads, AKA high CAC, when in reality they have crappy business model A KA low LTGP.
41:56
Here's a finding that will probably surprise you as much as it surprised me.
The cost to acquire customers between competitors in the same industry is much closer than you think.
The difference between the winners and the losers is how much they make off each customer.
So how do you know if it's your ads or your business model that needs work?
I use industry average CAC as my guide.
42:13
Research your industry averages for the cost to require customers.
If your CAC is below 3 extra industry average, that's good.
Focus on your business model then.
If your CAC is above 3X the industry average, that's bad.
Then focus on your advertising.
Things can only get so cheap.
Eventually you just got to make more money.
42:30
Think about it like this.
Lowering the cost of getting a customer by $100 will eventually take more work than making an extra $100 from them.
So once your cost is low enough, focus on your business model.
Cost can only approach 0, but how much you make can go up to Infinity.
Increasing advertising efficiency beyond a certain point is like trying to save your way to a billion dollars.
42:46
You feel like you're making progress, but you're never really going to get there.
Never have cash flow problems Again.
Client finest acquisition.
For many businesses LTGP is bigger than CAC Yay, but not after the first purchase.
Boo.
The profit from the customers first purchase is often less than the cost to get them.
43:02
It can take many months to collect the full LTGP so you get your money later instead of now.
This cash flow problem cripples your ability to scale ads and get more customers.
Boo again, but if your customer spends more than it cost you to get and fill them in the 1st 30 days then you have the funds to scale now and forever.
43:19
I call this client finance acquisition.
I pick 30 days because any business can get interest free money for 30 days in the form of a credit card.
And if we make more than the cost to get and fulfill the customer the 1st 30 days, we square our balance.
Now we have 0 debt and a new customer which we can keep profiting from forever.
43:34
Then we repeat the process.
Money is no longer a bottleneck.
This is the key to limits of scale.
Let's see client financed acquisition in action.
Say we have a $15 per month membership that cost us $5 deliver.
That leaves us $10 gross profit left over $15 membership. -5 dollar cost equals $10 gross profit per month.
43:53
And let's say our average member stays for 10 months.
That makes our lifetime gross profit $100.10 dollars gross profit per month times 10 months equals $100 LTGP.
If the cost to get a customer is $30.00, so CAC equals $30, then we have a 3.3 to 1 LTGP to CAC ratio.
44:09
That's $100 LTG P / 30 dollars.
CAC equals 3.3 and it's 3.3 to one.
Our ads make money.
Hooray, But wait.
There's a problem.
You spend $30 in ads and only get $10 back. 10 bucks trickles in one month at a time until you finally break even two months later.
44:28
That's tough.
Make no mistake, you should 100% make that trade.
But now we have a cash flow problem.
Here's the way I fix it.
I immediately sell more stuff.
If ioffer $100 upsell with 100% margins, that one in five new customers take that adds $20.00 of gross profit per customer. $100 upsell divided by 5 customers equals $20 average upsell per customer.
44:48
This takes us from $10 to $30 in the 1st 30 days.
Our break even window.
The first purchase is $10.00, but now the average upsell adds $20.00.
So $10 plus $20.00 equals $30 gross profit per customer in less than 30 days.
45:05
And since it costs $30.00 to acquire them, we break even Great $30 CAC minus $30.00 Cash collected within 30 days equals free customers.
Every $10 a month that comes in there after is gravy.
Now I can go get another customer while I keep collecting that $10 profit per month for the next nine months.
45:22
This is how you print money.
The things you can sell or upsell are unlimited.
If I cover the cost to get and fulfill a customer in the 1st 30 days, I can pay off my credit card then do it again.
It's how I've scaled every company I've started for the past seven years.
Past $1,000,000 per month in the 1st 12 months without outside funding.
With efficiency out of the way, creativity is your only limit.
45:40
Bottom line, figure out a way to get your customers to pay you back in the 1st 30 days so you can recycle your cash to get more customers personal lessons from paid ads.
Number one, don't confuse sales problems with advertising problems.
The cost to get customers doesn't only come from advertising, it just mostly does.
45:56
For example, a company I invested in spent 12 weeks and $150,000 to run paid ads.
They were getting the right leads on the phone, but they weren't buying.
The owner said advertising wasn't work.
The ads worked fine, great even.
Their sales sucked.
The owner threw up his hands and gave up six inches from gold.
46:12
Frustrating.
Confusing an advertising problem with the sales problem cost them an estimated $30 million to enterprise value.
If you're engaged leads have the problem you solve and the money to spend and they're not buying, then your ads work fine.
You have a sales problem.
Two, Your best free content can make the best paid ads.
46:27
Some of the best paid ads I've ever run come from free content.
If you make a free content piece that generates sales or performs very well, nine times out of 10 it'll make a great paid ad note on User Generated content or UGC.
If you can get your customers to create testimonials or reviews using your product, post them.
46:45
If they perform well as free content, they'll often make killer ads too.
Having a system in place to encourage these public posts from our customers is my favorite way to get a steady stream of potential ads.
And the best part is, it's no extra work.
Three, if you say you suck at something, you probably will suck at it.
47:01
Never say I'm not techie or I hate tech stuff.
It just keeps you poorer than you should be.
I said it for wait for it four years.
Then one day I snapped because I hated my website designer more than I hated tech itself.
I was like, if this idiot can do it, so can I.
Four years are wasting time and lost money reversed With four hours of concentrated effort.
47:20
Your turn.
I can teach you how to place an ad in 20 minutes.
It'll cost you 100 bucks.
Worth it?
I hope so.
It's an important skill.
It won't make you money, but you will learn a lesson worth far more than 100 bucks running ads.
It's easier than you think.
In fact, Platform spends zillions to make it as easy as possible so they can make more money.
47:38
Here's all you got to do.
Search how to place a Insert the name of the platform, add, then place one for $100.
Don't go all the way to the end.
Then check it out.

As soon as you do, you're no longer an observer, you're in the game.
47:57
Once you've put all these pieces together, it's time to send it.
Spend money.
Start with an acceptable amount you're willing to lose each month.
Expect to lose it.
You won't be earning.
You'll be learning if you recall from our advertising checklist.
You'll need to pick each line to fill out your action card.
This kicks off your journey and paid ads to get even more engaged leads.
48:13
Here's a sample paid ads checklist.
Who yourself?

How much?
A learning budget, then reverse to your sales goal?
How many 30 plus call outs times 10 Main Ads.
How long?
As long as it takes.
Paid Ads Part 2 Conclusion Paid ads are the fastest way to scale how many leads you get.
We spent the lion's share of this chapter talking about efficiency because once you understand how ads really make money, it becomes much easier to win.
48:50
I've been very successful with paid ads, but it wasn't because I was the most creative or had the best copy.
It's because I knew the numbers.
So follow the steps outlined.
I recommend doing paid ads last for two reasons.
First, the skills from the other three methods transfer to this one.
And 2nd, Paydads cost money.
Money you will have if you start with the other three methods first.
49:08
So learn the skills and make the money from the other three methods so that you have the shortest learning curve on this one.
And once we have all that, we scale it.
We expect to lose money more times than we win, and once we win, we scale the hell out of it.
And that's how we do it.
Paydads is the last of the core four ways a single person can let other people know about their stuff.
49:26
But before we transition to the second-half of the book, I want to show you how to put these strategies on steroids.
Free gift Paydads fast.
Track running paid ads is the fast track.
It's high risk, high reward.
I recorded a deeper breakdown of paid ads frameworks that have served me across industries and price points.
You can find it here for free as always.
49:43

Leads my gift to you.
Money you'll make in the future.
If you think you now know how to run ads.
Or at least you can take your first shot at it and it demystify that for you that there's somebody else who also would feel that way too.
And if you could take the two seconds.
50:01
In exchange for the two years that it took me to write this chapter and make it as clean, as efficient as it was and send it to somebody else, that's that's that's the best way that you can give back to me in this community.
So it would mean the world to me.
And Next up on our on our adventure together is the Core 4 on steroids.
50:18
So this concludes the section of the Core 4, which is the only four ways that any one person can advertise, meaning the only four ways that any one person can let another person know about their stuff.
And the next chapter, talk about how I amplify those things.
You're not going to miss it.
It's definitely one of the most valuable chapters.
50:33
It's also how we scale companies.
This has been $100 million.

So we're going to get wild today on this special edition, $100 million leads, audio book, podcast collaboration folk Free.
We're talking about Core 4 on steroids.
We concluded the Core 4, which is the only four ways that any one person can let another person know about their stuff.
Today we talk about more, better, new, which is the three ways that you can do it and do more of it in a way to make more monies.
0:21
All right, so hope you enjoy this one.
It's going to be a heater and packed four or four on steroids.
More better new if at first you don't succeed.
Use force.
I surveyed the 50 or so faces of the group, all entrepreneurs looking to scale their businesses, each hungry for the missing link that would flood them with engaged leads.
0:40
After finishing a presentation on lead generation, I opened up the floor for Q&A.
The first business owner chimed in.
I feel like I've saturated the market.
I don't think we can get any bigger in the chiropractic units than we already are.
What's your revenue?
I asked. 2 million a year.
And how much do you spend in advertising?
About 30 grand a month on Facebook.
0:58
What's your conversion rate from Click to close?
I don't know.
So you don't track overall throughput?
I guess not.
Okay.
What other platforms do you advertise on?
None.
How much content do you make for chiropractors?
None.
How much code outreach did you do?
None.
1:13
And the 30K you spend on one platform for a $2,000,000 business saturated the $15.1 billion chiropractor industry.
Does that sound reasonable?
A second business owner chimed in before you could answer.
If it helps, I'm in the chiropractor niche too, and I spent 30,000 in advertising across 4 platforms last week.
Do you still feel like you saturated your niche?
1:30
I asked.
You got the point.
I have this conversation daily with entrepreneurs looking to grow.
Typically they figured out how to get enough customers from one platform to get them to 1 to $3,000,000 per year.
It's still not completely predictable and they have their ups and downs, but they have the gist of what they need to do and I've seen some success.
So it's at this point that they hit a wall because they think they can't make more money.
1:47
They assume they've tapped the market.
I kid you not.
I had a conversation with a different entrepreneur making 3 million per year in the weight loss space.
He was worried increasing his ad spent past 40,000 a month would saturate his ad platform.
For context, that platform has over 1 billion active daily users and he was selling weight loss in America, a $60 billion industry.
2:05
Silly, there are more leads out there than you can possibly imagine.
I've used a framework to unlock those leads over and over again, and now you can use it too.
How to get even more leads?
More better, New First you reach out to people who know you, then you start making free content.
2:20
Then you start reaching out to people who don't know you.
Then you start running paid ads.
This is how you do the Core 4 to get engaged leads, and there's really nothing else a single person can do on their own to get them.
But what if you're doing the Core 4 and still not getting as many engaged leads as you want?
Well, worry not.
There are two ways to boost any of the Core 4 to get more engaged leads on your own.
2:38
I use these every time I want to increase engaged lead flow in a portfolio company.
They're easy to remember, more better, new.
Simply stated, you can do more of what you're currently doing.
You can do what you're currently doing better, and you can do it somewhere new.
And just like the story in the beginning with the agency owner, that's exactly what I was asking him Could you advertise more?
2:55
Could you advertise better?
Could you advertise somewhere new?
So let's start with the one I actually do first.
More.
You've done some advertising by now, and you know the advertising that you do works to some degree.
So the next obvious thing you can do to get more engaged leads is more a lot more crank up the volume to Max capacity.
3:13
Even with no improvements at all, if you double your inputs, you'll get more engaged.
Leads make twice the reach outs, post twice the content run, twice the ads, double the ad spend, etcetera.
You won't regret it.
Unless, of course, you hate money.
So while we'll always focus on testing to make ourselves better, which we'll get to in a moment, the biggest increases often come from advertising more.
3:30
Here's how I do more.
The Rule of 100.
The Rule of 100 is simple.
You advertise yourself by doing 100 primary actions every day for 100 days in a row.
That's it.
I don't make many promises, but this is 1.
If you do 100 primary actions per day and you do it for 100 days straight, you will get more engaged leads.
3:47
Commit to the rule 100 and you will never go hungry again.
Here's what it looks like.
Apply to each of the core 4.
Warm reach outs, 100 reach outs per day.
Example primary actions, e-mail, text, direct message calls, etcetera.
Post content 100 minutes per day.
Making content release at least one per day on a platform.
4:04
As you get better, post even more.
Example primary actions, short and long videos or articles, podcast, infographics, etcetera.
Cold Reach outs, 100 reach outs per day, example primary actions, e-mail, text, direct message, cold call Flyers, etcetera.
As with all cold advertising, expect lower response rates, so use automation.
4:22
Paid ads 100 minutes per day.
Making paid ads example primary actions, direct response media ads, direct mail, seminar, podcast spots, etcetera. 100 days straight of running those paid ads.
Use the daily budget we calculated together in the paid ads chapter.
Aim for client finance acquisition.
4:39
Pro tip More ads means better ads means more leads.
Facebook reviewed the accounts of all advertisers on their platform.
They found something curious.
The top .1% of advertisers split test 11 more times creative than everyone else.
Oftentimes it's not that you can't scale an ad profitably, You just can't scale a mediocre ad profitably And the only way to find the exceptional ads is to make 11 times more of them.
5:03
Success leaves clues.
Do what the point 1% do to get what the point 1% get.
Getting better gets you more leads for the same effort.
We want that, and you can only get better by doing one thing testing.
So you do more and more until it breaks.
Then you make it better.
5:18
In other words, if you do more for long enough, your CAC will eventually get too high to sustain.
So you make a tweak and see if it improves.
If it does, keep doing it.
If it doesn't, toss it out.
Thousands of these tiny tests separate the winners from the beginners.
Every action a lead takes before they become a customer is a potential drop off point.
5:35
So I do the most testing at whatever step the most leads drop off.
I call these constraints.
Constraints are the points where the smallest improvement create the biggest boost in results.
That's why they're so important.
We get the biggest bang for our buck.
For example, if you have three steps in your process, let's say 30% opt in, a KA give you their contact information, 5% apply and then 50% schedule.
5:57
But let's ignore the obvious constraint for a moment.
Imagine we improve each step by 5% itself.
So 30% becomes 35%, which is a 16% increase. 5% becomes 10% which is 100% increase, 5% becomes 55%.
6:14
In scheduling, which is a 10% increase in leads, we get wildly different results.
Improving the constraint also comes out the clear winner.
So focus on the constraint, which was obviously in our example the five going to 10, because it's a 2X increase in leads.
6:29
And again, if you're not sure which step is the biggest constraint, find the step where the most leads drop off.
You'll get the biggest reward for the smallest improvement.
Here's how I get better.
I test one thing per week per platform, and I do it for four big reasons.
One, if you test multiple things at a time on one platform, you'll never really learn what worked. 2 steps affect each other.
6:50
A single change can affect results at other steps.
For example, if you change step one and more people opt in but fewer people apply.
No bueno, but you wouldn't know if you change both steps.
If you make one change, you can see what happened.
If you make a bunch of changes, good luck trying to figure out what worked or didn't.
Three, it forces you to prioritize what will get you the most engaged leads.
7:08
You can do an infinite amount of tests, but time is limited, so you must choose your test wisely.
For example, if you only do one big test per week per platform, don't waste it on a color change from red to bright red.
Four, maybe the most important You run the test for long enough to see if you actually get an improvement.
7:27
Too short and you won't get enough data.
Too long and you waste time you could have spent improving the next constraint.
With the size of my team and the amount of money I spend on advertising, one week is typically long enough for me.
In every company I own, I set up a testing schedule.
Every Monday, we run one split test per platform.
7:43
We give it a week and then the next Monday we do three things.
One, we look at the results and pick the winners for each platform test. 2 important We write down the results of the test in a log of all tests.
So the next time we do something, we start a zillion improvements later, not at square 13.
8:01
We come up with our next test to beat the current best version.
If we can't beat the version we're currently running in four tries or one month, we move on to the next constraint.
You continue to allocate effort to make things better, but at a certain point, the effort you put into making things better brings lower and lower returns.
8:16
At some point it makes more sense to invest your effort into something that will bring higher returns.
Only at this point do we try something new.
Pro tip front to back.
Most times in general, the lowest percentage steps usually happen at the front and the higher percentage steps happen at the back.
As in 1% of people may click an ad, then 30% will give you their contact information.
8:36
This is why most times you'll end up focusing on the front more than the back, and that's fine.
Those steps are usually the constraint.
They have the largest return for the smallest improvements, the call out, the value elements, the offer, the CTA, the landing page, the headline, the subheadline, the image, etcetera.
Down the pathway you go in order what the lead will see and then do pro tip, better, more new.
8:54
When talking to businesses less than 1,000,000 per year in profit, I usually advise them to do more first.
They haven't done enough volume for percentage changes to make a big difference.
But once you cross a million in annual profit, making things better can be the lowest cost, highest return thing you do.
So once a business is big enough, I flip the order from more better new to better, more new new.
9:12
So after you've improved your marketing efforts through more and better, the only thing you have left is new places in new ways.
In simple terms, new.
And if you think your business can't possibly get any bigger, let me show you why it can.
Then I'll show you how it can size of the pie fallacy understanding market size.
I have a visual that has three circles, one that's 100% filled out that just says me, one that's 50% filled out that has a middle :) says me plus one competitor and then a circle that has only one quarter filled out, which is me +3 competitors.
9:41
Which is a very sad face.
Most business owners only look at the platform and tiny community they market in, and usually there are only three or four big companies marketing in their niche, so they assume those companies must split the entire market between them.
This is exactly what the entrepreneur and my intro story did.
9:58
Think for a moment about how ridiculous this is.
I call this problem the size of the pie fallacy.
The market is in fact much bigger than most assumed.
A small business uses one of the core four on one platform in one very specific way, with a very targeted audience, and in that same space, advertising the same way there may be only a handful of other competitors.
10:17
They then mistakenly assumed the tiny slice of the universe they advertised to is the entire available market.
This is why most businesses stay small when they plateau.
They think there's no more leads to get.
They believe they got as big as they possibly can because for many, saying I'm as big as I can get is much easier than saying I'm not as good at advertising as I thought.
10:34
This false argument keeps entrepreneurs everywhere poorer than they should be.
When to do new When the returns you get from doing more better are lower than what you could do from a new placement or new way of advertising.
There are many other slices of attention and potential leads sitting just inside the tiny universe of post content.
10:51
They could add new placements, since many platforms have multiple places or forms of content.
For example, on Instagram you can make Stories, Messenger ads, and posts.
On YouTube you can make shorts, longs, community posts, etc.
Or they could add a new platform.
They could go from Instagram Messenger to Facebook Messenger.
11:07
They go from YouTube shorts to Instagram shorts, etcetera.
And once they've exhausted those, they could add an entirely new Core 4 activity.
And if you're curious, the order I pick my next new comes down to one thing.
What will get me the most leads for the least amount of work?
That is the rule.
11:22
And nine times out of 10, it goes like this.
New placements, then new platforms, then new Core 4.
Bottom line, no matter how you advertise, you could do it in new ways, different styles of content or new places.
Think other platforms, then finally do a new Core 4 activity altogether.
11:41
And you guessed it, each of them gets us what we want.
More leads.
Now this is much harder in practice, which is why we exhaust more better first.
But at a certain point you have to expand to new placements, platforms and Core 4 activities to get more people to know about your stuff.
Action step exhaust more better first.
12:00
Once you can't do anymore any better, meaning the returns are lower than putting the same effort into a new platform, then try new Use this rough order, New placement, new platform, new core 4 activity, Get it going, measure how you do and scale it from there using more better.
12:16
Then rinse and repeat More better New summary.
First you do way more of the advertising that works until it breaks, then the next drop off point becomes obvious.
Then you keep that level of advertising up while you go back, fix the constraint and make it better.
So really better and more work with each other more than they work separately.
12:33
The first question I usually ask myself before we invest in a company that needs to get more customers is what's stopping them from doing 10 times what they're currently doing.
Sometimes nothing, so we just do more.
Other times we need to make something better first.
So answer that question and you'll know what to do next.
Only once you've exhausted more, better do the real returns come from doing new.
12:51
First, go with new add placements on a platform, you know, second, go with placements you know on a new platform.
Then once you get the hang of the new platform, use new placements on it.
Once you exhaust that, you can add a new core for activity on top of what you currently do.
That gives you my simple real world way I put the Core 4 on steroids to get even more leads.
13:10
Conclusion advertising is the process of making known.
It's what we do to let strangers know about the stuff we sell.
Now we solve the stuff problem with your lead magnet or offer.
To get them to turn into engaged leads.
You have to tell them about it.
So we spent this section going over the only four ways a single person can advertise.
13:27
Let other people know about their stuff, and to do it you treat either time, money, or both.
And when you do it, you can advertise to people who know you warm, or you can advertise to strangers cold, and you can advertise publicly content or ads or privately through outreach.
As far as what to do when, whenever I build a business, I think about it this way.
13:46
After I do warm outreach to get my pool of customers going, if I have more time than money, I move to posting content.
If I have more money than time, I go with cold outreach or running paid ads.
But remember, you only need to do 1 to get engaged leads.
So just pick one, then Max it out.
Do more, do better, do new and all the advertising methods compound together.
14:05
The money, the systems and experience you earn from the prime method will help you master the next one.
A business that posts free content and runs paid ads will get more out of their ads and their content than a business that only does one or the other.
A business that does cold outreach and makes content will get more from their cold outreach and work their warm leads better than one that does only one.
14:22
Every combination of the Core 4 advertising activities boost each other in some way.
And as a personal note, I've done them all.
I built my first business off posting content and warm outreach.
I built my gyms off free content and paid ads.
I built gym launch off paid ads and cold outreach.
I built Prestige Labs off affiliates which will cover in Section 4I built Allen off paid ads and affiliates.
14:40
Also Section 4I built acquisition.com off posting content.
There are many ways to get engaged leads.
If you master one, you'll be able to feed yourself for the rest of your life.
They all work if you do.
Next up, if you follow the steps in this book, you'll run out of hours in the day.
You won't be able to do anymore any better, let alone add anything new.
14:59
So you'll need help on your journey to the land of endless leads.
You'll need allies.
Those allies come in four different flavors, and since there are more of them than there are of you, they're the key to getting there.
So let's go get them Free gift, bonus training.
More, better, new.
This is one of my favorite topics around scaling businesses.
15:16
Our portfolio CEOs cite this as one of the most impactful frameworks I've given them.
If you want to see a video version of me breaking this down, you can find it here for free as always at acquisition.com/training/leads.
As simple as what you just heard was that framework of More Better new is exactly how I approach every advertising campaign in every single company, which is can we do more, can we do better?
15:39
And I go back and say, why can't we do more?
Why can't we do better before doing new?
But if you need to do new, you might as well know how to do it well.
And hopefully that give you a little bit of a taste of how to do that for your own business.
And if you enjoyed that and you think you could use that in your own business and it means it probably would be useful to somebody else.
15:56
And so if you could take the two seconds, hit the share button, text it to a friend, post it to your story, it would mean the absolute world to me because after all this whole thing, I mean absolutely free rather than trying to monetize it, Hope you'd enjoy.
And next we have Section 4, which begins the lead getter section.
All right.
16:11
So I almost wrote this entire book to get to the lead getter section because today almost all the leads I get are from the next four ways that I introduced advertising.
But I had to explain the fundamentals, which is the core 4, in order to explain the next 4 lead getters.
And this is, I mean, when I advertise this book, I use predominantly the back half of the book to advertise the book I advertised using the first half just to show that I could do it and to demonstrate that it worked.
16:36
But where you go from 100 leads a day to 20,000 leads a day comes from leverage and that comes from the back half of the book and the beginning of that is next episode.
So you won't want to miss it.
This has been $100 million.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
There's what is going on happy Monday.
Hope you guys are having an awesome week so far today.
A I wanted to do some a little bit different than I really have ever done and what I would like to do is actually ask you for something and I'm going to ask for is just how I can help you.
0:43
Now some of you guys who don't know me, we've been in the gym space for a little bit yet a little bit.
Now I had six gems of my own in Southern California which I sold in the end of November 2016 and have since started, Jim launch and helped over 1100, Jim's trying to drown We have a bazillion case studies to show you for that.
1:02
But my question for you is especially those people who haven't, you know, work with us at all or haven't seen anything from us.
I just wanted I just want to see how like how I can help and I really mean that in a genuine way.
So my question for you is what are the biggest bottlenecks that you're suffering from your business?
1:20
Whether that be from a lead generation standpoint, from a how to get people to show up, how to sell people, what pricing, how to fulfill well how to have, you know, great retention how to motivate trainer.
Ders, how to manage, how to how to Outsource the facility?
Like any of those things, anything that has to do with people or process?
1:37
Anything at all, we've done this a lot of times and we've gotten fairly good at it and we also have a large data set that we can pull from because the number of facilities that we have now and because of the number of facilities that we have who are already doing a million dollars plus in Revenue, we know the best the best, the best practices so we can pull from that large data set so that I can help you.
1:58
And so, my goal here, Here is to just give you access to the amount of knowledge that we have so that I can help you solve your problems.
And in the meantime also make a bunch of videos that are hopefully very very relevant to this community.
And so my question for you are, my ask is that if you can just post or comment in this post, any questions that you have whatsoever related to running the gym, my promise to you, is that I will answer them, no matter how many get posts you get on this thing.
2:27
I will answer all the questions.
Via video so that I can help you to the extent that can and I'll tag you in the response so that you can have an answer specific for you.
So I hope that's cool under this little bit different than normal, but this goes for everyone.
2:44
So people who are obviously my gym or words are sweet, are sweet, crew, anybody's and demolish, or even.
Anyways, in this group who has, you know, are like you just came in here?
Yesterday, maybe been here for six months and just been looking around.
Either way, it's cool.
I want to provide value for you.
Guys, and I want to give you access to the data that we have, so I can help.
3:04
So anyways, lots of love, please, comment below with any questions you have whatsoever and I will answer them and I will tag you in the answer.
So I'm looking forward to seeing how this goes









0:01
Today I've got a special episode for you guys on our $100 million Leads Podcast collab.
Between myself and myself, this is the high leverage portion of the book.
The first four of the core four of the book are about how one person can advertise to let other people know about their stuff.
Today is how we get other people to advertise on our behalf.
0:17
Many of you heard about the book from someone else, and this is going to be key because today we're talking about referrals.
All right?
And so the only way that other people find out about stuff, and a way that is viral, is other people, like, letting them know about it for you.
And so if this stuff has proven valuable for you and you've already gone through 2345 episodes of this and you've not chosen to share it, shame on you, all right?
0:37
Because if you've gotten this far, it means you've gotten some value from this, which means that someone else would get value, too.
All right?
So at the very least, if you can leave a review so that someone else can see it, because if you have no friends or entrepreneurs, then leave a review for someone you don't know.
And if you do know someone, send it to them.
And if you're awesome, do both.

Section 4.
Get lead getters.
Get people who get you more leads.
Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.
Our communities building a $100 million lead machine is all about leverage.
An old lady can lift a semi truck with a long enough lever.
1:15
The strongest man in the world without one can't.
The length of the lever determines how much someone can lift.
This is leverage.
We can use the principle of leverage in advertising.
Let me explain.
Someone with Internet can send a message to millions of people at once.
Someone writing postcards by hand can't.
1:32
The Internet allows us to reach more people for the same time spent.
So it's higher leverage.
That means leverage boils down to how much we get for the time we spend getting it.
So we want to use higher leverage activities to get what we want.
More stuff, We want less time getting it good.
And we want leads.
1:48
Lots of leads.
Pro tip Don't mistake leverage for speed.
One person can only move so fast.
A person 1000 times ahead of you isn't moving 1000 times faster.
They can't.
They're doing different stuff.
So the future that feels so far away with leverage is closer than you think.
2:04
Lead getters give you leverage.
Only two people can let strangers know about the stuff you sell you and other people, and there are more of them than you.
People can find out about the stuff we sell from two sources.
We can let them know using the core 4 or other people can let them know using the core 4I call these other people Lead getters.
2:22
When other people do it for us, we save time.
That means we get more engaged, leads for less work leverage baby.
Imagine 4 scenarios.
Scenario one, you are the lead getter.
You do the core 4 all day every day by yourself.
You get enough leads to pay bills, work high leads low leverage low.
2:40
Scenario two, you get a lead getter.
You get a lead getter to do the core 4 on your behalf.
Now the lead getter brings enough leads to pay the bills without you advertising.
You work less than scenario one and get the same number of leads Work low leads, low leverage.
High scenario three.
2:58
You get lots of lead getters.
You spend all your time getting other lead getters.
Your leads go up every time you get another one.
You work all day, every day, but you get way more leads than you did when it was just you.
You work more than scenario 2, but get way more leads.
Work high leads high leverage.
3:13
Higher scenario 4.
You get a Lead getter who gets lead getters.
You recruit somebody who recruits other people to advertise on your behalf.
They get more lead getters every month.
You only had to work to get the first lead getter once, but his leads continue climbing without you working.
3:29
You work less than scenario 3, and you get more leads each and every month.
Work low, leads high, leverage highest.
Now you've got the makings of a $100 million leads machine.
Outline of the Lead Getter section.
The lead getters aren't part of the Core 4 because they're not things you do.
3:45
You don't do affiliates, or do customer referrals, or do agencies or do employees, but you have to do the Core 4 to get them.
They come from warm reach outs, cold reach outs, posting content and running paid ads, and once you get them, they do it for you.
So the Core 4 stacks one time to get them and a second time for when lead getters get engaged.
4:03
Leads on your behalf.
But it doesn't have to end there.
In fact, it shouldn't.
The process repeats.
Lead getters can go get Lead Getters.
So we do something once, then Lead Getters can do it forever.
But wait, I thought this book was about getting leads.
So am I trying to get leads or do I want Lead Getters?
Answer yes.
4:19
Lead Getters start out as leads, then get interested in the stuff you sell and become engaged leads like anyone else.
The difference is they get other people interested in the stuff you sell too.
And ideally every lead becomes a lead getter.
The following chapters explain in detail how to get other people to advertise for you.
And if you want to scale to 100 million plus, you have to understand them #1 customers.
4:38
They buy your stuff, then tell other people about it to get you leads. #2 employees.
People in your business that get you leads.
Three agencies, businesses with services that get you leads for affiliates, businesses who tell their audiences about your stuff to get you leads.
All four lead getters let other people know about your stuff.
4:55
In other words, all four are higher leverage than doing it on your own.
Once you understand the four lead getters, you can build a lead getting machine for every company you start for the rest of your life.
I'll break down how I use all four lead getters, how each is different, how to work with them, when to use them, best practices, and how to measure your progress along the way.
5:13
At the end of the section, you'll understand how to get other people to bring you more leads than you can possibly imagine.
And since we already used the Core 4 to get customers, let's start with something we can do right now.
Get those customers to refer more customers.
Free gift, Advanced bonus.
Get people to do it for you.
That may have been one of my favorite chapters in the book.
5:29
It took me so long to figure out how to recombine everything into a simple model.

Word of mouth.
Best source of new work is the work on your desk.
Charlie Munger, October 2019.
Leila and I sat together on her parents living room couch, the one she watched movies on as a kid.
The faded edges of the coffee table begged us to kick our feet up.
We bounced laptops on our thighs extension cord, snaked around the couch to the outlets down the hall.
6:05
Her stepmother claimed in the kitchen.
This was not a work environment, but we may do 2 years earlier.
I lost everything and met her parents on the same weekend.
Hey dad, I met this guy on the Internet.
He lost everything and has no money.
But don't worry, I quit my job and moved in with him to help him on his next big business idea.
6:21
By the way, can we crash here for a while?
Great first impression Alex, but a lot of change since then.
We were multimillionaires now.
We made enough to buy her childhood home in cash.
Every week, Leila reviewed reports from our department heads.
Oh, yeah, we had executives now, too.
Hey, sales numbers looked a little soft this week, she said.
6:38
Really.
How many did we close?
15.
And sales started dipping last week, too.
Is there anything different on your end?
I don't know.
Let me check.
I logged into Facebook's advertising portal.
Red rejection notifications filled the screen.
Well, that'll do it.
I said.
What?
What happened?
All the ads got shut off.
Well, that's a problem.
6:55
When do you think you can get them back up?
It'll take a day or two to get a new campaign started.
I squinted at the screen.
Something even more alarming jumped at me.
Facebook rejected the ads two weeks ago.
I acted like nothing was wrong.
So we closed 15 this week.
7:10
And how many the week before I asked 21.
Well, I've got good news and I've got bad news.
OK?
She said.
The bad news is the ads got shut off 2 weeks ago.
So that explains the dip.
The good news is our product is so good, we're still doing 500,000 a week.
From word of mouth alone.
7:26
You ignored the ads for two weeks.
She had Oh no, you didn't.
Ridden all over her face, I shrugged with a sheepish grin.
Still love me, right?
We busted out laughing at the absurdity of it all.
Those two years were insane.
The amount of money we were making didn't make sense.
We didn't comprehend how much it was until years later.
7:43
We were just grateful to be doing it together, flaws and all.
And this accidental stretch without running paid ads made something very clear our customers were telling their friends.
A few months later, I stood on stage and looked over the 700 plus gym owner audience.
Everyone paid $42,000 to be there.
8:00
All wore black gym Lord tshirts and stick on mustaches.
It was nuts.
I was mid presentation explaining how excellent service generates leads through word of mouth.
All the while I obsessed over whether the money we made during the two weeks without running paid ads was a fluke.
Feeling confident, I paused the presentation.
8:16
Time to find out.
All right, just to show you how important this is.
Who here learned about gym launch from another gym owner?
Raise your hand.
As soon as the words left my lips, I felt instant regret.
What if no one raised their hand?
What if our growth was all forced?
I'm such an idiot.
I looked around the room with my arm raised like a monkey.
8:33
The room stood still.
Oh no.
Then a few gym owners raised their hands.
That doesn't look great, but it could be worse.
Then more, thank God.
Then more than a wave of hands.
Holy cow.
People looked at their sides and behind them it was almost the entire room.
I let the moment sink in for all of us.
8:49
I'll never forget it.
I knew we had good word of mouth, but not this good.
That, I said, is the power of word of mouth.
I know you weren't there when Lela and I realized we're making 500,000 plus per week from word of mouth.
I know you weren't there to see $30 million.
And customers say someone referred them.
9:05
The first time I realized the power of referrals, it was by accident.
Seeing how much it made me, I studied what had gone right.
I wanted to make sure I could recreate it on purpose.
For me to transfer that ability to you, I have to transfer the beliefs that created it.
And these experiences form those beliefs.
This is why I share them.
People copied our offers ads and lead magnets.
9:22
They copied our landing pages, emails, and sales scripts.
They copied everything they could.
They did it with little success.
They think it's about advertising, and it is.
But the best advertising is a happy customer.
An amazing product turns every customer into a leadgetter.
The world loses trust by the 2nd.
9:38
Every day more customers do their research.
They arm themselves with information to make purchasing decisions as well they should.
So to play at higher levels, we need our product to not only deliver, but the light customers must get so much value, it compels them to tell other people about us.
The good news is once you know how, it's easier than you think.
9:55
In this chapter I explained how to get the lowest cost, highest profit, and best quality leads out there.
Referrals How Referrals Work The referral happens in somebody.
A referrer sends an engaged lead to your business.
Anyone can refer, but the best referrals come from your customers.
So this chapter focuses on getting more referrals from your customers.
10:11
How Referrals Grow Your Business Referrals are important because they grow your business in two ways #1 They're worth more.
Higher LTGP referrals Buy more expensive stuff and buy it more times.
They also tend to pay more in cash upfront.
Lovely.
Two, they cost less, aka lower CAC.
10:28
If one customer sends you another customer because they like yourself, that new customer costs you nothing.
And free customers are cheaper than customers that cost money.
So free customers equals good.
But what does this stuff really mean?
Check this out.
Imagine you had an LTGP to CAC ratio of four to one.
That means it costs you 25% of your lifetime gross profit of 1 customer to get another.
10:46
Not bad.
But now imagine if every customer brought you two more customers.
You now have an LTGP to CAC ratio of 12 to one.
You'd use just over 8.3% of your lifetime gross profit to get a new customer.
So you'd get 3 customers for the price of 1.
Now we're talking Hooray, what a deal.
11:04
On top of that, referrals are exponential.
Let me explain the number of engaged leads you get from the core 4.
Depends on how much you do them.
The inputs to outputs are pretty linear relationships.
If you do 100 reach outs, you get engaged leads.
If you double it, your leads roughly double.
If you spend $100 in ads, you get engaged leads.
11:19
If you double it, your leads roughly double.
So no matter how well you advertise, how much you get depends on how much you do, and that's great.
But with word of mouth, we can do even better.
With word of mouth, one customer brings 22, bring 4/4, bring 8, and so forth.
It's not linear, it's exponential.
Nothing scales like word of mouth.
11:34
Want to know why so few people scale by word of mouth?
They lose customers faster than they get them.
Look at the referral growth equation to see it in action.
Referrals in minus churn customers out.
So the visual is percentage of clients referred monthly minus percentage of clients churned monthly equals percentage monthly.
11:53
Compounding growth.
If referrals are greater than churn, you grow without any other advertising.
Yay.
If referrals are equal to churn, you need other advertising to grow your business.
Meh.
If referrals are less than churn, you've got to advertise to break even.
12:09
Boo.
That's most folks.
This gets nutty when you look at percentages.
If the percentage of referrals every month is bigger than the percentage of customers who leave, your business compounds every month, You'd have to spend that much more money on ads, do that many more reach outs, or post that much more content just to maintain that growth.
12:24
You eventually hit a wall, but with referrals, you can maintain growth no matter how big you get.
This is how companies like PayPal and Dropbox exploded into multibillion dollar businesses.
I'll break down their exact strategies later in the chapter.
On the other hand, small businesses barely scrape by because they have about the same customers exiting as they do entering a hamster wheel of death.
12:43
Here's why.
Two Reasons Most businesses don't get referrals Most businesses don't get referrals for two reasons.
First, their product isn't as good as they think it is.
Second, they don't ask for them.
You're not making as much money as you want because you're not as good as you think you are.
Problem #1 The product isn't good enough.
13:01
Everyone loves our stuff.
We just need to get the word out, says every small business owner with a product that's not as good as they think it is.
I'm going to take off my nice guy hat for a second.
If your product were exceptional, people would already know about it and you'd have more business than you could handle.
So if you sell direct to consumers and they're not bringing more customers, your product has room to improve.
I like to ask myself, why.
13:18
Are my customers too embarrassed to tell everyone they know about my product?
It may be OK, but it's unremarkable, as in not worthy of remark.
In fact, most of the stuff I pay for kind of sucks.
My pool guy forgets stuff half the time.
My landscapers make a ton of noise at the worst hours.
My cleaners routinely put my clothes in my wife's closet.
13:33
I guess that's what I get for extra medium T-shirts.
The list goes on.
Business owners wonder why they don't get referrals.
The answers right in front of them, they're just not good enough.
Let me show you how I think about it.
Price is what you charge.
Value is what you get.
The difference between price and value is goodwill.
This means that the price not only communicates value, but is also how we judge value.
13:53
Economics dorks call it customer surplus, but I'm just going to call it goodwill.
You want lots of goodwill?
Lots of goodwill creates word of mouth.
Word of mouth means referrals.
There are two ways to build goodwill with your customers.
You can lower your price or you can give more value.
After all, if you lower the price of your product, enough people would line up to get it, but you'd probably lose money.
14:12
So lowering the price is at best a temporary solution.
You can only lower the price so much for so long.
And as marketing legend Rory Sutherland says, any fool can sell something for less.
So to build goodwill, to get referrals, the question isn't how do we lower our price, but how do we give more value.
Six ways to get more referrals by giving more value.
14:31
There are six ways I get referrals by giving more value, and it just so happens to map to the parts of an ad.
NITO.
One call outs sell better customers 2.
Dream outcome Set better expectations 3.
Increase perceived Likelihood of Achievement.
Get More People better results 4.
14:49
Decrease time Delay.
Get faster results 5.
Decrease effort and sacrifice.
Keep making your stuff better.
Six call to action.
Tell them what to buy next.
So let's start with the first call outs.
Sell better customers.
We want to sell better customers because they get the most value from our products.
15:05
Customers get the most value, have the most goodwill and the customers that have the most goodwill are most likely to refer.
Yes, it's that simple.
Let me give you a real life example.
We have a portfolio company that did public relations for small businesses.
They had a lot of sales but they had a lot of churns, so they plateaued.
They didn't grow for years.
15:20
To see what we could do, we looked at their lowest turning customers to see if they had anything in common.
They did.
They were all on a specific niche and looking to raise funding from investors.
So the solution looked obvious.
Get more of them.
But the founder had a big worry.
These customers were only 15% of his business.
If he changed his targeting and it failed, he would lose 85% of his business.
15:39
But the business wasn't growing anyway.
A tough situation for any entrepreneur.
But after reviewing the data many times, he agreed to change the advertising call outs to match his narrow, perfect fit customer.
The results?
The company broke through its plateau.
They grew for the first time in years and now we're on track to adding millions per month.
15:55
Plus their cost of advertising, a huge expense for the stagnating business went down.
They got even cheaper leads since they could be more specific with their messaging.
But not only that, the cheaper leads got even more value from the product because it was meant for them.
And those customers, because they had more goodwill towards the business, started referring the clockwork action step.
16:11
Increase the quality of the prospect and you'll increase the quality of the product.
Figure out what your most successful customers have in common.
Use those similarities to target a new audience that has the greatest chance of getting the most value who are just like them.
Then sell only people who meet those new criteria.
Set yourself up to build more goodwill.
16:27
More goodwill means more referrals. 2 dream outcome Set better expectations.
The fastest, easiest and cheapest way to make your product remarkable is make it better than they expect.
And that's easier than you might think because you set the expectation.
Pro tip Dating advice on 1st dates.
16:44
I like to set the bar as low as possible by admitting all my flaws.
After telling my now wife all my flaws, I joked I can only go up from here.
If you've had a stranger tell you a new movie was awesome then you go see it and think that wasn't as good as I expected.
On the flip side, have you ever had someone tell you movie was terrible and then you ended up seeing it anyways and thought that wasn't as bad as I expected?
17:02
Our expectations of an experience can dramatically affect the experience itself.
We can increase goodwill by lowering expectations.
It gives us room to over deliver.
In the beginning I promised everything in the kitchen sink to get people to buy.
The feeling on that turned into a nightmare, so I began inching down my promises while maintaining quality.
17:17
It gave me more room to over deliver and I netted a major benefit.
Referrals.
Customer expectations are fickle.
That's why we set expectations for them.
And if we set those expectations, we can exceed them.
Action Step Slowly lower the promises you make when making offers.
Keep lowering them until your close rates lower.
17:34
At that point, stop.
This maximizes how many customers you get and the goodwill you build with them.
Maximize customers and more goodwill means more referrals 3.
Increase perceived likelihood of achievement.
Get more people, better results.
The customers with the best results get the most value from a product, figure out what they do to get the most value and you can help other customers do the same. 2 steps ago to sell better customers we figured out who the best ones were.
17:58
So now to get everyone the best results we figure out what the best ones did.
Let me show you what it looks like.
At Jim launch we started by tracking customer activities.
Speed to running their first vet, speed to their first sale, their tenants on calls, etc.
Then we compared the activities of our average customers to the activities of our best customers.
18:15
We found out something huge.
If a gym owner ran paid ads and made a sale in the first seven days, their LTGP tripled.
Once we realized this, we focused on getting everyone to launch ads and make sales.
In the first seven days, the results of our average customers skyrocketed.
More customers, more testimonials, and more referrals followed.
18:33
Here's the process I used to get more people, better results.
Step one, survey customers to find the ones who get the best results.
Step two, interview them to find out what they did differently.
Step three, look at the actions they had in common.
Step 4, Force new customers to repeat the actions that got the best customers the best results.
18:52
Step 5 Measure the improvement in average customer results, speed and outcome.
Step six, match the conditions of your guarantee to the actions that get the best results to get more people to do them.
Pro tip, make the success activities the conditions of your guarantee.
Do not do this if you hate money and helping people.
19:11
As soon as you start getting customers results, note what they did.
Then start guaranteeing new customers those results.
But do it on the condition that they do what the best customers did.
The guarantee sells more people.
The conditions get them better results.
You win, they win action steps.
19:28
Figure out what the best people did, then get everyone to do it.
Make your guarantees around the actions that create the most success.
More success, more goodwill, more referrals.
Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book chapter that you're listening to right now, $100 million leads I took a long time putting together for you.
19:46
And so my only ask is that you just take a quick second and leave a review for the book on Amazon.
It's the number one way that people find books.
And this is a way of getting more people into our world.
And so our mission, acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone.
20:02
And I need your help.
And so if you could do that, just that one, one small action and it has a trade for the two years that I took putting this book together for you, it would mean the world to me.
So thank you. #4 Decrease time delay.
Make faster wins.
20:18
I define a win as any positive experience a customer has.
Faster wins increase the perception of speed, increase the likelihood they'll stick and increase how much they trust you.
Triple win.
To make wins feel faster, we give them wins more often.
Let's imagine you have a product that takes a week to deliver.
The customer can get one win at the end of the week or win every day with daily progress updates.
20:37
Same amount of progress, seven times the wins.
On top of that, if someone said seven things would happen and all seven do I trust them?
Even more referring a friend is now at lower risks and seven promises were made and all seven were kept.
Here's five ways I make wins happen faster in the real world.
One, if I have seven small things to deliver, I deliver them at shorter intervals rather than all at once. 2 updates are wins.
21:01
If it's a bigger project, I share updates as frequently as possible.
You can never give someone too much good news and regular updates.
Progress or not is better than leaving your customers hanging. 3.
Customers form their lasting impression of a business within 48 hours after they buy.
Force a good impression.
Force as many ones as you can in that window.
21:18
Set many expectations.
Meet many expectations.
Repeat.
Four They should always know the next time they'll hear from you.
I got a slick saying from a public CEO friend of mine.
Bam Fam.
Book a meeting from a meeting again.
Never leave a customer in no man's land.
They should always know what happens next.
21:36
Five.
Never expect customers to forgive you.
Ever.
So act like it.
For example, you can deliver early but never late.
I add 50% to my timeline, so I always deliver early.
That makes on time for me, early for them.
Action step.
Breakdown outcomes into the smallest possible increment.
21:52
Communicated as often as reasonable even if there's no progress.
Update them.
Set timelines with breathing room.
Deliver early.
More customer wins means more goodwill.
And more goodwill means more referrals 5.
Decrease effort and sacrifice.
Keep making your stuff better.
If the customer does less stuff they hate to benefit from your product, you've made it better.
22:11
If the customer gives up fewer things they love to benefit from your product, you've made it better.
And there's no such thing as a perfect product.
You can always make it better, and the easier you make it for them to benefit, the more goodwill you get and the more likely they'll refer.
Here's my process to keep making my stuff better.
Step one Use customer service data, surveys and reviews to find the most common problem with your product.
22:28
Step 2.
Figure out your fix to get a head start.
Get feedback from the customers who made your product work despite the problem it has.
Step 3 Use that feedback to improve your product.
Step 4 Give the new version to a small group of your struggling customers.
Step 5 Get your next round of feedback.
If you solve the original problem, then roll it out to all customers.
22:46
If it didn't, go back to Step 2.
Step 6 Move on to the next most common problem and repeat the process.
Do this until the end of time.
Action Step Keep making yourself better.
Survey.
Make changes.
Implement, measure, repeat.
I run this process every month.
Set this as a recurring monthly process in your business.
23:02
A product that takes less effort and has fewer sacrifices means more goodwill and more goodwill.
You guessed it means more referrals 6 Call to action.
Tell them what to buy next.
If you have an amazing product, they'll want more.
You have to satisfy their desire to buy.
23:18
If you don't, they'll still buy, but from someone else.
Don't let that happen.
Sell them again.
You can either sell them a new thing or more of the thing they just bought.
In either case, you'll get even more goodwill and extend the lifetime of the customer.
And besides, the more stuff they buy, the more stuff they can refer their friends to.
For example, in a weight loss company we know lots of customers referred friends to their first year product, but some didn't.
23:39
A lot of those customers who didn't refer to the first product when they bought their more expensive thing referred their friends to that.
So you just got to keep selling.
In my experience, people obsess over their front end offers and that makes sense, but then they neglect the back end and customers fall off.
And customers that fall off your product are unlikely to refer, so keep selling them so they don't action step.
23:57
Treat every customer like it's the first time you sold them to make sure your next offer is more compelling than your first.
Remind them to buy more after each big win.
More things to buy means more opportunities to add even more value.
More value means more goodwill and more goodwill.
You guessed it means more referrals.
One question to rule them all.
24:14
Let's consolidate these six steps into one thought experiment.
I encourage you to try it out with your team.
Here it is.
You've lost all your customers but one.
The gods of advertising ban you from doing the core for and decree all customers must come from this one customer.
Violate our terms and we will destroy your business and every other business you start for eternity.
24:32
Tough break, but the question remains, how would you treat this customer?
What would you do to make their experience so valuable?
They would send all their friends.
What kind of results would they need to get?
What would their onboarding be?
What type of customer would you pick?
Think about it.
Write it out.
Your business depends on it.
Then do it.
24:48
Start acting like the advertising gods will revoke your Core 4 privileges at any moment.
Soon you'll see you have no choice but to start adding more value to get more customer referrals.
Now that we covered that, do you want to know how you can get even more referrals?
Ask for them.
Referrals.
25:04
Ask for them.
Do you know why businesses have so few referrals compared to what they could have?
They never asked for them.
Your customers, like any audience, can only know what to do if you tell them now.
I've tried a lot of referral strategies.
Most failed and I struggled until I had this epiphany.
Asking for referrals only works when you treat it like an offer.
25:20
The referrals come when you show the value the customer gets when they refer their friends.
Let me give you 2 quick case studies to show you the power of asking for referrals.
Case study number one, Dropbox gave free storage to customers and free storage to their friends they referred The referral program went viral and they 39 xed their business in 15 months.
25:40
Case study Two.
PayPal gave $10 in credit to customers and $10 to the friends they referred.
Within two years the program helped them reach 1,000,000 users and six years later they hit 100 million users.
They still use it today.
So how do we harness the same viral growth in our own small business?
25:57
We do what they did.
We asked for it seven ways to ask for referrals.
There are three components to referral program, how you give the incentive, what you incentivize with and how you ask rather than give you 100 variations that may or may not work.
Here are the seven combos that worked best for me.
26:13
Number 11 sided referral benefit.
I'd rather pick customers than a platform any day of the week.
Pay your average cost to require customer aka CAC to the referr or the friend.
Make them aware of the incentive.
Example, imagine it costs $200.00 to get a customer.
26:29
Ask the current customer to make an actual 3 way introduction to a friend via call, SMS or e-mail, not just a name and number.
Also ask them to do it right when they buy, don't wait.
Then write them a check for $200.00 when their friend signs up.
Or give their friend $200.00 off example two.
26:47
This works great for spouses because they both basically get the benefit.
Always ask for the spouse and give a household discount. 22 sided referral benefits.
This is what drop backs of PayPal used.
We pay our CAC to both parties, half goes to the referrer in credit or cash and half goes to the friend in credit.
27:05
This way they both benefit.
Example we sell $500 programs.
Our cost to get a customer is $200.
For every friend someone refers, we give them $100 in cash and give the friend $100 off signing up.
Good for up to three friends.
This worked really well for my local businesses.
27:21
Protip, run your paid ads for free.
In our service businesses, we routinely get an additional 25 to 30% of signups as referrals if we ask for referral right when they signed up.
So if we signed up 100 clients for a promotion, we'd usually get another 25 to 30 clients from referrals.
27:38
And since we always operate above 3 to 1 LTGB to CAC ratio, the cash referrals often cover the cost of ads and some bingo, bingo #3 ask for a referral right when they buy.
On the sales contracts or checkout page, ask for some names and phone numbers of people they'd like to do this with.
27:56
Show them how they will get better results when they do it with a friend.
Example, I had a new salesman come into one of My Portfolio companies and shatter all the sales records for an upcoming event.
We didn't know what was going on, so I hopped on the phone with him.
How are you selling more tickets than everyone else?
He shrugged and said I'm doing the same thing as everyone else.
28:12
I just make sure I ask them who else they'd want to have come with them, then ask them to introduce me.
Half his sales were from referrals.
So simple and yet no one does it.
Scripting example, people do our program with someone else tend to get three times the results.
Who else could do this program with you?
Very simple pro tip, not if, but who you want.
28:32
Someone is a customer.
Be more direct with your ask.
Don't ask if they know someone, ask who they know.
Four.
Add referrals as a negotiation chip.
On top of that, you can ask for referrals as a way to negotiate a lower price.
In other words, if someone wants to pay $400.00 and your price is 500, you can give them a discount in exchange for an introduction to three friends.
28:52
You can ethically charge a different price for the same thing because you change the terms of the sale.
Example I can't do anything less than 500 down, but if you make a three-way text introduction to a few friends right now, I'd be happy to cut that initiation fee.
And to address the question, you didn't ask if a full price customer finds out you gave someone else a discount, which I've had happen.
29:08
Here's all you say.
Yeah, Stacy got $100 off because you referred 3 friends.
I'm happy to give you $100.
If you refer me three friends.
Who do you have in mind?
They either back off or they give you 3 friends.
Win Win #5 Referral events where people get points, credits, dollars, or even just bragging rights for bringing friends within an explicit time period.
29:27
Referral events typically last from one to four weeks.
Whenever you run one of these events, sell everyone on the benefits of working with others.
Use some stats, internal or external to show high success rates and the selfish benefit of bringing friends.
I use names like Bring a Friend Promotion, Spouse Challenge Accountability, Buddy Coach Challenge Promotion where you create teams with your employees and customers.
29:47
This works well in coaching style businesses 6 ongoing referral programs.
Instead of running a limited duration referral promotion, you talk about the benefits of doing things with others all the time.
Think in your free content outreach, paydads, etcetera.
After a buddy did this, he saw a 33% boost in total signups.
30:05
For context, he had a million customers buy tickets to his virtual event and 250,000 of them were referred.
This stuff works. 7 Unlockable Referral Bonuses create bonuses for people who one, refer and two leave a testimonial.
A few examples unlock VIP bonuses, courses, tokens, status, training, merchandise, service levels, premium support, additional hours of service, etcetera.
30:29
Unlockable referral bonuses work well if you don't like paying out cash.
The bonuses can also be for both parties if you like, since they cost you less than cash.
Visit the lead magnet section for some extra inspiration.
As always, the more insane you make the offer, the more people will refer.
If you want them to refer, make it so good they'd be stupid not to.
30:48
You're only limited by your creativity.
Here's what it looks like to combine a few of the strategies above into a killer referral promotion.
Give everyone a gift card for 1/3 the cost of their program.
Tell them they can give it to a friend of theirs if they sign up with them.
Give the gift card an expiration date within 7 to 14 days from the date you give it to them.
31:05
It'll force them to use it.
This gives the refer status when they give it to their friend.
Rather than saying hey join this program for $2000 off they say hey I got this gift card for $2000 Do you want to use it?
I don't want to waste it.
It's seen as a much bigger deal for them and you.
You can still use the three-way introduction with this tactic.
31:22
Then text a picture of the gift card.
Bonus points if you write the friend's name on it before texting the picture.
It makes it feel personalized and gives you a legitimate reason for asking for the friend's name.
Wink, PS:.
You can also sell the gift cards at 90% off as purchasable gifts only for friends of customers.
31:39
The referral looks like they spent a lot of money and you get paid to get new customers.
I can hardly think of a better way to make money.
Again, the only limit is your creativity.
Pro tip, match the thing you give with the thing you sell.
If you don't want to give away money, try to match the referral incentive with the core product you sell.
31:54
For example, if you have a tshirt manufacturing company, give away free tshirts.
Makes a lot of sense because your incentive will attract people who actually want tshirts and they're more likely to become paying customers.
Hint, that's why the gift card works so well.
On the other hand, if you give away an amazing limited edition T-shirt for your IT services business, it may or may not attract people who want IT services.
32:13
So try to match the thing you give with the thing you sell.
Conclusion Referrals aren't an advertising method you can do.
It's not 1 trick or hack, although we learned some of those.
It's a way of doing business and it starts with you.
After all, referring is always a risk for the customer.
They risk their goodwill with their friend in the hopes of getting more by showing them something cool your stuff.
32:32
So customers only refer when they think it's very likely their friend will have a good experience.
In other words, when the benefits to them personally outweigh the risk of hurting a relationship with that friend.
So we add benefits for them and their friends with incentives, and we lower the risk by building goodwill, showing we deliver on our promises.
And we do that by using the six ways to give your customers more valuable.
32:49
Now don't get me wrong, building goodwill does a fantastic job of getting referrals on its own.
But if we're smart, which we are, we capitalize on that goodwill.
So we get even more referrals by using the seven ways to ask for them.
So give more than you get and you'll never go hungry again.
This is how we treat our customers.
Do this and you can monetize goodwill forever.
33:06
To keep this in perspective, I always remind myself I'm compensated tomorrow for the value I provide today action items, figure out your referral percentages and turn percentages to set a baseline.
Implement the six giving value steps to build goodwill, then capitalize on that goodwill using one or more of the seven ways to ask for referrals.
33:24
Next up, So now we have to figure out how to scale A-Team.
It looks like we'll have to call out potential teammates, show them the value of joining the team, then ask them to join.
Wait, that sounds familiar.
But seriously, if you really want $100 million leads machine, buckle up.
The most valuable chapter in the book is coming up next.
33:40
Employees.
For real.
This isn't a boring chapter and you're going to need them if you want to make the big money, free gift bonus, customer referral frenzy.
If you want to know more ways to use the highest leverage, most profitable ways of getting customers, I just made a training for you.
You can get it here Free acquisition.com/training/leads.
33:59
I hope you enjoy the customer referral section.
I feel like it wouldn't be complete without me asking you to refer a friend to this podcast or the book.
And if you want to read while you while you listen, which is actually how I prefer to consume content, it'll store the book in more places.
I just want you to win so that ultimately one day I can invest in your business and that is Myself's attention.
34:16
That being said, next we have employees and agencies and this one is 1.
That's gonna be a sleeper.
This is gonna be a dark horse.
And this is the one where the big business owners are nodding their heads and they're like can't wait to get to this one.
And the small business owners don't get it yet.
And so I've broken down to huge parts.
34:32
One is that I learned every new platform that you have seen me on 1st by using an agency and an entirely unique method that I don't see anyone else talking about.
And it's how I engage with every single agency.
And I'll give you the script and how to negotiate it everything down the T in the next episode.
34:48
On top of that, I'll show you how I've leveraged employees in order to get more people to find out about my stuff without spending more minutes on it.

Today I've got a special edition $100 million leads episode collaboration with the podcast The Game Myself and myself, A Self High 5 if you will.
We've got two chapters for you today.
Special cooking in the In the Big Cauldron of Money Making Madness that is this podcast.
We're going to be going over employees and agencies, employees so that they can help you do the core for for you except on payroll.
0:22
And agencies are outside entities that will do them for you as well.
I have a really unique spin on how I use agencies, so you're going to want to stay tuned for that.
So I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Employees, if you want to go fast to go alone, if you want to go far, go together.

African proverb, June 2021, the new sales director piped up.
I know we came into our goal again, but I don't think we need to change anything.
We'll hit it this quarter.
I started around the room and looked in every direction but mine.
The silence was long enough for the executive assistant to mark the topic covered and move on.
0:57
No wonder we missed our cold outreach goal for the second quarter in a row.
Nobody challenged the failure.
What?
So now we think the third time's the charm.
Wait, I said.
Now everyone looked in my direction.
I'd like to know why we didn't hit this two quarters in a row.
I know we can sell.
So if we want to make more sales with cold outreach, then we do more cold outreach.
1:14
What's the issue?
We lose a Rep every four weeks?
The sales director said.
Aha okay, Why is our turn so high?
I was wondering the same thing, but HR says we're actually below industry average turn for this position, he continued.
But by the time we hire an onboard one, another one.
1:30
Turns out I saw the HR director nodding in agreement.
Getting warmer, okay.
So the issue is hiring.
I said, what's the hiring situation look like?
We hire one out every four candidates HR pushes to us.
So if they turn out as fast as we hire them and you only hire one out of every four, that means you get like one candidate a week.
1:49
Yeah, about that.
Almost there.
Gotcha.
Now I looked at the HR director, What's the screening situation look like?
We get one qualified candidate per 10 screening interviews, give or take, she said.
So it takes 40 interviews to get a single low skilled frontline worker.
I guess.
2:05
So bingo.
All right, we need to change things up.
I said we're bottlenecked at the one to one screening.
Start interviewing in groups and look for the crazies there.
Push everyone else with a good work ethic and basic social skills over to sales.
We can teach the rest agreed.
The team nodded.
Within six weeks, hiring outpaced turn.
2:23
Our code outreach sales increased in lockstep.
By the end of the quarter, cold outreach sales had doubled and made-up more than half our total sales.
The issue wasn't cold outreach method, skills, or offer at all.
We just didn't have enough people doing code outreach.
If you use the methods in this book, you'll see more engaged leads flow into your business.
2:39
More engaged leads means more customers, but as you grow, so does your workload.
In due time, it will take more work than a single person can handle, and you can solve the problem of too much work for one person by having more people work.
In short, to advertise more, you'll need more workers.
And this chapter will show you how employees work, why they make you wealthy, how to get them, and the method I use to turn them into lead getters.
3:00
How Employees Work.
Lead Getting employees are people who work in your business that you train to get you leads.
They get you leads the exact same way you got your own leads in the beginning.
They can run ads, they can make and post content, and they can do outreach.
They could do any advertising you train them to do so.
More lead getting employees means more engaged leads for your business.
3:17
It also means less work you have to do to get the leads.
More leads and less work.
Sign me up.
But wait, not so fast.
Don't get me wrong, employees take work.
They just take less time and work than doing everything on your own.
In my experience, if you trade 40 hours of doing for four hours of managing, you work 36 hours less.
3:34
Brilliant.
And the best part is you can make that trade over and over.
You can swap 200 hours of work per week for 20 hours of management.
Then you trade the 20 hours of managing for a manager who costs you 4 hours per week to lead.
What remains is 4 hours of work for 200 hours of lead getting boom.
Bottom line, employees make a fully functioning enterprise that grows without you.
3:54
Why?
Employees make you wealthy.
For your business to run without you, other people need to run it.
Scenario number one.
Imagine you have a business that makes 5 million per year in revenue and two million per year in profit.
And to make that profit you have to work around the clock in the situation.
You basically have a high paying job.
4:11
But let's say you're okay with working all the hours and knowing your business would burn down if you took a vacation.
Vacations are for losers.
Anyways, kidding Cough sort of.
We still have another important thing to look at.
Sure, you make a bit of money, but your business isn't worth much.
If the business only makes money with you in it, then it's a bad investment for anyone else.
4:28
They may not sound like a big deal right now, but let's consider an alternative scenario. 2, Your business makes the same 5 million per year in revenue and two million per year in profit.
But there's one big difference.
The business runs with value.
This does 2 very cool things.
One, it turns what used to be a risky job into a valuable asset.
4:44
And two, it makes you much wealthier.
Here's how.
First, you get your time back so you can use that time to invest in your business, buy their businesses, or take your sting and vacations.
Second, you become much wealthier because your business is now worth something to someone else.
You turn a liability that relied on you into an asset you can rely on.
5:01
If you have an asset that makes millions of dollars without you, then that means somebody else could use it to make millions of dollars without them.
In other words, your business is now a good investment.
Then investors looking for assets like acquisition.com for instance, would buy some or all of it from you.
And your two million in profit per year, especially if it's climate, could easily be worth $10 million right now.
5:20
So your business went from having almost 0 value to having $10 million of value.
So learning how to get other people to do it for you makes a $10 million difference in your net worth.
I'd say it's worth learning how to do it.
Reminder, you get rich from what you make.
You become wealthy from what you own.
And it took me years to realize this because not that long ago, everything I thought I knew about employees was wrong.
5:40
Have you ever heard?
If you want it done right, you got to do it yourself.
No one can do it like I can do it.
Nobody can replace me.
I have.
I said all that stuff.
I lived all that stuff for years.
Every time I hired somebody, I would compare what they could do to what I could do in my head.
I felt like it was me against them to somehow prove I was more able than them with my own team.
5:59
And this belief, this way of leading people, never made me more money for business.
Nobody can do it but me, and if you want something done right, you got to do it yourself.
Aren't facts, they're false.
Somebody did similar stuff before you were around, and somebody will continue doing some version of it after you're gone.
In one way or another, everyone is replaceable.
6:15
It might be by multiple people, technology or later in time, but everyone can be replaced.
My suggestion?
Replace yourself as soon as you can.
Then you can make yourself useful somewhere else.
Many other people figure this out, and so can you.
In the early days, whenever I started a business, I could do stuff better than the people I hired.
6:31
My entire workforce always ended up looking like a ragtag group of misfits who could kind of do one of many things I could do.
This got me up and running at first, but I fell into the trap of believing I was better than everyone else.
I would go back and forth between gloating because I was better than them and complaining because they weren't as good as me.
6:48
And for whatever reason, it never occurred to me I was the one who hired and trained them.
Who was that kidding?
The reality was twofold.
First, I didn't have the skills to train or lead A-Team properly.
Second, I was too poor.
And then, when I had a little money, too cheap to hire anyone better.
In other words, it was my fault they sucked.
7:04
Oops.
The more I tried to out compete my employees, the more distracted I became and the worse my business got.
Sure, at the time, maybe I could do anything better than any of my employees, but I couldn't do everything better than all of my employees.
And when I finally realized this, I started adopting better beliefs about talent.
7:21
If you want it done right, get someone to spend all their time doing it.
If I can do it, someone else can do it better.
Everyone is replaceable, especially me.
These new beliefs about talent not only made it a much healthier culture my business, but also came with very profitable side effects.
Trusting my employees to succeed made my time and my attention far more valuable.
7:40
If someone else can do it, why would I?
If someone else could train them, why would I?
If I could learn other stuff to grow the business while my team held the fork down, It makes way more sense to do that.
So let's do that.
How to get employee leads?
The internal core 4.
Remember the Core 4?
Well, they work for getting employees too.
7:57
Imagine that by changing the frame from letting potential customers know about your stuff to letting potential employees know about your stuff, it immediately turns into something you already know how to do.
But some people have the opposite problem.
They already know how to get employees just fine, but struggle to get customers.
Employees are just other people you let know about your stuff, so you do the same thing.
8:15
Let's line up the actions to get employees with the actions to get customers.
It's the same stuff.
Warm outreach equals ask your network.
Cold outreach equals recruiting.
Posting content equals posting job openings.
Paid ads equals promoted job postings.
Customer referrals equals employee referrals.
8:33
Affiliates equal associations, guilds, listservs, etcetera.
Agencies equal staffing firms.
Employees equals employees because those are the same thing.
The ways you get employee leads and their lead getters have equivalent to the ways you get customer leads and their lead getters.
So when you need to get new talent, you just advertise to get it.
8:50
And when you need more, you do more.
And like creating a reliable process to get customers, you can also create a reliable process of getting employees.
And you'll need both to scale.
How to get employees to get you leads?
Now you hire someone who costs you money every month.
Great.
Let's make sure you get it back and some ASAP.
9:07
Note, some people looking for work will already know how to get leads.
Those people are awesome.
You can also count on them to cost more.
And if you're starting out, you may not be able to afford them.
So your next best option is to train them.
Thankfully, you have an entire book of lead getting at your fingertips.
So the next step is training your employees on how you do those lead getting activities.
9:25
I think about and actually approach training with this Three D's mental model.
Document, demonstrate, duplicate.
Here's how it works.
Step one document You make a checklist.
You already know how to do the thing.
Now you just need to write down the steps exactly as you do it.
You can also have other trusted observers watch you and document what you do.
9:44
Bonus points if you record yourself doing the thing multiple ways and in multiple shifts.
This way, you can watch yourself as an observer rather than breaking your flow by pausing to take notes while you go.
Once you've got everything put into a checklist, bust it out on your next work block and only follow those steps.
Can you do an A+ job only following your directions exactly?
10:02
If you can, you have the first draft of your checklist for the job.
Step 2.
Demonstrate you do it in front of them.
Just like your parents taught you how to tie your shoes, you sit down and walk them through the checklist step by step.
This may take a while, depending on how many steps it takes to complete the thing.
10:17
If they stop you or slow down to understand something, adjust your checklist for that.
Now you have the second draft ready for them to try.
Step three, Duplicate.
They do it in front of you.
Now it's their turn.
They follow the same checklist you followed, except this time they're the one doing it and you're the one observing.
10:35
We just want them to duplicate what we did.
So if the checklist is right, the outcome will be the same.
And if the checklist is off, you'll find out fast.
Fix your checklist until it's right.
Then have them follow it until they get it right.
And once they nail it, you now have a bona fide lead getter on your payroll.
Congratulations, pro tip.
10:52
Give short windows for people to prove themselves.
Most entry level advertising jobs aren't complex.
It takes more grit than skill.
If you train someone properly and they're still below expectations in three weeks, cut them after you train your first few employees.
This way you'll have worked out the kinks for that job and it's pretty much smooth sailing from there, At least the training part anyways.
11:10
Think about it like this.
If you vanish tomorrow, could a stranger get the results you get if they only followed your checklist?
That's the level of clarity to shoot for some helpful notes on training.
A helpful way to look at this training style is if they get it wrong or get confused, then we got it wrong or made it confusing.
11:26
If we have to explain what a step means, then the step is too complicated.
Or, more likely, we try to put multiple steps into one next.
If they only appear to get it after a longish explanation or multiple demonstrations, then again we've got some work to do.
Business owners that ignore this run into chronic training problems and word of the wise.
11:44
You can probably force an inferior checklist to work, but this turns into a nightmare when somebody else takes over your training for you.
Next.
There is a difference between competence and performance.
In other words, they can know exactly what to do and not be that good at it yet.
And if that's the case, then your instructions are fine.
12:01
They just need to practice.
Using an analogy from the fitness world, think slow, then smooth, then fast.
You don't need to change anything, they just need more reps Next, focus on your employees ability to follow directions more than whether they got the right result.
12:17
This is super important because if you train your employees to follow directions then they will follow directions, and if they follow directions and get the wrong result then you know it's the directions that's good.
You have a lot more control over that next Every time they do a step successfully, let them know they did it right.
12:33
And if they respond to praise, praise them.
And if they goof, that's okay too.
That's what training is for.
Don't take over them when they mess up, simply pause, take a step back, and let them try again.
Fast feedback cycles get people to learn faster.
If they follow your directions exactly and get the wrong results, still praise them for following the directions.
12:52
Praise them.
Then make the corrections to your checklist on the spot.
Avoid punishment or penalties of any type for doing the wrong stuff during training.
As a rule of thumb, reward the stuff you want them to do more of, and they'll do more of it.
Learning a new skill is punishing enough we don't need to add to it.
13:08
It's hard to fix multiple things when you've never done something before.
Get feedback one step at a time.
Give one piece of feedback at a time.
Practice until they get it right, then move on to the next step.
Whenever there's a major dip from normal performance, retrain the team.
They stop doing an important step in the process, often because they didn't know it was important.
13:27
Once you figure out the step, reward people for following it going forward.
How to calculate returns from lead, Getting employees, excluding the cost of running paid ads, the cost of advertising, outreach and content, etcetera, with employees is almost entirely best in the amount of money you pay them to do it.
We simplify this by comparing how much money we spend on payroll to how much money they engage leads they bring in.
13:46
Get total payroll divided by total engaged leads equals cost per lead.
Example, $100,000 in payroll divided by 1000 leads equals $100 per engaged lead.
If one out of 10 engaged leads becomes a customer, then our CAC is 1000 dollars $100 per engaged lead Times 10 engaged leads per customer equals $1000 CAC.
14:07
If each customer has an LTGP of 4000, then you have an LGP to CAC of four to one. 4000 LTG P / 1000 dollars CAC equals 4 to one.
For example, at the time of this writing, I get about 30,000 leads per month at acquisition.com.
I run no paid ads and do no outreach, but the team responsible for creating the content that generates that interest is about $100,000 per month.
14:27
This means it cost me roughly $3.33 per engaged lead, 100,000 / 30,000 leads, and payroll to generate them.
We make much more than $3.33 per lead, so we're profitable.
You can apply the same math to whatever advertising method you use.
How to know which employees to focus on to maximize returns?
14:47
Like we learned in Run Paid Ads Part 2, if you're costing it to customers within 3X industry average, then you're doing good enough.
From there you focus on bumping your LTGP.
If your CAC is more than 3X industry average, then you have a sales problem or an advertising problem.
We diagnose this with a single question.
15:02
Do my engaged leads have the problem I solve and the money to spend?
If no, then they're not qualified.
That's an advertising problem.
If yes, then they're qualified and they're buying, but you don't have enough of them, which is an advertising problem.
They're qualified, but not buying, which is a sales problem.
Don't fire your sales guy if you've got an advertising problem, and equally don't fire advertising employees if you got a sales problem.
15:23
That little question can help you identify which employees to focus on.
But fundamentally, you just need to figure out all your costs of getting a customer put together, and as long as they're at least 1/3 of the profit you make over the lifetime, you're in good shape.
Conclusion.
The goal of this chapter was to shift your perspective.
It's your job to advertise and sell the vision of your company.
15:40
You advertise it publicly and privately, to employees and customers alike.
That's the job.
And once you get good at it, you become unstoppable.
I say this because I believe anyone can be taught to do ground level jobs for any business, advertising or otherwise.
So who you pick is not as important as how you train the ones you do.
Like I've said throughout the book, and we'll say again here, it doesn't take a genius to advertise.
15:58
I'd even say it hurts.
We've got plenty more iron wills than brainiacs.
Anyways, remember, this isn't about brains, it's about guts.
And although some people might be born geniuses, nobody is born with an iron will.
After all, we all come out cry babies.
All this to say, having guts is a skill, and that means anyone can have guts if they learn how.
16:16
So if you have an iron will, and as an entrepreneur you probably do, it won't take long for you to figure out that you got it from your life experiences.
You can pass those experiences on as lessons to anyone who cares enough to listen.
Then they can stand on your shoulders and have a better chance of succeeding in life.
And you can't really know anything anyway until you train them well and give them a fighting chance to succeed out in the field.
16:35
Plus, for lowlevel jobs, you'll never have a shortage of Labor.
Get picky when you have to make massive investments and hyperspecific, multiple 6 figures, C-Suite employees, etcetera, AKA fancy employees.
I find at this current stage it's actually better use of time to hire, train and anyone willing.
Then when you find winners and with this method you will treat them well, don't burn them out and give them what they deserve.
16:56
In the land of overflowing leads, you'll need allies.
Employees are among the most powerful of these allies.
We talked about how they make you wealthy, how they work, how getting them works, how to get them, how to get them getting you leads, how to keep them getting you leads, and how to know they're doing a good job.
And once you build a system for getting people who get you leads doing the core 4 on your behalf, you just need to do more.
17:18
Author Note a word on fancy employees.
I explicitly left out recruiting director level and up employees because you can easily qualify for acquisition.com without them.
And once you do become a portfolio company, we'll do it for you.
The next lead getter, the next stop on our advertising journey leads us to agencies.
17:35
Yes, you can pay people to shortcut your path.
I have paid zillions of dollars to agencies and I believe I finally cracked the code on how to create a win for all parties for us.
So we're not dependent on them forever for them so they can make more profit and provide more value to their customers.
They've been key to many breakthroughs I've had, so you won't want to skip this next one free gift, build or buy the talent roadmap.
17:58
The longer I do business, the more I ask who over what and how.
This training may be one of the most tactical and important because no matter what you build, you're going to need help since it's so important.
I made a training outlining this content in more depth with some downloads etc.
You can watch it free at acquisition.com/training slash Leads.
18:17
Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book chapter that you're listening to right now, $100 million leads.
I took a long time put it together for you and so my only ask is that you just take a quick second and leave a review for the book on Amazon.
It's the number one way that people find books and this is a way of getting more people into our world.
18:34
And so our mission, acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone.
And I need your help.
And so if you could do that, just that one, one small action and it has a trade for the two years that I took putting this book together for you, it would mean the world to me.
So thank you agencies, everything is for sale.
18:53
Summer 2016.
I wasn't a techie guy.
I was a fitness guy who had learned a few marketing and sales tricks building my gyms.
But now I had five and I was launching my 6th.
It was time to level up.
Facebook had just released some new features, retargeting interest groups, pixels, etcetera, and I didn't understand any of it.
19:09
I bought a few courses, but ended up more confused than when I started.
I asked a few friends if they knew anyone who could help.
I got two referrals.
Both were agencies.
I was scared.
I'd never used one before.
I'd only ever heard horror stories about advertising agencies, mostly that they cost a ton and never work.
But then I realized that even if they did work, I'd need them forever.
19:26
They'd have my business by the balls.
It turns out my expeditions weren't far off.
They offered to run my ads all right for an arm and a leg money.
I couldn't justify spending with my low margins, but then again, my advertising costs for killing me.
And at this rate, in a few months I wouldn't be able to keep my doors open.
Stressful, I refused the first agent because I couldn't afford it at the time.
19:45
The second call started going the same way.
I began to panic.
How am I going to fix this?
In what felt like a last ditch effort to stay in business, I asked the second agency owner for what I really wanted.
Can you just show me in a few hours how you'd run my ads on my account?
No, you fired back.
My time's not for sale.
Worried, but still hopeful.
20:02
What sort of arrangement could we come to?
He thought for a moment.
Then his eyebrows shot up and a smirk appeared.
Fine. 750 an hour.
Gulp.
His intimidation tactic worked, but at least I knew his time was for sale, so I wanted to find out more.
And for 7:50 an hour, you will sit down with me and show me how you would run my ads.
20:23
Yes.
And I'd be the one doing everything.
Like you'll walk me through what to do and look over my shoulder as I do it, and then you'll explain why you do it that way.
Yeah.
And you're confident you can make my ads more profitable and show me the more advanced stuff, right?
Yeah.
I mean, if you want to pay me some 50 an hour, we can do whatever you want.
20:40
It's your money, he said, half laughing.
It sounded more like it's your funeral.
I paused.
All right, I'll do it.
We'll meet one hour week.
You give me homework, and I'll study between calls.
Fair enough.
Works for me.
You got to pay the 1st 4 hours up front, so that's what I did.
20:57
I placed a $3000 bet on this guy's word that he knew what he was doing.
Yikes.
But every week thereafter I showed up and like a good student, I came with notes and questions ready.
I also recorded and rewatched every call because I didn't want to miss anything.
The first two calls, he took the wheel and I watched calls three and four.
21:13
He put me in the driver seat by calls five and six.
It clicked.
I got how he made decisions and what data he tracked.
At 7:00 and 8:00.
I realized I didn't need his help anymore.
I'd learned how to run paid ads, at least on Facebook like a pro.
And if I had to make a guess, it was because I learned it from a pro.
21:29
In this chapter, we explore a not so obvious but much better way to use agencies to get more leads.
Let's get Cranking how agencies want you to think they work.
Advertising agencies are lead getting service businesses.
You pay them to run ads, do outreach, or package and distribute content.
21:45
For example, let's say you want to post free video content, but you know nothing about making video content or how to distribute it.
You need to learn how to pick video topics, record videos, edit videos, make thumbnail images, and write headlines.
Or you need to hire people who do enter the agency They say they've hired and trained people to do that stuff already, so they promised faster, better, and more cost efficient results than you could get on your own.
22:05
And as soon as I had enough money, it felt compelling enough.
After my first experience with an agency that I mentioned earlier went quite well, I decided to use more.
But my experience with the next 10 plus agencies was different because I used them quote the right way.
Each went something like this.
Step one, they got me excited about all the new leads they would bring.
22:22
Step 2, I'd go through an onboarding process that felt valuable and sometimes was.
Step three, they assigned their best senior Rep to my account.
Step four, I saw some results.
Step five, they moved my senior Rep to the newest customer.
Step 6A, junior Rep starts managing my account.
My results suffered.
22:38
Step seven.
I complained.
Step 8.
The senior Rep would come back once in a while to make me feel better.
Step 9 Results still suffered and I eventually cancel Step 10.
I'd search for another agency and repeat the cycle of insanity.
Step 11 for the zillionth time, start wondering why I wasn't getting results like the first time.
22:55
To be clear, like the introduction of this chapter shows agencies can play a valuable role in business growth, but not the way they want you to.
I don't want anyone else falling into the same trap.
In fact, I hope all the money I wasted goes towards paying down your ignorance debt too.
So keep reading.
It's frankly ridiculous.
23:10
It took me so many years to figure this out, that I actually used an agency the right way the first time.
But now after playing their game so many times, I feel I cracked the how to use an agency code.
And it doesn't come from playing their game at all.
It comes from playing a different one.
And this chapter breaks it all down in three steps.
Number one, hiring an agency versus doing yourself to how I use agencies now and how you can do 3.
23:31
How to pick the right agency.
Hiring an agency versus doing it yourself.
First, let's get this out of the way.
Good agencies cost money.
So if you have no money, then agencies are out of the question.
You got to learn through trial and error, and that's no big deal.
We all start that way.
But if you do have some money, I suggest using agencies for two things, learning new methods and learning new platforms.
23:50
If I want to learn new ways to do content outreach or paid ads, then I hear agencies offering new ways to do them.
They've already made the big mistakes.
So instead of wasting time figuring out myself, I skip straight to the make money part.
I like the make money part.
I also use agencies when I want to start advertising on a new platform.
24:06
I don't understand.
I make money faster because they do the early set up and maintenance for me, and because I get them to teach me how to do it.
Hiring an agency is all about investing in important skills you can't really learn anywhere else.
That is unless you go through all the trial and error to learn it yourself.
And if you did, you lose the time and attention you could have used to learn other important stuff that scales your business.
24:26
And scaling your business is the whole point action step.
As soon as you have enough money for a good agency, start poking around.
If you follow the rest of the steps in this chapter, you'll make it all back and then some.
How do I use agencies now?
And how you can too.
I've become a little more sophisticated than the story I told at the beginning.
24:42
Here's how I use agencies now rather than believe the lie.
I'll never have to learn the stuff because they can do it.
I start every agency relationship with a purpose and a deadline to fulfill it.
I open by saying I want to do what you do in my business, but I don't know how.
I'd like to work with you for six months so I can learn how you do it.
24:59
Plus, I'll pay extra for you to break down why you make the decisions you do and the steps you take to make them.
Then, after I get a good idea of how it all works, I'll start training my team on it.
And once they can do it well enough, I'd like to change to a lower cost consulting arrangement.
This way you can still help us if we run into problems.
Are you opposed to this?
In my experience, most agencies are not opposed to this and if it doesn't work for them, that's perfectly fine, just move on to the next agency.
25:21
But before you start kicking everyone to the curb, be willing to negotiate at some price.
It's worth it for your both Viva capitalism.
This is how I use agencies now.
Like when I wanted to learn YouTube, I actually hired 2 agencies.
The first I hired to keep me committed to making videos while they did some legwork on the platform itself.
25:38
The second I hired at four times the price to really teach us the indepth ideas behind making the best content possible.
And once our videos beat their videos, we drop down to consulting only.
I've used this method again and again.
I hire one good enough agency to learn the ropes of a new platform.
Then I hire a more lead agency to learn how to maximize it and I cannot recommend the strategy enough.
25:58
If you are upfront about your intentions and the agency agrees, you get the best of both worlds.
You get better short term results because they probably know more than you, and you get better long term results because you learn how to do it yourself or your team learns to do it for you.
You also spend the maximum amount of time with their best reps.
Remember, you only get a fraction of the agency's attention, so results get worse whenever they get new clients.
26:17
Meanwhile, your team gets better and better because they stay focused on you full time.
So compare your team's results with the agencies until you beat them.
Then cancel the relationship and put the money into scaling everything you just learned.
Action step When you find an agency to work with next step, set terms with them and deadlines for yourself.
26:34
Use the template above as your guide and feel OK with negotiating a bit to make it work.
Author note, yes, there's a place for agencies.
To be clear, I still own equity in an agency software Allen, so I'm not against agencies.
I just share how I've had the most success with them.
Are there massive companies that use huge ad agencies?
26:51
Sure, they're not who I'm writing this for.
For most people, spending 1050 or $100,000 on an agency is a significant cost, so this is how I've gotten the best return from working with them.
Also, some people never want to learn, and for those people, agencies are great.
I personally always want to learn, which is why I use agencies this way.
27:09
How to pick the right agency.
After working with tons of bad agencies and a handful of good ones, I created a list of what all the good ones had in common.
Now this is the last word on what makes a good agency, but it is useful stuff.
That worked for me.
Here's what I look for one somebody I know got good results working with them.
27:25
If you only know about an agency from their paid ads or code outreach, they probably aren't as good as the ones who rely solely on word of mouth and the best ones do. 2 prominent companies got good results working with them.
I may not know the companies personally, but if I recognize them, that's a good sign. 3A Waiting list When demand for service exceeds the supply, they're probably pretty good. 4A.
27:45
Clear sales process that makes a point to set realistic expectations.
No funny business 5.
No shortterm hacks.
They keep the talk on longterm strategy.
They also give clear timelines for setup, scaling, and results.
Six.
They tell me exactly what they need from me, when they need it and how they use it. 7 They suggest a regular schedule of meetings and offer several ways to update me on their progress.
28:08
Eight, they give updates in simple terms and have clear ways to track so I know how costs compare with results.
Nine, they make a good offer.
Dream outcome.
What is the promise that I want?
Perceive likelihood of achievement?
How many other people like me have they gotten there?
See time delay?
28:23
How long will it take?
D Everton sacrifice?
What do they require for me to do when working with them?
What will I have to give up?
Can I stick with those for a long time?
Ten.
They are expensive.
All good agencies are expensive, but not all expensive agencies are good.
So talk with as many as it takes and use this list as a guide to find the good ones.
28:43
If an agency checks those boxes, they're worth considering.
Pro tip.
Talk to more agencies to become a better customer.
Being an informed customer helps everyone.
So before you buy, get informed.
Talk to five or ten agencies to learn how they work.
At first you'll learn a bunch of new stuff, but over time the difference between the better ones and the worst ones will become obvious.
29:00
Now you can make a more informed decision If the agency doesn't meet my needs, but I like the people, I'll ask them to refer me to another agency.
A good agency offering one specialty will send you to other good agencies who offer the one you want.
Those are some of my favorite referrals.
Action step Even if an agency agrees to your terms, talk with a few more before you make a decision.
29:20
Compare them with the checklist above and then pick the best one for you.
Conclusion Even though this isn't the traditional agency model, both businesses benefit.
They get a customer they otherwise wouldn't have and we get a money making skill for life In the story at the beginning of the chapter, it cost me 8 hours and $6000 to learn a skill that's made me millions.
29:38
Does that seem worth it to you?
It better.
And to make this HC method work at scale, you have to count on a good amount of time where you pay the agency and your team to do the same stuff.
You've got to give yourself some breathing room to get results from the agency, learn what they do, and train your team on it all at once.
Yes, it costs a lot of money, and yes, it's totally worth it.
29:56
When you get it right and get it right, you can.
After agencies put a low level employee on my account for the millionth time, it finally clicked.
This can't be that hard.
At first it took me about a year to get my team better than an agency.
As I got better, it went down to 10 months than eight.
And now I've got it down.
30:11
I get my team as good or better than an agency in six months or less.
And every time I want to learn a new method or platform, I repeat the process.
The better you get, the cheaper it becomes and the more money you make.
Funny.
That sounds a lot like advertising.
Next steps.
One, decide if using an agency makes sense for you right now.
30:27
Two, talk to a lot of agencies to get a feel for the market.
Don't be cheap.
Three, use the agreement framework I outlined. 4 Set a clear deadline to force you and your team to learn the skills 5 Use both teams until your speech theirs regularly 6.
Switch to discounted consulting until you feel like you're teaching them instead of them teaching you.
30:44
Then cut them loose.
Now that we know how to profit from the high risk world of agencies, we explore the leadgetter that's made me the most money.
We recruit an army of businesses who can get us even more leads.
Affiliates Free Gift What to look for in an agency checklist If you want to know the best way to use agencies rather than being used by them, I made a free training for you.
31:05
You can watch it free at acquisition.com/training/leads.
It has swipe files and some other goodies.
I hope you enjoyed the Employees and Agencies chapters from the $100 Leads book.
Next episode we have coming up is going to be Affiliates and partners.
31:20
That was a huge part of how we promoted this book.
It's been one of my unlocks.
I've done over 50.
No, that's not true.
I've done over $75 million in sales from affiliates and partners.
And so learning how to align incentives between you and affiliate and their customers create a winwin scenario.
31:37
There's a very specific step process that you can follow to make that happen every single time.
And when you unlock that, you latch your business onto their advertising.
And so you get hundreds and thousands of people to advertise on your behalf.
And just to give you some proof around this, when I promoted my book, I had over 10,000 people who promoted it with me, and they did it without a financial incentive.
31:58
And so you can do this stuff even if you have no budget.
All right, So that's what we're going to be going over in the next chapter.

Welcome to another special edition $100 million leads audio book podcast collaboration Self licking Ice Cream cone.
Me working with me, handshaking myself promoting this book for free on my podcast.
And so if me being an affiliate of myself today we talk about affiliates and partners.
0:19
It's going to be a heater episode.
This is 35 minutes, one single chapter and then we have a section conclusion.
Which you will definitely enjoy, because if this if you've been watching this or listening to this a few weeks apart, then you'll want to have the recap so you can put it all together in your head into one simple framework.
But today with affiliates, I'm going to be talking about how you picked the right affiliates, what kind of offer to make them, how to get them advertising, how to keep them advertising, and the many lessons I've learned along the way to doing over $75 million in sales.
0:45
Not spending a dollar of advertising on my own, but letting other people advertise for me.
Hope you enjoy.
Affiliates and partners.
Nothing makes friends like money.
December 1st, 2018 I had no idea how the Prestige Labs launch would go.
1:01
I had no idea if our clients would like it.
I had no idea if the technology we built would work.
I had no idea if payouts would happen on time.
I had no idea if our warehouse would mess up orders.
But I did know over a year of preparation went into this launch.
We put everything we had into creating a top tier product.
We spent over $1,000,000 custom building affiliate software and training and we bought $3,000,000 of inventory for sales.
1:21
That may never happen.
It took every business scale I had to make Prestige Lab Trail and in just a few hours we would roll it out to our gym owner affiliates.
I felt like a kid on Christmas Eve and if it didn't work it wouldn't be for lack of effort.
Author note the game podcast Episode 98 titled I remember.
1:38
If you want to go back in time you can hear young me talk about my thoughts and concerns.
The night before the launch.
You can be right there with me.
It's episode 98 on my podcast The Game with Alex or Mosey.
I titled it.
I Remember this is before I knew the success it would become.
To find it, just go wherever you listen to podcasts and search Alex or Mosey.
1:54
It'll come up launch day.
I finished the two hour presentation soaked in sweat.
It's done.
I sold the opportunity to sell my supplement line at their gyms.
I would train the new affiliates to promote prestige labs at their gyms.
So for this to work they would have to go through the training and use it.
But if they did, everyone would profit.
2:11
I had no idea if it would work. 3 weeks later we made $150,000 in total sales.
Meanwhile, $3,000,000 of the product sat in an air conditioned warehouse.
It didn't work.
At this rate, including operating costs and affiliate paths, it would take five years to break even.
Even if we could stick it out, our premium product would expire well before then.
2:30
We were all but screwed.
I felt miserable.
It was terrible.
Who am I to think we would sell that stuff?
I just wasted millions.
How could I be so stupid?
But on the 4th week, something wild happened.
Boom. 100 grand on a Monday.
Boom 110,000 on a Tuesday.
Boom. 92,000 on a Wednesday.
2:47
We did over 450,000 in sales the 4th week alone.
The trend continued 429,383 thousand, 411,452 thousand.
We averaged more than 300 orders per day across 400 plus active affiliates.
Orders just kept coming in.
Check out the snapshot of our internal report below.
3:04
It shows from left to right revenue by week.
I couldn't believe the results.
Sometimes I still can't for everyone listening.
It was 429-380-3411 four O 4452.
In terms of revenue per week through this launch, the best part is I didn't advertise or sell any of the products at all.
3:22
No paid ads, no sales teams, nothing.
The affiliates did everything and the affiliate machine I built still prints money this day.
So that sounds like something you're interested in.
Hang tight because I'm going to show you exactly how I built it, how affiliates work.
An affiliate is a lead getter.
They are an independent business that tells their audience to buy your stuff.
3:39
Affiliates seem like referrals on the outside, but are much different under the hood.
First, they have their own business and do their own advertising.
Second, they agree to offer your stuff to their engaged leads in exchange for money, free stuff, or both.
Now you get affiliates by advertising and then making them offers just like you would customers.
But affiliates demand a unique type of offer.
3:56
Instead of offering your product, you offer a fast, simple and easy way to make commissions promoting it.
And that can mean literally millions of engaged leads to your business.
So this makes affiliates one of the highest leveraged lead getters out there.
Why You want an affiliate army?
Each affiliate you get adds another stream of leads and customers.
4:12
So recruiting, activating, and then integrating with an army of affiliates causes crazy.
Scaling fast, That's good.
We want that.
Compare these two scenarios.
Scenario number one, you sell 10 customers per month worth $10,000 each.
Your business caps at $100,000 per month.
In 12 months, you've made 1.2 million.
4:29
Assuming no other advertising, your business plateaus.
Low leverage.
Scenario 2.
For the same effort, you sell 10 affiliates per month.
Each month, those affiliates bring one of those $10,000 customers.
Now, every single month you add an extra $100,000 in revenue.
In 12 months, you've made $7.8 million.
4:47
And it grows every month thereafter.
Same work, more money, high leverage.
Let's use Alan, my software company.
I grew with affiliates to show how this works in the real world.
Alan grew with three levels of affiliates, Agency super affiliates who brought agency leads, agencies who brought local business leads, local businesses who brought in and consumer leads.
5:04
One super affiliate added ten agencies per month.
The 10 agencies brought in a combined 50 or so local businesses per month.
Those local businesses brought in a combined 2500 leads per month.
Allen worked those leads for about 5 bucks a pop, a cool $12,500 per month.
5:20
But it didn't stop there.
Each super affiliate brought in more agencies, who brought in more local businesses, who brought in more leads every month after that.
So every super affiliate we signed on brought in 12,500 the first month. 25,000 the second month, 37,500 the 3rd and so on.
5:38
With only a few agency super affiliates, we scaled to $1.7 million per month within six months of launching.
That's why you want an affiliate army.
So let's build 1 How to Build an Affiliate Army In six steps Affiliates are among the most advanced way to get leads.
First, you have to convince them to advertise someone else's stuff.
5:54
Second, you have to convince them to advertise your stuff.
Third, you have to keep them advertising to make them a long term lead source.
It seems like a lot, and it is, but I have good news.
I built two companies with affiliates Allen and Prestige Labs.
Together they've done more than 75 million in revenue from 5000.
Affiliates and the affiliate strategies I share work for me so they can work for you.
6:13
I'll break down each step.
Step one, find your ideal affiliates.
Step 2, make them an offer.
Step 3 Qualify them.
Step 4, Figure out what to pay them.
Step 5, get them advertising.
Step 6, keep them advertising.
That's it.
Let's dive in.
Step one Find your ideal affiliate.
6:30
The ideal affiliate has a business with a warm audience, a full of people like your customers.
Start making a list of those businesses.
If none come to mind.
Answer these questions about your best customers.
What do they buy?
Who provides that stuff?
Where do they go?
What businesses are in those surrounding areas?
What do they like to do?
6:45
Who provides those services?
If direct to consumer, the employees of your consumers could also make great affiliates.
What type of businesses do they work for?
What kind of jobs do they have?
In a nutshell, who's got my leads for example?
When I started Allen, agency owners were my ideal affiliate, so I made a list of 200 products and services for agencies and the businesses that delivered them.
7:06
After a little bit of work, I realized they fit pretty neatly into categories.
Softwares, products, equipment services, groups they belong to, and events they attended.
Every time I create a new affiliate hit list, I start with these categories.
Note, if you find a business that falls into multiple categories, there's a high chance they've got a lot of good leads for you.
7:22
Now that I know the businesses that had my leads, I knew exactly where to put my advertising efforts.
It wasn't fancy, so don't overthink it.
Action Step.
Make a sheet with each of the questions and categories.
Search online to fill it in.
If you struggle, call up your customers and ask them End result Create a lead list of your highest potential affiliates.
7:39
Step 2 Make them an offer.
We make the affiliate offer and advertise it the same way we would any other offer.
We call out our audience, show our value elements, then call them to action.
But affiliates will only sign up if we give them a strong reason.
Thankfully, it's pretty simple since affiliates are businesses or start businesses.
7:54
By signing up you offer them a new way to make money.
We'll start with the call out.
Call out call outs for potential affiliates often include the Philipp business owners themselves AKA attention Spa Owners, The Affiliates customers AKA do you work with busy professionals who spend all day in meetings Results.
8:10
The affiliate businesses Promise AKA to the heroes who heal the stress of others products and services the affiliates deliver.
If you sell lotions or scented oils, this is for you to our own customers.
Do you know anyone who owns a spa?
Now that we can grab a potential to feel its attention, Let's make it worth their while.
8:28
Elements of Value There's an unlimited number of ways to show value, but all money making offers follow a similar structure.
That's good news.
We don't need to reinvent the wheel.
Most affiliate money making offers show value like this.
Make more money from your current customers and get more leads than your current offer.
8:43
Dream outcome with a high chance of working since your customers already want the product.
Perceived likelihood of achievement without needing to build, deliver or provide customer support for the product itself.
Effort and sacrifice so you can start selling it tomorrow.
Time Delay.
Action Step.
Explore the different value elements and fill in the blanks.
9:00
I won't go deeper on this since we've covered it already.
You simply need to make affiliates the customer you're advertising to.
Now that we've got the potential affiliates interested in our offer, let's qualify them.
Step 3.
Qualify them.
Potential affiliates become actual affiliates when they understand and agree to your terms.
And just like customers, we want to get them their first win as fast as possible.
9:18
So we set up our terms to force them to win as fast as possible.
I do that by getting them to invest.
I prefer they invest their time, their money and in the product itself.
Any can work, but nine times out of 10, if they pay, they'll pay attention.
Here are the two ways I get my fields invested and winning.
Make them a customer and make them an expert.
9:35
Let's dive into each way #1 Make them a customer.
Make them buy and preferably use the product to keep affiliate status.
This is the lowest barrier investment that's worked for me.
I found the more money in affiliate invest in your product, the more money they make.
This should make sense.
If they don't believe in yourself enough to buy it, they probably shouldn't sell it.
9:51
You can tell them I said so.
Pro tip Bulk purchases.
If you need to make more money per affiliate, you can require them to buy it in bulk.
This was huge for Prestige Labs affiliate success.
Once they bought a big package upfront, they started following through and winning more.
The bigger investment also made them and us more money.
10:07
If you have physical products then try bulk purchases.
If your company has a line of products like Prestige Labs does, then toy around with different big bundles.
Here's how you phrase the offer.
So you want anything extra or you just want the minimum order.
By presenting a minimum purchase, they will at least buy that, and more often than you think they'll buy more than the minimum.
10:25
But a boom wait #2.
Make them an expert.
I make them pay for the onboarding and training that certifies them as a product expert.
If you have them buy a product to become an affiliate, you can have them use that as a credit toward certification.
As in, the certification comes with the products they bought.
Now, aside from actually making the affiliate useful, certifying them does two things.
10:44
First, it covers the cost of advertising.
Second, it means I can afford proper onboarding and training of every single affiliate.
How much do I charge?
I recommend 10 to 20% of what the average affiliate makes in the 1st 12 months.
So if your average affiliate makes $40,000 per year selling your stuff, then charge 4 to $8000 to onboard and trade them.
11:00
Too low and you won't get them invested.
Too high and you won't get enough affiliates.
I found 10 to 20% maximize the number of people who become active affiliates.
If you're just getting started and have physical products then use the bulk purchasing strategy from the pro tip.
Otherwise you can use the strategy for more.
Reach out chapter and raise the minimum investment every five sign ups until they hit the sweet spot action step.
11:20
Make your affiliates customers, experts or both, which is my favorite way.
If you don't get enough people to start, lower the commitment.
If you don't get enough people to follow through, raise it.
Step 4.
Figure out what to pay them.
The first biggest problem to solve with affiliates is getting them bought in.
But the second biggest problem is how to keep them bought in.
11:36
And no matter how you slice it, keeping your affiliates bought in depends on how you reward them for advertising your stuff.
I prefer to reward people that do things I like with money and free stuff, especially if they make me money first.
So let's talk about that.
When I figure out ways to pay affiliates I look at 2 basic things.
One, what they get paid for.
11:51
Two, how much they get paid?
Number one, what they get paid for.
Before I do any affiliate payout money math, I ask myself a simple question.
What exactly do I want the affiliate to do?
Once I figured that out, that is what I pay them for.
Then more often than not, how much they get paid and how often they get paid nearly solve themselves.
12:10
I pay affiliates for two basic things, new customers and repeat customers over time.
If you track your metrics better, you can pay them for steps before someone becomes a customer.
Like for lead matics, downloaded appointment set, or anything else you know reliably turns into sales for you #2 how much they get paid.
12:26
I suggest paying affiliates based on your maximum allowable cost to require a customer.
For example, choosing your maximum allowable CAC.
Let's say we sell a single use product for $200.00 and it costs $40 to fulfill.
This gives us $160 to pay the affiliate and run the business.
If we want an LGP to CAC ratio of three to one, then three parts go to the business $120.00 and one part $40 goes to the affiliate.
12:48
This means we will pay up to $40.00 for an affiliate to get a new customer.
But here's where things get interesting.
I used to give away the farm the whole CAC.
I suppose I still do, but I got pickier about who I give it to.
Not all affiliates are created equal, so I suggest having a three tier payout structure.
Using the example above with a $40 maximum allowable CAC A3 tier payout structure might look something like this Tier 125% CAC equals $10 payout.
13:14
Anyone who agrees to my initial terms would qualify.
Example.
They sign up and buy products or certification tier. 250% CAC equals $20 payout.
Once they activate example, actually finishing the certification they bought, doing a specific number of posts and outreach, doing a launch etcetera.
13:32
This gives a nice reward.
Twice the pay for activating tier three. 100% of CAC equals a $40 payout.
They qualify for this once they sustain a certain level of performance example.
They maintain 5 customers per month on subscription.
13:48
This tiered method also has a hidden and very profitable side effect.
The average payout is much less than your maximum allowable CAC.
This means if we leave the maximum payouts for top affiliates, then we get to keep the leftover profit from the others.
We can use the leftover money to run huge contests, advertised to get more affiliates, incentivize rising stars, etcetera.
14:07
Or I suppose we can just plain pocket it, for example if 20% of sales come from Tier 1. 20% from Tier 2 and 60% from Tier 3.
Your blended payout is $30 instead of your maximum liable CAC of $40.
This means your LTGP to CAC ratio just went from 3:00 to 1:00 to 4:00 to 1:00 and often cutting marketing costs by 33% can translate into a 10 to 20% increase in net profit at the end of the year.
14:31
A massive jump Pro tip.
Pay with product if possible.
Sell 3.
Get it free.
Everyone likes free stuff, often more than what it would cost them to get it.
Rewarding performance with product is a cheap and effective way to keep them winning.
They value it at retail, but it only costs you your cost.
14:49
A nice arbitrage of value.
Set sales tiers and bonus your affiliate with product or credit toward the retail cost.
At lower tiers, you can even compensate exclusively with free stuff.
For example, if your affiliate sends you tons of massage clients, it's totally acceptable to reward your fill it with free massages at low volume.
15:06
A massage is often worth more to them than sending them a check for $30.
Your cost.
But as affiliates send you more customers, they'll usually offer more money.
After all, cashing in 100 massages becomes unrealistic.
At Prestige Labs offered anyone who sold more than three packages per month a free $200.00 bundle of their choosing.
15:24
This also made every affiliate A sponsored athlete.
They got free products for life, as long as they kept three clients per month buying.
I called it Sell 3 to get it free Action Step.
Figure out what you want to pay affiliates for so you can plan out how much to pay them with what and how often.
Step 5.
15:41
Get them advertising.
Launch like refers.
How much value affiliates get from you determines how much they advertise your stuff.
So treat them like customers.
Give them something good, fast, and nothing.
Does that for affiliates like big launches and lots of cash.
Here's how launches work.
Affiliates advertise your lead, magnet or core offer to their audience before they can buy it.
16:00
They post.
They do warm reach outs.
They run paid ads.
They may even do cold outreach.
They do as much advertising as they can until the day of the launch.
When the product is available, they sell to all the engaged leads they assembled.
Some sell 1 to 1, some pitch the whole group and others simply make the product available.
16:18
So if you're going to do launches to activate affiliates, which you should, you may as well do them right.
I use the whisper T shot method.
I can't remember where I first heard this, but the name stuck.
Let's launch.
Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book chapter that you're listening to right now, $100 million leads.
16:34
I took a long time.
Put it together for you.
And so my only ask is that you just take a quick second and leave a review for the book on Amazon.
It's the number one way that people find books and this is a way of getting more people into our world.
And so our mission, acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone.
16:52
And I need your help.
And so if you could do that, just that one, one small action and it has a trade For the two years that I took putting this book together for you, I would mean the world to me.
So thank you.
Before we get launching, remember.
Good launches have the work done ahead of time, so do all the work for them.
17:10
Then they can plug and play.
Let's break down each launch phase and I'll give an example of my book launch to drive each point home.
Note, this is how you launch anything, not just affiliates.
I put it in the affiliates section because I haven't found a better way to activate affiliates than launches.
Whisper.
Think call outs like an ad.
17:27
The key to the Whisper phase is curiosity.
Keep the product itself mysterious and a hint at how big of a deal it is.
Keep Whisper short.
And bonus points if you show behind the scenes of making your product.
If you have something in the works, you can start the whisper phase a few years out.
The further out you start whispering, the bigger deal it becomes to your audience.
17:45
We start this early because the longer something appears to take, the more an audience will value it.
For example, all other things being equal, an audience will value product that took 10 years to make more than one that took ten days.
So show your work.
Remember, curiosity comes from wanting to know what happens next, so embed questions about the product in their minds.
18:02
We need to tell them about something they want to know more about and then say not yet.
For example, during the whisper phase of my book launch, I posted content, reached out to friends, emailed my list, told potential affiliates about major updates to the book.
I showed what draft I was on.
I took pictures behind the scenes of me printing out drafts.
18:18
I showed the many versions of the frameworks I drew.
I shared videos of myself editing the book clearly in the early morning and late at night, etcetera.
All that made people who want to get leads get curious and pay attention.
Action Step.
Start whispering every four to six weeks until you get 60 days out.
Then whisper every two to three weeks until you get 30 days out.
18:36
Then start teasing.
Tease.
Think elements of value.
It's time to start satisfying all the curiosity you created during the whisper phase.
Reveal your product, make the date of the launch public, and start showing the elements of value.
Use the What Who When framework from the Paydads chapter, for example, during my book Launch the Tease phase.
18:57
I was more specific and revealed more hard information about the book.
I started advertising how the book satisfied the dream of limitless leads, of doing less work and getting it done faster than they could imagine.
I also showed dozens of examples using the book to its potential action step.
Start teasing once per week until 14 days out, then tease twice per week until three days out, Three days out.
19:19
It's time to shout from the rooftops.
Shout think, call to action.
Give specific actions for the audience to take when the product launches.
Now you start pounding the audience with bonuses, scarcity, urgency and guarantees around being the first ones you shout to get as many people exposed to your offer as you can.
19:35
For example, during my book launch, the shout phase, I gave specific calls to action short, sweet, clear reminders to register for the book launch.
I reminded everyone of the exclusive bonuses only for people who bought during the launch.
Action step shout at least twice a day, starting three days out on the day of start shouting every few hours until two hours out then.
19:56
Shout every 30 minutes until you launch the product.
Pro Tip movie releases The best real world example of Whisper T Shout is movie releases.
They do 5 second trailers a year out, then 32nd trailers 90 days out, then longer trailers as the date approaches.
They drive curiosity, then interest, then action.
20:14
Action step.
Get your affiliates to launch.
Set them up with everything they need to whisper T shout right.
They do the advertising.
You get the engaged leads.
Everyone gets paid.
Step 6.
Keep them advertising.
The strategy we use to start them advertising differs from the one that we use to keep them advertising.
20:31
In an ideal world, you sell an affiliate once and they send engaged leads for life.
Integration gets us there.
I've got three ways you can integrate your product into their offer.
I order these from easiest to hardest.
First, you can get them to give away your lead magnet with every purchase of their stuff.
Second, you can get them to sell your lead magnet separately to their audience.
20:50
Third, you can get them to directly sell your core offer #1.
They give away your lead magnet for free, which makes their core offer more valuable for no extra cost.
Then you upsell your core offer and every offer thereafter #1 affiliates give your lead magnet away when somebody buys their stuff.
21:08
The idea here is for your lead magnet to make the affiliates offer more valuable.
This allows them to charge more for it and get more leads than they could without it.
Remember the best lead magnets?
Give away a free trial or sample of your thing to reveal a problem or offer a single step of a multi step solution.
21:27
Here are examples of each samples and trials.
Say I sell massages and recruit the personal training studio next door as an affiliate.
Now everyone who buys personal training from them gets a free massage.
For me.
The personal training studio now has a stronger offer they can charge more for and we get more massage leads.
21:43
Everybody wins reveal a problem.
Instead of giving a free massage, we offer a free or discounted posture assessment with every training package they sell.
Assessments and discounts add less value to the affiliate's offer, but some people will still do it.
And to be clear, after assessing the customer, you make them an offer to solve the problem.
22:01
You revealed one step in a multistep process.
Say you have a three-part treatment plan, massage, stretching and adjustments.
People get enough value from one step.
They fear missing out on the rest of the steps, so the more they think the other steps will help them solve their larger problem, the more likely they are to buy them.
22:18
What I did, we'd get gym affiliates to give away a free nutrition console to every new member.
Then we'd upsell our products at the console.
They can market that.
They have nutrition consults included to get more leads and they could charge more for the added value and we would get the opportunity to sell those leads.
22:34
Everybody won Pro Tip White label lead magnets.
One of my favorite strategies is to let them use the lead magnets I've already made from my audience for theirs.
Just make sure your affiliates agree with how you give value and understand your call to action.
At most, a few tweaks in copy will make your lead magnet work for them.
22:52
For example, for gyms I made white labeled no logo, meal plans, grocery list, food prep instructions, etcetera.
I gave them to the gyms to use the lead magnets for their customers.
All they had to do was slap their logo on it and boom, their audience got to benefit from all my work instantly and we both got more leads.
23:09
Two, they sell their core offer, then they upsell your lead magnet.
Then you upsell your core offer and every offer thereafter affiliates sell your lead magnet.
Basically the affiliate can sell anything of yours that turns their customers into your customers.
23:26
It could be a book, an event, a service, a software, a sample product, etcetera.
Also giving affiliates all the cash from selling lead magnet that you fulfill becomes all profit and no work for them and attract your proposition for any business.
Your money comes by selling your main thing for more than it costs you to deliver your lead magnet.
23:43
And if you do it this way, you don't need to split any money with them on your core offer.
Another win win example.
They sell each of those things we gave away for free in the step above.
They sell your massage at a discounted price.
They sell your assessment, which you could do one-on-one or in a group format like a workshop, they sell part one of your multistep solution.
24:02
What I did, the gyms would sell a nutrition console with us and keep the money.
They may be charged 99 or 199 to sell an hour of our time.
If we were clever, we let them keep all the money.
If we do, they'll send even more leads.
Then we'd upsell our products during the console.
24:19
Three, they sell their core offer, which is the same as your core offer.
You upsell more stuff from there.
Then you split the money.
Either you split the upfront cash, all the cash for a certain period of time, or all the cash forever.
I prefer to pay forever, so my affiliates stay motivated to keep my customer forever and I never kept payouts. #3 Affiliates sell your core offer and affiliate sells your core offer directly to their customers and adds another source of income without extra work.
24:47
For some affiliates this is their entire source of income.
Many companies offer the structure as either a new business opportunity or a bolt on to the affiliates existing business.
Either way, anything you sell, they can sell.
When you do it this way the affiliate will get a higher percentage of your lifetime gross profit, but you won't have to do anything but deliver.
25:06
Example, they sell your entire massage package, they sell your entire program or services, they bundle their services with your paid services and charge an even higher price.
What I did, we taught gyms to hold nutrition consultations with white label products.
We then taught them to upsell our supplements right to their members and we split the money.
25:25
All three strategies work, they're just different after testing.
We continue to do strategy one twice per year as a big event and strategy 3 on an ongoing basis.
That being said, many similar businesses in our portfolio use strategy two.
I'm just sharing what worked for us.
Bottom line, integration is the long term strategy for using affiliates to get enduring lead flow.
25:44
Treat affiliates like customers.
Make your offer, make sense for their business.
Make it so good they'd feel stupid saying no action Step integrate with your affiliates by choosing whether you want them to give away your league magnet, to sell your league magnet, or to sell your core offer directly.
Those are the six steps to recruiting an affiliate army.
26:01
Now that we covered that, let me give you 3 real life case studies to drive this home 3 Case studies you can model Service business Case study number one National tax Preparation Services.
My friend's $50 million business prepares Llc's, bank caps and articles of incorporation.
26:17
He focuses on people starting businesses for the first time, but he doesn't try to compete with LegalZoom.
Instead he built it partnering with people who train new entrepreneurs.
His strategy is simple, help those people sell more of their stuff by also selling his stuff.
So he offers every affiliates customer a free LLC setup.
26:33
Remember learning about the high cost lead magnet from Section 2?
This is one of those launch He does a big blastoff seminar to his affiliates audience to kick things off.
People happily take him up on his free LLC offer.
That's his lead magnet integrate.
Once affiliates see the success of this launch, they integrate his lead magnet into their core offer.
26:50
Then my friend's team gets on the phone with the customers.
His affiliates bring him for free.
Here's how he makes his money.
He sells them what they'll need next, the services they'll need to start their business, bookkeeping, tax prep, etcetera.
He hasn't spent a dollar on paid ads.
His true advertising costs are two things.
27:07
One, delivering his free lead magnet, the LLC setup.
And two, paying a percentage of every first sale to the affiliates that sent them.
That's it and everybody wins.
Physical products Case State #2, Prestige Labs, my supplement company.
We sell gym owners at gym launch and train them how to advertise and sell their gym memberships.
27:25
Prestige Labs has a line of supplements for active adults.
This makes Gym Launch a perfect affiliate for Prestige Labs.
It's a community of gym owners that also have active adult customers.
So when Jim Launch sells a new gym owner, they introduced the gym owners to Prestige Labs.
Then Prestige Labs team follows the launch that integrates strategy above.
27:42
We really do this launch.
We give the gym owners advertising materials so they can reengage their current and former customers.
We focus on warm outreach and posting content for a free 28 day challenge.
When they come in for the free challenge, the gym owner sells them supplements to use with the program.
The gym owner gets more customers, they make money, we make money.
27:59
Everyone wins integrate.
After the launch, we teach them to sell supplements to every new gym member.
So when new clients buy a membership package, the gym owner sets up a nutrition orientation.
At the nutrition orientation, the gym owner sells them 50 to $1000 of supplements.
So if a gym signs up 20 clients per month and get 70% of them to buy supplements, we get 14 new customers per month per gym.
28:18
It doesn't sound like much, but when you multiply 4000 gyms times 14 new sales per month, times $200.00 average order, it equals a lot of money every month.
Local Business Case Study #3 Chiropractors Chiropractors want new patients and a portfolio company of ours teaches them to use an affiliate strategy to get them.
Their model is simple, go to high volume businesses that have people that are in need of adjustments.
28:37
A gym fits the bill nicely.
Here's what they do.
Launch They get the gym owner to promote a three hour workshop where they show correct exercises and posture to get more from their workouts.
The gym owner promotes the workshop for free or sells the workshop for 29 to $99 a person.
The chiropractor splits the money with the gym owner.
28:54
Hint, if you give the affiliate the gym owner, in this case 100% of the money, they'll want to do it more.
So if a gym owner gets 30 people to show up for $99, they make $2970 a profit for zero work.
Besides a few emails and posts at the workshop, the chiropractor soft pitches their services and gets a bucket of new patients.
29:11
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy integrate.
Long term, the chiropractor convinces the gym owner to include one to two adjustments with every new membership that Jim signs up.
This increases the value of the gym membership compared to the guy down the street, and it shows the gym prioritizes its members health and safety, a big concern for beginners.
29:28
Win, Win.
Now every new gym member becomes a lead for the chiropractor to follow up with.
They repeat this process with 30 gyms and get more patience than they can handle.
Pro tip employees are leads too.
Companies that hire a lot of people make great affiliates.
This is huge for direct to consumer businesses and wildly underused.
29:47
Example.
Every new hire at a company gets a free massage in their new employee packet.
Or you can give free massages to their employees at lunch.
It's free, it's easy, and lots of companies want to provide more value to their teams.
They get free value, you get free leads, and since they're probably not in the same business as you, there's no risk of you quote, competing with theirs.
30:04
So employers can be among the easiest affiliates to integrate with costs and returns.
Affiliates can't work for my business, the loser said.
I have to make affiliates work for my business.
The winner said be a winner when calculating returns with other methods.
We compared lifetime gross profit LTGP with cost to acquire customer CAC.
30:22
So we spend money to get customers, and the customers in a profitable business give us more money back.
Affiliates work differently.
We spend money to get affiliates.
Sure, we don't really make much back from affiliates themselves.
Instead, the money we spend to get an affiliate comes back from the customers they bring us.
So to calculate returns, we compare how much it costs us to get an affiliate with the gross profit of all the customers they send to our business.
30:43
Example, let's say we own a widget company that grows with affiliates.
It costs us $4000 in advertising to get an affiliate.
So CAC equals 4000.
Our average affiliate sells $10,000 in widgets per month and stays for 12 months. 10,000 per month times 12 months equals 120,000 in total sales.
31:01
The widgets have a 75% gross margin.
In other words, they cost 25% of retail price to make.
So 120,000 in total sales times 25% of total cost of goods equals $30,000 total cost of goods.
Now we take the $120,000 total sales minus $30,000.
31:18
Total cost of goods equals $90,000 in gross profit from all the customers the affiliate brings.
We pay the affiliate 40% of gross profit, so $90,000 of gross profit times 40% payout equals $36,000 to the affiliate as payment.
Here's the gross profit we have left over after cost of goods and payouts $120,000.
31:39
Total minus $30,000.
Cost of goods minus $36,000.
Payout equals 54,000 left over.
So let's find out our affiliate LTGP to CAC ratio $54,000 of gross profit left divided by $4000 to get an affiliate 12 1/2 to one.
31:54
Not too shabby.
If you recall from earlier, we need at least three to one to have a decent business like the example.
We want the ratio to be even higher than that 5:00 to 1:10 to 1:00 plus.
Now if we had these numbers, we'd just do more.
But if your actual LTTP to CAC is less than three, here are three ways to improve it #1 lower CAC.
32:13
We get affiliates for less by improving our ADS offering sales process.
Two, increase LTGP and decrease CAC.
Get more to activate by creating a launch process.
Three, increase LTGP.
We make them worth more by improving our integration process long term.
32:29
With affiliates, you have at least two layers of customers, your customers and the people who get you customers.
And if you've got super affiliates, you add a third the people who get you, the people who get you customers.
This adds complexity, but if you can manage it, it's worth it.
Now that you understand how to use affiliates to advertise and how to make them more profitable, let's bring it all home.
32:48
Conclusion Like referrals, Affiliates aren't an advertising method you can do.
They're people who advertise your stuff to benefit you both.
You do the core 4 to get them, and if you want them to love you, then you treat them like customers.
Because in a lot of the ways they are and if you deliver more value to them than it costs to get them, especially hidden costs, they'll get you more leads than you can handle.
33:07
And like we learned earlier, there are two ways to create a compounding business.
You can find more people that never stop buying your stuff, or you can find more people who never stop selling it for you.
Referrals are the former, Affiliates are the latter.
In theory, once you build an affiliate army, you never need to advertise again.
33:23
They keep getting you leads month after month.
The main reason it makes sense for them?
The way you do business, your leadership, the value of your product all comes into play.
You are only as good as the goodwill you have with your affiliate partners.
Arrange it right and you should both be better off in the relationship and they should be able to spend more dual car customers through a more compelling offer, higher profits, or both.
33:42
In return, you get more engaged leads.
So why doesn't everyone do this?
They don't know it's possible, they don't know how, or they don't want to.
Simple as that.
And hopefully we solved all three of those issues at once.
Remember, advertising always works.
It's only a matter of efficiency.
33:58
So once you start, keep going until it works.
Action step.
Advertise your affiliate offer until you get 10 to 20 affiliates.
Get results with those affiliates and use their feedback to work the kinks out of your offer.
Terms, launches, and integration strategy.
Then scale like crazy by turning their results into your first batch of affiliate lead magnets.
34:17

34:35
Conclusion Get lead getters.
The last skill you ever need to learn is how to get other people to do everything you need for you.
We do the core forward to get engaged leads, warm outreach, post content, cold outreach and paid ads.
And we use them to get two types of engaged leads.
34:51
The ones that become customers or the ones we turn into lead getters.
Lead getters come in four flavors refers.
Employees, agencies, and affiliates each have key strengths.
Customer referrals have the biggest potential for low cost exponential growth.
Employees have your direct influence and run your business on your behalf.
35:08
Agencies teach skills you keep forever and can transfer to your team.
Affiliates, once you get them going, can operate entirely on their own.
You can either do the advertising or other people can, and there are more quote other people than there are of you.
You get more leads for the work you do when you have help, so if you want to get a ton of leads, this is the way maybe your head is officially spinning.
35:30
Now that you understand these advertising methods, you see leads everywhere you look.
We have so many ways to grow and you'd be right, but you don't know which one to focus on.
Any or all of these lead methods can underpin a successful lead getting strategy, and I put them in the order of what happens naturally.
If you start on your own, you tend to get your first referrals before you start building a big team.
35:49
And when you start building a big team employees, you'll probably start looking for professionals to help agencies.
And only when a business owner has a handle on managing people inside of their business do they need to get the guts to try and manage people outside of their business affiliates.
In any case, you have to forget the idea that everything is going to work out the first time.
36:07
If you think you're going to become a millionaire the first year you go out on your own, you're probably wrong.
It's very unlikely, and an obsession with getting rich quick will likely ensure it never happens.
People try shortcuts for a decade until they realize they should have picked a strategy and stuck with it for a decade.
If you do that, success is inevitable.
36:24
Once you find something that works for you, stick with what you pick.
Those are the best words of encouragement I can offer.
The longer you play the game, the better you will get and the more success you will have.
Just don't quit or switch methods after seeing a few losses.
It's normal to lose in the beginning.
In fact, I expect to crack a new lead source in three to six months.
36:42
And this isn't my first rodeo.
So if your expectations are faster than that, do you think your expectations are reasonable?
We covered a lot here.
This section was how you scale.
You get other people to help you.
They are the missing link.
Each has their own strategy and best practices.
Use what applies to you now.
36:59
This leads us to Section 5.
Get started.
I want to put everything together for you in a nice bow so you know exactly what to do next.
Together, we'll eliminate leads as the bottleneck in your business forever onwards.
That concludes the 2nd to last episode of the $100 million Leads podcast Collab and then the spirit of affiliates and partners.
37:19
I'm going to ask you to be an affiliate of mine and not in the way that you might expect.
So you might not know this, but many people charge for audiobooks.
That's a common trait.
That's how most people do it.
And they don't even see that as like a a brand ask.
It's like, of course you're going to charge for an audiobook, but I chose not to do that, despite spending probably more time on this book than most people spend on their books when they just have ghost writers pump them out so they can make 20 bucks on everybody.
37:41
But here is my ask.
If you can be an affiliate of mind and send this chapter or any chapters or just the first chapter of this book to somebody else, it would mean the world to me and maybe to them.
And something that you may not know that I found out way too late in life is that when you introduce someone to something valuable, they associate you with the value that you gave them.
38:00
And so you can gain relational capital by introducing new people to valuable things.
And so I hope that I can be that Channel for you.
And next we'll have our very last episode that will conclude the $100 million leads book.
I'm not even going to tell you what's in it.
It's just going to be good because who gets 10 chapters in and doesn't finish the 11th?
38:19
So I'll see you in the next one.
This has been $100 million Leads written by Alex Tremosi.

0:01
We wrap up today.
The $100 million Lead Special Edition podcast episodes we have on the game.
I hope you've enjoyed this journey with me.
I can tell you that this took me over 2000 hours of work to put together over 2 years.
0:17
My.
Editor Put another 1500 hours into the book So you have two two grown men.
Who spent almost two years of their lives or three years of their lives?
Putting this one thing together for you to hopefully serve.
You in a way that really transforms your business.
I've asked before, but if you've ignored it then this is my sincere ask.
0:38
It would mean the world to me if you left this book review on Amazon where new people can find it, or if you leave review on this podcast at this as the very least some more people can find it.
And even the tiny action of just saying, like, hey, I'm going to send this episode and just send the first one of this book series to a friend.
0:56
I think you could change someone else's life and it would introduce more people to this content.
I made it free so that there wouldn't be a barrier for anyone who's in a hard spot.
And so that's my ask.
Hope you enjoy Section 5.
Get started.
1:12
It's not the end.
It's not even the beginning of the end, but it is perhaps the end of the beginning.
Winston Churchill, June 2017 Three months after we lost it all again and switched Jim Launch to licensing.
Hey, Leila, what do you make of this?
1:27
I asked.
What's up?
I gave her my phone.
Mr. and Mrs. Hermosi, we cordially invite you to a private event for entrepreneurs earning 8 figures and up.
Let me know if you're interested.
Seems cool, she said.
But we're not making eight figures.
I pretended not to hear you.
Want to go?
Sure.
1:43
Is it included in our mentorship?
News?
1 SEC.
I'll ask.
An e-mail response came a moment later.
No, this is an additional fee.
It's a two day event limited to 10 people at a private resort.
Nope, I said.
Huh.
Can we afford to go?
Ouch.
Who cares?
1:58
Can't afford not to go 10 days.
A long flight and a short drive later, we made it.
The cool kids meet up.
I had one goal, to add as much value as I could to everyone else in the room.
But the moment I walked in, I knew I was out of my league.
I recognized almost everyone there.
They were famous in the advertising world.
2:14
They all spoke at huge events, signed autographs, made millions.
Then there was me.
I wasn't an 8 figure entrepreneur.
I was a kid from Baltimore just paying to breathe everyone else's air.
Once everyone settled, we had a short housekeeping discussion and then got down to business.
This way of doing things was a sharp contrast to the big stages, booming sound systems, flashing lights and other theatrics that quote real events have.
2:36
The first speaker was ready to go.
He had a man bun and loose yogaish clothing.
He looked like a hippie.
But then he opened with how he was doing only three million per month.
Is this real?
I felt like a fraud.
The numbers he shared with such a casual attitude blew my mind.
How is this possible?
2:52
He continued on with his talk, using all sorts of business, advertising and tech jargon.
He pointed to dizzying charts and graphs.
I came here to learn more about advertising, but felt Dumber.
By the 2nd I recognized enough of the words, realized I knew nothing useful about them.
His presentation was way over my head.
I started sweating bullets.
3:07
Leila grabbed my hand.
We both felt stressed and out of our deaths.
He finished and finally opened up for Q&A.
Excellent, but the questions were still at the same level as his presentation.
Nope, I'm still doomed.
Then an awkward voice cracked.
So what courses are you taking to learn all this stuff?
3:23
Now we're talking.
I leaned in, pen in hand.
His answer changed my life.
At this point, I don't expect to learn anything new from courses I have to learn by doing, and I do, by spending a percentage of my revenue to test new campaigns, new channels, new pages, or just plain crazy ideas.
And I learned something every time I test, so the money is well spent whenever one of these tests is a winner, and some are.
3:43
It's a big deal.
I learned something amazing and make far more money than I spent.
It raises the bar for my business and more importantly, myself.
So whether it's one percent, 5%, or 10%, set some percentage of your advertising budget aside to try new things without expecting a return.
Consider it an investment in your education.
3:59
I felt chills go through me like some judgment Demon left my body.
He gave me permission to fail.
None of this is magic.
If he can do this, so can I.
The next week I triple my advertising budget.
Yes, it was a bit aggressive, but my mindset had completely changed.
I either make more or get better.
4:16
Our business went from 400,000 in June to 780,000 in July.
From there, my cost to get customers went up too high.
So I tried new audiences.
Most failed.
Then a hit.
Boom.
We cruised past 1,000,000 to 1.2 million to 1.5 million per month.
Then I realized we didn't follow up with our engaged leads at all.
4:33
We tested e-mail, didn't work.
We tested phone calls, nothing.
Then I tested text box.
Wham we zoom to 1.8 million the next month.
From there, we tested paydads like crazy.
We made way more of them and put more focus on their production value.
Boom, we cruise past 2.5 million per month.
4:49
Then we launched our affiliate program and stacked another 1.5 million per month on top.
That took us past 4 million per month.
Years later, our portfolio now does more than 16,000,000 per month.
So test until you find something that works, take massive action.
Stay focused.
Double down on it until it breaks.
5:04
Then test until you find the next thing that works and double down on that.
Taking these leaps are the only way to unlock the business you want and the life that comes with it and maybe slay your judgment demon too.
So from now on you either win or you learn the end of the beginning.
5:21
Your speed to making big money depends on how fast you learn the skills to making big money.
Getting more engaged leads with the skill of advertising is a great start to making more money.
In fact, if you make any amount of money, more engaged leads will make you even more.
And sadly, those skills take time to learn.
So I share my experiences to shave years off your time to shorten the gap between no money and no money.
5:40
It's time to make it happen.
Outline of the Get Started section.
This final section has three chapters.
They are short and sweet, like our time together.
In the first chapter, advertising in real life, I lay out my one big advertising role.
Then I'll give you my personal one page advertising plan you can use to get more engaged leads today.
5:56
In the next chapter, putting it all together, I'll lay out the road map to scale from your first few leads all the way to your $100 million leads machine.
Finally, a decade and a page.
I'll distill everything we learn in a bullets to show how far we've come and our time together.
Then, to send you on your way, I share a parable that has gotten me through even my hardest times advertising in real life, Open to goal.
6:20
If some is good, more is better.
June 2014, when I launched my first gym, I used the same paid ads I used at Sam's Gym from way back, and they worked for a while.
Over time, the cost started creeping up.
I got less leads for the same money, but I still needed more customers.
I wasn't sure what to do.
6:36
I talked to a mentor who ran a chain of tanning salons for some advice.
He said before all this fancy Internet stuff, Flyers crush for us.
You should try those.
So try them.
We did.
We printed over 300 over the next day.
We put them on cars in areas close to the gym.
A day passed.
6:51
Nothing.
The next day the phone rang.
Finally.
Hey, you put a flyer in my car.
My heart raced.
It worked.
Yes.
Yeah, I did.
How can I?
But before I get finished, he interrupted right back.
Yeah, you scratched my Mercedes.
Crap.
You're going to need to pay for.
I panicked and hung up the phone.
7:08
He called back.
I let it ring.
He never called again.
That was the only call I got from the Flyers.
No leads.
Nothing.
Universe 1, Alex Zero.
A few weeks later, I sat in the lobby of my gym waiting for customers to fall into my lap.
Feeling bored and a bit frustrated, I called the mentor with the quote.
Bright idea to put out the Flyers.
7:25
Hey, Alex.
How's it going?
Not too good.
Why?
What's up?
We put out the Flyers like you said.
Oh, yeah?
How many leads you get from him?
None.
That's odd.
What was your test size?
What do you mean?
You know, how many did you put out?
I put out 300, I said in a resentful tone.
7:41
Shoot, you only put out 300.
Hard to know if anything works with such a small number.
I test with 5000.
Then when we find a winner, we put out 5000 per day, every day for a month. 5000.
He tests with almost 17 times more than my entire quote campaign, and he does it in a single day.
7:58
I felt like the person who says exercise doesn't work after going to the gym one time and I hate that person.
I mean, what kind of response did you think you were going to get?
He chuckled.
If we get half a percent, that's decent.
If we get 1%, that's a winner.
With 300 Flyers, half a percent would be like 1 1/2 people.
That makes it pretty hard to know if you got a winner or not.
8:15
I had nothing to say.
He was right.
I feel like a fool.
I doubt he remembers the call.
But it stuck with me.
I promised myself I would never let effort be the reason anything didn't work for me.
It could be something else.
The offer, the copy, the image, the targeting, the media, the platform, the position of the moon, But not my effort.
8:31
Those 300 measly Flyers taught me a mondo lesson.
I did the right stuff, but I didn't do it enough times.
I lacked what can be described in a Single Word volume.
Neil Strauss once said success comes down to doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time.
8:46
Without convincing yourself you're smarter than you are.
The right action in the wrong amount still fails.
Most people, myself included, stop too soon.
We don't do enough.
Most people dramatically underestimate the volume it takes to make advertising work.
They're not doing half as much or third as much as is required.
9:04
In fact, they're doing dramatically less.
I was doing 115 hundredth the level of effort required to make a flower campaign work.
I just didn't know it.
I hear this all the time, Alex.
I reached out to 100 people over the last six weeks.
I only got 1 customer.
It doesn't work.
My response?
You did 142nd the amount of work required, it was 100 per day, not 100.
9:23
Over time, most people do not get that advertising is an inputs and outputs game.
To them, outputs appear out of their control.
Their low effort inputs get them their low and unreliable output of engaged leads.
We're ending that now you input advertising effort.
Your output is engaged leads, period.
9:40
Now we are crystal clear on the stuff.
You do the Core 4 and like we learned maximizing the Core 4, you just got to put in more and do it better than before.
We started with the Rule of 100, but when you make that the norm, you're ready to take it to the next level.
With the Rule of 100 on steroids open to goal, a very successful gym chain allowed their sales managers to make their own schedules.
10:00
But there was a catch.
They had to sign up five new members per day, no matter what.
So if they did it by lunch, they could cut out early.
But if it took 18 hours, so be it.
They called this type of work schedule open to goal.
I found that elite entrepreneurs and salespeople across industries do some variation of open to goal.
10:15
This is because it's like the Rule of 100, but for the big kids.
You don't just commit to doing something a specific number of times.
You commit to the work until you hit a specific number of outcomes, no matter what.
So it means you unlock a whole new level of effort you never even realized you had.
It might mean only doing something 50 times to get the desired result.
10:31
Or like the Flyers, 5000 times every day for years.
If you want to take your advertising to the next level, work until the job is done.
Give up the idea of quote doing your best.
Instead, do what is required.
Sometimes that means your best just needs to get better.
10:48
How I make open to goal work for myself.
If I had to pick three habits that best served me in my life, they would be #1 waking up early, 4:00 to 5:00 AM pro tip.
This actually means going to bed early, 2 getting right to work.
No rituals, no routines.
11:04
I drink coffee and get to work.
Three.
No meetings until noon.
No interruptions, nothing fully focused work time.
To be clear, I don't think there's any magic about waking up early, but I do think there's magic in a long stretch of uninterrupted work immediately after a long stretch of uninterrupted sleep.
11:20
After all, it's the most productive hours in a row of the most productive work I can do.
With nothing getting in my way every single day, how can you lose?
And since I have a good idea of what I can do in a day, I set my daily goal accordingly.
Then, only after my dedicated block of work do I put out fires, talk to humans, and do with other day-to-day stuff.
11:39
Waking up early, getting right to work and working 8 hours straight has been my highest Roy quote habit stack by a long shot.
If you choose to try it, I hope it serves you as well as it served me or better.
And for those of you thinking wait, that's more than 12 hours of work a day, you're right, I'm planning to win.
11:55
But if it overwhelms you at first I get it.
Just throw it back a few hours and work your way up.
Some days.
It's tough, but I always like to remind myself do more than they do and you will have more than they have.
Whenever I get to a low point where I think why do I even bother, I just try to remind myself this is where most people stop and This is why they don't win.
12:14
Since my job is usually to get more customers in most of my companies, advertising is what I focus on.
This book for example was written exclusively in that open to goal time block.
Why?
Because it's an asset that can bring me more companies.
So if you're going to follow my high ROI habit stack, then you're going to want a clear action plan for that time.
12:31
This is the simplest advertising plan I can give you one page advertising checklist.
Step one, pick the type of engaged leads to get customers, affiliates, employees or agencies.
Step 2.
Pick Rule of 100 or open the goal.
Commit to your daily advertising actions.
12:48
Step three, Fill out the advertising checklist for that daily action.
Who you What your offer or lead magnet?
Where?
The platform To whom?
Your audience or list when your first eight hours every day?
Why get X engaged leads or lead getters?
How warm or cold outreach content or ads?
13:05
How much?
100 or until you hit your goal.
How many?
The number of followups and times retargeted for how long?
100 days or until you hit your goal?
Step four.
Do this daily action until you have enough money to afford paying someone else to do it.
Step 5 When you do, go back to step one, Make employees your new target lead type and then repeat steps one through 4 until you have the help you need.
13:25
Then scale again.
Conclusion.
Lots of pages.
So many ideas.
We're almost at the end, but you don't have any more leads.
What gives?
Answer reading doesn't get people interested in the stuff you sell.
Advertising does.
If you're not telling one about the stuff you sell, then you aren't getting anyone interested in your stuff.
13:42
Period.
This chapter laid out the plan to advertise in the simplest way I could work.
Open to goal.
Structure your day to make open to goal possible.
Create and commit to that goal with the one page Advertising checklist.
Many skip planning, or worse, they write a 100 page plan that never gets used.
So skip the atrocious waste of time that is writing pages of baloney.
14:00
Harness the power of laying out your action steps in a single page.
It leaves little room for excuses, distractions, or delusions.
You either did the stuff or you didn't.
You can fill out your one page advertising checklist in about 5 minutes and once The Naked Truth stares back at you, all you have left is to do it.
14:17
I have a free training that'll help you support the Open to Goal and Rule of 100 checklist so you can print it out and fill it out for yourself and execute it on a daily basis.
If you want that, go to acquisition.com/training/leads.
Hey, I hope you're enjoying the book chapter that you're listening to right now of $100 million leads I took.
14:37
A long time putting together for you.
And so my only ask is that you just take a quick second and leave a review for the book on Amazon.
It's the number one way that people find books and this is a way of getting more people into our world.
And so our mission, acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible to everyone and I need your help.
14:56
And so if you could do that, just that one, one small action and it has a trade for the two years that I took putting this book together for you, it would mean the world to me.
So thank you the road map.
Putting it all together, zero to 100 million.
A leader must aim high, see big judge widely, thus setting himself apart from ordinary people who debate in narrow confines.
15:18
Charles de Gaulle, French President during World War 2.
To get where you want to go, it pays to know what lies ahead.
So in this chapter I describe the phases you will go through as you scale your advertisingacquisition.com uses this road map to scale our portfolio companies from a few million a year all the way to 100 million plus.
15:35
These levels will help you identify where you are on the advertising tote bowl so you know what's due to get to the next level.
Level one your friends know about the stuff you sell to start getting engaged.
Leads you make one offer to 1 avatar on one platform.
The moment you get engaged leads is the moment you can start making money.
For me, the started when I started reaching out to everyone I knew.
15:53
Primary action, warm outreach level 2.
You consistently let everyone you know about the stuff you sell.
You know the exact inputs to get an engaged lead with your chosen advertising method, and by scaling those inputs, you get consistent customers with it.
But the consistent customers come from maximizing your personal work capacity.
16:10
For me, on top of warm reach outs, I maximize my personal work capacity with paid ads using a case study as my lead magnet.
But looking back, I wish I would have started posting free content.
So I suggest that primary actions do as much warm outreach and post as much content as you can consistently.
Level 3 You get employees to help you do more advertising.
16:29
You've maxed out your personal advertising inputs but not the platform.
And if you want more engaged leads, that can only mean one thing doing more.
For me, I hired A videographer and a media buyer to take most of the paid ads work off my plate primary action.
You hire people to advertise profitably on your behalf.
Level 4.
16:45
Your product is good enough to get consistent referrals.
You continue building goodwill and shoot for getting 25% or more of your customers from referrals.
Now you've set yourself up to ramp your advertising again, but to make that work, you have to get more serious about hiring A-Team to make it happen.
This is when I realized that my ads were shut off, but I was still getting referrals every week.
17:03
So I doubled down on referrals.
I build goodwill using customer feedback to update my product every two weeks.
I also started a strong referral program with big incentives at the same time.
Primary action Focus on your product until you get consistent referrals.
Then go back to scaling your advertising with a bigger team.
This is where most people mess up.
17:19
They let their products slip and never recover.
Level 5, You advertise in more places in more ways with more people.
First, you expand a new audiences on your best platform.
Then you make ads with all placements and media types the platform supports.
And after your team can get consistent results, you expand your team again to add another platform lead getter or Core 4 activity.
17:39
For me, I hit two birds with one stone.
I expanded my paid ads to include potential affiliates and this paved the way for my affiliate programs.
Primary action advertised profitably using at least two methods on multiple platforms.
Level 6, you hire killers.
Your executives grow departments specific to an advertising method or platform without you.
17:56
And you're not looking for potential.
You're looking for experienced leaders specializing in exactly what you want.
We capped here.
It took me 3 years to figure out two things.
One, that I needed veteran executives with experience suited to my problems, and two, that they needed stronger incentives.
But by the time I realized this, I sold those companies.
18:12
Once I started acquisition.com, I realized the power of expanding the pie to get more of the right people invested in winning.
This is how we crossed 100 million plus than 200,000,000 plus in portfolio revenue and beyond.
Primary action get battle hardened executives and department heads to take over new advertising activities and channels.
Pro tip higher experience not potential.
18:29
I tried cold reach outs twice before it worked the third time.
The main reason the person I hired to run it.
First I tried someone external with experience that failed.
Then I tried internally with no experience that failed.
Then finally I tried internally with experience that worked.
Since the people heavy operationally complex machine, the person you hired to manage the team matters a lot.
18:48
Pick experience.
They should know more than you do.
If you're not learning from them in the interview, you've got the wrong person.
Level 7.
I'll come back and edit this chapter once I cross a billion.
I promise I'll send the lessons as soon as I have them.
You have my word.
Last points.
I know this looks clean, but it never is.
19:05
Real business is messy.
It takes a lot to find out what audiences, lead, magnets, method and platforms work best.
And you can only find out what works if you try.
So you have to try a lot of different things, a lot of different ways for a long enough time to know for sure.
Nobody can ever know the absolute best thing to do.
But I do know this.
The more you advertise, the more people will find out about the stuff you sell.
19:23
The more people who know about the stuff you sell, the more people who buy it.
This is the key to the $100 million leads machine.
The $100 million leads machine.
Let's look into your future.
Your business makes $100 million plus an annual revenue.
It's great to have a clear picture of what $100 million machine looks like.
19:38
Let's have a look, shall we?
First and foremost, your advertising fires on all cylinders.
Your media team scales tons of free content and all media types on many platforms.
You regularly make offers to your warm audience to get more customers or affiliates.
Your ravenous audience makes anything you launch immediately profitable.
You have teams running and scaling profitable paid ads across multiple platforms.
19:56
Your code outreach team gets you more customers.
You have an affiliate manager launching and integrating all new affiliates.
You have recruiters and recruiting agency bringing in more lead getters.
Your product is so good that a third of your customers bring you more customers.
Your executive team drives all this growth without you, and you have more engaged leads than you can possibly handle.
20:13
How long does this take for business owners who don't know what to do?
Anywhere from 5 to 10 years.
Loading something great, even if you know exactly what to do, takes time, and so many like to trumpet overnight success.
But looking behind the curtain tells a different story.
It took my wife and I more than 10 years of our best effort to cross my first 100 million in net worth.
20:31
So the bigger goals, the longer time rises, need to be.
You want to play games where if you wait, you win.
Entrepreneurship isn't for the faint of heart.

I hope this book provides a utility.
I hope as a result of reading this you know how to get more leads than you currently are and I hope I unmasked the mystery behind lead getting.
Also, since you are one of the few actually finish what you start, I want to leave you with a parting gift, a fable that has gotten me through my hardest times.
22:51
The many sided die.
Imagine you and a friend play a dice rolling game who are each given one die.
One of the die has twenty sides, the other has 200.
On each die only one side is green and the rest are red.
The point of the game is simple, roll green as many times as you can.
23:09
The rules of the game are as follows.
You can't see how many sides you have.
You can only see if you roll red or green.
If you roll green, one of your red sides turns green and you get to roll again.
If you roll red, nothing happens and you get to roll again.
The game ends when you stop rolling, and if you stop rolling, you lose.
23:27
What do you do?
You roll.
When you roll red, you pick up the dye and roll again.
When others roll green, you pick up your dye and roll again.
When you roll green, you pick up the dye and roll again.
You keep telling yourself one thing.
The more I roll, the more greens I get.
23:44
At first you roll green once in a while, but as more red sides turn green, the greens happen more.
With enough rolls, hitting green becomes the rule rather than the exception.
What does your friend do?
He rolls a few times and hits a red each time.
He sees you roll a green and complains that you must have a die with fewer sides.
24:02
He reasons.
It's the only way you could have rolled green before him, and although you did, you also rolled many more times.
So which is it?
In either case, he rolls a few more times in frustration and hits a green, but then he complains about how long it took.
He spent more time watching you and complaining than actually playing.
24:18
Meanwhile, you've hit your green streak.
It's so much easier for you, he tells himself.
You get greens every time this game is rigged.
What's the point?
He quits.
So who got the die with 20 sides and who got the die with 200 sides?
If you get the game, then you see once you roll enough times, the die you're given doesn't matter.
24:37
The die with fewer sides might roll green sooner, the die with more sides might roll green later.
But a die with a green side always has a chance of rolling green if you roll it.
Every die hits its green streak when rolled enough times.
All of us get a many sided die and looking at the other players, you have no idea if it's their 100th roll or their 100th thousandth roll.
24:59
You don't know how good other players are when they start.
You can only see how well they do now.
But if you understand the game, you also know it doesn't matter.
A few begin playing early, others begin much later.
The rested on the sidelines complaining about how lucky the players are.
I guess so, but they're lucky because they play and when they hit red, which they do, they didn't quit, they rolled again.
25:22
Learning to advertise is a lot like the game of the many sided die.
You do not know if it will work until you try.
And when you start advertising, you will probably hit red on your first few rolls.
But if you try enough times, you will hit green.
And when it works, you have a better chance of getting it to work again.
The more you do, the easier it gets.
25:39
You begin to understand the game.
No matter how many players there are or the number of sides in the die you're given, you start to see there are only two guarantees.
One the more times you roll, the better you get. 2, If you quit, you lose.
So here's my final promise.
25:55
You cannot lose if you do not quit.

Real quick, guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ass is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if.
It was a review if it was a post.
If you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
You have to set the standard so that a.
Players will be attracted to you and also so that you can have a team of a players and then the entire culture rises, right?
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.

This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and.
Beyond, I hope you share and enjoy.
What I wanna talk about is, I just finished our strategic meeting and it was so apparent some of the new talent that we brought in, how much they were really driving growth in some of our companies.
1:03
And I wanna talk about this because I think it's a single hardest thing that entrepreneurs face.
Like every single entrepreneur has one problem.
They think they have multiple problems, but they have one problem and it's a people problem.
They don't know where to find good people, number one. #2 They don't know how to hire and recruit those people. #3, they don't know how to manage those people. #4 they don't know how to grow and cultivate the talent, right.
1:25
And so that entire process embodies what really growing a business becomes after you get to probably about 10:10 to 30 million a year is when when OPS really, really start taking over, especially at 30, it's all about talent.
And I think I've said this before, this is probably the big it's been the biggest bottleneck for me, crossing 30 to 100.
1:46
Is was really understanding that.
I was understanding that it was all about the talent.
It's actually not about you.
And that can be really hard for your ego because you love being needed.
And that's like an interpersonal need that we, you know, have from childhood or whatever it is.
We didn't get hugged enough.
But like that need is something that is outside of the business.
2:02
The business doesn't require you.
The business should be able to run on its own.
And this is something that has shifted over time.
That being said, it doesn't mean that you can't have the future vision for the business.
You know, Bezos just stepped down for the first time after, you know, 30 years or whatever, but.
But you're the actual doing, the leading, all that stuff.
2:17
Over time, the company becomes a company of companies, right?
It becomes a conglomerate as you grow.
And So what I want to talk about specifically today is how to find and know the difference between an A player and A/B player or really an A player and everyone else.
2:33
And I can't really stress how unbelievably important this is.
And The thing is, is that we talk to entrepreneurs.
They're always like, my team's awesome, and you talk to the same entrepreneur a year later and they're like, that team was horrible.
This team's awesome.
And that's because we're eternal optimists, right?
That's that's just the reality of it.
2:48
If you can't look at someone on your team and be like I think this person's kind of weak or I think this person could be better, then you, you really have rose colored glasses on, right?
And that's the hard part.
And I honestly, this isn't this wasn't real for me until I actually saw teammates of mine growing divisions of our companies without me doing it in ways that I had never thought of.
3:09
Once that happened, it became real for me.
And I think there's these different steps in your entrepreneurial journey.
I mean, the first one was when I remember the first person who did a sale for me, I cried.
I remember I I cried because I heard about on the phone.
And they're like, yeah, I sold two people today.
And I I had done every single sale for my business for like a year and a half.
3:26
It's just, it was just no one could bring it in, right.
And and the answer is other people can bring it in.
You're not special.
But I it wasn't real for me.
And as soon as this this girl did this, I was like, Oh my God.
Like, I don't have to, I don't have to literally make the money.
3:41
Someone else can do this and I can actually start running the business.
And so is a huge breakthrough.
And there's obviously levels to this, right?
And I think the, the level that I just recently had a breakthrough on was watching teammates actually grow the business without me, right?
And it's, it's really special.
3:57
It's really awesome.
So you're like, that's awesome for you.
Alex, why are you talking to me?
Great question A players and B players.
So what I'm going to do is tell you a quick story because I think it's perfect for illustration.
So we just recently promoted a brand manager, one of our companies, and she was given the task of like, hey, why don't you think about other revenue streams that we could possibly bring into the company?
4:19
And so she said, I thought we should start an apparel line because I'm getting lots of messages on social media about how we should have apparel.
And I think that'd be a good opportunity.
And so her, her supervisor said, I think it's a good idea, go for it, right.
And So what she did was she emailed, you know, 20 different, you know, manufacturing companies for apparel.
4:37
She got samples from all of them.
She tried them all on.
She felt them and she showed up to the strategic meeting and she was like they were crap.
She was like, I'm not sending that to my customers.
She said those exact words and I can't tell you what it felt like for me as an owner to hear that.
4:52
She said I'm not sending that to my customers and it was because it showed so much ownership and one of our core tenets is be her own boss, which I'm switching to act like an owner, but that's exactly what she did and.
To push it even further, she didn't just stop there and say all of this stuff sucks because that would just be presenting a problem.
5:09
Instead she was like, but I did find some manufacturers that don't do manufacturing and fulfillment cuz some centers do both, which is much more convenient for me as a business.
But she's like, but their stuff is legit.
It's awesome.
She's like, so I just need help figuring out how how many pieces do you want to order?
5:25
As a baseline, I'll figure out the logistics to get to a third party fulfillment center so that we can do this apparel launch.
And so we ended up coming a solution for it and she felt great about it.
We looked at different you know designs and and with the with the great quality we were going to come up with a solution.
But here's here's what I want to bring up break apart for you.
5:42
Imagine a normal person, a BB level employee, nothing wrong with them.
There's lots of them, right?
But they show up.
They do their job, they go home right.
They don't take ownership because what?
What an alternative story of what would have happened.
5:58
Is the director says, hey why don't you look for new revenue opportunities and that person may or may not have done it at level one, right, Level 2 they actually do it and they say I think apparel.
She says OK go check out apparel.
Now what that person probably would have done was look at three companies from a Google search maybe or maybe not even sample the product.
6:18
Just look at the pricing and say hey I found an apparel company, we can print our logo on it, we can ship it out.
That is what A/B player would have done.
And honestly, unless you have an A supervisor, the A supervisor probably would have let it go and what?
And I'll tell you the difference real quick wise.
6:36
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you.
6:52
Can rate and review and share this podcast so the single thing that I has to.
Do is you can just leave review but take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may.
Change the world with someone else.
The difference is with the a scenario you have a high quality product that people buy, enjoy and buy again.
7:13
And that massively increases the LTV, the customer.
And on top of that, that brand manager cares deeply about the customers and their experience.
And she's going to be thinking, top of mind, how do I make this easier?
How do I make this faster?
How can I improve their experience?
Right.
Whereas the B player, you already lost them like, Oh yeah, they don't like the T-shirts.
7:32
I mean, what do they expect, right?
I mean, like they're $30 T-shirts.
I mean, they're not going to be, you know, XYZ and so.
That difference is the game.
And finding people who think like that A player compared to people who think like the B player is the difference between companies that grow and companies that die, companies that barely compete and make it, and companies that thrive.
7:59
And none of what I just described was earth shattering.
It was just a willingness to do more work and raising the bar.
It was having a level of intolerance for anything but excellence.
And it is my belief that within a company hierarchy, every person, the higher the person who runs the division or the department or the company, should always have the lowest amount of tolerance for anything but excellence.
8:27
Which means you should be intolerant of anything that is not amazing, right?
And that trickles down.
It gets diluted right at every level.
It's diluted a little bit more, a little bit more, a little bit more.
And if there comes a day where you see two people and you see a supervisor, and you see someone underneath of that supervisor, and the person underneath has a has a lower tolerance for anything but excellence, then the supervisor, those roles should reverse.
8:51
The person who cares the most should be the one in charge.
And so if there comes a day where someone cares more about my customers and the experience in the business that we have than I do, they should rightfully run the company, not me.
And sometimes entrepreneurs get to that point.
They have a CEO.
And they elect them because they're like, I think that you're better equipped for this and I think that you care more deeply.
9:09
And that's Okay.
That happens, right?
You know, Phil Knight doesn't run Nike anymore.
But I mean, shoot, Jeff Bezos says it and you obviously stepped down for other reasons and whatnot.
But the big picture here is having a level of intolerance for what an A versus A/B looks like starts with us.
9:26
And The thing is, is whoever you hire, most people only hire people worse than them.
And so if you're if you're one level removed or two levels removed, dear God.
Imagine what you're what's what's being hired on the frontline, right?
And so you have to carry this torch, you have to raise this bar, you have to set the standard so that a players will be attracted to you, and also so that you can have a team of a players.
9:49
And then the entire culture rises, right?
If you've ever been on a winning team, on a championship team, you know the difference between the vibe, how people come to practice, how they play, the expectations of one another, right?
The speed of response?
The team or all of that?
10:05
That's culture and that's only created through having the right players on the field, the right people on the bus and kicking off the wrong people.
And I'll end with this quote from the head of people for Chickfila, which is a company I admire a lot, she said.
A lot of companies want to compete against us in the Championship, but the reality is they lost in the draft.
10:25
And that one really resonated with me because, and I I mean, I'm paraphrasing here, that might not even be your title, but that was what she said in general.
And that that really struck me because so many of us are always trying to develop, we're always trying to develop talent, always trying to do all these things, management styles, etcetera.
10:41
But some people just come with batteries included.
There are some people who are just winners, right?
And you just need to get out of their way.
And I think that it's worth the extra 5 interviews.
It's worth the extra 20 interviews to find the a player, because once that person is in place, they will grow, right?
10:59
They will grow whatever they touch.
And this has been a deep lesson for me, which is what, you know, people are like.
It's all about people.
And it is, it's just boring and unsexy for most entrepreneurs.
Because we love the promotion, we love the sales, we love the marketing, we love all that stuff, right?
We love the product.
But the people is what runs it.
11:16
And I think that this has been, this has been a deep lesson for me.
And I hope, I hope if you look at your team right now, you don't think, oh, they're all amazing, right?
Because the reality is they're probably right.
And every single entrepreneur says that.
I can tell you right now some people that are weak on our team, right?
You have to be honest about it and you have to think not just what are they doing, but what would I be doing in their position?
11:37
What initiative would I be taking that they're not taking?
What questions would I be asking that they are not asking?
And ideally you want someone who's asking questions that you haven't thought of, and that's when you know you've got an A player anyways.
This comes with time, it comes with experience.
It comes with once you've seen an A player, you can never Unsee them, and then you start to use that template to apply to other people.
11:58
Right.
And then you repeat it over and over again.
And I think that's why entrepreneurship takes time.
Like you grow.
You grow in levels.
You grow in tolerance.
You grow in interpersonal understanding.
You grow in awareness of other people.
And as you grow in that awareness, so too will your selection of talent.
So too will your recruitment of talent, your management and growth of those people.

I started 4 businesses that cracked 10 million in a row.
I want to share the frameworks and lessons I learned from the many mistakes that led to those four in a row.
So that hopefully the next business year after the current business you're on and achieve that level and beyond.
So the first big company I built was called Gym Launch.
It was a licensing business for gym owners.
0:16
As in, I had a model and I would license that model to them.
They would use those things, they'd make more money.
The average, it would make an extra $100,000 a year in profit business at its peak was worth about $150 million.
And then COVID hurt that business and I ended up selling it for 46.2 million to American Pacific Group which is a private equity firm out of San Francisco.
0:34
The 1st 10 customers I got from Jim launch, I got somebody to pay a VA in the Philippines to scrape Crossfits database and then send me the list of emails.
I then uploaded them to Facebook, made a look like audience off of those, marketed to get a webinar which no one watched.
And then I had 80 leads from people who had opted in and none of them bought or scheduled a call.
0:54
And so I looked up everyone of the emails manually and I like friended them on Facebook.
I messaged them and then I got a few of them on the phone to pay me 500 bucks to go out to fly to their gym and actually do the turnaround.
Once I started the licensing version of the model, which is the one that really gave me the scale, I was able to sell something that had virtually 100% margins.
1:13
The first month I think I did like 120,000 in sales and the next month I did like 300 ish and then high fours and then 780 and all I was doing was just selling more units.
And then we had a million.
The next month would look at whatever problems the gym owners that we were with were currently suffering from.
So it could be their suffering from churn or they could be suffering from margin issues.
1:29
They could be suffering from they're not getting enough lead. close rates aren't as high as we want them to be.
We would then create a hypothesis around what we thought might work.
We would survey the community and say who has the best conversion rates if that's what we wanted to fix and then we'd invite 20 of them onto a call.
We would take all the notes to figure out what things they were all doing.
1:46
And here's the important point, We didn't say great, we're going to do all these things.
We try to see the few things that they were all doing.
Then we'd say, hey guys, this is a big deal.
This is like worth the cost of change.
You're going to have a demonstrated long term benefit to the business.
For context, my best gym did about $600,000 a year.
Our average gym who's a gym Lord made 600,000 a year.
2:04
Big picture is that the product has to be exceptional.
If your customers are in love with your product, which takes more time because people are like, oh you threw this thing together.
It's like it took six years for me to put all those pieces together and then finally be able to monetize that deliverable and like that little inch between good and great is yours.
2:20
But the return you get on it from the word of mouth that compounds is hard to fathom.
One of the other big secrets of Jim launch was that we had a very different approach to acquiring customers.
The traditional model of most businesses in general is loss leader.
You know you get someone in for some sort of free thing, you lose money on the acquisition, you make it up in LTV.
2:39
I came with a different model and I've since done that in every single business I have.
So this is one of the important frameworks that I want to pass to you and it's something called client financed acquisition.
So client financed acquisition basically means you get the customers to finance the acquisition of the next customer.
So all you have to do is have enough money to get the first sale.
And if you make more in the first sale than the cost to acquire that customer and the cost to fulfill that customer plus the cost to fulfill the next customer and the cost to require the next customer, you eliminate capital as a constraint in the business.
3:04
You can put a dollar in and get 2 customers back.
Then that next customer buys you two more and two more and two more.
And all my gyms were able to just crush everyone else because we could outspend.
I've taken that aggressive acquisition perspective to everyone of the businesses that I've had.
We had many, many terrible things that happened during DuMont.
I mean one we had COVID, which was tough, you know, for gym owners in general.
3:22
A third of all of our clients went out of business.
Another thing that we did that was really bad was we over hired for our support.
I had hired an inexperienced director of customer service.
She was a frontline Rep that we just promoted all the way through.
I work ethic but no experience.
And so she hired 35 reps and we only needed five.
So we had to lay off 30 people and then that became a thorn in our side for the next 2-3 years because our glass door got smashed.
3:43
The biggest reason Jim once was successful, one is that it was timing.
We identified arbitrage on Facebook ads before anyone else did and we created a turnkey system around how to monetize it.
I was running ads on Facebook in 2013.
You could put a girl with a bikini and say click here now like it was the Wild West.
4:00
The second thing, because of that arbitrage, the average gym was taking home an additional $30,000 in cash in the 1st 30 days.
That was the average.
If you take a business where the average business owner is making $36,000 in profit and then you add $30,000 in the first month of working with them, you don't need to worry about marketing.
4:18
Technically my return on marketing was 100 to one for the 1st 18 months in the business.
But it's because I probably could have just not marketed at all and I would have had the amount of people that came in.
So like who knows if the ads were doing anything.
But everybody from the outside was like, this guy's ads are everywhere.
Like he's killing it.
So many people who are copycats, Mickey Mouse giving a bullshit, people who just used old versions of our stuff to try and sell out of like all the stuff you would imagine.
4:40
All those guys went out of business because they didn't have the depth Prestige Labs, which was my second big company, which actually is really a sister company to Jim Launch.
He built the whole thing of an affiliate base that we acquired through Jim Launch.
And so like the first month of being fully operational did 1.7 million.
I didn't want to sell supplements for a very long time because I was like supplements.
4:57
You just need to eat, eat right and work out.
This woman wouldn't leave my office.
She's like, my friend says I need supplements.
Like fine.
So I wrote her a list of like, go get this stuff, go away.
She came back the next day with the things and she was like, I just want to make sure I got the right stuff.
And I saw the receipt at $700.00 on the receipt and the thing that I had sold her was 400 bucks.
And I was like, fuck that.
5:13
I'm going to sell supplements.
So I would recruit a gym owner and I would say, hey, we're teaching all this marketing and sales stuff over here.
If you just sell every person supplements, it will cover the cost to acquire a customer just from the physical products.
And the beautiful thing with selling physical products is that there's no added fulfillment.
One of the problems is the more you sell, the more you have to deliver, right.
5:30
And so it's kind of this double edged sword where the moment you swipe the credit card, you're like, oh shit, now I have to deliver on this, right?
They didn't have to do anything.
They literally just swipe the credit card.
And then we meant centrally.
We would ship it direct to the consumer.
I wanted to create a brand gym owner sold, No one else could sell it.
We priced it on our home site higher.
5:46
We priced it 30% higher on the main site.
So there were significant savings.
On top of that, we gave them a very good selling system because I learned a lot about selling supplements, I made it a recurring subscription.
So now they got to have two recurring subscriptions per customer.
I picked the 1st 10 customers from our distribution base already.
So I rolled out ten locations and then the next month I rolled out 20 or 30.
6:04
Next month I rolled out another 20 or 30 and then we did the big launch to everyone.
There's lots of little things that we did that were gym specific that no other supplement company could do which has given us a nice Moat in that space.
Cost me 4,000,000 bucks to start Prestige labs.
About a million of that went to the tech so we created our an entire point of sale for supplements that was specifically made for gyms.
6:22
So every gym would get a retail kit so they have a full wall of products.
They would have a kiosk which is stand with an iPad type thing on it.
A5 didn't really exist that we had to build this whole thing and then the other three ish million went into just product biggest difficulties with it in the supply chain.
So like if you run out of 1 ingredient on one product like you can't sell the product.
6:40
There are also legal firms that will buy all your products and try and test to find something that's off or underrepresented or whatever.
There's predatory law firms that as soon as you have a patent they'll just try and find people to sue and they'll just basically Rev share on the amount of money they can get.
The end consumer is just not sticky and that's just because people don't stick with fitness stuff in general for a long time.
6:57
So the biggest lesson I have for you guys Mosey Nation around Prestige Labs, is that I probably shouldn't have done it.
That's the real role.
It is a good business, but I think that if I had allocated more time to just making Jim launch better, Jim launch would have been bigger.
And because Jim won't stop growing.
The year I launched Prestige Labs, I just became CEO of two companies rather than CEO of 1.
7:15
The third business I started use allen.com, still around today doing great.
I saw where chat was going and I saw where AI and machine learning were going a few years ago.
And if I figured if I were able to aggregate all of the data from every single type of small business, all scheduling brick and mortar in person appointments, I'd be able to predictably show what days of the week, what times of day, what kind of followup sequences got the most amount of people to show up.
7:39
And since we were compensated on percentage of people that showed up, we were highly incentivized to solve that problem.
And I learned a ton about how to get the most throughput for leads, and I've used that in every one of the portfolio companies that we have.
And you can usually add twenty 3040% to the throughput on ads, simply your scheduling process.
7:55
I first started it to solve the problem for gym owners because one of the biggest constraints is that people don't work their leads.
Amazing, I know, but the average gym was getting 9% of leads in the door.
When they had to work them manually, we were able to get just under 20% of leads in the door without them doing anything.
And the average front desk person costs 2000 + a month.
8:13
And we could do it for a fraction of that.
Sold the first kind of customers of Allen by going to our distribution base and saying, hey, do you want to try this thing?
What was interesting is that we very quickly realized that we couldn't expand outside of our distribution base.
The breakthrough was that I realized that we needed to get agencies on board rather than getting small businesses on board because they'd be like, great, I can work my leads, how do I get leads?
8:33
And we're like, ah shit, they don't know how to get leads.
So then we started selling agencies, which had another degree of leverage because if you sell an agency, they could have 50 small business owners underneath them.
I did 2 webinars with who had big agency audiences.
So now you go up another level.
I could make one pitch and in one pitch get 1000 customers.
8:49
That was when this thing really took off.
I did 2 pitches and within six months we were doing 1.7 also ironically per month through the software company.
Alan is the business that I probably learned the most lessons from.
I ended up selling that business as well, 75% of it to a strategic buyer who's still running it and doing a good job with it and hopefully they'll have a big exit in a few years.
9:06
And that was an all stock deal.
So under NDA, I can't tell you, but I can tell you we did 12 million in the trailing 12 months before the sale.
That being said, lesson 1 is that you need to have have an inhouse CTO if you're going to be if you're going to get into software.
I develop software for Prestige Labs.
I use the exact same development shop to make the software for Allen.
9:23
I regret that.
Development shops, honestly, they're about as close to a complete scam as you can come to.
Because if you really are going to build a software company, you need to build a software company.
Like that's it.
Like you need to build a software company.
It's like having a marketing agency and having a white labeled marketing agency doing all your delivery.
It doesn't make any sense. #2 is that you want to run pricing surveys early because we unlocked four times the pricing power by simply repackaging how we charge, exploring different ways to charge based on usage, based on recurring fees, different API's.
9:47
This is especially true of software because there's so many different ways you can charge compared to maybe traditional service.
The third thing is having aligned incentives with your customers often just makes you more money.
And so that business had a tremendous amount of scale because we had so much alignment with every single stakeholder.
The small business owner want people to show up, the agency owner wanted people to shop, and we got paid based on shops.
10:06
So everybody was aligned top down.
The fourth thing, throughput on appointments.
When you're scheduling for sales calls or in person appointments, the amount of days per week that you are open, the hours that you are open, and the increments of time matter a lot.
10:21
Like 50 to 200% would be like marking doesn't work for me and they had one time slot for an hour per week that they were willing to take new customers on.
That's just stupid.
I there's no other way to say it.
The people who made the most money, who had the most throughput are the ones who gave the most availability, gave the most flexibility.
Their customers were open the most days and they unsurprisingly got more people to schedule and show up.
10:39
There's a reason small business owners stay small, they make small business owner decisions.
So acquisition.com, so this is the 4th business portfolio companies that right now does over $200 million a year and I make these videos so that you can hopefully pass 3,000,010 million etcetera and then we can invest your business and help and grow from this.
I started with the question, what can I do forever and then work backwards from there.
10:56
So it's like there has to have a lot of leverage.
I need to have a capital compounding vehicle.
So the 1st 10 investments that we found some people I knew from, you know, beforehand and I would say that the relationship had shifted more and more to it, like basically an advisory role anyways.
And the rest of it has been people who read the book, who watch videos, who listen to podcasts, who come in, who already are aligned with our values.
11:13
We'll always look at anything as three or more, but most of the businesses are over 5.
The average business right now is doing 17,000,000.
So acquisition.com is the first business that was really like built on a personal brand and inbound with content.
So that's been like the biggest change compared to the other businesses.
There's pros and cons to it, like it's a slower business overall.
11:29
If you are used to doing a transactional business where you're doing multiple sales a day, going into a business model where you have one every month is very different and there's a lot of conversations that happen that don't amount to anything.
The thing that excites me most about acquisition.com is I learn more now than I ever have because I'm exposed to more businesses at a higher level.
11:47
I believe that the purpose of life is to learn.
That is my purpose of life.
Then enabling myself to learn in as many ways as humanly possible maximizes that.
And Co own all these businesses because I want to learn how solar sales work.
I want to learn how mortgage sales work.
Like knowing a lot about a lot of things allows you to cross pollinate ideas that work well in one industry and then apply them to another one and then get outside returns.
12:09
As we saw how quickly and how easily acquisition.com grew.
The biggest part of that was because we hired from the top down, there was so much that we could automatically delegate to people who were better than us at their respective things.
Director of Sales, Director of Marketing, Director of People, Director of IT, Director of fully Operations.
12:26
Not as good as, but better than us who were teaching us.
Every other business I've had I hired from the bottom up.
This one I went from top down and I we'll always do that from here on out.
You can really only do that if you're well capitalized.
That's why venture people raise money, because you can get more talent before the business can really afford the talent.
12:41
Because at the end of the day, every business incurs debt.
It's just what kind of debt.
So are you incurring financial debt?
Are you incurring management debt, cultural debt, technical debt?
And the question is which one do you want to pick and have to pay down later?
And so for us being the bank was willing to pay down financial debt to not have to pay any of the other debt down in the future because ultimately on a longer time horizon we'd move faster.
12:59
And the other thing is that we have made recruiting talent single core competency of the business.
Most of the companies that we're bringing on the entrepreneur needs more talent and we have the ability to recruit talent better than most people because one, we have so much inbound that comes in.
Two, we as a private equity firm have more prestige than most of the companies that are in our portfolio.
13:19
And so we can recruit and people respond to a private equity firm with portfolio companies more than they respond to Joe's Dry cleaning.
And then we have somebody at Holdco who will help train them on our way of doing business.
So they get it right the first time.
A portfolio company, when they're managers are getting stuck or their directors still getting stuck, they talk to our Director of sales and if you're a business owner, then you'd like to scale to 50, a hundred and beyond.
13:40
We'd love to partner with you on it.
We have the track record that we have because we've done it multiple times.
And the biggest cost that you have in the business is what you do not know.
And so if we can help you pay down ignorance debt and we can drag what you might already do in 10 years and three years, then for us that's a win for everyone.
So if that's interesting, you can always go to acquisition.com, go there the.








0:00
Most nation real quick, if you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
And if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
And so if you give someone who's not prepared for a gob of potential energy that they did not earn or learn how to wield, it will ultimately burn them up and consume them.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:33
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wish Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
No one will remember you.
And that's a statement that bothers a lot of people.
And if that does bug you, then you probably should look away from the rest of this.
0:52
And my team was going back and forth on even posting this because they're like, dude, there's so many people that are going to disagree with this, and I'm OK with that.
And this is not me in any way saying that my beliefs should be your beliefs or that your beliefs are wrong.
I am simply explaining my beliefs.
And the reason I'm doing that is because I think one of the hardest parts of entrepreneurship is managing emotions and managing anxiety and managing stress so that you can make higher quality decisions and high quality decisions.
1:16
One of those things that compound over a long period of time because we make hundreds and hundreds of decisions every single day, every single week for our business and it's many small micros that can go all the way up.
One, you know, 1% better everyday compounded for 365 days is 37 X what you started.
And you know 10% or 1.1% worse goes down to zero at the end of the year.
1:36
And so managing my mental state has been a continuous learning experience for me and the set of beliefs that sits the core of that is what I would consider optimistic nihilism.
And to be clear here, there's a lot of people who feel like nihilism was really negative thing, and that's because they ascribe some sort of meaning to the word.
1:57
But it really is just that you don't think that things have inherent meaning.
It doesn't mean that there isn't any meaning in the world.
It doesn't mean that there is a global meaning that we all have to agree to.
As a result of that, there are downstream implications that affect my behavior and I think have positioned me to be less stressed about things that come up and as a result make Better Business decisions.
2:16
And so This is why I show this.
And if only some of these things make sense for you, awesome.
None of it makes sense for you.
Awesome.
If it all makes sense for you, awesome.
So the big picture for me was a lot of people take a lot of work and stress a lot about what other people think about them.
And I'm not going to say that I'm here like I don't care what anyone else thinks.
2:34
That's not true at all.
I think I use these frameworks to try and remind myself that other people's opinions don't matter as much as I think they do.
And for me, reminding myself that I'm insignificant and in the long and eventual universal scale am irrelevant allows me to look at my failures and laugh a little bit.
2:53
And so rather than say Oh my God, this is the end of the world, it's really on a 500 million year time horizon.
I am a being that exists for a blip of time and then will disappear from existence.
And one of the things I was telling a friend of mine is he was telling me all the things that were stressing him out said, you know, if you zoom out far enough, you can't even see the earth.
3:14
And he started laughing.
And we both started laughing together because it's like we we like to exaggerate these things in our mind because that's what our brains trained to do so keeps us alive, is making things seem in problems they've actually tested This is that like, you will still always find the same number of problems, whether they're rich people problems or they're poor people problems, they are still problems nonetheless.
3:31
And so at least realizing that allows me to not judge the fact that I have problems as it being bad because if I don't believe things have inherent meaning, that it means that I can control the meaning I ascribe to things.
And so for example, let's say that I get into a car accident, right?
3:49
That would be for most people, a bad experience.
Now how you look at that can depend.
It could be like okay.
Well, there's a law of large numbers.
I've been alive for this many days.
It's probably that I'm going to get in one of these accidents.
On the flip side, you could also think, hey, you know how amazing I got to experience this part of the human experience?
4:06
I got to check that off the list of things that I got to survive, right?
Like crazy to think about something like that.
But like what else you going to do?
Would you rather just like sit there and sulk and just like this is ruined my life?
Like I don't think that's going to be an advantageous response.
And so the core of all of these things that I have sits from the fact that I can create and destroy meaning as I see fit.
4:26
Number one, and the big rapper for this whole thing, is that entrepreneurship is a stressful road.
And so if you're somebody who like, gets stressed out or feels anxiety or fears overwhelmed, then these are the tools that I've used in my toolbox to combat those things when they come up.
So this is going to be a list of mental frameworks that I apply to diffuse stressful situations in my life.
4:49
And so let's start from the top, #1 is that I don't believe that things have inherent meaning.
I see them much more like the weather.
Meaning some people say sunny days are good and rainy days are bad when they are really just weather.
Because if you are in a drought, a rainy day is good, and if you on a drought, a sunny day is bad.
5:08
And the flip side would be reversed if it was your wedding, right?
And so the only thing that has happened is just a circumstance or condition.
And then we ascribe meaning to that thing.
And so if we can control what that meaning is, that it means we can influence our own emotional response to it.
And if the whole idea of being a good decision maker is controlling our emotional response, then having tools like this can be really helpful.
5:30
The next one is that a lot of people like to say if it's not going to matter in five years, it shouldn't matter for five seconds or whatever it is.
I like to take that a bit further and say if it's not going to matter in 500 million years, it shouldn't matter for five seconds.
Now some people take that and think, wow, then you don't think anything has meaning.
5:46
And the answer is yes.
That is the point.
And so for you, it might be a bad day, but it's going like, we are all going to eventually be forgotten.
And as much as that bothers people, it's like, do you know who your great, great grandparent is?
You probably don't even know their name.
Like, really, you probably don't even know their name, let alone anything about them.
6:02
You probably don't even know their name.
And we have this because we're so selfcentered, think that everyone around us is going to sing our praises and hang our pictures on the wall and just sing Kumbaya to us every single night after we're gone.
And the real real is why do we give a shit if we claim to not care about what other people think?
6:18
Why would we care what they do and talk about us after we're dead, right.
And so I'm going to talk to you about a lovely lady named Betty White.
So Betty White was somebody who was really early on race integration.
She was a golden gal, a huge, huge personality.
6:35
She lived in 99, didn't make it to 100, which is sad.
You probably haven't thought about her until I brought this up.
And she died about a year ago.
And and The thing is, is that she lived an amazing life and incredibly public life, very financially successful.
The top of her skill be loved by all.
6:52
And A you either forgot about her or B, you didn't even know her neighbor to begin with.
And so how arrogant are we to think that now everyone on earth is going to remember us?
Like you probably don't even know any Indian celebrities at all.
We're alive today.
You probably don't even know any Chinese celebrities who are alive today.
7:08
Probably know any Russian celebrities who are alive right now, right?
And so we're so arrogant that like not only do you think that like we're going to matter after we die, you probably don't even matter right now.
And those are the celebrities.
Forget the normal people, right?
It's just ego.
And This is why I think so many people get bothered by a lot of the stuff that I say here is because they want to reject it, because it makes them feel bad, the idea that they don't matter.
7:32
Now obviously there's going to be a lot of counter people that wear shirts that say you matter.
And I don't agree.
And I think by thinking that way you set yourself up to be upset at the world because it means that you feel anything as a slight.
7:48
Because the underpinning of ceiling like you matter is that you deserve things.
And I hate the word deserve because it sets an expectation that we are bound to not see fulfilled.
And so if you see suffering as unmet expectations, you can either change the conditions or you can change the expectations.
8:07
And one of them happens in your mind and the other one forces the entire world to change.
And the crazy thing is people will demand that a universe who doesn't know they exist or care change to their will, which it won't.
And so they self inflict their own suffering or anxiety or overwhelm when they're in business.
8:24
It's not fair that this competitor down the street opened up.
It's not fair that they're copying my ads.
It's not fair that they're undercutting my prices.
You're ascribing a meaning to it.
All that we know is that it happened.
That's it.
And so we could say how cool it is that I get to have this experience of competing with somebody so I can tell the story later.
8:41
Because at the end of the day, we're all going to just collect our experiences and then we're just going to cast them in and then die.
And so again, this is not meant to trigger anyone.
This is just how I view the world and has been helpful for me because on another level, like as our current understanding exists in the universe, the sun is going to continue to expand until eventually engulfs the Earth and we all die in a heat death.
9:02
Unless we become a multiplanetary species, all of the stuff that we're going to do, everything they've ever done, the books that I write, the videos that I make will eventually all get melted into nothingness.
And so when we have this worry that one of our videos or our post didn't get a lot of likes, it just really doesn't matter.
9:19
And I'm not saying that I don't feel the feelings I'm saying.
I remind myself of these things so that I don't feel them as much or as long.
So let's imagine something bad has happened.
All right, today, in this moment, now I'm going to take you through a timeline.
So if we go three months into the future, it probably won't matter that much.
9:39
And here's how I'll prove it to you.
Can you think of something that happened three months ago that bothered you?
Does it bother you now?
Probably not.
So we can use that evidence to project in the future that the current moment won't matter then.
And if it's not going to matter then why should it matter now, real quick, wise?
9:55
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the word so we can out more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
10:14
So the single thing that has to do is you can just leave review.
They'll take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world with someone else.
Belief #3 is that your legacy doesn't matter.
So #1, let's assume that you define legacy as material assets that you accumulate.
10:32
OK, so the ETH agreed this, and this is something that I'm fortunate to be able to share with you, is that my great, great, great grandfather was a ruler of the Kajar dynasty in Iran, and so he had 400 kids.
So I'm not that related to him.
10:47
All right, just like your progeny won't be that related to you either.
But anyways, great great grandfather.
I actually keep forgetting his name.
Guy was a king, right?
I don't even remember his name.
And yeah, like and he conquered the fucking world or born into it doesn't really matter, right?
He sat on the top of material wealth and power and me four or five generations later don't even know his name.
11:09
I know the dynasty was born of right?
And so I think it was Hormuz Han.
I think it was his name.
Anyways, point being, I don't think about him every day.
I think about him literally only to make these about how it doesn't matter.
And so your progeny probably won't think about you.
And so when you die and then you pass your stuff on, part of people were like, OK, well, I have my material assets.
11:29
Well, OK, well, those are going to get divided up a zillion times over and get fought over with a bunch of people who don't know how to make money or manage money until then should get squandered.
So we know that's going to happen on a long enough time runs it.
OK, great, check that box off.
Now let's talk about your values and your beliefs.
Right.
And that's what you see as your new legacy, which I think is a more noble legacy if we had to compare the tip.
11:48
But even then, let's do the The second version of Legacy, which is just having children in general, is that you're like, I want to proliferate my genes, which is super Darwinian of you, which is awesome if you want to call it awesome, or it can be bad or it can be whatever you want.
And so let's say you have lots of kids.
And let's say those kids have lots of kids.
And let's say those kids have lots of kids and lots of kids and lots of kids.
12:04
Well, guess what happens is that 5 generations from now, you're 1/2 to the fifth related to those people.
They're 164th you.
And that's like 5 generations.
Not that much, right?
Like, you're just great, great grandfather.
That's all that.
It's like, talk about like, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.
There are one one thousandth you.
12:22
Are they really related to you, or are they just humans?
If they're just humans, which means that the eventuality of this equation if you just keep adding the numbers, is that your progeny will just be humans, then if you care so much about them, you might as well just care about everybody today.
Kind of nice when you think about that way.
12:38
And so that's the genetic argument.
Okay #4.
Leaving things to your kids doesn't benefit them for a variety of reasons, #1 is that timing of when you give it to them probably won't matter.
Here's some stats for you.
So the average person gets inheritance in their late 60s because their parents die in their late 80s or whatever.
12:58
And when that happens, they already are old and don't need the money.
So if you are going to give your stuff to your kids, you should give it to them when people deem it the most impactful of their lives, which is between 24 and 35, because that is where you can materially change someone's living conditions.
13:16
The education that they can provide to their kids, whether they can have childcare, those are huge changes in someone's life when they're in their 60s.
Their die is more or less cast, right?
And so one if you're going to leave it to them, leave it to them on a time.
It's impactful 2.
Leaving it to someone in general or giving it to someone in general when someone hasn't earned it tends to alter their behavior in a negative way.
13:36
So how many people have seen like the trust fund kids that just completely lose their minds and suspend, you know, all their money and get into drugs because they have no challenge, they have no hardships, everything has been removed from their lives and then basically the real hardship becomes themselves.
And so I think we we benefit from struggle on a character development perspective and I see money as potential energy to be exchanged.
14:00
And so if you give someone who's not prepared for a gob of potential energy that they did not earn or learn how to wield, it will ultimately burn them up and consume them. #5 is law of large numbers, which is, let's say you have a bad day.
A lot of people want to say I need to change everything about my life cause I had a bad day.
14:15
But if I were to say, hey, you have 365 days in a year and a top, you know, bottom 10% day, you expect that to be a good feeling day.
Well, no.
OK Well, 365 days, bottom 10% days would be 36 days a year.
Well, there's 12 months in a year.
That would mean that you'd have three of those per month, almost one a week.
14:32
Wow.
I get a bottom 10% day once a week.
Well, that sucks.
Yeah.
On the flip side, you have top 10% days once a week too.
And so I see these things because a lot of times we want to change our behavior and attribute some outside force that something happened when it might just be randomness.
14:49
Like if you have 365 days, you're going to have top 10% days and bottom 10% days with the exact same conditions.
So does it mean anything?
Not really.
And so for me that helps me deal with the fact that sometimes I'm like off this is a bottom 10% day.
That's all it is.
Don't even change anything bottom 10% day.
15:06
I'll give you another one that I borrowed called the frame of the veteran, which is from my good friend Doctor Kashi, which I think this is number six, which is if something bad happens.
Imagine that it's already happened 1000 times before and I will tell you the first time I ever used this cuz how ridiculous this is.
So I got this new flannel I know and my housekeeper cleaned it incorrectly and so it's like a nice material in the trunk which obviously looked even better.
15:29
I'm kidding.
Anyways, part of it was that it shrunk and then it also like wasn't like soft anymore.
It got like all like those little like, hairy beads all over.
It's like when you wash wool.
And in the moment it was an expensive flannel.
And I was kind of annoyed.
And then I remembered the frame of the veteran and I was like, okay, what if every time I washed a flannel, it always became like this?
15:47
And every flannel I had was this way, and this is just how flannels were.
What would I think?
I was like, I wouldn't think this is a big deal.
And just like that it was gone.
Something that would have been an annoyance just wasn't anymore.
If, like, you're stuck in traffic and you're normally stuck in traffic, but every time in this hypothetical world, the frame of the veteran, every single time you got into a car, you get stuck in traffic, would you be bothered by it?
16:04
Probably not.
Why?
Because you're accustomed to it.
You expected it.
And So what it means is we can basically retroactively alter our expectations and project a fictitious past onto our present so that we can alter how we respond to it.
And so for me, the frame of the veteran has been very valuable if you've been broken up with and it feels heartbreaking, But if you figured every single time you meet somebody you're going to have a heartbreak on the thousandth time, how would you feel?
16:26
Probably not that big of a deal, which means it can be not that big of a deal right now if you choose for it not to be.
So a lot of us wish that we don't have problems, but problems are constant and sometimes they're a sign of progress because if you solve a problem, then you create another problem.
16:42
So if you solve your marketing problem, what do you create a sales problem?
If you solve your sales problem, what do you create?
A customer success problem.
And so it's called the never ending cycle of problems and solutions.
And so the idea is that we're wishing for something that will literally never happen.
16:58
We want to live a problem, free life.
But instead, in my opinion, we should try to choose which problems would you prefer.
Because there absolutely are better and worse problems.
And so for us, let's just see if we can do better problems that we can solve.
But wishing to eliminate problems is in and of itself something that will create a permanent problem in your life.
17:15
So #8, I think is an exercise called a failure resume, And I'm going to make a separate about my failure resume.
I'll share with you guys, but a lot of people like to make their resumes about their accomplishments.
But what I think that does is it gives us an inflated mental image of ourselves.
17:31
And so if you make yourself a failure resume, I think it creates the equal opposite situation, which is you're like, man, I have really messed up a lot of times, over and over again, and there's a lot of valuable things you can take from that.
Number one is that, and probably the most important.
17:47
I am still here.
And I think if there's a one big take away from that, it's like you have survived.
And this actually leads to A-frame in and of itself, which is if it kills you, whatever this problem is, it won't matter because you'll be dead.
And if it doesn't kill you, it means you can handle it and so either way you win.
18:07
So when someone's like I can't stand this, the statement in and of itself is self conflicting.
You can't stand it because you are standing it.
You may be uncomfortable, but you are literally a living example of the fact that the statement was false.
And if you truly can't stand it, you will die, in which case you won't need to stand it.
18:24
So pretty much your default situation is standing, which I think is kind of cool.
And so back to the failure resume is that you're like, I am still here.
Number two, none of those events which felt like the end of the world actually did end my world because I am still here #3 If you have any measure of success in your life, which everyone does, you just have to change what you're measuring on.
18:45
You were able to have all of that failure and still have a level of success, which in some ways I think is like a little bit of a sense of humor.
Like you can be like, wow, I'm sets.
Dance.
Like I can't believe I did all these things, can't believe I'm still here.
And I think what it does is rather than talk about all your accomplishments and set yourself up for a big ego failure, basically sit from the exact opposite, which is like, I can't even believe I'm here, what a win.
19:10
And the rest of this is all gravy.
And again, I am not saying that every one of the frames that I just gave you are things that I always have operating at every single hour of every day.
But they are tools that I deploy when I am feeling not as good.
19:25
And if you want my two cents, so here's my number 9.
I believe that the only real legacy is leaving the human race better than you found it.
Not because they will remember you, because they won't.
And even if they did, why do we care about the approval of people who aren't even alive yet?
19:41
Fun fact, You can't say that you don't care about the opinion of others and yet care a lot about what people who aren't even alive yet will think about you while you are dead.
So I see education as the ultimate legacy, as the ultimate thing that we can pass on.
19:57
And so that is the reason that I've dedicated my life to doing that and passing on whatever learnings that I have.
Because I feel like if all of us accumulate knowledge, which we all do in some settings, if we don't package that and pass it on to the next generation, that in my opinion is a waste of a life.
20:14
Because everything that we have right now, the cameras that you're you're, you know that this is being recorded on the phone or the screen that you're watching this on or whatever you're listening to this.
Like there are many past humans who live their entire lives to make one advancement.
That other humans picked that baton up and moved the ball forward.
20:30
Many people who are faceless and nameless to us today but have made our lives better.
And to me that is a purpose.
That for me inspires me to continue to want to work even though I know they will not remember my name.
And in many ways, because they don't remember my name or won't remember my name, it actually adds a lot of levity to my life because nothing is that big of a deal until I die.
20:53
And when I die it won't matter cuz I won't have to deal with it anyways.
So the TLDR is that no one will remember you, and that's OK.








0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that if you haven't checked out $100 million offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its #1 ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5005 star reviews.
So thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through.
I'll check it out on Amazon.
The Kindle book is $0.99.
The audio book is as low as they'll let me put it on for it.
So I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
There's no way to strike out.
You just have to wait and wait and wait until you get the perfect pitch, that fat pitch that's in your sweet spot, and then you step up and you knock it out of the park.
0:37
And if you look at the people who are the wealthiest in the world, invariably the vast majority made their money with one vehicle.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, The Game, is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:56
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I want to tell you a story that was really impactful for me earlier on in my life and my business career.
And it was when Leila and I went to the Pirates who have mastermind.
1:13
Now, if you've ever, you know, listened to my podcast or you've been on this channel, I've talked about this before.
But it was one of the most impactful experiences of my life.
And it was because I had multiple mentors who made more than me speak belief into me and also made sure that I capitalized on the fat pitch.
All right.
And so I'll tell you how this went.
1:28
So I was Leila and I just got married.
This is 2017 May.
We had just gone from, you know, me almost losing everything to this business that we had just shifted from a done for you flying out, doing gym turnarounds to a consulting service teaching other people how to do our model.
1:46
And we were doing and we were like in our second month and doing 350,000 a month.
It was insane.
And it was just Layla, me and an assistant over the selling, over the kitchen table.
It was absolutely bananas.
I didn't even know we made more money than I knew what to even do with it was it was it was crazy.
You know what I mean?
2:01
We're living on $1200 a month and and taking home 340 of 350,000 a month.
It was crazy.
It's so anyways, I got invited to an 8 figure mastermind and clearly if you're doing the math there, I'm not making any figures.
And I felt like really out of place.
I was like, Are you sure you want me to come?
And he was like, yeah, dude, you're going to like, he's like you're going to blow past day figures.
2:19
Like, really.
And so first person that's spoken to me was Russell, which is why I'm always grateful for that.
And so he saw something in me that I couldn't see for myself, which is why I think it's so valuable to to pay for mentorships and pay for, you know, people who are ahead of you to give you perspective that you lack because a lot of times it's beliefs, the things that you don't see that kill you.
2:39
Right.
And that prevent you from succeeding.
And so anyways, we get to this event, super nervous this because all these guys are like tightened and they're all doing, you know, 10,000,020 million, 30 million.
And I think Russell, at the time, I think they were doing 35 to show you how long ago it was because now I think they're doing 150.
And I got up there, it was finally my turn.
2:56
And I, you know, I wrote on the board and I told how our whole process worked and how, how much money our gyms are making on average.
And Jason Flatlin, actually, I'll start with Alex Sharfin says, Alex Sharfin was in the room.
And he's like, you have $100 million business right now and you don't even know it.
And I remember feeling like the air was sucked out of the room because I felt all of a sudden I was, like, really proud of what I'd accomplished.
3:17
But all these guys made so much more money than me that they were like, dude, you need to like, you need to step on the gas.
And I was like, what?
They're like, you got a huge thing in front of you.
If you, if you like, like, you need to take advantage of this.
And at the time, I was saying how I was like, okay, we're making 350 a month.
3:33
And I want to start a supplement company.
And they were like, why would you want to start a supplement company?
Just double your ad spend?
Because you're not spending anything on ads right now.
And I was like, okay, I guess I'll do that, cuz I listened to these guys cuz I made more money than me and I was like, all right, and so that was my end all.
So rather than starting another business, I just kept doing the thing that I was doing, which ended up being an amazing piece of advice for them to give me and I probably would have sabotaged myself.
3:54
I had not paid for that.
So it's like if you ever have the opportunity to spend more than you're probably comfortable with to be surrounded by people who make a lot more money than you, you will almost always disproportionately.
And every time in my life, I've always disproportionately moved up faster.
When I can surround myself and figure out, I want them to speak into me and tell me what I cannot see.
4:11
Right.
I'm like, tell me what I'm missing.
What am I not seeing that you can see, right?
Because for whatever your business is, right, or whatever your skill set is, I'm sure that there's if someone who's who's doing something that you are very good at, you can immediately see what's going on.
It doesn't take 62 seconds, right?
You're like, oh, this is what's wrong.
This is wrong.
This is strong.
When I look at a business now, I can be like, ah, this is each right.
4:28
It's immediate, but I when you don't have the context, you just run your head into the wall wondering what's going on, right.
So anyways, after the my little presentation was over, Jason Flatley came up to me and he had done $100 million on webinars and I was like man, this guy's super smart and he was, you know he was really aggressive and bright and I was like man, we got to figure something out or I don't want to say anything stupid.
4:48
And so anyways, he comes up to me and he said you need to 10X overnight.
And I was like, what he said, if you what you're saying is true and you're making Jim's this much money, he's like someone bigger than you who already has all your customer base is going to take everything you have and distribute it.
5:03
I was like, what?
He's like, they're going to take everything you have and just destroy you before you even have a chance.
And I just felt even worse after this, right, for this pit in my stomach.
And then he leaned into me and he said when it when it gets easy is when you go hard.
5:20
And I remember how much I was shaken by that.
And Layla was right next to me.
And I was like, when it gets easy is when I go hard.
When it gets easy is when you go hard.
And the biggest gift I got from those guys there was that.
This was my fat pitch real quick guys.
5:36
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, showed it on Instagram or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
5:55
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur, right?
There are only a handful of opportunities that present themselves in the course of, you know, entrepreneurs career where you have the opportunity, you have the skill and like basically the stars align right now.
6:15
That being said, you have to develop the skills so that when the opportunity presents itself, you can knock it out of the park and step up to the plate.
But when I listen to Warren Buffett and he talks about the investments right, they choose very sparingly what things they're going to invest in.
6:30
But when they do, they back, they load the truck up, they go all in.
You know, you find your sphere of confidence in and you just get pitches all day long, right?
Just like a baseball analogy, You get pitched over and over, but you have no strikeouts, right?
There's no way to strike out.
You just have to wait and wait and wait until you get the perfect pitch, that fat pitch that's in your sweet spot, and then you step up and you knock it out of the park.
6:49
And if you look at the people who are the wealthiest in the world, invariably the vast majority made their money with one vehicle.
They made all of their wealth or the vast majority of their wealth with one vehicle.
And then after they made their wealth, then they diversified, Right.
7:06
And so this is one of the big issues that I feel like I see in the Internet culture, in the Instagram culture is they're like, you gotta have, like the billionaires have seven, you know, revenue streams.
Yes, but they didn't have that to get there.
Right now, I have lots of revenue streams, but I didn't have that building this right.
7:22
And so the idea is it looks much more like an umbrella.
You've got one straight path all the way up on one vehicle where you're all in invested, which is your business most of the time or your career.
And then it balloons out, then it umbrellas out and then you sprinkle those investments and other things because you're overly leveraged in one business.
7:40
But every single one of the most of the guys that you see, all of them came from one one thing that made their money and then they sprinkled it out on top of the other vehicles.
And so if you listen to Gary Vee, even he talked about one of his biggest regrets was how when Google ads were really cheap that he should have spent more for wine library.
7:58
And all of these things kind of the collided at the same time in my life where I had, you know, I'm listening to Gary.
He was saying, you know, I I, I wish I had spent more, right.
And I had Jason saying, hey when it gets easy is when you need to go hard.
All these guys are going to take all your stuff and then you know sharpen saying, hey, you've got $100 million company and you don't even know it and then you know Russell's like you're going to blow past eight figures.
8:16
And all of this stuff was spoken into me when I was just a kid.
Like you got to understand like I didn't know anything.
Like I knew nothing.
We're doing 300,000 a month and I was like holy crap like what is going on is this legal.
I don't want to mess it up like it's just like holy and so but because of their encouragement rather than a distract myself and start another business right.
8:36
All we did is we'd I followed what they said I I5X my husband and and then it just took off like a freaking rocket.
You know what I mean?
We went from you know 350 to 1.5 million in the next like 5 months as in per month.
And so it was just blockers and I just listened to what they had said.
8:54
And so my my my take away from this and me sharing the story is that I don't know what pitches you have in front of you.
There are only a certain amount of times where we're going to get that fat pitch and I think we my the point of this is that if it is easy for you right now, this is the time to step up.
9:13
I was talking to some entrepreneurs that were younger not that long ago and they went from you know next to nothing.
I think not next to nothing.
I think they were doing that.
That sounds horrible.
What about to say so they were doing like 1 or $2,000,000 a year.
I didn't mean it like that, but their last month they they made like 20 or $30,000 in the last month of the year.
9:30
And then the next month they they hit this offer out of the frickin park and they they did 3 million and they did 5 million the next month in revenue.
I mean that's insanity.
I mean I've I've never heard of anything growing that fast without like a JV, you know, like some sort of joint venture thing like never in my life.
9:46
I've heard someone grow that fast.
And they're like, yeah, you know, we're trying to like, enjoy the fruits of our labor and not spend a ton of time on the business, on the business.
And I want it.
And I got to have the opportunity to be the, the older person in the situation because I could see in them what I imagine people saw in me, which is like, you've got a hot one right now.
10:07
Like, you need to ride it hard.
Like when strike when the iron is hot, right when the fat pitch comes, you step up and you put everything you've got into it.
And so, like, this is not the time to try and figure out work life balance because you're going to have this finite window.
We're going to make disproportionate amounts of money where you're going to make your generational wealth in this short gap.
10:25
And we just have to hope that when that opportunity presents itself, we take full advantage, right?
If you're going to California and during the gold rush in 1849 and you start panning for gold and you start getting gold, that's not the time to say, you know what, I've made it.
I'm going to stay home.
I'm only going to pan for gold an hour or two a day.
10:43
Of course not.
Right?
Because you'd be like, I got to pan, I got to take.
It's time to take as much gold out of this river as humanly possible.
It seems obvious to us from the outside, but when you're in it, you have all these other things that are going on in your mind, right?
And The thing is, is that opportunity, like many, are finite, right?
There's a defined period of time where you're going to be able to ride that wave and be early on it and crush it.
11:01
And so most people who were very wealthy had one big pitch that they swung hard on and and then after they've made it, then they sprinkle their other investments.
Just don't try and reverse engineer the wrong sequence.








0:00
We doubled the profit of a $5,000,000 business in less than 8 weeks.
And we followed a single specific process that I'll break out in this video.
And at the very end of the video, I'll walk you through a hypothetical example of a calves business that would be the best business ever that taught people how to grow their calves.
So you can apply to your business using the same process.
0:16
So I want you to imagine that you have a business or you'd like to start a business that has 100 customers that hey, $100 a month.
I'm trying to use the simplest math possible.
So 100 customers, $100 a month.
So that means it's doing $10,000 a month in revenue.
Now let's assume that in order to fulfill those customers, we have $8000 a month in cost.
0:34
So making $2000 a month in profit, $10,000, top line $2000, bottom line, $8000 of cost.
That's the business.
Now you rub a magic iPad, a genie appears.
And this is not any kind of genie.
This is a very a business genie.
And this niche genie has one wish that he can grant you.
0:51
And so he says I can grant you one wish.
He says I will double your business in one of three ways.
You need to tell me which way you want me to do door number one or wish grants.
The number one is I will double the amount of customers that you bring in every month with this business.
Let's assume that your churn is not that good so people stay far.
1:09
On average, three months #2, I will double your price.
So you have the same amount number of customers and I'll double how much they pay you every single month.
Nothing else will change.
Door #3, he says.
Now what I'll do is I'll double how long they stay.
So instead of staying for three months, they'll stay for six months.
Which of the wishes do you take the genie up on, really?
1:26
Be honest in the comments, tell me what your first guess was going to be.
A, B or C So with door A, he double s it.
So now we have 200 customers a month.
What happens?
Well, if we have 200 customers paying us a month, we now are making $20,000 in top line revenue.
1:41
And assuming everything scaled proportionally, we would have $4000 a month in profit and $16,000 a month in cost, double the number of customers.
We doubled the amount of profit, doubled our business.
Awesome, let's go to door 3 because people are staying twice as long, but you're getting the same amount of customers per month.
1:58
Eventually you will get to the same equilibrium point as the first one.
The exception is that that Wish accomplished does something more powerful, which is it increases your LTV.
Now because of that and the additional months that they pay you, most businesses, it's more profitable the last one someone pays than the first one, usually a cost of acquisition, cost of onboarding.
2:17
There's more cost associated with getting a new customer than keeping someone.
If you can double the lifetime risk profit per customer, then your cost of acquisition can be bigger than it could in the first example here, I eventually get to the same top line, but I have more bottom line because I didn't have to spend as much on marketing.
So between A and C, you pick C Now you're like, all right, well what about door B?
2:36
So let's say we had the same 100 customers, but now instead of paying $100 a month, they're paying $200.00 a month.
We still have the same cost of fulfilling them, so $8000.
And our profit went from $2000 a month to now we have literally the extra $100 a month.
It's pure profit.
So we 6X the profit of the business with one change for those in the audience who are thinking but not as many people would buy.
2:57
So I told you that we increased how much profit the business made.
I'll tell you the one change that we did was as we looked at the entire marketplace that we're selling a similar service to theirs and it was based on our research, we felt that the market could support a 50% higher price.
And so we literally, and this is already a pretty expensive thing, we literally did nothing but add 50% to the price and changed nothing about the product.
3:17
And guess what happened?
More people bought.
Why?
Because when something becomes more expensive, people perceive its value in a higher way.
And because of the brand that the person had, it was more aligned with the person to have a higher price tag.
Now most times in most markets you have supply and demand, and when the price goes up, demand goes down in most markets.
3:34
Now not all markets, and more times than not it doesn't drop by the same proportion.
So if you double the price, sometimes you sell a third fewer.
But if you double the price and you've 6X the profit potential on a customer, If I 6X my profit on a potential customer and I do it at 2/3 the price, then I tripled the profit of the business.
3:52
Still, you still make way more money.
And so finding the absolute perfect point of profit many times comes from raising the price.
And pricing is one of those very interesting things because it's very tied to emotions.
A lot of people are very afraid of raising the price because they don't want to break it.
I want to talk to you about how to raise the price if that is your goal, which is why the number one lever that you have on profits is pricing and cost testing.
4:13
A lot of people's split test their pages, they split test their scripts, they split test their offers.
But the thing that they forget to test is their price.
And it's the strongest lever of all three levers.
OK.
So let's walk through a hypothetical business and the steps that we would need to take in order to increase the price, if that's what we decided was the right call.
So the first thing we would do is we'd survey the existing audience using the Van West or pricing survey.
4:32
Let's say this business sold a 12 week grow your cabs program and let's say it was $1200 for 12 weeks.
Very simple.
And on the first third of the survey, we're trying to find out more about the customer.
So we're like, hey, you know, what was the main reason that you bought this?
This?
Was there an event that was coming up that incentivized you to do it?
What's your current income level?
What's your job?
4:48
What was the primary way that you found out about us?
Right.
So it's like, OK, these are the things that we know about the avatar.
And so we've got those client demographics.
OK Second part is the four questions of the Van Wester.
What if it was super expensive?
What if we're way too cheap?
What if it were a stretch?
And then what if it were a bargain, right.
There's the four questions.
5:03
Now we say of all the things that we do in our cabs program, which is the book, the training, the nutrition, the stretching thing that we have, the one-on-one calls for accountability, the body system that we've put together.
So you have an accountability buddy.
Like all of these things that we do in our value stack.
Which of these, if we only had one of them you would keep?
And which of these, if we got rid of 1, you would lose and not care.
5:20
You take that data in #1, #2, now we communicate it internally first, right?
So we've got to communicate to the team, got to communicate to the sales team, security to the marketing team.
Then we communicate it to our customers.
This is what's happening.
This is why it's happening.
Past, present, future.
This is what we did to get here.
This is why it's important now.
5:36
This is what we're trying to do later.
We're investing in the business cuz we want to fulfill our promises.
Finally, now we bring it up to the new customers who are coming in.
So we hit our lists up to let them know as we had the urgency in step four.
And then the last step is now we officially have this new price.
Now what we wanna do now is expect the fact that the change in price will probably result in fewer sales by total volume.
5:56
And the reason for that is because we cleared the pipeline before the price change.
It happens.
Once you have that, you have to let it shake out, you have to let it settle.
And it's really trying.
It's very difficult to do that cuz it takes guts.
But once you make that and you let it settle, then you just do the math and let the math do the talking.
But if you sell it at twice the price, you make more money.
6:13
So in our hypothetical cab scenario, let's say we bumped it to $2000 or $3000 because we found out that that was the price that was right at that sweet spot.
That was the stretch, but they'd still do it.
We might have just two or three X the profit of the business by making that one change and maybe because cabs are the coolest thing ever, got even more people to buy it because they thought they really could get the results that we said we were going to help them experience.
6:34
I'm a.








0:00
You want somebody, in my opinion, who believes in your dreams even more than you do.
Because I'm a big believer that you should only listen to somebody or take advice from people who have bigger dreams for your life than you do.
And I think most people don't have bigger dreams for you, which just means that for me, it's like their advice is invalid.
0:17
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Well, what I do want to ask you is from a mental perspective and also from a relationship perspective, because there's a lot of people here.
0:34
I do want to talk about how you met your wife and everything like that.
But managing all these relationships, both professionally and personally, and then dealing with your own stuff mentally, What was that actually like to go through?
Because it's cool to hear the story.
But I mean, what was even going on in your mind?
0:51
What was that pressure like?
I mean, it was tough enough that I was drinking like 1/2 a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black every night during most of that early gym when we were doing the turnarounds.
And The thing is, is I feel like I can say this pretty confidently like I wasn't an alcoholic and it didn't affect my performance in terms of like I still showed up and I still sold every day and it was what it was.
1:10
But I drank to basically like decrease the noise in my head because I felt so much pressure.
It was like I felt like I could take my first breath of the day after I had like a massive you know half a bottle of that stuff and that obviously, you know the pressure eventually led to you know me getting the the collision driving back from a family event ironically and what was interesting for me and that mighty that's not when I like.
1:33
I didn't stop drinking after that because again like I still felt honestly that it wasn't really an issue.
I had a coach like a performance coach at the time and after I got, I walked away from the accident.
If you saw pictures of it, it was 60 miles an hour and I walked away had on collision and it was like Alex, your stress is going to kill you.
1:53
He's like and you now see this And his big thing was basically like conversations unsaid, which is like you have all this attention that's spread between these things because you aren't willing to look at them Like you just you avoid these things, you avoid these hard conversations.
And so at this time, I was so spread thin, I actually asked Leila to just go away basically for a month.
2:13
And so we still talked, but we were like on a break and she she basically came in one day and was like, do you still want to be with me?
And I was like, no, you can do whatever you want.
And so she went and launched the gym in Hawaii.
We actually need it.
And she crushed it.
She still has the all time record from that launch.
And at this time I had, I had nine businesses because I was the classic like shiny object entrepreneur.
2:34
And so I had partners, I had all this stuff and I had a, I had a dental agency, a chiropractor agency.
I had five locations.
I had the 6th, which I was now in, spending my days in and then I had to launch business.
So I had like no mental bandwidth whatsoever.
2:51
And mind you, like I'm still not really making any money.
I'm just like, I'm like making revenue and just spending it again.
Like I'm just not doing, I'm not making anything.
And so the thing that really helped me get through that was after I did get in that DUI, in that collision, I think stakes became really clear to me, which was that I didn't die.
3:14
And if I didn't die, then everything that I looked at was framed through the image of, like, will it kill me?
And so then all of a sudden, like, the next day, I called all of these partners and was like, can't do business.
And they're like, but use it.
And I was like, can't do it, sorry.
3:30
I was usually the breadwinner for the, you know, I was the rainmaker for most of the businesses that I was part of.
I was like, I'll do whatever do you want.
I was like, but I'm not doing it.
And so I exited all of those businesses within the next like 48 hours.
What was your role in those businesses like the dental and the chiropractor marketer?
3:46
OK, yeah, marketing and sales, that was always my my game.
And so I just stepped out of everything and that was when Layla was like we should do this launch thing.
It's actually working.
So that's like concurrently going on, but from a pressure perspective, the thing that the perspectives that have shaped my life is have since then been all framed around death.
4:04
And that's been kind of my single point of absolute truth is that like, I am going to die.
And so if I look at things from that perspective, it just helps me get out of the like the daytoday expectations management of other people because I live the first part of my life that more than half of my life with the, you know, choked by the expectations that I perceived of other people.
4:23
And so I would say that probably the second-half of my life has been just a slow and deliberate process of trying to disengage as many of those as I can so that I can just hear the one voice that matters most, which for me is, is mine and trying to meet that man or the ideal version of myself's expectations.
4:41
So I think about like my 85 year old self and I'm like, what does he want me to do?
And so I'm like, does he care about what this person thinks?
And like, he said that that person didn't even show up to your funeral.
OK, well, if they're not going to be at the funeral, why do I care about what they think today?
And so I just, I use that frame a lot and that's what actually gets me.
It allows me to get out of a lot of social like perceived social constructs and expectations people want to put on you or at least that you perceive that they're putting on you and then you can just make decisions that make sense.
5:06
And so I think that that was my big unlock from that that little season and then that allowed me to kind of I got all my attention back and then that's when you know, I had that little breakthrough a few months later and then that was it.
When you are 85 years old and you're looking back on your life, what do you want that legacy to be?
5:26
So I would say internally and externally.
So internally it's that I leave no potential unused.
So as you know, I think everybody has an idea of what their potential is.
And so I just want no potential Alex left.
I want all of it actualized, every ounce of it squeezed out.
Why?
Because I find that meaningful.
5:42
And then from an external perspective, the more I've thought about it, I'm a big believer in what what Socrates said, that ignorance is the only evil, just not knowing.
So it's like people are mean to one another because they don't understand one another.
Like if they really understood the other person, then they wouldn't.
And if everyone's seen these TV shows where people hate each other, they find out more about one of them and all of a sudden they're actually fine with each other.
6:02
And so it's just people like the context.
And so I see, you know, the opposite of ignorance is knowledge or education.
And so our mission, acquisition.com, is to make real business education available to everyone.
And so that's why we write the books while we write, make the course because like, that education is what allowed me to lose everything and then still get it back.
6:19
And if you play out different scenarios, like if you accumulate all this wealth and they pass it on to a generation and they don't have the same education issue and then you pass it on to more generations, they lose it all because they don't know how it was made.
And so all of it, like, we're here with like cameras and recording items and we're able to do it because other humans who we don't know figured something out and they passed it on.
6:40
So it's very much like Newton's we stay, you know, I can see so far side staying on shoulders of giants.
And I know that in 5000 or 5 million years like my name will definitely be forgotten.
But I can still help humanity by having some level of contribution from an educational perspective And so from an external impact.
6:59
Education I think is the greatest legacy because it's the only thing that like if you have kids and they lose all your money but they have all your education, they can get it back.
And then from like a combating evil perspective, if you have, if everyone had complete understanding of one another and of the world which only comes through knowledge and education, then I think a great amount of evil would be would be avoided.
7:19
And so that's what I think, my 85 year old self.
It sucks to say this because I don't know how to say it the light in a good way, but I really enjoy teaching.
Or rather if I was going to be precise, I enjoy instructing as in teaching is organizing the environment to reward or punish for behaviors.
7:34
I don't do that but instructors and like if these are the things and how I do them that have worked for me, use them if you want.
That is something that I'd really deeply enjoy.
Like right before I came here, I spent the entire day redrawing images for the next book that's coming out, just so that they're like a little crisper and a little clearer and there's there's no thing that I enjoy more in my life.
7:53
Like if I did only that for the rest of my life, like I'd be stuck.
And so that's what I love most.
And I think if my 85 year old self saw me do that for the highest percentage of my life, possibly you'd be pretty happy to.
That's awesome, man.
That's powerful.
I think something really interesting about the time we're living in is there's something you said there which brought a thought to mind, which is you said in 5000 years or whatever, you know, people aren't going to know your name.
8:14
That might not be the case.
I think you know something that's so interesting and I don't think anyone really.
Most people don't think about this or talk about it, which is that we actually, due to technology, we now live in the first ever time in human history where the things that you create and put out there beyond, say, a written manuscript can exist forever and be accessed by everybody all over the world, right.
8:41
This podcast we are recording right now.
This conversation and there's no in 5000 years, people can come back and not just listen to the conversation, they can watch us.
All the videos you put out on YouTube, all the clips, all the long form stuff, that was never ever true.
8:57
I mean, if you go back, I don't know exactly what your photography, let alone videography, was invented.
But I mean, we don't know exactly what all these historical figures look like, right?
Because there was no photography.
There were definitely no video cameras.
We we can't hear their voices.
There's no recordings of them.
9:13
I mean, maybe the earliest you can go back is to maybe when was photography invented?
I don't know, late, late, late 1800s, early 1900s, something like that, right?
But it's only been, let's say, 150 or so years where you could even see an image of someone before that.
It's statues, it's paintings.
We've got.
9:29
We've got an idea of what these people look like, but we can't go, oh, let's watch a video of this guy.
And I think it's actually so fascinating that we now live in a time where everything we are now creating.
Our great, great, great, great, great grandchildren can go and be.
I wonder.
I don't know what my.
9:45
I don't.
I don't even know what my great, great, great grandfather look like.
Right.
But they can go back and be like, oh, OK, this is how this is him.
This is his video.
These are his videos.
This is Voices.
We we've got like this.
Tick tock real.
And I think that's actually, it's kind of scary in a way.
10:00
It's a little bit scary in a way, but I think that's incredibly powerful because we've already got this stack of human knowledge, but.
I think it's it's just going to be exponential.
Now all these videos, people are putting out all their tweets, all their posts, all that, everything.
I'm like, it's kind of scary that it's going to live on forever.
So, you know, be careful of what you post.
10:17
But but it is going to, and I do wonder how that's going to sort of bear out for humanity because I often say that in this modern era we only have two advantages.
Human nature hasn't fundamentally changed over the centuries.
The two advantages we have over our ancestors is we have better technology and we have access to the past.
10:36
That's it.
Really we're we're the same human beings as people were 500 years ago.
That's kind of all we've got.
So if we choose to use that to our advantage rather than to our destruction, then I think that's how we move forward.
Right now we seem to be doing, doing, doing a little bit of both, but human nature doesn't change.
10:53
That's why you can go back and read a book written 2000 years ago and the life lessons are as applicable today, whether you're reading the Bible or you're reading Marcus or Alias.
It's like, oh, it sounds like this could have been written last week because it it doesn't change.
It's the same lessons humans have.
11:09
We have the same flaws.
We're prone to the same silly thinking, same cognitive problems.
We have the same survival needs.
We we need food, you know, we need water with it.
It doesn't change.
And I think that we think that we're changing and we think that we're so advanced in whatever.
And I'm like, now we've just got better stuff.
11:26
That's kind of it.
We're not.
The people in the 1920s were the same.
The people in the 1820s were the same.
They just didn't have as much history and they didn't have as much stuff.
No air conditioning, no Wi-Fi, basically.
Pretty much, yeah.
It is interesting because I I think a lot about how poorest people today live better than, you know, Louis, the whatever, the royalty of a long era ago that always tricks me out.
11:46
And also that those people are still just as unhappy and happy as the people are today.
And so I mean none of this is is new stuff that more stuff isn't going to satisfy us.
And I think that like when we die or at least for me, like I'll probably be equally satisfied and dissatisfied as I am today.
12:03
Because The thing is, is like I've accomplished things that I said would make me happy years ago.
So I already know that that's a false, you know, false premise.
And so I had this mentor early on, and I had a particularly good weekend.
And, you know, saw some people I liked did stuff that I was that was fun for me.
And I came in just like kind of a little bit upbeat.
12:19
And I told her that and she said, you know, I'm pretty sure that's the secret to living a good life is putting as many of those days in a row as you can.
And it was.
It was actually like a really.
It was it operationalized joy for me, just like okay, doing things that I like with people that I like as many times as I can't.
12:37
I've never heard someone say operationalize the joy.
This man is a true entrepreneur.
Well, it's just because like a lot of it's like these amorphous words and we're like, what do they mean?
It's like, well, how do I, how do I make that real?
And so that's what I spent a lot of time on.
And even today, because we get a lot of time, I'm sure you get lots of people pulling on your time, right?
12:52
One of our teammates, our director of people, made a presentation on how it takes about 80 hours to make a friend to be a true friend.
And that was actually really profound for me in a different way.
More so because now I just think to myself, I'm about to take a lunch with someone.
Am I gonna spend 80 hours with them?
13:09
If the answer is no, it's giving me an easier way to say no.
She's like, I don't think I'm gonna spend 80 hours with this person, Okay.
I'd rather spend it with friends.
Not to say that I'd never take, you know, new meetings, but it's it's giving me a nice lens to say no, which I try and do as much as I can.
You've mentioned your wife, previous girlfriend, now wife, multiple times throughout this podcast.
13:31
I'd like to learn more.
How do you guys meet?
So we met on Bumble, which is the dating app.
It was the best one that.
So I don't know what, I don't know what the kids are doing these days, but it was it was where?
All the talent.
You don't want to know what the kids are doing.
Yeah, I don't want to know.
Yeah, it was.
It was where all the talent was.
And so anyways, I called her up because I quickly for me, my game plan was always like get the phone number as fast as I could so that I could get off the app.
13:52
And so I called her up and set a frozen yogurt date because I said, hey, it's low commitment, right?
If we don't like each other, we can dip in 10 minutes.
And she tried to cancel me the day before the date.
And so I called her up and I was like, you're not canceling.
I just said no.
I just refused to request to cancel.
14:07
And so she showed up for the frozen yogurt thing and we immediately just start talking about business.
And that was like awesome because I never, it's all it's all I cared about was business.
And so I felt like all my other dates, I always had to, like, pretend to be interested in what they were interested in.
14:23
And so this date, I just got to talk about stuff I was interested in and she was interested in that stuff too.
And so we spent like 4 hours on her first date only talking about business.
And at the end of the date, I said, hey, I don't know if this is going to work out, but you should only work for me.
And so I offered her a job and I was like, I'm going to do this new thing and I'm going to call Jim, launch.
I'm like, go around.
14:38
It was right at the time.
I was like, I'm going to go around the country and launch these gyms.
And so she said, no, I literally just met you.
Like, I'm not.
I actually had a whole book of business as a person trainer.
But anyways, I went and I did my first launches and I came back and I hadn't processed any of the money because I was, I can do the talking things I did that got all the credit cards, got them on the sign, and then I have the next person.
14:58
So I hadn't processed any of it.
And so she picked me up from the airport like a month or month or so later.
And we'd spoken every night.
Not always.
I was like, I went 21 for 23 today.
I went 18 for 18 for for 21, you know, like, whatever it was.
And she said, you need to take me on a date because you promised you're going to take me somewhere that wasn't Chipotle, Panda Express or.
15:15
And I was like, we're eating together.
What else is there?
And so anyways, I said, yes, I said, can you do one favor for me first?
And she's like, what?
I was like, I just need you to help me process these contracts.
And so I got back and I had this fast stack of contracts since I taught her how to process something like an hour.
We processed like 100 and something $1000.
15:31
And she, I mean, she can do math.
She looked at it and she was like, what is this?
And I was like, this is the thing I was telling you about.
And then she just like, she's like, is it legal?
That was her first question.
Like, is it legal?
And I was like, yeah, she was like, all right, a minute, that's so funny.
15:47
And so she quit her job.
So I only did the first two or three launches on my own.
And then Layla came with me first.
So anytime there was a launcher, it was just one, it would just be, it would be both of us.
And if we had two, she would fly to that one and we'd talk every night.
And that was basically our early days.
So we went from like we just met to traveling the nation, living out of the one room, motel room together within like six weeks.
16:10
So this is a little bit of the context of when I went back to see your family, they're like, so this is the guy that you met on the Internet and then six weeks later dropped everything for and are sleeping in a motel room.
Middle Eastern father.
Yeah, so huge fan of mine, right.
16:27
Right.
When I came back I had no money either so I'd lost everything to billing.
When she met me, I was a successful 5 location gym owner.
But anyways, we started doing this and we met in April of 16 And so if you remember the the chronology there, we met in April 16.
I did the first launches, then we did launches together.
16:44
I opened that 6th location with that guy in August which I crushed that launch at 370 plus sales and then he said then I then I sold the gyms and then I put all the money into that account.
Then he emptied the money from that account and then I got my DUI and then got my DUI.
17:03
My mom went to the hospital and then I had to close that gym down.
Drained my bank account for the most part.
Then had the processing issue, then launched all the gyms and then had the charge back and refund issue with them doing everything.
And then it started to work And so that was the 1st 12 months of our relationship.
17:25
And so after it's like things quote turned around which was like May 2 months later.
But like what's crazy though is that like two months after that we were taking home like, I mean we we took home like $300,000 in personal income like two months after that.
So honestly, I remember looking at her the month after that when I had $100,000 saved up after having nothing again.
17:45
And I was like one of the most significant moments in my personal life.
Because up to that point, even with the gyms, I always left the money in the in the business account.
So it never felt like it was mine.
It was always like, yeah, it's going to be for the next location or whatever.
And this was the first time I had $100,000 in my personal account.
And I remember, like, being in the kitchen with her and, like, pulling it up and, like, getting really choked up because I couldn't even, like, say it because I've been such a goal for such a long time.
18:08
I mean, mind you, like, for everyone's listening, it was six years, you know what I mean?
Or five, whatever it was, five or six years.
It was tough.
Five or six years.
And she came over and she like dropped everything while she was cooking.
And then she just like gave me a hug and I just like wilted in her hands because it felt like like we had made it.
And I I still have the state only thing I've ever felt as rich as I did in that moment because.
18:28
And I think I think about it a lot because the relative change in income was like 100 X, you know what I mean?
I went from 1000 to 100 that like, I don't think I'll ever have 100 X change in personal like ever again.
And I remember like after I could like I caught my breath or whatever.
I was like, we can screw up there we go for the next three years and we'll be okay because for me we were living together on 30,000 a year, both of us.
18:54
And so I knew that I was like we're good, we're good.
And then obviously the next month we made more and more.
But like that moment that was, I felt like I could exhale finally.
And then that I proposed to her two months later.
And my proposition was in the same style of I I walked in one day.
19:11
Our employees were worried because we were dating and running this business that was growing really fast.
And they're like, what happens if you guys break up?
I was like, it's a good point.
I understood concerns.
And so I just went to Layla and I said I have to handle something.
We're going to take a detour on the story.
I had had a fiance before this and we had like kind of left things like open loop, you know what I mean?
19:30
Like, maybe in the future.
And so I was like, I need to like close this loop.
And so I said, I'm going to go fly back to see my fiance and kind of close things off.
She took that as us breaking up.
Oh gosh.
So she flew back home.
Oh gosh, yeah, yeah.
19:45
And we came back, you know, two days later together.
And and we were at that point in Albuquerque, NM and I came in with flowers and I was like, these are for you.
And she was like okay.
I was like, so I've been thinking, I think the exact words I said, I think it would make sense if we got married.
20:06
Fellas, listening.
This is the line right there from Alex Ford.
I I didn't have a ring.
I didn't do the one knee, one knee down thing.
I will say I probably surprised her.
And so, yeah, I handed the flowers that I think it would make sense if we got married.
And then she like, looked at me and I was like, well, what do you think?
20:23
And she was like, I mean, yeah, I yeah, I guess so.
And I was like, OK, well then I guess we need to go get your ring.
And I was like, well, there's a jewelry store on the corner.
I was like, you want to go there?
And so we got in the car.
We went to the jewelry store.
He looked at a bunch.
And she was like, I like that one.
I was like, I like that one, too.
And so we bought it in 10 minutes and then went back to the apartment.
20:41
And I was like, I guess we have to do the church thing.
And so I go out to church.
And the pastor was like, Are you sure, son?
Like this is.
I was like a free Wednesday.
And he was like, yeah, it was 6 days from that point.
And I was like, yeah, no, that's fine.
And so we worked, and we worked that day that Wednesday.
And then after work, we went to the church.
20:58
We got married with no one, no family, didn't tell anybody because we, we thought our parents would disagree with it because they say you guys are moving too fast, you're being so irrational, blah, blah, blah.
But we were both like, we're doing this for us, it's not about them.
And so we got married.
21:14
We showed up to work the next day, told the staff, we're like, hey, you're good.
All your concerns have been, have been accounted for.
We are married, so you don't have to worry about that anymore.
And they were like.
What?
And so that was it.
And so we got engaged and married in six days and then been rocking and rolling since.
21:30
Wow, that's a Hick of the story right there.
I do have to ask what was the response when you eventually told your respective parents?
They weren't pumped about it.
I'll say that, Yeah.
My my dad was not happy about it.
21:46
So another random story, but I went back home for something.
And my dad threw a surprise wedding, kind of, oh, okay.
It wasn't a wedding, though, because there was no vows or dresses or anything.
And so it was just like a dinner.
22:01
So it's kind of like we're surprise reception, but it was only his friends, so a bunch of people.
I didn't know.
It was an odd experience.
And so that was my dad's taking it.
My mom found out over the phone, whatever.
And then I do remember her parents.
That was the funniest.
So we Facetimed her dad and he fixed up.
22:18
And he's like, hey, sweetie.
And I'm like.
Hey, I'm in the, you know, in this thing too.
And she was like, I've got an announcement.
And so she shows her ring, right?
And they're like, oh, congratulations.
And she was like, and we got married and then it was silence.
22:37
Oh boy.
The silence was so long that I stepped in on the phone and it was like.
Doctor Karosh, I was like, nobody died.
That was my first line after the silence was nobody died.
There's no funerals, everyone's okay, like it's all good.
22:54
But we spent 13 months together from beginning to end, been through the time and like it's all good.
That was how both parents found out.
And then what was interesting though is that we had to go back and we spent like 6 weeks and a nice place at this point that I was renting out.
23:11
I had a tenant and so.
We had gone to Puerto Rico and then to try and do tax stuff which didn't work out because four days later Hurricane Maria hit, if you remember that it does.
So four days after we went to Puerto Rico, the biggest hurricane in 90 years hit the destroyed everything.
And so Lela was like, I don't want to live there and so we basically were homeless.
23:29
But now we were making more than her parents house every week.
And so I went back now it was kind of a cool 360 of like 2 years earlier and so now we're staying at her parents house in the same room and.
We spent I spent like six weeks with them and so then her dad and I have have been close since like yeah, he's he's great.
23:48
He helps you with my books like we're thick as thieves awesome.
But that would So that was the they're like, OK, this guy's not so bad.
Just just just showed up from the Internet and just snatched my daughter and then.
But.
To piggyback real quickly, Layla is the reason that I'm here.
24:06
All of the success that I've had has been.
In part or 100% due to her like a lot of the like early days I I made my gyms relatively successful but not super successful and it was only when I met her because she is like kind of the yin to my Yang.
She's like got a massive heart.
24:22
She really is so good at judging people.
She's never been wrong about like the partner she was like I wouldn't do the business this guy and I was like what do you know?
I'm the entrepreneur.
And she was right.
The amount of times that we've had, like, actual crooks try and steal money from us and then later get indicted like true, like actual criminals.
24:39
And she like, we'll get like halfway through a process.
She's like, I don't know, I just something's off.
Like, it's happened three times in the last, like, few years.
And she just has like an amazing people picker.
And so she can build an infrastructure of people around anything.
24:55
And so I've always been able to like, outsell and outmarket any company I had.
But until I met Layla, I couldn't do anything about it.
And then she came in and was able to just organize people and she's been.
I mean, it depends on how you define CEO, but like, she is the CEO of all the things that we do.
25:11
Like her title is c.e.o@acquisition.com.
I'm founder.
I'm just like random guy who shows up on stuff.
But she like, I have one direct report.
She has many.
And so it's been because of her.
Like, I couldn't a lot of people try and pay lip service to, like, boost their wife up like?
It's not that.
And I would just always get the credit because I'm a guy.
25:28
But like Leila's a fish as entrepreneur.
I mean, she was successful personal tribe.
She's making more money, you know, before we met and then.
Yeah.
And since then we've fully integrated our lives.
So we work, we live life together.
So we both wake up and work all day and we work out.
And we didn't like, we spend all of the the day pretty much together and we've been doing that since.
25:47
And if you think about like marriage stats, it's kind of funny.
It takes.
I think it's the average couple spends, I think 2 hours a day together and like 45 minutes of that is watching television. 45 minutes of that is eating and then there's like 30 actual minutes of like, yeah, and two hours US statistics.
26:06
It sounds crazy, but then I think of how most people live their lives and people spend, what, 8 to 10 hours at work or on the way to it.
And then, you know, especially if they've got children in the picture, whatever.
Yeah, it it sounds shocking, but actually if you think about it, it's not surprising.
And so Leila and I, by the math, have been married for 50 years.
26:25
So we spent a long time, a lot of time together.
It's been good.
That's no man.
I mean, it's such an unorthodox story, but it's also, it's also very beautiful, right?
It's extremely romantic whilst being extremely unromantic.
You know, I so I remember I was engaged before this and wonderful family.
26:42
Everything was awesome.
And, you know, being a sensible person, I was talking to her sisters.
And was like, hey, I'm, I'm planning on proposing.
They're like, what's your plan?
I was like, well, the plan is we're going to go grocery shopping and then I will just, like, propose there because my whole angle was this is what life's going to look like, not the flowers.
27:02
And the I was like, this is life And so if you want to do this with me, I'm game.
And her sister heard that story and was like, that's a terrible idea.
This is not about you.
This is about her.
And you know she wants all these things.
And so I I did a whole the classic song and dance the whole thing.
27:19
I think that for me, the way that Leila and I's story has panned out is the way I want it to pan out.
Because like to your point of like, it's maybe romantic.
Maybe it's not romantic for some people, but it's like it's ours.
And so that's my vibe.
27:35
And well, no, I, I it's funny because it's romantic in an unorthodox way.
But if you think about the things that are, I'm not married yet.
But if I think about the things that are genuinely important in a lot, in a marriage and in a relationship and just that everyday stuff, spending times together, going through the ups and downs, taking the L's, getting the wins together, all that stuff.
27:57
I mean that's kind of what it is.
All the stuff of, you know, fancy this and you know, they they just all the all the song and dance, all the whole Disney kind of thing.
It's like okay cool, like people do all that stuff.
But then I think in the Western society in particular, and not even just Western, honestly, like globally because of the kind of commercialization of a lot of it.
28:18
You know, there's so much focus on the wedding, but not the marriage.
Just in what I see in many people's relationships, it's all this one day of like pomp and grandeur and spending 10s or hundreds of thousands and then it's like, okay, Well, what about the rest of it?
28:34
And people aren't thinking that.
I mean, if you're spending only two hours a day with a person, I'm like, that explains a lot of the other marriage statistics to me.
I'm like 2 hours.
That's that's nothing.
And I get the people's lives are structured in such a way.
You know, this person's got a day job, that person's got a day job and they're apart for so long.
28:51
But it's even though that's normal when you really think about it, it's kind of crazy that you're spending what you spend 10 hours at work or on your way to work in some office, say, and your spouse is also doing the same.
You're over there.
They're they're literally spending more time with your coworkers and with your boss and whatever Then you are with the person you're married to.
29:11
And then you get home and you're tired and maybe you and then maybe people fight and they're just, you know what I mean?
Because they're stressed out from the work.
And I'm like, that's as an entrepreneur myself, even though I, you know, I'm not married.
I'm not married yet, but I'd like to talk to people who are and learn from them because so much of what I'm doing now and the way I'm trying to position things is to think towards that future of being married and having a family and everything.
29:35
And I don't want to be a husband and a father who's not there because I'm forced to be kind of going into something.
So I'm like, let me set stuff up now so that I will have that flexibility.
Yeah.
Sometimes you don't have to go on a trip.
I might have to travel there or whatever, But I want it to be on my accord.
29:51
I don't want it to be because I have to do this or I have to do that.
I have to be away from my kids.
I have to be away from my wife.
So I think the way that that's worked out, even though it sounds so, it sounds unorthodox to people, right?
Even the running a business together, a lot of people are told, you know, don't run a business together, your spouse or whatever.
30:09
Although I've actually heard that that is the opposite of what is correct.
I've actually heard that couples who do run businesses together. $1.00 together in a business you have a 90% likelihood of not getting divorced.
Is that an actual statistic?
Divorce rates among people.
Divorce rates among people who have made a dollar together in business together, together is 10%.
30:30
That's incredible.
That's incredible.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
30:47
You can check on my YouTube channel, It's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into, and if not, keep enjoying the show.
Let me ask, because a lot of young men do listen to you.
I'm sure you've been asked.
You know that we, we do live in a time in an era and in a place where there's a lot of new challenges for young men and women out there.
31:07
There's a lot of challenges.
A lot of men are both men and women, I think are operating from a position of fear, in many cases, right Literally fear of the opposite sex.
But also fear of marriage.
Fear of commitment, fear of having kids, fear of doing this, fear of doing that.
31:24
Fear of judgment for a young man who is out there who is looking for a relationship, a wife, someone to spend their life with and to create their future with, What type of advice would you give to that man?
Whether he's he's in his 20s, he's in his 30s, whatever, but he's aware of all the madness going on in the world.
31:43
He's concerned about this, concerned about that, doesn't really know his position.
When it comes to the wife part in particular.
What would you suggest to that man?
Because I I saw you did a post on Twitter about this recently, so I'd love for you to expand on it.
So three things.
31:59
One is check your stats and So what I mean by that is.
If this person came into your life, what happened to your stats?
Did you get in better shape or worse shape?
Did you start making more money or less money?
Is this person trying to take you from the things that you want to do or is it trying to encourage you to do the things that you want to do?
32:16
That's number one.
Like all my stats had to go up.
Like that coach that I was talking about.
I was debating whether I should, you know, stay with.
I was at that point, I was to stay with Layla because it was during that break where where she was going to come back and he was like, check your stats.
And when I thought about it, I was like, well, shoot, she's in shape and she works out and she eats well.
32:32
And so I've been doing better about that And she doesn't drink like I drinks.
That's probably good.
You know I'm making more money than I did before.
So like all these things are like, well, yeah, I mean I guess my stats have gone up and that was that was a I was actually as silly as that sounds that was like a huge point for me.
And then we got we we got back together.
The second one is you want somebody in my opinion who believes in your dreams even more than you do.
32:55
Because I'm a big believer that you should only listen to somebody or take advice from people who have bigger dreams for your life than you do.
And.
I think most people don't have bigger dreams for you, which just means that for me, it's like their advice is invalid and so you want someone who really believes.
And I think that Layla always believed.
I mean, really, when there was, when it was definitely faith, there was not a lot of evidence, You know what I mean?
33:16
Like, she believed.
I think that like in the dark times that you will inevitably have in life, like having someone who believes in you, it's just, it's just everything.
It can be everything.
The last one is.
So the Bible talks about this.
I want to just get any ancient wisdom around getting married.
Right after late when I got married, we went through all the divorce stuff so that we could understand why people get divorced.
33:37
And so we went through all of these marriage retreats that are meant for, like, crisis marriages.
You went to them?
We went through the no.
We went through like the materials we bought, the workbooks and watches and it was super helpful for us.
There was a great one.
It's a Christian thing, even if you're not faith-based.
I'm not.
It was called love and respect and it was basically talking about how, like, men have different needs than women do.
33:56
Men need respect.
Women tend to need love.
And so talking like in those terms was really helpful for us and I think in a lot of ways just validated how we had set up our relationship.
But the only line in the Bible about picking of me not being married, there's tons of stuff on being married but only one on picking and it was pick someone to go to war with.
34:14
And when I think about that, I thought about it before we before we did get married and like she was somebody who had gone through war with me, you know what I mean?
And.
When she went to Hawaii, which is when we did that launch, When we split up, right?
Or went on a break, whatever.
When she did that.
34:30
Think about it from her perspective for a second.
So she met this guy on the Internet 4 weeks later.
He's flashes some money.
She quits her job, which she had a good career, Starts flying around the country.
As soon as he starts flying around the country, meets a partner she disagrees with.
It opens up more businesses.
34:46
I thought I'd quit to do this thing with you, but now you're doing lots of things, then says.
I don't think I want to do this anymore.
And then at that point, when you're living in a motel with this dude who says he doesn't want to be with you, you then fly to Hawaii and still make him money.
35:04
And so, like, when my world was crumbling, at that point, Layla stood tall and she crushed it like she didn't just like do OK.
She broke and set the record to this day for a single launch location.
And so like.
To me when she came back and like I had had some space, I'd finished this partnership, you know, I'd cleaned up some of my my personal space.
35:25
It was like when the chips were down.
And not everyone can be that lucky where you get to like like see someone go like test, you know what I mean?
That kind of thing.
It's kind of like you can say you're loyal, but until you have the opportunity to cheat, you aren't anything like you need evidence to claim the trait, and so like Layla's, have his nails and so when she.
35:45
Did that and came back and that was all the money that I needed to like do the try yet again and then fail.
Yeah, right.
My next temporary success leading only to failure.
That was just like she was somebody that I would go to war with.
You know the last thing that I'll, I'll add to this is again, I want to put the big giant disclaimer here, which is like this is just what worked for us.
36:08
Do whatever you want.
There are no sheds.
Live your life.
You don't even you don't have to get married.
There's I'm not even like, pro marriage.
I'm just pro my marriage like I see most marriages.
I wouldn't want that.
You know what I mean?
So I as an institution, not the biggest fan.
We talked about what it would look like for us to split up, what would we do about the business.
36:27
And we both agreed.
And even to this day, nothing would really change.
I would just live somewhere else and we'd still do business together because we enjoy doing business together.
And so I get questions from guys who are like, how do I get my girl to like, whatever?
And I'm like, you're not.
She always liked it and I could change the person.
And so one of the things that I loved about Layla was that.
36:45
Upfront, she said, I'm never going to try and change you.
And to me that was very freeing because like, I'm weird in my own ways, you know what I mean?
And almost like that little microcosm of that story with the the proposal and mind you, lovely family, lovely people, awesome.
37:01
It was just pure acceptance.
And so I think that like if you can find somebody who just accepts you, like truly isn't like, hey, you should dress this way or hey, you should cut your hair like this or hey, like all the because like there's big implications in that statement.
It's.
I don't care what you want for you.
37:16
I want you to look like this for me.
Now you could make the argument well I'm the one who looks at you all day and you want me to be attracted to etcetera.
But like in my opinion again one man's two cents is that you should be attracted.
Showed us a strong word is that I think it works better if you were attracted to that person's natural state.
37:34
Because if they if the way they act, the way they dress, the way they like, the way they are is someone that you are attracted to, then I think that's the game.
I think you've won and so.
I'm a big believer in Leyland.
I call it loving logically, which is counter to all the Hollywood stuff.
But like we talked about, like, OK, well, what happens if we get divorced?
37:52
What happens with the business?
How we're going to do that?
I was like, we're just going to keep running.
It's like, OK, cool.
Leyland and I have had one argument, and it wasn't like a screamer match.
It was just like, she really didn't want me to do this business thing and I really wanted to do it.
And I steamrolled her and I did it.
38:07
And it was the wrong call.
It was the wrong call.
Yeah, it was the wrong call.
And she was right.
But you know what?
She's never once brought it up that's that's that's actually, that's.
Yeah, she's never once been that way.
And so I got a piece of advice from a pastor about it and he he said something to us that was really helpful.
38:26
He said if you don't agree, don't move forward.
And we've we've actually stuck with that.
So we were like what happens when it's a 5050?
It's like you keep working on it and eventually you come up with a solution, you know that works brother.
You compromise if you need to.
But I'm a big believer in.
If you have the same information, you should make the same decision.
38:43
And so if we don't agree on something, the first thing we usually say is what information you're working off of.
Which means that I have an incomplete data set compared to yours.
And so then we share info rather than like arguing.
It's like, I don't know, what are you thinking about?
And like sometimes she's like, oh, what about this employee might take it like, that's a great point and didn't think about that.
38:58
Didn't call or sometimes I have something, you know what I mean?
But loving logically in that.
I think arranged marriages have.
They don't know.
I think they have high.
Success rate significantly.
And I think there's, I think there's a combination of two things.
One is low expectations.
Second is high commitment.
So if you define a successful marriage as one that does not break, which is not.
39:15
I mean, it's a low bar, but at least it keeps you married, right?
I don't think Leila and I had huge expectations.
Both of us weren't like planning on getting married and if anything, I was getting out of like a the fiance thing.
And when we met, I said I'm not interested in anything long term.
Like I was like, I'm just like I'm living life and if you want to live it with me, you can.
39:35
And so our dates we hung out every day after that first date.
Was I'm working all day.
If you want to work next to me, yeah, cool.
And so that's how our, like, that's how our quote dates work.
I think something just that in itself is very powerful, just just enjoying being in someone's presence.
39:51
Yeah, even if you're not like entertaining one another or in date mode or whatever, like just liking, hey, I'm working.
You know what?
I like you just being there.
Yeah, I think that in itself says a lot.
And I'll give you my last one, because I don't know, just give a bunch of them.
But this is great right there.
40:06
This is great.
I think 3 pieces and they're actually the same as they are with business is that you want someone with aligned mission aligned values and similar tastes or lifestyle.
So aligned missions, like do we want to go to the same place, right.
And when it like I've looked at a lot of past relationships they wanted different things from life and that's.
40:22
And again I want it like there's nothing wrong with that.
Like if you want different things that awesome, like just go do what you want to do and try and fund somebody else who also wants to do that thing.
And then that way you don't spend the rest of your life either resenting that person or compromising.
Like, again, I'm not like a huge pro marriage guy.
40:39
I I'm pro like do you.
And if there's somebody else that's doing them and you can do that together, I think that's great.
I mean men live 12 years longer on average who are married.
That was the life.
So you want 12 more years.
There you go.
So one is aligned mission, you want to go to the same place.
The second is aligned values, which is you want to get there the same way, right?
40:58
It's like, how are we going to choose to navigate, how we're getting there?
And Leila and I shared very similar values.
Remember, I think it was the first date I was talking about upsells and some, you know, some business thing.
And she was just parroting back to me like all the stuff that this business was doing.
And I was like, so you see that she was like, yeah.
41:15
And I felt really seeing because I was like, I don't talk to anybody who thinks this stuff's interesting.
And she was like, yeah.
And then they do this.
That's how they get you, blah, blah, blah.
And I think that that for me made me feel a lot less alone because I think a lot of times, I mean probably a lot of guys are guys and girls like you feel very alone.
41:31
I think if you can have someone who doesn't make you feel alone, that's a really big gift.
Because a lot of people are in relationships where like when you when you go to sleep at night and the person's next to you, you're laying on the pillow, you're like darned, there you go.
See, I didn't curse like, what am I doing?
41:48
Like what's it like?
And you feel more alone in that moment than than you were when you were alone or lonely, whatever the the quippy saying is.
And so you want to have somebody who wants to get there the same way as you.
Because I think if you have a shared experience of reality, then you get to enjoy everything together.
If you have a different experience.
Which is why like when people live lives together and they live separate lives.
42:06
I think one of the tough parts is like if the lady is at home all the time and the guys getting exposed to work stimuli all the time, you're going to adapt to the environment you're in.
And if you're in different environments, like in the beginning, the opposites attract part is what creates the chemistry.
But if there isn't enough overlap, then it just fizzles because they're just two strangers that it doesn't actually make sense for them to be together.
42:27
Because like, why would you just be with this random girl who like, sure, maybe she's attractive, but then like, then what?
Like, she's into completely different things than you, right?
And then it's like you have no shared interests, which is really the last one, which is like the taste and lifestyle and the things you enjoy doing.
42:43
So it's like, we both like fitness.
If I liked fitness and the person I dated didn't like fitness, that would be a big part of my life that I wouldn't really like.
The way I eat.
It's the way I workout.
Yeah, it's a big one.
It's a big chunk, right?
Like if I didn't have somebody who was into that, like, that is a pain.
Like, that's just like now.
Now for me to be me, I actually, it's like a give on the other person.
43:01
Like I have to ask for.
Like there's all all this time I'm not going to spend with you for the rest of our lives together because of this interest that I have.
Yeah.
So yeah, and I think with that one in particular, and I've seen this happen in other people's situations, is.
It can create resentment, yes, right?
43:16
Because if you're someone who is training and you're looking after your body, you're mining what you eat, you're putting in all this effort and you're with someone who just wants to sit there and eat trash.
And not exercise and not train and get out of shape.
Yeah.
And in the process of that leads to people getting out of shape.
43:32
And, you know, they're you're that you're there and you know you're in.
You're in good shape.
And then, you know, your wife or girlfriend is kind of slowly ballooning up over the years.
It creates resentment on both angles because you're like, hey, stop being a slob.
Like, you know, you want to push them in that way, not in a mean way, but you want to, you want to encourage them and you do want them to look good.
43:49
I'm sure you've seen situations where women want to, like, fatten up their men a little bit to kind of like keep.
Right.
Like they they're like, no, I don't want you you're you're a little you're a little too ripped.
You're looking a little too, a little too good, right.
And it creates this very odd, it creates a very weird dynamic.
44:04
So something like you know being into fitness might not seem on paper like oh this is something important.
But I actually think it is.
I think it's very important.
I think it's also important that I can see with you and her, you both have a the the self improvement streak, right.
44:20
If you're someone who's into self improvement.
And you're with someone who is not.
Again, over time, that gap just grows.
If you're just like, I'm getting better all the time.
Like I'm working, I'm trying to get better.
I'm trying to level up, level up, level up, and the other person's just happy to just stay the same, to just stagnate again.
44:36
Over time, it creates the shift and I think it.
I've seen that play out with other people.
I'm very observant of other people's relationships, whether it's successful or or unsuccessful.
I like to learn from it all and then be like, OK, cool.
I'm making notes on all this stuff just like I do with other aspects of life.
44:52
I think the growth one's huge.
Like, arguably the biggest.
I mean, I think I'll give you an example.
So if I had to name 1 trait about Layla that I value the most, it's that she's coachable.
And so she responds to feedback immediately and aggressively.
45:10
And so earlier on, when we were dating, if someone's laughing, they're like, you're so stupid, right?
She used to say that.
And I remember she said that to me.
And I said, I don't like it when you say that.
And maybe it was my own insecurities, maybe identify as being smart, whatever, whatever reason, right?
45:27
And somebody could say, hey, you should just work on that, Alex.
You shouldn't protect it on her, blah, blah, blah, whatever.
It's a hell of a lot easier to just ask somebody to just not do this thing right.
And I'm telling her that and to this day, she's never done it again.
And it wasn't like some big punishment or anything like that.
45:42
It wasn't like some like I was just like can you say that?
I was like, I don't like it when you say that and her speed to correct behavior is unlike anything.
I mean she's faster than I am.
Like she like she can just once and just immediately.
That's why I think she's such a good operator for our companies.
45:58
But like if you have somebody who cannot take feedback and that's what that kind of growth perspective, that's tough because then you can't Orient yourselves with one another.
Yeah.
And I think there's a difference in changing values versus changing a small behavior.
You know what I mean?
And it's it's also that thing you said before like men do want respect.
46:16
What men actually want is not talked about a lot in our society, right.
I think we hear a lot about what women want.
We don't hear a lot about.
Like, it's true, right?
We don't.
There's a movie called that, right?
Like you don't hear, you don't hear a lot about like what men actually desire.
And I think something like that it's.
You know, I don't think it's an ego thing.
46:32
I think it's just a respect thing, you know, even if it's a joke, right, saying oh, you know, the stupid it's.
And I also think if someone loves and respects you, then they don't want to disrespect you, even if it's something that seems like silly or frivolous or whatever.
If someone you said, hey, you know, I don't, I don't like when you do that.
46:47
And they're like, they make a huge thing about it, to me that would be like a red flag because I'm like, hey, I'm doing all this, you know, if you asked me, if you said, hey, you knows, you'd be this thing you're doing.
It's like really bothering me or whatever.
And it's like some very minor thing.
I'll be like, OK, cool, no problem.
We'll cut that out because I love you, right?
And I think the other way around.
47:03
Cool.
Like, I love and respect you.
So like why hang on to that thing?
So Alex, man, I know you've been super generous with your time.
So one last question before we close it out is for anyone who is out there who is entrepreneur.
47:18
Curious, right?
One, Yeah.
One entrepreneur.
Anyone out there who is there, either they're in a they're in a job already, or they're just coming out of college, or they're considering going to college.
Whatever.
Lots of different situations, but for that guy or that gal who isn't just not sure of what to do.
47:38
What should I do next?
What should I do first?
What would be your advice for that person?
So I think you have to decide whether you want to make the work that you do right now your main hustle or make your main thing the side hustle and your side hustle, the main hustle.
Meaning if you're in a career that you enjoy and you just need to put your reps in, then stop being distracted and go all in on that.
48:00
Because not everyone is going to be an entrepreneur, right?
It's definitely like glamorized right Now.
On the flip side, if you are like, I, I want to do this thing, I want to get in this entrepreneurial game, then you need to work really hard at your job because excellence is a trait.
48:17
And then you also need to work really hard outside of your job.
And people were like, well, then that means that you're asking me to sacrifice my family or you're asking me to sacrifice.
Yes, there's tradeoffs and there's seasons.
And if you have zero to start, then you need to get the momentum and the momentum.
48:32
And just like you have to work double time, like you have to do your normal job, then you got to work to get ahead.
And so my kind of steps there is like, start the thing, start making money from the thing, start making enough money that it replaces your current income.
Do that for six months and then at that point you can get the rest of your time back and go all in on it.
48:48
I think that's the the safest bet to do it.
To be clear, I did not do that.
I saved up what I thought was a year and a half of living or maybe 2 years of living for me, which is 50 grand.
But then I spent that opening a gym and then I had two months of rent left and so I definitely want a little bit more do or die.
49:04
And again I've said before and I said again, I was, I was lucky.
I would not have advised myself to do that.
I just think I was.
I got a one out of five shot night and it worked.
Awesome man.
And Alex, where's the best place for people to find and follow you online?
Well, if you're podcast or I have a podcast called The Game by Alex or Rosie, or with Alex or Rosie, if you type my name in, you'll find me.
49:23
And if you're on the interwebs of Youtubes and stuff, if you type my name in Alex or Rosie, you will find me.
And if you're a company that does over a million or plus in profit and you're looking for a minority party and help you grow or majority exit, just go to acquisition.com and we're happy to take a look at the company and see if we can know.
49:40
Awesome Alex for Mosey.
Thanks for coming on the show, bro.
It's been really good getting to know you and to finally have you on.
I've been wanting to chat to you for a while, hopefully, hopefully we delivered.
No doubt man, 100% appreciate.
Appreciate you.








0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show guys, happy Tuesday one day after I asked you guys for some questions.
And so thank you so much for giving me the amount of time that it took you to write the questions.
I would try, are you by giving you Good answer.
So there were a few different kind of stress like lines of questioning that appeared on the video that I made yesterday.
0:39
And so I'll probably answer three or four at a time per video, just depending on what kind of line or bucket, it kind of fit into.
And so the first one that I wanted to or the first four that I wanted to kind of address where from will Hamilton many Laris, Jesse Catalano and Alex Morningstar because it kind of fell into the same bucket under My, you know, understanding of it and so will Hamilton asked.
1:03
How would you make this work for how to make challenges work for apt?
First CrossFit Studio, Jesse asked how you do this, if you wanted to run this online and sell online, and then Alex, Morningstar asked how you can do this.
If you had a mic, mic Muay Thai studio.
1:20
So, I'll just address your three first and then I'll address paintings for will Hamilton.
And those of you who have a PT first, A box.
Right?
What's up Tyler?
That's actually really like I don't really know why there's even a hang-up with it.
1:38
Like a six-week challenge is literally just a front-end whatever you want to do on the Fulfillment side is up to you.
So I mean we've had semi-private Studios that just run you know two times a week.
Semi private sessions for six weeks so they get 12 sessions for 600 or 800 or $1000 that they run on the front end.
So it's entirely up to you in terms of what you want to use for your fulfillment mechanism.
1:57
The point is that we're Just getting them in the door so that we can provide great service and that would work.
I mean I don't even see an issue.
The main I guess constraint for you is just that you're not going to be able to take as many on.
But you've already said that, that's kind of what you want to do.
2:13
Anyways, is not teaching me people on at once.
So don't take too many people only once.
You know what I mean, like that's entirely your prerogative and it would work seamlessly just the same way.
So if you're, if you're just comfortable starting with 2 or 4, new PT people a week and start with 2 or 4 News.
2:29
People a week.
If you're selling at 800 bucks a pop, you know, and you do four of them, it adds an extra three grand a week, so it's an extra 12 Grand a month.
You know what I mean?
Just on the front end and then you can transition back to CrossFit on the back in the exact same way.
We transition everyone else to CrossFit or large group, whatever on the back end.
2:45
I mean there's really no difference.
It's just a question of whether like you have the capacity but that's always going to be your business problem.
No matter what if you want to leave with PT which is fine, it's just, you're limiting your inflow, which is full.
So But that's your choice and really doesn't have any effect on the acquisition process.
3:04
That's just a fulfillment.
Thank you.
So we'll hopefully that answers your question.
If you have any more problem below, happy to talk more about it because I love talking about this stuff.
So, Jesse Catalano.
You said, could you work?
Could this work with online?
It probably could.
3:20
But that's not my, that's not my wheelhouse, not that I couldn't do it.
We obviously have an online business.
It's just that I don't recommend people have two things.
I'm I speak out pretty adamantly against the whole hybrid model because I think what ends up happening is that you chase two, rabbits, and you catch neither, I don't think split focus makes anyone any money ever Only people that I see who actually run multiple businesses successfully.
3:45
You're usually doing a hundred million dollars more or more in Revenue where they've actually got to the point where they can executive team and then underneath them they have managers underneath them.
They have Frontline employees, but if you're like, I'm trying to start two things at once, one of them is going to work, it never works.
So let me like, hopefully save you that time.
4:02
You should just use it in your local market, crush it because it already works really, you know, like the systems end to end and it just flat out work.
So I would just do that rather than trying to do it online and then introduce more variables because everything seems attractive until you get into it.
So you get it.
4:19
There's a there's a beautiful like curve of uninformed optimism first.
So right now, you're uninformed and optimistic and then becomes informed pessimism and then you have the valley of Despair and then you have informed optimism and then you have the realization of the goal but most people don't make it past inform pessimism or Valley of Despair.
4:37
So my recommendation is to not do that is to just focus on the local market that you're eating.
It that way Alex Morningstar, you had a you have a 1200 1200 facility from white eye.
And the question was just how do you, how do you get?
How do you start a challenge without disrupting your current member experience?
4:56
It really depends on.
So first off, it's a big strategic question in terms of whether you want to introduce a fitness component to your facility and that is a, you question, I like Fitness and transformation aspects because it's easy to sell.
There's a huge demand for it in the market.
5:12
Place and its high value.
A lot of people value changing the way they look in a very short period of time, especially initially and then they get brought into the process etcetera in the community.
So, that's really a you question.
Now, if you said, okay, I would like to do that.
5:28
I do want to introduce, you know, a fitness component to my facility so I can satisfy two, knees, and I get two different front-end.
Some people want self-defensive confidence, other people want weight loss and then we cross out, which we have tons of facilities that do that, that's just a choice that you have to make.
But in terms of, if you have a 1200 or facility, there's two Alternatives.
5:47
One is that you introduce a fitness component to your white eyes sessions.
So like maybe the first 30 minutes or so is is kind of conditioning work and then the second 30 minutes is skill work, which is fine.
A lot of people just see that isn't happy benefit or the alternative would be that you have like conditioning sessions.
6:06
That only the people who are in The Challenge would have access to, but I see that as sort of a more limited model.
The people who are going to have the most success of the ones who really like incorporate into how they do their fulfillment on a larger scale and especially since you're limited by space that would have to be because like you're not going to really start another like in my opinion because what would happen is this, if you started it, you start one session and then you start one session a day.
6:30
A it'd be kind of a pain in the butt to fill but you could do to one in the morning one at night.
The thing is just like you're going to make more in the first week running our thing.
Then you've done from your entire more Thai studio and then you're gonna be like holy shit.
I'm You doing this like now and so then then you're going to confront the fact that you want to change strategy because make way more money.
6:47
So it's that's what's going to happen if you do choose to do that.
But again, it's your problem, it's your business, and it's whatever you want it to do.
So, I hope that that kind of answer the question, but from a logistics standpoint, starting with one of the morning one at night.
You only have enough room for one session, so it's like for me, if I really want to do a proper data, I would just do a specific amount of time during the session that would be for fitness and Then followed up with him.
7:12
Opening.
And that could be a nice added bonus of a nice sales point.
The last question was for many Loris who asked what happens when like if there's other people in my area, if we were doing Jim launch which is like a comment obstacle overcome that we have in our shell script so I will tell you what are basically tell everyone, we've got some markets, we got 20 gym trying and yet they all get fed and so the reality is that if you look at the marketplace it's not like there's one pie like this and then Others to gyms and others for gems and there's whatever eight gems.
7:46
And you're cutting this one pie and like less and less throughout is that there's 400 gyms in your market and now you're just going to be one of the eight or one of the ten, that's actually crushing it.
And the reality is that, if you over-deliver have amazing service, having these with fulfillment, really care about your customers, follow up with them, have events early on, to, to engage members, get them into the community.
8:09
Then you're going to be a gym.
That's going to succeed, and you're going to be a gym that's going to maintain.
Jane the customers, get referrals and then grow from there.
And so the question that I think you had as a secondary question is what happens if the market gets tired of Six-week challenges, right?
8:26
And hey it's a fair question, but I think that if you look at history from Fitness like LA Fitness in front a free month for like 40 years and so your, as long as you have a mechanism that converts eyeballs into customers walking in the door, then you're going to be okay.
8:45
Thanks Darrell.
Appreciate it.
You're going to be okay.
And the moment it stops working.
There will be something that works because there will always be You something that brings people in the door.
Now, my personal opinion is that for the 40 years that LA Fitness was dominating and 24-Hour, Fitness was dominating, is because they were the only ones who are big enough to afford radio, by Stevie buys, big Direct Mail plays.
9:07
And so, they were the only ones who even had any promotions that we're working on a large-scale, the Advent of Internet, advertising allowed people to start with a five dollar a day budget.
And so a lots of morph, lots more fish.
Could enter the marketplace, the other thing that happens that you could test a lot faster.
9:23
And so the The you know the the front end promotions that they usually had was for, you know, one month free stuff like you know, no Initiation fee, things like that, that they would use to get people in the door.
But the reality is that they probably just never tested a security Challenge on the front end because if they had my opinion, is that it would have converted better.
9:40
It's just that they didn't know because that was not one of the tests that ran.
Now we started running challenges six-week challenges in 2013 at my facility so that's five.
Six years ago that we started running those and my opinion is that We're just able to test in so much faster that we can run 100 tests within two weeks rather than do an a/b split test.
10:02
If you are really Savvy, marketer back in the day and then have to wait for months, to get all the data from your direct mail piece or your radio split test, right?
And so if you're looking historically at how people, how Jim's Market to get people in the door one, the average woman died, has five times a year.
10:18
You're going to be getting different eyeballs every single time, you run a campaign, because a different person's light is on at that moment to Respond to an advertisement.
The second thing is we want to craft the offer that is going to be the one that converts best.
And so right now I'm a big advocate of have one front end that works the best like right now.
10:36
We haven't changed our free case study for 19 months.
If we need to change it, we will.
But even so it's still going to push straight to a strategy called because that's what's worked.
That's our acquisition system.
That's what good we need to change the widget we can.
But at the end of the day, if you're a gym, you're going to be giving a certain amount of time for free, right?
10:52
Like it's going to be a And it's going to be a promotion of its time, right?
It's 28 days, it's 42 days, 12.
I mean, like, there's just so much like you're going to be giving.
Hey, try our service at the, it all boils down to it.
11:08
That's what it is.
And so, if you want to have a way of liquidating that attention, right, liquidating the amount of time then, I would suggest that you sell something on the front end, that's 500 to 700 dollars, right?
When they come in the door will Hamilton earlier said he's got the PT.
11:24
First model.
Cool.
Those guys do.
Pt first.
That's fine.
You know I mean if you want to run more volume through your door and have a more you know a structured process where you can take on 10 15 new customers a week then you can run a child's model.
We have it either way, it doesn't really matter.
It's just an acquisition process.
So A most addition quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
11:48
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
All that to say if they're ever does get to act.
12:05
Like one of the market is big enough, because every single day, right?
Every single day, there's 400 gyms in the market every single day, each one of those gyms has new people who walk in the door and people walk in the door off of work.
Now they walk in the door because they Googled it and it showed up on Google Maps.
12:21
They walked in the door because they Googled it and it was a blog post.
That someone Road at wrote for SEO, it was something they heard on the radio.
It was a direct mail piece.
It was something.
So Instagram is something that's on.
It was something that's on YouTube.
The amount of traffic that is out, there is so much bigger than people are giving credit for it.
12:37
Like, like, I just got a message this morning, someone's like, hey someone's, like trying to copy your stuff.
I'm like, do the sign up to 13, Jim's?
Yesterday, we are much bigger.
And the point is, is that there are still still enough market in my tiny.
Little sliver of gym owners who are like who are CrossFit owners who came owners or summer private facilities.
12:55
Like I'm in a niche of an inch of a niche and we're still able to grow to the size that we are.
If you're talk about weight loss like women who would like to lose How many women do you know, we like to lose weight, all of them, right?
And so, if you have 400 teams in each one of the gyms on average times have 10 new customers a month, you're talking 4,000.
13:11
New people a month were signing up for gym, memberships, like across the city.
And our concern is what happens if another gym is marketing.
So what like one more Jim is like is going to be a little bit better than the other four hundred you're going to need, but still at the end of the day, that's just going to be something to get someone to try your food.
13:32
Unless your food is good, they want to tell your friends their friends and they will not get more people to go for you.
So and I mean, but the, the sad the sad news is that, no, Jim no micro Jam is really even big enough.
Most of the time even in the market aggressively for 10 years, you know, I mean like for five years for anyone to even know who you are, right?
13:51
Like I remember thinking when I walked, when I said, I had United Fitness and Southern California and I wanted to be like, like, on the street, like, hey, do you know like The other United Fitness and people are like, I don't even know that is and like a telling tale of this and I've said this before, is that a friend of mine used to launch our new theories and I said, oh that must be really easy.
14:12
Everyone knows who, you know, aren't theory is and I was like, no, not really.
I was like what.
And he said, nine out of ten leads that we get off of online advertising.
It never heard of Orangetheory Orangetheory.
And so if you're worried about like how Pike, I hope that gives you an idea of how big the market is and how big the pie is.
14:30
And if you're like, there's two gyms in my area marking off, These books, light, you'll both get fed for all three of, you'll get better.
All ten of you get fed, and it doesn't like that should just extend your mind.
In terms of how big, the guy is, if every single like I told you, there's 4,000 people, there's 400 Jim's Eastern gets 10 people a month.
14:46
There's four thousand people, every single month.
We're signing up for Jim's is just, can you do you think that you can get 20 of them?
Do you think you can get 40 of them?
Of course you can.
Right?
You have to know how to Market not is.
So not even act as a process and then put this process in place for each traffic.
15:02
All that you're using.
So.
Okay, hopefully that answered will Hampton specials about Petey first.
Yes, I think you can use that as a form of mechanism for the sixth challenge.
Just because of Lana.
I would not recommend that you do this as an online program because I think will be distraction for you.
I would just focus on the fundamentals of doing what you do because you can make tons of money with Jim through it right now.
15:22
It's Morningstar about my tie.
That is a fundamental strategic decision for you.
In terms of what you want your facility to be about.
If you like what will likely happen.
Those, if you adopt our model, you will make a lot more.
Money and then all of a sudden you'll see your like your perspective will change.
But like I saw that you could do that experience on and the many I hope that that kind of size of the pie explanation give you a little bit of idea in terms of how big the actual pie is what I think about Market saturation and the longevity of an offer and at the end of the day, like what offer is going to beat at least four r's are free 60 challenge.
15:58
There aren't many.
And I think that it wouldn't even be giving like What about a free eight week challenge?
I think that there's magic with six weeks and the reason that I think that is six weeks is just long enough.
That people believe that they can have a huge outcome, but short enough that they believe that they can achieve it.
16:14
And so I think that's really the balance point with the six weeks, free just makes it irresistible and challenges are just kind of what Thief would be converting right now, if it turns into something else will change it, you know what I mean?
But like, it's flexible for the guys who know me, like, I'm in no way romantic about a six, you challenge.
16:29
It just happens to be the vehicle that works like her.
At least has worked for the last five years, and doesn't seem to be slowing down.
So, I mean, and it for anyone who's like, well, I'm concerned of what happens when it stops working.
It's like, well, there's something that's working right now.
I don't want to use it because it could stop working.
16:46
It's like we'll just do just use it now.
It's working and then when it's tough, working will move to the next thing.
You know what I mean?
It's just called being adaptive, which is part of the game.
And if you think that your business has ever been interesting to have one offer like forever, then that's silly because business is It so, don't think that way, because it's not reality.
17:05
It's just like a dream world that we want to have, and it's just not true, but for the while it works.
So and it has worked last five years.
So I don't think it's going to change like, proclaiming the six months.
But anyways, guys, have an amazing Tuesday.
I hope that answered your for questions.
And for those of you who tuned in, I appreciate it.
17:24
Thank you much talk to you soon.









0:00
Real quick guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
0:19
So the single thing that I has to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
This is where most people stop, and This is why they don't win.
It transitions into one of my my most used sayings.
0:34
To myself, I don't say a lot out loud, but to myself, it's like I won't do my best.
I'll do what's required.
And so right now, what is required for you to win or get a job or get the skill might be better than your best, and so it just means that your best just needs to get better.
Welcome to the game where we talked about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:56
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wish Bezos, Musk, and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
One in every 250 businesses does over $10 million a year in sales and that means that 99% of entrepreneurs never hit it.
1:12
Every business that I've started since I was 25 has crossed 10 million B to B services with Jim Law, B to C consumer products with Prestige Labs or supplement company Allen our B to B Software and acquisition.com which is an investment firm for all of the money that we made during those businesses to invest in other ones.
1:29
Feel really confident that I can talk to the points of helping you go from zero to 1,000,000 million to 10 million and beyond.
And so this is just a visual put this in context. 90% of businesses never hit $1,000,000 a year in sales, 90% doesn't look that way on Instagram.
1:46
But this is the this is the vast majority of businesses right now, 9% of businesses across this $1,000,000 threshold, right.
And then only .4%, which is one in 250 do 10 million plus.
2:02
It's so rare.
And so the nice thing is that success does leave clues.
I want to kind of separate this into two major categories.
One is the entrepreneur and the other is the opportunity vehicle they're pursuing.
You'll notice I said leverage rather than opportunity vehicle, but fundamentally leverages the difference between what you put in and what you get out.
2:17
And so you want to have the best entrepreneur getting the most out of what they put in.
And so if you have those two things together, then you create a $10 million plus business.
And if you've consumed any of my other content, I used to talk about how entrepreneurs does three main things.
You've got skills, you've got character traits, you've got beliefs.
2:33
I've thought about this more and I've actually simplified it to 1 degree, which is I think you just have skills and beliefs, character traits.
If you think about this, you're like, I want to become patient.
Patient is just a general term for lots of little skills.
2:49
And so if you want to become more patient, you want to do things that patient people do.
And that means that if I can train someone to become more patient, then patience is a skill.
And so as a total side quest on this, what's interesting about this is that you've probably heard people say soft skills and like hard skills.
3:04
In my opinion, hard skills are just skills that are easy to measure.
Soft skills are just hard to measure, but they're both 100% skills that you can train and improve.
And so if we say, man, I wish that guy had better people skills, what we mean is 100 micro skills that are like, I wish you would smile when someone walked in the room.
3:22
Can I train someone to do that?
Absolutely.
If I said, hey, I wish you would greet someone by their first name immediately, every time they walk in the door, right?
Boom, that's trainable.
I wish someone wouldn't interrupt.
It's like, OK, well, we can just give someone a cookie every time they don't interrupt someone and let someone finish their statement.
3:39
And then we train them.
And so all of these soft skills are just soft because they're hard to measure, doesn't mean that they're not skills or they're not important.
And oftentimes most of us know that, like within an organization, like the way that you gain influence is the soft skills that are hard to measure but incredibly important.
3:55
So if we're talking about how do we make the highest leverage entrepreneur, we want somebody who has lots and lots of skills.
And really it's about beliefs that don't limit them.
If someone had no limits in terms of what they believe they could achieve, then the only thing that would limit them was their skills.
But most of the times, the beliefs that we have are things that just decrease our potential.
4:15
And it's not really our fault because most of the people that were around us when we grew up just by statistics, were poorer than you might want to be.
And so they told you how they see the world.
If there's ever something that's going to be on my tombstone, it's this quote, which is we question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those we never think to question.
4:34
And so, like the things that you actually believe, they're so invisible to you because that's just your lens through which you see the world.
Whereas when you're like, I want to debate this point, it's like you don't really believe that.
You just have an opinion on it or you have some assumptions that you're willing to back.
Right?
But the true beliefs of like, well, no one would be willing to pay for something like that or like that doesn't exist.
4:54
I didn't know that was possible.
You don't even question those things because they weren't even in your mind to begin with.
It's the unknown unknowns that are the things that limit us.
The question is how do we uplevel someone's beliefs?
So let me give you a quick example here.
So there was an entrepreneur that I know who had a fitness app.
5:10
He was a super high level CrossFit Games competitor and he started this app and he didn't want to tell anybody about it because he'd never placed top three.
He placed fourth place in multiple competitions, which is insane.
But he had a belief that if he wasn't the winner, he didn't deserve to have an app like, think about how crazy it is.
5:29
But he didn't question that.
That was just what he believed reality to be is like.
Well of course, of course I wouldn't want it.
And so he built this app for himself and just the members of his gym.
But the app was so good that people started sharing it.
And finally a client of his was a marketer and said you need to start marketing this, you need to start posting about it, and he wouldn't post.
5:48
And finally, she convinced him to just make one post and he, like, doubled his revenue.
He'd gone from like 20,000 a month to $100,000 a month with his app simply because he changed his beliefs.
And so, like, fundamentally, he had all the skills.
He was already a really good CrossFit Games competitor.
He already had the product that was really good, and he already had the skills to be able to market it.
6:08
He was just choosing not to.
Unchaining an entrepreneur is figuring out the reasons they give for why they can't do something.
Those are known limits, right?
Well, I can't do it because of X.
That's the things that you know because you can even explain it.
I can't do it because I'm not number one.
6:25
I can't do it because I'm not in good enough shape.
I can't do it because the app doesn't load well enough.
I can't do it because it's only on one platform.
I can't do it because insert whatever.
Right now.
The dangerous ones are the unknown unknowns.
All right.
My whole goal when I started my chain of gyms was that I wanted to be America's next gym.
6:42
So I bought the trademark United Fitness.
I was really proud of it.
I had six locations.
I joined this group of Internet entrepreneurs now mind you this, the reason I think this is funny is because I was sold by the sales guy that there was other gym owners in the room and they were all like doing well and doing stuff on the Internet too.
6:58
Got in the room.
Not only were there no gym owners, there weren't even any brick and mortar business owners in the room.
And so I was like, wow, this is a shock.
And so everybody's going up there exploiting their, like ads and their funnels and their upsell process and all this stuff.
And I get up there and I'm like, I own 6 gyms and I was like, but these are the ads I run to get members into my gyms.
7:16
The thing is, I gave this whole breakdown of everything I did and how opened every location at full capacity on the first day without taking cash out of pocket, all the stuff.
And I remember the, the guy who's running the the whole, the whole group.
And I really looked up to this guy at that time because he was the first person who was like way more successful than me, that I actually had access to.
7:34
And so I think at that point he was doing $1,000,000 a month.
And I remember thinking like, whoa, like, and so I go through this whole presentation, I'm talking as fast as I can, explaining all the stuff that I do.
And he stops.
And he's like, Alex, I don't think you should be in the gym business.
7:52
And I remember hearing that it was like, time slowed down because I felt like you, like, punched me in the gut because this was, like, my whole plan, my whole dream.
This is what I was going towards.
But I, like, paused and just, like, hurt him out and said, you have a level 10 skill set and a level 2 opportunity.
I don't think you should be running gyms.
8:07
I think you should be teaching people how to do what you just walk through.
And I had a belief, and I still do, that if someone's further along in the game of business, you always have things that you can learn from them.
And if I paid to be in this room, if I don't take the advice, it's the closest thing to me burning all the money that I paid to be here.
8:23
And so when he told me that to me that was an unknown, unknown.
I didn't know that there was another opportunity vehicle outside of me just owning gyms.
Like I didn't know it was possible.
So I hadn't thought, like I didn't know how franchises worked.
I didn't know how licensing worked.
I didn't know how, how any of I didn't know how to be to be national.
8:42
Any of that stuff worked.
Now there were sub skills that I would have to learn in order to enable it, but I couldn't even start on that skill path or see the deficiency of skills that I had because I didn't even think I could pursue it.
And so these are the ones that in my opinion are the most powerful to overcome.
It's the things that you didn't know were possible.
8:58
I'll give you a different example.
In Chain of Fairies, which is one of our portfolio companies, amazing business, super successful single location.
And the founder had an agency when he approached me saying like, hey, I want to do what you did with Jim launch but with photography studios.
And so we talked and we talked and we talked and his model was so good.
I was like, I don't know man, I think like one of the things that I didn't have with Jim launch is that like I couldn't control delivery.
9:19
With photography you can control delivery.
And so that means that we could actually centralize a lot of stuff.
I was like what if we just owned all of them with like a hybrid model.
We actually took the agency from what it was doing, which for most people watching this would be a very good business for you to 0 to start this next thing.
9:35
We had such good rapport that he's like, if you really think so and we walk through the math and he's like, I mean this makes sense, but like I'm going to kill something that makes a lot of money.
I was like, yeah, but I think it's going to be for something that's going to make way more.
And then for the next six months, we worked and and tweaked the original model to get this new model off the ground.
9:54
And thirty months later that business is 2 1/2 million a month with 30 plus locations because I said let's just own it all.
He didn't think that that was a model that was really available.
And then as soon as we made that switch, everything took off.
Even in my own personal story, when I switched from having my gyms to doing a done for you fly around the country model that took the same skills that I had as an entrepreneur and put them in a better vehicle.
10:19
And then even from doing the gym turn around business for two years, I accidentally fell into the licensing model because I didn't want to fly out.
Somebody asked me if I could just show them all the stuff that I did so they could do it for themselves.
And then at that point he bought it and it was all margin and I was like, holy cow, this is insane.
10:36
That's when everything took off like a rocket.
And so I had my brick and mortar gems and then I scaled to it done for you, turn around business.
And then I scaled to licensing.
And each of those were higher leverage opportunities.
And it was because I didn't know it was possible.
And since I learned that it was possible, that unlocked all of the potential value that my skills could have.
10:54
Because fundamentally, in every one of those examples, I knew how to do the same stuff.
I knew how to market and sell for a local gym.
I knew how to build them more profitably, create the workouts, the meal plans, all that kind of stuff that got people results.
That's what I knew how to do.
But at each level, when I went from gyms to turnarounds, the leverage increased from each of these things.
11:14
And so the same skills that put into a new bucket or a new vehicle unlocked huge value.
And that's why a lot of entrepreneurs don't get past 1,000,000 or even get to 10 million that they're in the wrong vehicle.
So I talk about leverage a lot and it's actually one of the core concepts in our logo.
11:30
So we have a supply demand curve and then we have the fulcrum, which is the acquisition.com logo.
And it's because it's core to everything we do.
If you think about leverage, you've ever heard Archimedes, he said give me a long enough lever and I can move the world.
This is our lever and we'll put our little, our little hand here.
11:45
That's my arm.
If we grab the lever here, we have the most leverage on something that is here.
If we grab the lever here, we still have the most leverage on something here, but we have less leverage overall compared to how much we have on this side.
12:01
And the main difference here is how much force goes up the other side, all right.
And so leverage is the difference between what you put in and what you get out.
That's it.
So let me give you an example.
In the real world, if you are really skilled at cold calling, skill itself is leverage.
12:20
Because if somebody who doesn't have the skill makes 100 phone calls, that's their input.
And somebody who does have the skill puts 100 calls down.
And the guy who has, doesn't have the skill gets zero appointment set.
And the guy who's amazing at it gets 10 appointment set he has.
12:36
Well, let's just say the first guy had one for sake of math.
He has 10 times the leverage on that skill compared to the newbie.
Getting and acquiring skills gives you more leverage because it gets you more for what you put in.
And so if you're more skilled entrepreneur, being a skilled entrepreneur is a is a big bucket for hundreds of smaller skills underneath of it because it means that you know how to prioritize what to do next.
12:57
And so one of my favorite quotes about leverage comes from Warren Buffett.
Uncle Warren, he and one of his closest friends graduated Columbia Business School at the same time same year and he said that guy was smarter and harder working than him now.
They then went their separate ways.
Warren ended up getting into investing with Ben Graham and his friend goes into the steel business because that was back in the day when like American steel was like a thing which it really no longer is.
13:16
What he learned from that experience is that he Fast forward 30-40 fifty years and he said his friend, you know, did OK And he said, mind you, this is a guy who was smarter and harder working than him.
He said he did OK, he did pretty well, but not close to what Warren did.
And he said his biggest lesson from that was it's not about how hard you row, it's about what Bill you're in.
13:36
And I love that because it really encompasses the concept of leverage, which is Warren got more out for what he put in than his buddy in the steel business because the steel business had a lot of headwinds, a lot of things going against them.
They had globalizations that started, started happening.
13:52
You had other imported steel that was cheaper from China, blah, blah, blah.
And so those forces, he had to grow harder against the wind then Warren did while riding one of the best growth curves of the US economy overall.
And so he got higher returns.
14:08
And so over my career, I make more now than I did before because I've moved further back along this lever.
So I have more leverage now on what I put in than what I did before.
When I was selling one-on-one in person and I was doing 20 consoles today, I was working more hours probably than I do now, but I get so much more for what I put in.
14:29
So I'm going to show you 2 triangles that show increasing amounts of leverage.
All right.
Now one of these I've stolen ruthlessly from Naval Ravikan, all right?
And so he talks about the four types of leverage.
I've renamed them.
So they're C's, and it's mostly just so I remember them more easily.
But you've got collaboration, which just means other people working for you, All right.
14:47
Then you've got capital, which means other people worked for you and gave you the fruit of their work so that you can invest it on their behalf.
So for example, if I get people to give me a billion dollars, which I could do just raise the money, and then I invest that money and I say I get 20% of the gain.
I didn't have to work all the time to make a billion dollars, but I still get 20% of it, right.
15:06
That's the idea of using leverage of other people's money.
So capital, So you've got collaboration.
Capital, you've got code and content.
If I'm a genius coder and I could build one piece of software, I can build it once.
And people, a million people can use that same piece of software with content.
Joe Rogan can make one podcast episode and millions of people can listen to it.
15:26
And so he gets more for what he puts in, right?
So if you think about each of these things, it's like you have the influence on someone else.
I trade me selling for 40 hours a week to me managing A salesman for two hours, who then sells for two for 40 hours a week or higher.
Leverage.
I spend a week or two weeks recruiting the best sales recruiter and then I do that one time in my life for two weeks.
15:49
And then that sales recruiter works 40 hours a week to get new sales people in every single week on my behalf.
And then those sales people on my behalf then sell every single day.
And so I did two weeks of work for 100 sales people over the the lifetime of that one hire more leverage, I get more for what I put it.
16:05
Compare that to me taking 20 consults a day.
Higher leverage skill, but same concept done at scale capital.
We went over code content.
Those are the four types of leverage.
Now this is where this gets interesting because like once I learned this, I was able to put words to what I kind of knew intrinsically and I can now explain it.
16:23
So if you look at my career trajectory, and one of the key points here is that you can actually just Max out one of these things.
So you don't need to have all four.
Now if you have all four, cool.
But if you think about what leverage is in general, it's just you get more for what you put in.
And so if you get 1000 X on any of these, it's still 1000 X.
16:40
So somebody can just be an amazing private equity guy or amazing at raising money and become a billionaire.
They don't need to do any of these other things, right?
So we could be amazing at galvanizing people and creating movements, and they wouldn't need any of these other things.
If someone's amazing at writing software, they don't need anyone else's capital.
16:55
And the the software does the collaboration on their behalf, right?
And so all of these things, like, even though they're structured like this, you don't have to have all of them.
If you do have all of them, well, you look at Facebook, that is code about content.
You raised other people's money and he has people working for them.
But let me show you how this changed for me.
So in the beginning, I was an employee, right?
17:16
And I made four figures a month.
Then I became self-employed.
I gained a little bit of leverage just over my own time.
So I went from having someone else control my time to me controlling my time, which was leverage.
All right.
I got more for what I put it and I went to five figures a month.
All right.
17:32
Then I went to employing other people, right, Which is then I would say the first level is me now having the first level of leverage.
So I went to six figures a month, right.
And this is right as I I would say, first when I started my my gyms and I had multiple gyms and then when I transitioned that to turnarounds, I still stayed at six figures a month.
17:48
But fundamentally it's because I actually didn't change leverage.
I changed how I was structuring it.
But fundamentally like it was people doing the same work.
So this was both me being a gym owner with six locations and me doing the turnaround business with other people.
You're like, how do you go from six figures a month to seven figures a month?
18:06
Then you started licensing.
Now, what is that?
I made content fundamentally and then I made it once and then many people could have access to it.
And so when I did that, I went to seven figures a month.
Now the question is how do I get from 7 figures a month to 8 figures a month?
18:24
Because that's what we have at acquisition.com.
What did I add into it?
Capital.
So now we buy into companies that have other people working for them.
I use content to attract those businesses.
Now I don't have any code right now.
I have one software investment, maybe two, I think that are major investments.
18:40
But the rest of my stuff really, if we're talking about it, is that I made content.
I had capital from the things that I had done before and we have the ability to get other people to help us get to our goals.
And so this is acquisition.com and that's eight figures a month.
Now what do I need to do to get to 9 figures a month?
18:57
I may just need to add time to the existing thing that I'm doing.
Key point is that leverage is about getting more for what you put in.
People who move faster in life don't actually move faster.
They get more for their inputs.
They get more for every step, right?
I'm not like frenetically moving to move faster.
19:13
You just get more out of every move.
And so that means that if you're getting more out of every move, it's a function of time.
And so if I had, for example, maybe some code that was implemented within everything that I do at acquisition.com, I might be able to get to 9 figures a month faster than I currently am.
19:30
But I feel confident with these three that we'll get to 9 figures a month eventually.
And so you might say Alex, that might be a limiting belief, they might be, but that's that's kind of how I'm choosing to play it.
And so and let me let me like reverse the clock here.
19:46
If I had just kept my gyms from the time I started my gyms until now, I might have 100 locations and I might also already be doing 9 figures, not 9 figure.
I probably be doing 8 figures a month from the gyms.
And so you're like, well, wait a second, so was it the best move?
20:03
I can't go back and replay time.
I don't know.
But that's where to me, This is why the game gets interesting is that every time you switch vehicles, you start at 0 again.
So the pace that the leverage affords you for each step you take has to be disproportionate because you're four of a business, you'll typically grow more than year one of a new business.
20:23
And so that's we're doing the same thing for a longer and longer period of time.
You still get more leverage.
The guy who owns Panda Express open 600 new locations this year because he he has done this because now he has enough capital, he has enough collaboration that he's maxed.
20:38
You know, he doesn't do any content and he doesn't have any code, right.
But he has these two.
It's such a high degree that when he adds 600 locations and each location does $3,000,000 a year, right?
It might even be, I don't know, it's a lot.
And just to give you context, Panda Express in 2021 to 3.7 billion in top line sales and he owns 100% of it.
21:01
No, outside investors with his wife Peggy and they took home 27% net margins on brick and mortar food.
All right, So let's do the math.
That's 935 million in income.
Like that was his distributions from owning this thing.
21:17
Now if you're like, wait, but did he pay taxes on it?
Sure didn't.
Why?
Because he owns all the land and the dirt for most of the locations that he had that are freestanding.
So you'd appreciated all of that against his income.
So you took all of that tax free.
So point being, he did this and you're like, well, how did you do it?
He's been making chicken and and orange chicken and kung pao chicken for 45 years.
21:38
So even though he might not have been in the highest leverage vehicle, he was able to stick with that vehicle for 45 years.
And being able to stick with something for 45 years makes it really hard to suck.
And when you do that, you start unlocking multipliers on the leverage you have.
21:56
Rather than thinking I need more leverage in terms of more types of leverage, maybe you just need more of the one that you've been using since you've started with.
Remember I gave the little phone call example of like two people doing the same thing?
One person has more leverage.
Well, each of these things are big buckets with many smaller skills underneath of it.
22:12
So collaboration is I have to know how to recruit talent.
I have to know how to recognize talent.
I have to know how to onboard.
I have to know how to train.
I have to know how to manage.
I have to know how to grow talent.
And I have to know how to run meetings and I have to know how to have one on ones.
22:28
And I have to like you know, I'm saying here like all of those micro skills chunk up to collaboration for capital.
It's like you have to be good at math.
Being bad at math is probably not like it'd be tough to raise capital if you really can't do math right.
It's like, OK, well that's a skill you need to know.
Well, what else do you need to know?
22:44
It's like, well, you need to be able to reach out to people and get rejected.
Why?
Because when you try and raise capital, you get rejected a lot more times than you get checks right.
From there it's like you also probably have to have an understanding of legal because you have to learn how to set up a fund structure.
You also have to know how to negotiate because every single person writes you check is going to want different terms.
23:01
You then have to structure it in a way and negotiate so that you can get mutually beneficial terms for both parties.
So these are all other skills that go into raising capital, right?
Making content.
It's like you have to understand the different platforms, You have to understand how to tell stories, you have to understand how to have, I mean, and even understanding here, it's just like you might even have to just do the work to have credibility to make the content about whatever you're making it on.
23:21
And you know what?
I'm gonna sidequest this real quick.
A lot of people make content right now and they're trying to hit it big.
But what they do is like, in my opinion, you've got entertainers and you've got educators.
The thing is, is that a lot of people who haven't done shit are trying to educate on things they haven't done, and so they have no credibility.
23:39
And so The thing is, is that like, the reason Mr. Beast was able to get so big is that when he was 15 years old, he wasn't teaching people about business.
He was being funny and being cool.
People are like, oh, I want to be like him.
And so then they say, oh, I'm going to educate people on house flipping, but they're 22 years old and they haven't flipped that many houses.
23:56
And so they have no credibility in their content.
And so in my opinion, when you're doing this content thing, if you're going to do it, then make sure that you have the backing of experience and proof.
Because then I promise you, like when you get shit on from the public, because you will, because they don't know who you are and most people are lying, you'll be able to know that what you're saying is true because you lived it.
24:16
And so then you won't second guess yourself.
The people who like tank and self implode because they're like they can't handle the hate is because on some level they believe it.
So if you want to be an educator then I think that the middle ground, the pre education stage is the documentation stage where you just say this is what I'm doing now check it out.
24:33
Like right now I can't educate really on 9 figure, not really.
Excuse me, I can't educate on 9 figures a month, haven't been there.
I know what 8 figures a month is.
Don't know how to get to 9 figures a month.
I have my theory which is that I just have to add time to this equation.
The math spells that out but I just got to wait.
24:48
Once I get there, then I can talk about how to build a billion dollar portfolio and you can imagine how my content might change, right?
And so if you're making six figures a year and trying to talk about how to make seven, you've never made seven.
Then you're full of shit and you rightfully should get the hate that you do right.
25:04
And so these are skills that you have to learn how to acquire, to make content and to make code.
You have to learn how to go code and this is how little I know about coding.
This is it.
So I would even give you examples of micro skills, but like you have to learn HTML and JavaScript and Ruby and Python.
25:22
That's about it.
That's all I know and data architecture and Yep, that's it.
That's all I got.
And so you have to learn these, these these smaller skills to then say I'm very excellent at code so that I can then have more leverage on the things that I do.
25:38
And then you can walk yourself up this income ladder with more leverage, right.
And again, leverage is about speed.
Any of these vehicles that I had done, if I had done it for 45 years, like Mr. Panda, you could get there because my end on input is so high.
25:55
If I spend 45 years doing something, I might not have the strongest arm, but I've done it 45 times more, so I still get more out than the guy that's over here that does it two times.
This is where strategy comes into play, is making sure that you're picking the right vehicle.
26:11
Chris, for example, made less money in the first nine months scaling enchanted ferries than he did before.
But at month 10 he matched it at month 24.
It was, it was like so small in comparison that didn't even matter.
But I can tell you this really easy to say this, really hard to do that for nine months, eat shit and feel like you're losing and always knowing that you could always go back.
26:37
And that's the hard part, go back to what you were doing before that was comfortable and made you X versus staying the path.
And I can tell you it was.
I mean, it's hard for me.
I mean my team does that.
Like going from making what I was making a gym watch to doingacquisition.com the first year I was like, this sucks.
26:54
Like I'm used to being able to run any personal expense for this business and not even blink.
Like I actually have to look at cash flow, right?
And so like these are things that you have to like take in.
But I do believe genuinely your 10 of acquisition.com I think is bigger than your 15 of gym launch to make the apples to apples comparison.
27:11
Because The thing is that you actually never get an apples to apples comparison because you can't go back in time.
And so you have to look at what your 12:50 business is compared to your three of another.
And so if you're at your 6th year, maybe you should just keep riding it out because whatever you started with is the thing that you have the longest lever on number of times that you got reps in and people want to change industries.
27:30
And I'll give you a little tidbit from Y Combinator.
One is they don't take solo founders as a side note.
Now mind you, they're only interested in billion dollar companies.
So if that's not you, then you could totally be a single founder.
But it's just harder to be successful with one person skills versus 3.
The second interesting thing that they have, they have many things they select for, but one of them is industry experience.
27:48
And so if someone says, hey, I want to get into this industry, if you don't have any experience in that industry And then second to that is personal experience like you've suffered from whatever problem you're trying to solve, then they're not interested.
And so you might have six years of experience in the mortgage business.
28:05
I wouldn't recommend getting into weight loss.
I would say maybe you take a half pivot so you're in the same industry because it's so hard to make up those six years.
This hopefully gives you more nuanced view to making the right picks to making the most money.
By the way, if you guys like the white board of me drawing on with markers, this is a throwback to what I used to do.
28:24
I finally got another board because love these things.
But if you like this style, like let me know.
I love this style, but I just try and do the things that that the data suggests that you like the most.
I'll do what you guys want so that I can hopefully transfer the skills that I have to you faster.
28:40
I said earlier that the unknown unknowns are the most expensive thing in business, right.
Because you don't know what you don't know.
And so I want to give you a quantifiable example.
I remember the first time I heard this, it changed my life And so it was actually a whiteboard just like this so that you get to like I'm getting goosebumps you'll you'll have the same experience I did.
So a guy was on stage and gave this whole presentation about about learning skills and about how you have to invest in yourself to to get better, right.
29:02
And he called somebody in the audience and he said ma'am.
And as he's saying this, he's doing what I'm doing.
He says, ma'am, how much money do you make right now per year?
She stood up and she said $50,000 a year.
He was like okay.
So what would be the the main reason that you wouldn't want to invest today?
29:18
Right.
So he was closing.
This is actually a close.
But as a side note, I think the reason I like sales so much is because many of the obstacle overcomes that you learn to overcome are actually self bullshit.
And so in a way, like learning how to sell other people for me was learning how to sell myself because I had so much head trash of, like why I couldn't do things or why it shouldn't start now or why I had to think about or why I needed permission from someone else, or why the the universe was stacked against me to be successful.
29:42
Like, these are all things that I had to learn the arguments against to convince myself to do stuff.
And so he asked the lady, he says, okay, So what would make you not want to invest in this?
And she says, well, I don't have the money.
And he said, well, it's probably, you probably don't have the money because you've been paying a really expensive bill every single year.
30:00
And she's like, what do you mean?
He's like, well, right now you've been paying $950,000 a year not knowing how to make $1,000,000, he said.
This is the cost of your ignorance.
You guys love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
30:16
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check on my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into, and if not, keep enjoying the show.
30:34
This is the debt that you carry for the rest of your life until you learn how to make $1,000,000.
And so the reason I'm so heavy on learning skills and becoming educated is that right now I'm paying down Ignorance debt.
I'm paying down $950 million a year not knowing how to make a billion.
30:55
It's a debt I'm paying, like we all pay ignorance debt.
And so the idea is how quickly cannot pay this down so that I can have more cash flow to continue to pay this down faster.
Now strategy, like I said earlier, is about how you allocate limited resources against unlimited options.
31:11
That's the fancy word of just saying prioritizing, all right.
And so right now you have limited resources, you have time and you have money.
Now you might have more time than money, but either way you have some limit on what you have.
And so for you to move faster, you have to identify, prioritize the thing that you're going to allocate your time and money towards, right.
31:31
And you want the thing that gets you the most for it.
Remember the input output that we had overly the leverage.
So you want the thing that gives you the most leverage.
Now, one of the one of the the tough parts about reality is that the things that you have access to when you have fewer resources are less than the things that you have access to when you have more resources.
31:46
Like Mr. Panda can go buy a building for a billion dollars and flip it for $2 billion in a year or two and make a billion dollars because he has more resources than you do.
And you can't do that right, Not right now.
But you do have things that could get you there, which is why Charlie Munger talks about how do whatever you can do big, borrow, steal, eat, ramen, walk with your lunch, pail both directions.
32:11
Do whatever you have to do to make your first 100,000.
Because he understands.
And mind you, him saying 100,000 is probably like $1,000,000 today because he knows that once you get that, you can actually get a little bit more leverage in terms you get way more for what you put in because you can't only put your time in because it's so limited in terms of how much you can do.
32:26
All right.
So This is why I talk about having investing in the SME 500 more than the S&P 500.
So if you don't know this, it's standard and poor 500 companies on the Stock Exchange.
It's probably like the gold standard index that we track how the US economy is doing.
32:42
It's a really just the stock market in general is doing all right.
And so if you dollar cost average in the S&P 500, you get 9 to 10% a year for for life at least that's what it's done historically.
All right.
So the question is rather than investing in this, we just have to say can we do anything that gets us more than 10% back?
33:00
Great.
Now we can quantify this.
And so if I have let's say $1000, right.
And here's the magic of this is that when you invest $1000 into the S&P, you have no, you have nothing else that you add to that thousand like you can't juice the thousand.
33:17
You buying the same valuation that every other investor buys in it.
And so I'll tell you one of the magic.
So I'm going to open open up the curtain here for a second.
One of the magic what we do at acquisition.com is that we pair capital with know how and so we can buy a company at a decent valuation and have a big margin of safety because of our skill set.
33:35
So we know that we can triple or 10X the business when we invest in it.
So we don't have to pick amazingly like Warren Buffett.
The better picker always will be than I am right at picking businesses, but Warren Buffett doesn't work in the business, right.
So that's the advantage, that's my advantage over Warren Buffett right now.
33:50
Mind you, he has way more advantages over me. 90 billion on his Apple trade.
But, but, but this is the game that I'm supposed to play right now because here's the leverage that I have on him.
I have 60 more years of life than he does, right.
34:06
He's 93, I'm 33, so I have a lot more of these left on my on my move set.
Okay.
Now we have $1000.
We get 10%, meaning at the end of the year, we're at $1100, roughly okay.
Or let's say you buy a sales training course, they teach you how to sell and you get implementation from that where they review some of your calls so that you can improve.
34:29
And all of a sudden you take your income from 40,000 a year to 220,000 a year, Okay.
What does that mean?
That means that that thousand, think about this return.
All right, In scenario one, you have $1100.
In scenario two, and here's the crazy part, you have an extra 180,000.
34:50
All right, so compare this to that.
But here's the crazy part.
This is every year because once you have the skill, you only get better from there.
And so one of the things my dad used to tell me that when I was growing up was that he was always really big on education because he came here $1000, didn't speak the language, and he learned English like that was a skill he didn't have.
35:09
Like we'd take so many skills for granted.
Like the man didn't.
He couldn't even speak the language of the country right in 1000 bucks.
And he was able to take his medical school education and apply it here in the US because he fled during the revolution in Iran.
And he said the one thing that no government can take from you and no wife can steal from you in a divorce and you can't get sued out of is your education.
35:34
They can't take it from you.
And he had relatives who actually really well off who actually owned the lottery in Iran.
So you get it was a private company.
So they made a lot of money, but they were like second and third generation and they hadn't learned the skills.
And so when they fled during the revolution, they could only take what they could carry because all of their assets got seized by the government.
35:54
And they never were able to go back to what they had because they didn't have the skills, because the government could take their assets, but they didn't have the education right.
And the guys who were who were businessmen from Iran straight to LA became businessmen in in in LA and crushed it there too because they understood the game right.
36:12
And so This is why like if you think about it from actually an investment perspective like education can't go down, it can't be taxed, it can't be taken from you and only gets better over time, right.
And it compounds unto itself because when you learn the next skill.
So let's say this is, this is what the lift we got from from sales then you learn lead Gen. and then all of a sudden this because then you 5X the demand on your sales skills and you just pay down your ignance debt with two investments.
36:40
And so like is that worth it more than putting the the money in the S&P in my opinion every fucking time.
Is going from 40 to 220 realistic if you're a killer and you're part of Mosey Nation.
Absolute fucking lully if you do it the way we tell you to do it which is you look at the top guy on whatever company whatever team and you do twice what they do because you know why?
37:01
Because they're going to be better than you.
And so you got to make up with you got to make it up in inputs.
It's like but Alex does that mean I'm going to have to work harder and longer hours?
You bet.
Welcome to the world.
Like.
Because think about it.
If you work the same hours as that guy, that guy always has the advantage because he's already better than you.
And so if he puts a month in and you put a month and he's going to get further ahead than you because he already has skills through which to to judge his own performance and improve.
37:24
And so you have to put way more inputs in to get the same output than that guy.
And so that's why Kobe spent 5 summers doing 2 days when everyone else was doing one a day because he knew he had to make up for the guys who were way better than him naturally.
And so, like I would like to think of everybody who moves the nation as many black mambas from that perspective is that we're willing to put in twice the work, three times the work, four times the work, despite the natural talent deficiencies to make up for it.
37:49
Because on a five year or ten year or 25 year timeline, you become unbeatable.
Do I think you can get to 220?
Hell yeah.
But if you were to just look at average, which I don't want you to be, but if you were to look at average, you might make a hundred a year or 120 a year, It would still triple what you were making before.
38:06
And if you don't adjust your living from what you were making at 40 Mr. Smart Cookie, then now you have even at 1:20.
If this was 120 you have 80K a year extra that you can then invest in more skills to pay down your Ignorance debt.
38:23
A key point here, as I said that there was an advantage that I have with Warren Buffett, which is I got money and time slash effort, right?
If you go spend the money but you don't put this in, then you lose your advantage.
And so it's not just about spending the money.
38:40
Because here's an interesting factoid for you.
When you sell someone, you understand that the moment someone buys, they actually feel like they solve the problem emotionally.
And so you can sell that because you learn how to sell.
But the reality is that that just gives them the license to begin solving the problem of whatever it is, especially if it's a skill or it's education based.
39:00
And here's my ask for you guys.
One of the beliefs that I think has served me well is that whenever I joined a group or I joined a community or a free or paid or otherwise, I always wanted to become number one.
And the way that I thought about that was, and I always wanted to join groups of people who are all ahead of me.
Like when I joined the Internet group that I was talking about earlier, everybody there was making more money than me.
39:17
How do I get status in this group?
And the way that I did that was like be be good, you know, I mean make more money.
And So what I did was I talked to every single person in the group and I had only my small skill set and I gave it to them for free.
And I want to fucking hit on this because I get Dm's every day about this guy this morning even said it.
39:35
He said, Alex I want to make you 100 videos for free if you're willing to employ me the amount of times that I get this request, whether it's I want to make you this website in exchange for a job.
39:50
The point of Mosa Nation, the point of everything that it was acquisition.com that I hope to live by example is that you give first without asking.
You're doing it wrong.
Right.
You think cuz like in the press, like, hey, in the spirit of most like you're not doing it.
In the spirit of mosaic, you're doing the spirit of John.
Are you doing the spirit of you?
40:07
The way that you do it is that you give and then you give and then you give and you give and you keep on giving until that person is like, dude, what can I do for you?
And then you make your ask like whenever I get frustrated and I think, like, why do I even bother doing this?
Like I think about giving up.
40:22
I just think this is where most people stop and This is why they don't win.
It transitions into one of my my most used sayings to myself.
I don't say a lot out loud, but to myself, it's like I won't do my best.
I'll do what's required.
And so right now, what is required for you to win or get a job or get the skill might be better than your best.
40:42
And so it just means that your best just needs to get better.
All right.
So you might be riled up and be like, I'm going to go do this and take over the world and make all the money.
So but you're like, fuck, I got to pay bills.
So how do we take this and then put it into reality?
Number one is like, and this is how you transfer any skills in general.
By the way, a little sneak peek from the book that's coming out.
41:00
All right.
Coming soon is that you have the person who's teaching you documents the skill.
That's step one.
Step 2 is that they do it in front of you, so they demonstrate it.
And the third piece is duplicate.
41:16
You do it in front of them.
So document, demonstrate, duplicate.
Now, I can do this and I can do this, but you have to do this.
I can't duplicate it for you.
You have to take the stuff and actually execute on it.
And so if you're like, okay, Alex, what does that actually look like?
41:35
In my life, I'm actually a big, big proponent of having jobs, and I think that's probably taboo nowadays.
But yeah, why not get paid to learn shit?
And if you're like, well, the place that I work at doesn't teach me anything, then you should absolutely go apply for other jobs, like change your conditions.
41:53
All right, so I'm all about get paid to learn.
And as an aside, the reason that keeping your living expenses low is so important is because if let's say you make $100,000 a year now and you're like, Alex, I got a pretty good white collar job right now, but I really want to get into this, then it might mean that you have to go from $100,000 a year to $30,000 a year to learn the skill because right now you go from earning to learning.
42:17
All right.
And like, I want to, I want to tell you like, I walk this walk.
So I was a management consultant at a boutique strategy firm in DC like we did.
Like I had a top secret clearance.
I was 20 like I did.
I did shit that people could brag about, all right?
And then I went and became a personal trainer at a gym for $14.00 an hour.
42:35
Think about that.
I went from a high rise condo that I owned to renting someone's bedroom for $400.00 a month in their house.
All right?
And I went from having, you know, Hugo Boss suits to wearing Beast Mode engaged tshirts.
All right.
And showing up at 4:00 AM, like, ready to teach Nancy how to lose the last five, you know what I mean?
42:55
And so, like, I had to swallow my pride on this because I wanted to.
I wanted to get learned, all right?
And so you have to be willing to relinquish getting paid for getting learned.
43:11
All right, once you get yourself in an environment where you actually have a business that is investing in you, and it doesn't mean that they actually have to write checks.
To be clear now, if you have a company that's willing to do that, awesome level one is you communicate to them.
This is the skill that I would like to learn upon working for you.
43:27
And so you're like, these are the skills that I bring to the table.
This is what I would like to learn.
Is this a place that I can do that?
Any business owner loves clear communication.
It's like if you want to learn that and if they're a good business owner, they'll be like, let me help you support.
Now if they're like my job isn't to teach you wrong place and I'm be real.
A lot of business owners are like that.
43:44
And so if you're like, well man, it's not fair.
It's like, well, I mean getting paid to learn is a pretty good deal.
It's just that that's not always what happens.
And so I would say switch your conditions, but let's say you finally get into a business that teaches you stuff and you feel like you're getting better, you're moving faster.
I would say once you feel like, and this is a big caveat, this is like fucking caveat.
44:03
Once you have nothing left to learn from the current position, you communicate to them that you feel like you're learning is slowed down and then they may give you another opportunity to learn more.
And if they feel like they can't actually teach you internally, they might say, I'll pay $10,000 a year for you to go through these programs or workshops or seminars or whatever so you can or certifications so you can continue to level up your skill.
44:25
A good employer will do that.
And if you look at big corporate America, as much as people shit on them they usually have pretty strong corporate reinvestment programs.
Like they why?
Because they want their their human capital to appreciate.
And so if you can pay $10,000 because they do the same S and E500 except the S and U500 right, they invest in you $10,000 and they get a three times more valuable person.
44:45
Like one of the biggest arbitrage opportunity side of this, me talking to business owners that's out there in the marketplace, is that you can pay 25% more for an A player versus A/B player and you get 5 times the output.
So like you think about value arbitrage, like instead of paying 100 a year, if that's the market, pay 125 and get five times the output.
45:01
Why would you never make that trade?
Once you've done this, here are the three steps that you can transition from getting learned back to getting paid.
All right, #1 is that you live below your means.
The less risk you take in your personal life, the more risk you take in your business life.
Let's say that I own a business that does $10 million a year in profit.
45:19
Okay.
If my living expenses are $800,000 a month, then I'm not leaving much for the business to weather a storm.
And let's say that it's all fixed.
It's like mortgages and cars and jets and all the other stuff that I do.
Well, if there's a hiccup, the business might go under.
45:35
But if I live on 400,000 a year, then I have 9.6 million every year that I can go on the offensive and I can take huge swings.
I can be like I want to buy this company even though it's risky, but it might 10X, right?
And that offense is what you have to do as an entrepreneur because you have to take calculated risk, but you don't want to introduce multiple risk if you can control it.
45:55
And this is controllable risk.
OK, so you live below your mean, so you can stack cash.
OK.
Level 2 is that you take this cash.
And I want to be clear, I'm actually kind of against side hustles as a long term thing.
I'm pro them as a way to transition.
46:10
Again, this is how I play the game.
I'm a maximizer.
Like I want to win big.
And so I think if you follow my stuff, that you probably would have win big, too.
And so if you're doing a side hustle, it's because you wanted to eventually become your main hustle, not because you're just looking for side income.
I'm just not that guy.
There's other guys who will talk about that.
It's just not me.
46:26
All right.
And so you stack the cash, you can start your side hustle.
And you keep doing this until you have matched your income.
So you start your side hustle and you keep doing it until you match your current income.
And if you're like, wait a second.
For me to match my current income, I'm going to have to work 40 hours a week in my job and then work another 40 hours a week at this thing.
46:46
Yep.
And The thing is, and this is just, you know, one man's caveat, there's me different, different takes on this.
If you're not making more money on 40 hours a week of the new thing, you're still not doing it right.
Remember, I went from employed to selfemployed.
You have a level of leverage.
So those 40 hours, you have more leverage than the 40 hours that you're working for someone else.
47:03
And if you're not making more there, then you're like you still need to keep doing it until you've matched at least at least matched your income.
And then once you've matched the income, I would say sustain it for six months.
Two reasons.
One is because now you're going to be making double time.
You're going to be making money on a job, you're going to be making money on your.
So you're going to be doubling your actual income, which means you might be like 3 or 4X in your savings.
47:21
And the 2nd is so that you don't just quit on the one good month you had because you sign up for clients.
OK.
We want to make sure that it's not seasonal.
We want to make sure that we get like it's not just normal volatility because really small businesses super volatile, right.
If you're selling 2 customers a month, if all of a sudden you sell zero, your income goes to 0, right?
47:37
Unless you retain the people, etcetera, etcetera And then cut, cut the cord and go out on your own, spread those wings in a beautiful butterfly.
And a lot of people look at this thing, the side hustle and they're like, but this isn't Facebook, like this isn't.
Sure, it's not.
47:53
But I think a lot of people put undue pressure on themselves by expecting their next thing to be a trillion dollar company.
And the likely that it happens, Super, super, super, super, super, super small.
But again, it's like, what are your goals If your goals are just like, get out of poverty, get above the middle class, get above, get into the upper class, like a lot of businesses can get you there.
48:12
If you want to be a trillionaire, there's only a few.
And also what we don't see is the zillions of not Zuckerberg who put everything into their social media thing and it didn't work.
I'm a big fan of service businesses because it costs you nothing to start.
It's just your time.
You have no overhead in the beginning.
Those ones are harder to scale, but you'll usually learn a lot of other skills during that part.
48:32
Like I learned more from running a gym that allowed me to do gym launch.
Like if I hadn't run the gyms, I don't think I would have been able to do gym launch.
And so think of whatever this is as the stepping stone.
And again, we're still trying to get learned.
Like that doesn't change.
We're just going to also get paid as we do it.
And that's one of the beautiful things.
48:47
But entrepreneurship is that, like once you get past a certain level, you get to get paid to learn more.
And I think that's like for me, why I love the game so much is that you just keep getting better and get paid to get better.
Don't judge yourself on the side hustle and especially don't listen to other people's judgment on your side hustle.
Do you know many people like, I was like venerable Magnum Lowdy.
49:04
You know, white collar consultant job, like had a above Harvard, you know, GMAT score say like and you want to become a trainer.
Like the amount of people that, like, I used to compete against frenemies, whatever you want to call it.
They were like, oh, great, He's, he's out of the race.
You know what I mean?
Like, he's, he's doing stuff to make himself happy, right.
49:22
You know, I was younger and I probably had more fucked up shit in my head then than I do now.
But, like, I used to just think about them all the time.
When I'd be sleeping on the floor, I'd be selling where I was.
Like they're not willing to do this.
They're not willing to do this.
They're not willing to do this.
And then you come from behind, right?
And you do Kobe and you work twice a day.
And while they're working their job and they have their three series BMW and they're, you know, going out to dinner and they have the football on the weekends in their fantasy league.
49:43
And you have none of that.
Just know that you're doing your your two days during the summer or your three days during the summer.
But because your rate of input is so much higher than theirs is, you will catch up and you will surpass them.
And that's if you want to compare.
And the main reason I don't think you should judge yourself on whatever you do is because in my opinion, like I'm married to the game, right?
50:03
More than anything, like, I'm going to keep playing the game because I love the game.
And so if you want to play the game a long time, then it's the game itself that you want to stick with rather than the vehicle you're in, right?
Most entrepreneurs start more than one business over their career.
50:19
You are above the business.
The problem is that people identify so closely like their identity is their business.
But you have to just think about it.
And this is me just trying to give you like a, you know, Big Brother.
What do you want to call it?
Piece of advice, but like the further you can separate your identity and yourself worth from the worth of the business, the better off you'll be as an entrepreneur.
50:37
Because you also start to seeing it as an asset that can be sold, can create value in the asset.
You can make hard decisions.
Whereas if it's you, you're like, what?
What will people think?
It's like I made a decision about a business that I own.
That's okay.
Simon Sinek is a great piece on this.
But when I learned the difference between infinite and finite games, it really changed my perspective.
50:55
The infinite frame will always beat the finite frame, and there are finite games within every infinite game.
And so you have quarters, you have years, you have goals.
These are all finite games that we play in an infinite game.
And so when the US invaded Vietnam, we lost.
Why did we lose?
51:10
We lost a war of attrition, which was that they were willing to play the game longer than we were.
All right.
And so the difference between a finite, infinite game is that a finite game has known players agreed upon rules and an outcome and an end.
That's why it's finite.
51:26
An infinite game has known and unknown players has no agreed upon rules and the point of the game is to keep the game going.
And so the problem that most entrepreneurs have is they approach an infinite game with a finite frame.
They are the United States trying to invade Vietnam and and you will lose every time because there will be players who are playing with infinite frame.
51:45
And so let me give you 2 more examples of this.
If you want to get healthy right, you don't win at health.
There's no end goal to being.
You're like, OK, I'm done working out.
I did it.
I've achieved it, right?
Of course not right.
Same thing with marriage, right?
Like you're not.
The point is into get married.
52:01
The point is to stay married.
The point is to stay in the game, to keep the game going.
Most of the games worth playing are infinite games, not finite games, which means the point is to just play and so business.
You don't win.
The point isn't to finish, because even if you were trying to say you finished first, it's like, by what metric?
52:18
On what time period?
Has there anyone who's been the richest man in the world for all time?
No, of course not.
Which means that anybody who would try to do that is, is coming from a finite frame.
And so, but there have been people who've won the game of business in my perspective, because they played their whole lives.
52:36
If you want to be a stronger player and be somebody who can succeed as an entrepreneur, then the day you start playing is the day you win and the day you stop playing is the day you lose.
And so the goal is to find games that you don't want to quit.
52:53
That's where learning what you are into from executing is the the mega win here.
So for me, I found out that I actually liked business more than I liked fitness, which is crazy because I loved fitness getting into fitness.
But like the day I started my gym was the day my love for business outpace my love for fitness.
53:10
I was like, this is amazing.
This is so cool.
And so you have to find whatever that thing is.
And I'm be clear, like business sucks all the time, but it's just that if you're willing to play and like there's plenty of times marriage sucks, there's plenty of time you don't want to work out.
But it doesn't mean that I'm going to stop working out, doesn't mean I'm going to stop being married, doesn't mean I'm going to stop being in business.
53:29
And so I think if you can unlock that frame that you want to play until the day you die, even if the vehicle changes, even the players that you're playing with on the court change, then you'll be the guy who stays on the court the longest.
You might think, oh, I don't like video editing or, oh, I don't like, you know, dry cleaning or I don't like mowing lawns.
53:47
I don't like washing cars or whatever it is.
Right.
But the higher up you get in business, the more all businesses are the same, right?
You're gonna have marketing, you're gonna have sales, you're gonna have product, You're gonna have customer success or customer support.
You're gonna have it.
You're gonna have finance, You're gonna have legal.
Like all these departments are gonna, these functions will more or less exist in every business.
54:05
And so my advice is like a lot of people quit industries when they really actually just quit a function of a job.
And so like they're like, oh, entertainment wasn't for me.
It's like do you know how many jobs there are in entertainment?
Like you might love sales in like sales in entertainment and you were in enter the actual like product side, right.
54:24
Or the production side or the support side.
And so again, remember I said earlier that like if you stay in the same game longer you'll you'll be likely to get more reps in and you'll do better.
Well, then maybe stay in the same industry but switch roles.
Now in a micro business like your side hustle, you'll get to taste all the roles and you'll find out the things that you like more and that's where you can shift some of your attention there.
54:44
And then you backfill people who are, because you have a little bit of context, good enough to do what you do better.
You demonstrate.
So you document, you demonstrate, you duplicate, they duplicate and then they run with it, right.
And so today, for example, my, what I do looks very different than what I did 10 years ago, right?
55:02
Like what I did 10 years ago was the highest value skill I had then, which is just closing.
That's all I did.
I had consults all day because I got trainers to train for me.
I knew how to run the ads and that didn't take me that long.
It took me 2-3 hours a week to run the ads, make, make them and manage them.
The rest of my time was sitting in appointments and closing, and I had somebody else make the phone calls and text for me.
55:20
So I would just sit there and close because that was the highest value thing I could do at the time.
But The thing is, is that your baseline skill will continue to level up.
If I lost everything then like if I lost everything, I knew that I would sell cars during the day and I would strip at night right?
Once I had that skill, before I had the skill of sales, I would drive Uber during the day and strip at night, cuz I had the skill of being in shape, right?
55:39
And so your baseline continues to grow like being the best car sales.
Me make 405 hundred, maybe even a million a year.
Some of the best dealerships, like if you're an absolute savage, and I would consider myself an absolute savage if I was going to do that right.
If I lost it all, I'd be there 12 hours a day for sure.
And then once I learned how to market marketing in sales together, my new minimum was 1,000,000 bucks a year because I knew that I could sit in front of any brick and mortar business and I could get them leads and I could close.
56:02
Once you have that, you can make a million 2 million three.
Like I can't go below that because I have skills that are above that, right?
You keep learning these skills as you keep doing your business, and you might you'll start ping ponging in different directions until you hone in on the things that you're best at.
And so I think if you can find that game, make it the meta skill of continuing to learn, then you won't stop.
56:23
And then at that point, it means you win by default.
So we had talked about a lot of stuff, right?
But the question is, like, what's the next thing you're going to do?
And so I'm just going to give you advice that I followed, which is like, what was the first thing I did to get myself out of this $1,000,000 or below $1,000,000 category to the above $1,000,000 category and then to eventually the .4 percent, $10 million category.
56:40
And it was actually just learning how to sell because if you can't sell anything, you can't make money.
It's the first part of the equation.
Number of sales times you have no sales.
Doesn't matter how good the lifetime values if no one buys it 0.








0:00
Real quick guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you.
0:16
Can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
If you feel like you're not like a skill set, then you're lacking a character trait, or you have a belief about the world that is false, right?
0:35
It's just false.
And so you have to figure out what that belief is.
And sometimes that investment comes with going into communities, connected, paying to have access to people who can break that belief for you.
The wealthiest people in the world see.
Business as a.
Game This podcast.
The game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:55
I hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I wanted to talk about something that's a little different than the actual business, but very important, which is just about the money of the business.
1:11
So I'm just calling this when to take chips off the table.
So as business owners, you know we're always trying to grow.
We're always trying to reinvest in our businesses and a mistake that I see happen many, many, many times and something that I made earlier on in my My Business career.
Was reinvesting in the business.
1:27
And so there's a difference in my mind between reinvesting in the business versus reinvesting in yourself.
I think you should always reinvest in yourself.
But reinvesting in your business, your business may come and go, but you will always stay, right?
I mean, as long as you stay alive, right, And as long as you keep playing the game.
And so the whole idea here is a lot of people are like, well, I didn't take anything out because I wanted to, you know, reinvest it and grow.
1:48
The thing is, if you like, you really think about it.
There's.
You're reinvesting and growing because you're trying to make money.
But The thing is they're kind of like counter to one another, which means that at some point you have to decide I'm going to take this money and keep it for me, right?
And it's hard because you're like, man, some of that money that I'm taking out is money that I could be using to grow.
2:06
The thing is, is what is the end game, right?
And so if the end game, let's say like let's let's play out a couple different alternative because when I'm having my one days, the VIP days, that one guys are coming out, a lot of times we get into this which is like what's the goal, right?
And so if you have a gym, right, a single location and you want to like you enjoy running the gym, you enjoy that business, then the objective should be to make as much money from that business in real time, which means month over month you take as much money as you can out of the business of the business serving you, right.
2:34
That's the goal.
Now if your goal is, then you know what, I'd rather have multiple locations.
For me, in my opinion, the only reason to have multiple locations is because you're trying to have prove a concept so that you can then go into licensing or franchising.
There are very, very, very, very, very, very, very few people who make a a substantial amount of money through owning multiple brick and mortar service businesses.
2:58
It's typically made on the licensing and franchising side because with each new location you take on more overhead, you take on more, it costs capital to open them.
And so like that nest egg that you had then gets blown into this new thing and if you have a hiccup, all of a sudden the nest egg and all you built at 1 disappears in two, right.
3:15
And so the objective of a business is?
Is to make a profit.
That is the point.
That is what separates it from a nonprofit, right?
And so it is my belief that you should take as much money as you can out more than you probably feel comfortable with.
And that'll put you into a place of needing to make more money to pay you, which is good, because then it means you'll actually think like a business owner, like you're trying to make money rather than just trying to build something, right?
3:41
And what's weird is that a lot of times when you think from the frame shift of, shoot, I really need to make money, you tend to make money, right?
And that means that your business actually gets better.
It's kind of backwards, but it's true.
I mean, I'm sure most of you guys at some point have had to make payroll in three days or had to make rent in a week or had to, you know, get hit with a tax bill or, who knows, right?
3:59
And you've had to make 5 grand, 10 grand, 15 grand in a week.
And then you do right.
And here you are, still breathing.
And The thing is, is you still always have that skill set.
You just don't utilize it to feed yourself.
You only use it to feed other people, which you can.
I can dig more into later, but you can think about that for yourself.
So back to when to take tips off the table.
4:16
The only outcome besides, you know, opening our location for the desire to franchise or license that model would be an exit, meaning you're selling the location.
But The thing is, is if you're selling the location, you're going to want to show as much profit as possible.
If you're consistently putting money back into the business, now this comes into accounting stuff.
4:35
But when you're buying more equipment, things like that, a lot of that stuff's not going to be considered reinvestment.
That's going to be considered, you know, equipment costs or upkeep which will take from the multiple that you would get from that business.
And so if your desire is to exit your business at some point, then you want to take as much profit out of that business as you can now, mind you.
4:55
Big full disclaimer, I do not know your business.
I do not know your situation.
Everyone is unique.
Having self-awareness is key to making big decisions in your life.
But just from like an overarching standpoint, this is something that I see all the time and so I figured I would at least speak to it.
So back to the chips.
If you're like, you should try to run as lean as possible.
5:15
You have to be incredibly distant to not just spend the access on fun stuff or things that you think might make money.
Like you have to make an argument for like.
How is this thing going to make me this amount of profit?
So if it's like I'm going to go buy $4000 worth of equipment, I'm going to use the example.
5:33
Now if you know what your profit margins are, which the average gym runs 12 1/2% margins average.
I'm not saying it's certainly you guys, but the average gym I have a CPA friend who runs just gyms and is 12 1/2%, which means to make $4000 in profit back right back.
5:50
Then you're going to have to make eight times that in in revenue to make the 4000 back.
So you have to make an equivalent argument.
It's not can I just make $4000 more?
It's can I make $32,000 more because I'm taking this off of bottom line, I'm taking this off of profit.
6:06
And moreover, if you wanted to sell your facility, you'll probably get 3 ish 3 to 4 depending on the buyer, but three times your earnings, your profit at the end of the year, right?
So if the profit at the end of the year is is $5000 less, right, That is actually losing you $15,000 on your actual sale number, right?
6:28
Which again, so you're you're losing on the actual real profit in real time, but you're also losing on the actual valuation of your business, all right.
And so it's really difficult to make that money back, especially if I'm being real.
For the majority of people who are small business owners, the things that they choose to spend money on are stupid, right?
6:45
Now, that being said, I think that when you take the money out of your business, you should not just spend it on yourself on shit, right?
Spend it on learning more skills so that you can make more money, right?
That's tip like leveling up Your skill set is going to do more for you than probably anything that you can invest in the actual business itself, right?
7:04
In terms of buying stuff, your skills will make you money, right?
Way more.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon.
It's called $100 Million Offers that over 8005 star reviews.
It has almost a perfect sport.
You can get it for $0.99 on Kindle.
7:21
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1000 hours into writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars so that later on in your business career I can catch the partner with you.
So that's my give.
Go check it out Amazon and back.
7:37
To the show.
And so that's what you should invest in.
Beyond that, it is my belief, and I made a podcast about this, that you know, really, unless you're making $100,000 a month in profit or more this like I'm just being row with you, I think you should consistently spend money on acquiring skills.
7:55
Because that that's the problem, right?
If you're not making the money you want, it's because you're lacking a skill set, right?
And if you're if you're if you feel like you're not lacking a skill set, then you're lacking a character trait, or you have a belief about the world that is false.
Right.
It's just false.
And so you have to figure out what that belief is.
8:11
And sometimes that investment comes with going into communities, connected, paying to have access to people who can break that belief for you, right.
I'm not saying me do whatever you want, but I'm just saying like just having that approach and so back to chips off the table, I'm like I'm, I'm going to go make sure my ADD stays in check.
8:30
When you are running the business every month, take as much as you can out, have a number that you drain the bank account to every single month and do that.
Religiously, all right, You drain it and you rip the cash out and you stack it.
And you do that every single month, all right?
8:45
You don't give yourself an excuse to not to to to to not take out money one month or it's kind of close.
If there's only $800 above the line, you take the 800 out.
Like you have to be disciplined about that.
You drain the account.
And The thing is, is it'll keep you on it.
One of the habits that that that I did for a very long time that was extremely useful before.
9:08
Before cash flow became kind of crazy, basically until, until we until we were doing more than 100,000 a day, I looked at the total bank accounts of all assets, my personal and my savings, my everything that was cash that was liquid across all accounts every morning.
9:27
And I totaled it up.
And so every morning I knew exactly how much money I had across everything.
And The thing is, if you look at that in the beginning, you're not going to do it.
It's going to be uncomfortable.
And if you do this religiously, you'll have a mind for where your money is going.
You'll see a big pop in your But hey, where did that go from?
9:43
And then you'll start to start.
There's a rhythm that starts happening.
You'll start seeing it.
This pattern on Tuesday's payroll hits on on Wednesday, we get our credit cards.
On Thursday, we get our ACH deposits right.
You'll start seeing these hits and you'll start feeling the rhythm, and then you'll start seeing if something seems high or something seems low, right?
10:00
And just by being mindful of that, you will make more money, I promise you, because you'll see how hard it was for you to make the money that you made and see it actually come into your account, You won't be as quick to spend it, right?
So rip the cash out as much as you can every month, because both that's going to increase your net worth, right?
10:20
Because at the end of the day, if you keep going and I saw someone, this happened to somebody and This is why I'm making this for you.
I saw someone who, quote, reinvested in their business during the good times, right?
They're just just making tons and tons and tons of money, right?
And then bad time said right.
10:36
Something happened.
Trainer leaves, takes half the clients, whatever, right?
And they had nothing, right.
And they ended up having to close their facility after three years of what was good times.
But they didn't have a dollar to show for it.
Now, if during the good times, they've been consistently stacking cash, consistently stacking cash, One, you have a parachute that if you need to switch opportunities, you have it there.
11:01
Two, from an emotional standpoint, you feel like you have something to show for what you've done.
I can tell you after having sold the gyms and then having a partner at one point basically essentially drain the funds out of the account and then send it to somebody offshore, the person been indicted for fraud twice and I just didn't know.
I saw six.
11:17
All my locations, all the money that I had made vanish.
And I can tell you it's soul crushing and I don't want that to happen to you.
And so don't don't do that.
Just just take money out every month so that you have something to show for it, no matter what.
What you have to show for at the end of the day, at the end of this entire game is who you are, right?
11:35
Is the character you've built, is the beliefs that you have and the skills that you've acquired which create your reality, right?
That is truly going to always be the end goal.
But in the real material world that we live in, there are some things that money can do that can help make like.
Money can't buy you happiness, but poverty can't buy you anything.
11:52
And I heard that the other day, so it's not my quote.
But the other side of it is that money can't buy you happiness.
But it can sure help you avoid pain, right?
I'll tell you that.
Much.
Like it can help you avoid pain in your life.
And so if you can smooth transitions out for you, for your family, for whatever, Your kid has a learning disability and it costs $2000 a month to get some special tutor for them to learn how to read.
12:09
Like that shit happens, right?
And for you to be able to be prepared for that will allow you to be prepared right for when those types of things come.
So.
Take your chips off every month.
It's not helping you grow your business.
For most of you.
For the vast, vast majority of you, the things that you're investing in are not actually things that are going to grow your business.
12:27
So make it a party to profit as much as you can every month and stop buying stupid shit, all right?
If you want to exit, it's still going to increase the value of your business by being disciplined in that process, because then you're going to show lower overhead, higher profit, and it's going to be more attractive to a potential investor in the future.
12:44
All right, so.
Just don't make this mistake because I'm just telling you, when the times are good is when you need to take money out.
That is when you need to do it.
That's when you rip your cash out like you think it's going to keep going.
But the game of business is cyclical.
Right?
12:59
After every good time, there is a bad time, right?
Every up cycle is followed by a down cycle and every down cycle is followed by an up cycle.
We don't be like everyone else and think it's always going to be this way.
Right.
It's not like there's probably going to be something that's happening on the horizon, right?
13:16
Like the yield curve is flipped.
Like we're on borrowed time right now.
So right now, things are still good, right?
Economy's still frothy.
Take some chips off the table, all right, Because you don't know what's going to happen.
So anyways, I hope that was useful.
I hope right now, if you could think to yourself, man, there's some extra money in my bank account right now.
13:34
What should we do with it?
Take it out.
Right.
Run a paid in full play every once in a while, right?
Just take some, scrape some cash off.
Make sure you run internal plays to your existing clients at least 4 * a year, because that's just pure excess profit and you shouldn't reinvest in the business.
You just take it right out and you put it in the Bank of you all right.
13:52
Because number one thing that is guaranteed to make you more money is more money.
So if you take the money out, it's guaranteed to actually increase your net worth, whereas if you invest it, it is not guaranteed to do that.
And likely if you look at it from a profit standpoint, if you're doing 12% margins or even 20% margins, you have to make five times that investment just to make it back, just to make it back.








0:00
I get asked all the time about these no strips that I wear.
I wear no strips so that I don't snore at night.
In this video, I'm going to breakdown how I would launch a no strip business if I were to launch one and how I would get it to be a 40 to $60 million enterprise.
And how You can use the same thought process to apply to any physical products business or service business that you use to sell stuff to people that you don't know.
0:22
The no strip costs pennies to manufacture.
You can sell them for 100 times that price.
So if it costs you $0.02 and you can sell for a buck, you're making huge margins on the actual thing.
The second thing is that it's sticky, quite literally, but also from a recurring standpoint.
If you can improve how someone breathes, they're going to buy it again and again and again.
0:38
I could have auto ship built into it, which would be nice and it makes it convenient for people.
It's also something that doesn't require willpower to use.
You don't have to remember to do it.
Like the problem with supplements, that people have to remember to take them.
Most people sleep every day.
Those people don't work out every day.
And so I'd rather associate a product with something that people are doing on a regular basis without willpower.
0:54
It's the reason beauty products to me are more interesting than fitness products.
By and large.
I have deep product knowledge.
I've used the ones that are like peace, not a huge fan.
Walk around within the morning, I take it, I put in my pocket, leave it on my kitchen, take out of bed to go get the fit.
I like the disposable ones.
And the things that I'll probably do to make it different is I'd focus a lot on the product.
1:11
I would also probably try and tie in some sort of branding element.
I would put like volume or persist or endure across the bridge of the nose.
I'd like to have one that was clear, that had the word.
So the only thing you see is the word, which I think would be really cool.
It has to stick all the way through.
The different flavors of the nose strips would be the words that people are working on.
1:30
And so I like having those constant daily subconscious reminders around things they actually found in sales rooms that having a single word on the wall affected performance from the team, even if it was just huge.
So if you just have like one more on the wall, then everyone sees that as this daily reminder that they need to keep.
I would want my face to be The Walking billboard for my eye.
1:47
I would have it spelled backwards so that in the mirror someone could see it and they could see it every day and it would remind people of like a word that they're trying to focus on for a season.
And so I'll give you a basic estimate of what I think would end up happening money wise.
Let's say that we retailed the product for let's see what uh, some strips go for real quick.
So they currently sell for about $0.30 a strip and I'd probably sell 306090 packs.
2:06
I would want to be a little bit premium. 1999 would probably be a price point that I would look at any 499.
I would split test the price points there, but it'd probably be in that range.
My cost of goods would almost be entirely based on shipping cost that's associated cost to ship.
The nose strips would probably be in the neighborhood of like $4.00, maybe like 2 1/2.
2:23
It depends on like the three PL. that we would use.
Even after the cost of all the no strips, which is minimal, let's just say we make $16.00 of gross margin on a $20 product, which is really good for physical products.
Five options on my upsell 13612 all the way down to maybe 15% off if they buy, you know, 12 months worth and then cascading upwards in terms of smaller percentages off.
2:42
But let's do the math on how much money this will make.
Let's say 10,000 people a month would go to a page.
If I said hey check this out and if I did it consistently it probably about 10,000 people a month just clicks and then we converted 5% of traffic on that page 500 buyers.
Let's just keep it at the monthly rather than getting in the average bundles. 10% churn and it's not very low for physical but just leave it at that.
3:00
Every month I would sign up 500 and then I'd lose 10%.
This business would keep growing with that level of traffic until we reached 5000 users because it's 500 / 10% which is the churn which is the number of maxed out users at a hypothetical Max where you're in equilibrium between number of sign ups and number of cancellations.
3:16
I would be at 5000 users a month.
Price point was $20 hundred, $1000 a month, $80,000 a month, so $1,000,000 and profit from the no strips.
And if I was focusing on like a branding perspective, I would probably go after the entrepreneur community first because it's obviously community that I have access to.
3:32
The brand would actually be more of a personal development brand of like becoming the person you want to be with the daily actions and reminders of who you want to become.
Because I'd want it to be mass market, I would show different walks of life working on different problems.
Moms and their word is patience.
Patients can apply to anyone, but like a prisoner who just gets out is the next con.
3:49
It might be like forgiveness.
It could be a much wider brand if you focus on the deficiencies that people want to fill.
And then I have to think of some kind of sexy word for the brand name.
I don't know, I feel like it'd be something around like Better Be better, no strips short and simple that people could understand and share.
You want it to be about the prospect and more specifically about the problem that we're solving and the person that they want to become and the promises that we're fulfilling.
4:10
If you can help someone feel better about who they are, people will pay anything for that feeling.
And so the wedge product is the idea that we are helping people breathe better, but the brand and the promise is about we're helping people be better.
What I would really want to do is build the capacity to make the words easy to print on there.
4:28
So we could have people put their own custom word in.
So, so you can choose from one of my 5 words, but if you want to put your own word in, it's $30.00.
And I get this huge premium, but it's worth it for a lot of people to have their own custom words.
So that would be like a unique competitive mote.
If you develop a manufacturing capacity that can, like ondemand, create the word that someone wants, you can literally 2X3X.
4:47
Sometimes the price of the thing cuz value is there for people and they would get a text that would say, hey, what word you want to work on.
This month they texted back.
It automatically goes in the system and then ships it right out to them.
And I would probably ship no strips with two or three variations of influencers that I thought were words that their communities dug.
5:03
So someone sends me Mosey Nation or someone sends me S and me 500.
Someone sends me those terms on a strip.
I'm going to be like, dude, this is dope.
And then because I have such high gross margins, I could say, hey man, I'll give you 40%.
By the way, if you were making your own business, if you ran 40% margin on your own audience, it's a great business.
5:18
Anyways, for me, I was able to add $1,000,000 to the business and then you add 100 influencers.
Maybe they're not as big or they're not as no strip centric like I am, but maybe if they did a tenth of the volume that I could do, on average it's 10 times what I'm doing, which is $10 million.
Theirs was only 40% margin to me because I had to give them 40 and there's 20 that was cost.
5:36
So let's cut that in half again.
So I get another 20% from the 10X volume that I get from them, Mind you, stuff to run the business, but let's just keep it simple for now.
So now we're probably looking at a three or $4 million EBIT, a business that is recurring, not dependent on one single face, very high by gross margin, so that they can go into new channels that has a unique and competitive mode that allows it to have a premium pricing which I didn't even factor in.
5:55
Like if we sold it for 40 rather than 20, that would be a really interesting business model that would have huge enterprise values.
If you're curious, the final piece is that what would this business be worth If we're doing 4 million in EBITDA for physical products business like this, this business would probably be worth somewhere in the 40 to $60 million.

You have to show the initiative.
You have to have some skill.
You have to demonstrate that you have the skill and that you can identify a need for another person like it's basic level, but that that basic level is a hurdle that most people don't jump up.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:19
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's up everybody?
Today we are joined.
By a good friend of mine, Mr. Alex or Mosey.
Alex is in the middle of building a massive empire with acquisition.com.
0:37
Many of you guys have seen him in his social media, his YouTube Instagrams stories, all the goodness he's never skips desserts.
The man is a protein theme, but more importantly a business phenom.
So one of the best ways I've ever introduced Alex.
0:54
If anybody ever asked my opinion on Alex, I say Man, this guy.
Has an Ivy League type knowledge with street mixed with St.
Smarts, which is a very rare breed indeed.
And I think on top of that, I love the fact that he doesn't look like that at all.
1:14
The fact that he just doesn't care what anybody thinks, always rocking the tank top, the mixture he he doesn't care what anybody thinks.
Welcome to show, Mr. Alex.
Thanks for having me man.
I I appreciate the intro.
That was one of the most distinct ones and I'm I'm proud of both sides.
1:32
Good deal, dude.
So me and you, Alex, we we go back.
I was looking through my text messages.
We met about four years ago at a mastermind down in Utah, of all places, and got to know you and your wife.
And you know the the thing that that always impressed me is just how just like straightforward to the point.
1:54
Never beat around the Bush.
You know, very logical.
I love that about your relationship with business, your relationship with people, your relationship with everything.
So dude, obviously you've completely shifted gears in your career.
You went and built this amazing business with Jim launch.
2:12
Now you're building acquisition.com.
You got a really cool podcast.
What is pushing and motivating you right now?
I just enjoy playing the game.
I think that's like the biggest part of it.
And so I write books about business.
I make content about business and when I'm not doing those things, I'm doing business.
2:29
It's like that's what I think about all day and probably like you like you go to a restaurant you're like man how many tables do you think they turn through here And like, you know what do you think they get these you know, these shrimp at and then you're like, huh, like I wonder where they're recruiting the staff from.
Like I wonder how they market like because how did we hear about this was it the out bad now how do we hear.
2:45
No somebody's told us that.
You know, like you start reverse engineering stuff.
And I remember listening to, I think it was a a little Wayne interview and he was like, I can't stop rhyming.
It's like I just, I can't stop rhyming.
He's like, it's this like obsession.
3:01
And I feel like it's kind of the same thing for me with business in general.
It's like I just, I just like it a lot and it it happens to have a monetary outcome.
But I know I would do it if it didn't make money because I do lots of things that are business related that don't make me money.
Absolutely.
3:17
I love what you bringing up.
Like, hey, I go into a restaurant, I start thinking about things which by the way you there are some places that have to be cover ups for the mafia.
Because like for example, Arby's like there is never a car there.
3:34
And I go there and I'll eat a Turkey sandwich because it's like one of the only quick things that I can get that are somewhat good.
Just like, dude, there's no way, there's no way, these guys.
Aren't a cover up for for drugs for the mafia?
Because this has got to be a laundering scheme.
I definitely have seen some things in like shopping centers.
3:53
This does not make sense.
That's what I've been up to.
Primarily.
We've been you know massively investing in media overall because you know the overarching idea like when I when I decided to step down from gym lunch was that Jim launch in my opinion was going to eventually become an investment company.
4:12
So you know at a certain, you know there's 50,000 micro gym owners in the US and so we had already talked to 20,000 when I stepped down.
So like and I found a lot of the advice that you know actually I'll rewind for a second because I'll tell you a story that you may not know this.
So when I went to we had that little meet.
4:29
It was like you meeting like six other people at your your cabin.
And so some of my audits listen nice like when I talk about that meet up, it was actually with Chris and together it was like the eight of us were doing half a billion a year in revenue, which I thought was pretty cool.
You know what I mean if you just added up all the bits, it might even been higher than that, but it was at least half a billion a year in revenue.
4:49
And it was interesting from an experience for me because that meeting was actually one of the reasons I decided to sell Jim Watch.
And the big take away for me, like, even though we talked about lots of stuff, yeah, we talked about lots of, you know, you know, strategies, tactics, hiring people, scaling, blah, blah, blah, that kind of jazz.
But the biggest take away I had was I looked at everybody in the room who was doing more revenue than I was.
5:10
And, you know, I was like, okay is it, is it there a skill set that I'm lacking?
Like what?
What am I missing?
Right.
And the biggest thing that I saw as my take away was I was just in a pond and everyone else was going after an ocean.
And so I just needed to, It's like, I mean VC guys know this because they look at, you know tech companies are gonna best in the first question to ask is what's Tam, you know, what's total adjustable market?
5:31
And I'd never asked that question because when I come into the business game, everybody was like niche, niche, niche, niche, niche.
And I do think that's 100% the right advice when you're starting out.
But at some point you have to expand.
And so I had two directions I could have expanded in.
So one is like I continue to expand more broadly in fitness.
So I go after health clubs, which is exactly what Jim Lunch is doing now is they're going after bigger big chain gyms.
5:51
When I call like facility leasing gyms, it's like lots of equipment, lots of treadmills, that kind of thing.
We were all service based facilities or we could go down market, go after like for some trainers and fitness enthusiasts.
And so like those were like kind of the directions there.
But at that point, I've been in fitness for a decade, and I think, you know, if I hadn't sold then I I could have continued to go down that path.
6:10
But I didn't want to be known as the fitness guy.
Like, I already had felt kind of tired of being known as the gym guy.
And you can make an argument that that would have been a better move because I've known the space and you just get deeper and deeper knowledge and that becomes your competitive advantage.
But in September of 19, I started making general business content.
I stopped making content about gyms.
6:27
And so it was actually almost at that time that things started growing for me.
And so like my podcast, I went from talking about only gyms to talking about business.
And then it started growing, even though I've been doing it for like two or three years at that point.
And then I think a year later after that, I started making my first YouTube videos.
And so those were kind of like the first things that I started doing from a general business perspective because the general business market's a lot bigger than the gym market.
6:48
And I wanted something that would never stop compounding.
Yeah, that was like one of the big lessons that I had from gym lunch.
And I've talked to a lot of, you know, business owners that have a not, like the perfect vehicle when they start their first business because they didn't think about it.
Like, I didn't think about it.
I was just trying to not be broke, but like playing it out and thinking like what's the you have to have one or multiple compounding mechanisms within the business in order for it to be able to reach like reach without force, right.
7:13
Like could I you know, get to 1000 bull callers Like sure I could, but like could I take that same effort and allocate it somewhere else and get a higher return.
And so that's that's ultimately why we started doing all the content stuff.
I saw that media has a huge compounding effect.
Like your audience itself compounds.
7:28
So it's like 10% more people find about it every month.
And like when you have 10 people, you go to 11:00, but when you have 10 million, you go to 11,000,000, then it just takes time.
And so that was kind of the right that was one of the big reasons.
Super cool.
So for my audience that may not know your whole story, let's rewind.
7:44
I know there was like.
A big factor like you went to the Ivy League school.
You were planning on following in in the footsteps of your father as far as being a professional, right?
I I know your dad was in the medical field, but you were going to go, I think you worked for like a government contractor or whatnot.
8:00
Walk us through kind of some of those defining moments that got you to launching the gym.
Yeah.
So I graduated 3 years from Vanderbilt because I just did extra credits and did summer work and whatnot so I can get ahead.
And then I got a consulting job at a boutique strategy firm that did defense contracting.
8:17
So they did Space Cyber Intelligence.
At least those are the projects that I worked on.
It looked really good on paper.
It sounded great at cocktail parties, but I really did not enjoy the work.
And being where I'm at now, I would look back and probably just tell myself, like, maybe you need to switch companies.
Like, you know what I mean?
8:32
Like, it's not that I didn't necessarily enjoy the word.
I could just like the three people I saw all the time.
Or maybe like, you know, there's a lot of other variables.
But I extrapolated.
That's like, I don't want this to be my life, which was true.
And I I saw what the, the partner of the firm was, what their life looked like.
And I was like, that's what 20 years from now looks like or 30 years from now looks like.
8:49
I don't want that life.
And so I was pretty depressed at that point.
So just sad that like, life wasn't working out the way I thought it was going to, even though I'd done all the things that I thought I was supposed to do.
And so I started thinking, what do I actually like?
And I knew I wanted to start a business.
And so I started applying to business schools.
And the first question on the Harvard or who's either Booth or whatever one of the schools was, how will a, you know, Booth MBA help your long and shortterm goals?
9:13
It's like a standard question.
It's not like, I mean, it's not a complex question.
But I ended up staring at it for like 3 days.
Yeah, starting here for three days and being like, I don't know if this is going to help my short lumps and balls, where I was at right then.
Right.
I was two years out.
I was two years out of college.
You know what I mean?
So I was 23, not even.
9:28
I think I was 22 when I was seeing my plan because I just wanted to change.
But I thought about it for a few days and I was like, you know what I think?
I think rather than foregoing 2 years of income and incurring $120,000 in debt, to do this, I could take the 50 grand I've saved up and start a business and like, learn that amount.
9:44
And median income coming out of Business School at the time was 120 grand.
So I was like, I just got to get to 10 grand a month from my own savings with a business to then like kind of acquaints it too.
And so I was like, if I have no kids, I have no wife.
9:59
Like, if I'm afraid to take a risk now, like I'll never be able to take a risk later and transparently, I still think the hardest decision I've ever made was to play my job today.
Like, for sure it was.
So how old were you at that time?
I was 22 when I quit.
You got through school pretty quick.
I mean so you're 22, you're considering going to get in your MBA or whatnot and that's that's when you and you said that that's the hardest decision.
10:21
Like, talk us through that.
Like, why was it the hardest decision?
Well, for me, it was just, I didn't want to disappoint my dad.
You know, It was interesting because, like, the happiest time my father's life was the saddest of mine, you know what I mean?
Like, I had done everything that he had told me to do up to that point.
And I was living 100% the life that he wanted me to live rather than the life that I wanted to live.
10:39
And so I mean, and for anybody who has like a parent or an uncle or a brother or whatever it is that you're trying to live up to, I mean, it was tough because, like, you know, I always wanted the approval of my dad.
And it was like the closest time that I've ever had to like having it.
And he was pumped.
You know, we we'd go out to get lunch like 2 days or three days a week.
10:56
So I moved close enough to home that we could do that.
And so he was like he got some, you know, brag about me to his friends.
And that was like, that was it for him, you know?
And every time I talk about opening a business, he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, like, do this and then go to Business School and then, you know, whatever.
And and I was like, because he was always for formal education.
11:14
So he was like, yeah, Business School.
That makes sense.
Like, go do that.
But every time I bring it up, you would keep like, you know, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, like, come over.
We'll talk about it.
Let's talk about lunch.
And so it was just, like, months and months and months of, like, kind of always having that kind of pulled away.
And then when I decided to quit, it took me 6 months from what I thought I wanted to quit to when I actually quit.
11:30
And it was like six months of, like, really tough every day, like pacing Like, really, you know, I mean, like, I lived alone.
Just like calling everybody I knew, probably to the point where everybody I knew, like was sick of hearing me like, talk about this debate over and over again and finally.
I just figured, yeah, exactly.
11:47
And finally I just figured there's lots of little micro moments, but one of them was like I was reading all these self help books at that time.
So I was reading like, you know a few books a week because I was like trying to like, you know, invest in myself.
And I realized after like my 20th self help book that like my life was the same.
12:05
And some of the books said things that contradicted one another.
You know what I mean?
Some of them were like manifest everything.
Other ones were like, no man, if it's anything.
And I was like, right, and so sorry if I passed, you could pick me up.
And so finally it was actually like downside your side.
12:20
Yeah.
Just like downside decision making.
Which is like what what ended up driving it for me?
Just saying, like, OK, well worst case scenario is I lose all the money that I've saved up and my business fails and then I can go to Business School with like a real world experience and I can write essays or whatever.
So that was like, it sounds so simple now, but like, that being my worst case ended up being the thing that I decided to like lean a lot on.
12:41
And so I still knew my dad wasn't going to be game for it.
I basically left without telling anyone.
And I called my dad when I was halfway across the country because I drove to California.
And I called him up and I was like, hey, you know, just we'll let you know I'm gonna start that business.
And he was like, all right, we'll come over.
We can talk about it.
And I'd already had, you know, I'd already knew that he would just talk me off the ledge again.
12:58
And so I was like, Nah, I can't.
He's like, why?
He's like, I'm, I'm in Ohio right now.
I'm just like, And then obviously at that point he, you know, was very upset and so extreme.
You always, you know, like, you're never balanced.
Like, you need to be more balanced.
13:14
Follow along.
And The thing is a lot of people will hear that story and be like, oh, well, it's cool.
Your dad's probably happy with you now.
But like, we weren't cool for a while, like a long while, not like months, but like years.
You know, we stayed in touch.
Like I'm the son, I was alive.
You know, I shoot the occasional tax like 2-3 minute call like once a month or something.
13:31
But I looked at three different businesses.
I thought about starting a frozen yogurt stamp, a test prep because I was good at taking standardized tests.
And I mean because I because I I gone from like a 6:30 I think on the G Mat when I took it the first time to 7:30 or 7:40 which was like 20 points higher than Harvard Smith sport at the time to get it actually.
13:50
So you you just did here so like yeah.
So you're you're probably familiar with this so I got to send 30 some for you on it and all I did to prep for it was I bought every G map book at Barnes and Noble in like the test prep section.
They're all like these phone book thick things because I found this research study that said this line on a chart that said the more problems you do, the better your score is like it was just straight up, just like problems score.
14:14
And so I was like great, I can like input output equations for like success.
Like I can do that.
So I did 4 hours a day of problems for 16 weeks and that's what got my score above Hartsman score.
And so I was like, okay.
I could, I could teach people how to do that.
Hey, mosenation, quick break.
14:30
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right.
So send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with.
Tag them in one of my or Layla's posts, and I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, So let's get back to the show.
14:48
I couldn't afford the yogurt thing because I when I called up like franchises and stuff, they were like, it's 250 grand.
I was like, come on.
And so then it was just test prep and gyms because I was into fitness already.
So I was like, I kind of have a little bit of advantage there.
And then I was going to do a test prep thing.
And then I prepped all this stuff and I gave it to somebody who was going to be my partner.
15:06
And then they ended up taking it and just doing it on their own.
And so I kind of had like a bad taste in my mouth from that.
So I was like, I guess I'm going to do fitness.
And I had this lady at the gym that I was working out at asked me to meet her for lunch, like and much older.
And I was like, it wasn't weird.
So anyways, I met her for lunch because she wanted to ask me about nutrition.
15:21
So I was like, sure.
And so I talked to her for an hour about, like, what she could do with her food or whatever.
And then she handed me a check for 100 bucks.
I wasn't in business, but the idea that this lady just gave me a check for $100 for like sitting down with her, I was like, well, like I could make money for this.
15:36
And so there was a lot of, like, little things that happened.
And then when I finally decided to leave was because I I reached out to 40 different gym owners who looked like they were doing Okay.
And I just said, like, can I just work for you for free?
And no one got back to me except for one guy.
15:52
And he said, yeah, you can work for me for free.
And so I drove.
So I drove across the country to his gym and I, like, showed up at the front door and he was like, I was like, hey, I'm here.
And he was like, I'm doing it right now.
Like, what's up, man?
Yeah, Like, she was like, he was like, well, where are you staying?
16:08
I was like, I don't know yet.
He's like, you mean you literally, like, drove directly to my gym?
I was like, yeah, like I was.
I didn't know.
You know what I mean?
And so he was like, you can stay at my place tonight, but like, you need to find some place.
I was like, I'll figure it out.
And so the next morning he, like, went like stand up, stood on a box and was like, hey, does anybody have an extra bedroom for this kid?
16:26
And he's like pointing at me like in the thinking about like a little gym.
And this dude came up to me and I, like, worked out with that gym owner.
He had like a crew of three or four guys he trained with in the morning at like 4:00 AM And so one of the guys I'd worked out with was like, you can stay one of my spare bedrooms.
And so, you know, I paid a few 100 bucks a month in rent for one of these.
16:44
This guy's bedroom, you wanted to get in shape.
He was like, hey, just make sure I don't eat like crap.
And I was like okay, I can do that.
And that was how I got my foot into fitness.
And as a fun side note for the audience, like I was working a white collar job on pace to be able to make, you know, 100 grand plus.
17:01
And then, you know, obviously two years after Business School scale up from there.
And I went all the way back to basically being a trainer, which doesn't even require college education or the experience I had for, I think it was like, I don't know, 12 bucks an hour or something like that.
I don't even know what I was getting paid.
17:18
And so, like a lot of times, I think you have to take some steps back if you want to start something new.
Dude, I think that's such a a key principle that a lot of people don't quite understand is like the value of experience in education, in doing what you want to go and build is worth so much more than the short term dollars that you're going to get paid.
17:36
And so that I love the idea of like, going and working for somebody for free, especially if that somebody is like an incredible mentor, they can really catapult your career, right?
And there's not a successful entrepreneur in the world that would turn down a hungry guy or girl that's like, hey, let me come learn and work for you for free and just you just mentor and I'll do whatever you say, right?
18:00
Like that.
I mean everybody's going to take a piece of that.
You know actually I want to give some caveats to this.
I think you'll you'll agree with me because I've given this advice a lot and I had my training partner.
I was talking about a kid who came up to me and was like hey, can I work for you free And probably with your steps station and status that you're getting right now you'll you'll you probably already do.
18:17
But like, I have, you know, I probably get 50 a day of people saying, like, can I work for free for you or do something for free for you?
And so two or three big caveats around this.
Number one is that I recommend that if you're going to try and do this approach, you want to go to somebody who's one or two steps ahead of you.
18:32
Elon Musk, if you're like, hey Elon, can I get you a coffee for you?
Like Elon doesn't need you to get his coffee.
Like it's not like he's going to sit down with you every morning and give you a one hour coaching call because you gave him his coffee.
Like, people don't think about this.
Right.
And there's this issue that I see amongst 4 people that think that their time is worth something and it's not.
18:52
There's no shortage of low skilled labor.
They have this idea that if I'm willing to do $30,000 a year work for you, you now owe me all of your time because I'm giving you my time.
So my minutes are the same as your minutes, but they're clearly not because you're pursuing me and I'm not pursuing you.
And so caveat #1 is like, you want to go to somebody who's supply demand of free labor is in your favor.
19:12
So somebody who's one or two steps ahead of you, they probably don't have a lot of people saying they want to work for free right now.
That person might not have all the skills that Elon must have, but they got more skills than you.
And so it's like okay.
So #1 is gone for people who are just a couple steps ahead. #2 is you want to make them an offer that's so good that they feel stupid saying no.
19:29
Because, like, I don't want people to get this twisted like you were getting the better end of the deal if someone starts working with Chris and just shadows you every day, right?
Or shadows me every day.
Let's not pretend here like my life is not better off because you're in it now.
Your life has to be significantly better because I'm met.
19:45
I'm just like, I don't want to sugar butter.
Like, let's be real for a second, right?
And so in order to to do that, like you have to provide value.
And so one of the things that I see and I get this in my DMS all the time, which is like, hey, I'd like to do this in exchange for working, you know, alongside you.
And I'm like, no, First off, like the whole principle of giving first is in an offer to give first, it is giving first period without expectation of something back.
20:09
So it's like what does Chris need?
Well, Chris probably wants somebody to edit and cut his podcasts or take his podcast clips and redistribute them.
You don't offer to do that.
You just do it and then send it to him.
And then you keep doing it and keep sending it to him.
And I'll bet you that if you do that for 10:50, a hundred days straight, Chris will be like, damn, this kid is like, really, really hungry.
20:30
Like he's willing to continue.
He took the initiative, figured out what I wanted, et cetera.
Because the alternative of that right, is that you come up and you say, Chris, I want to work for you for free.
And he says, what's the next thing he's going to say?
He's going to be like, what can you do?
And now what are you asking Chris to do?
You're asking Chris to work for you because we have to figure out what you're good at, and we have to think all this like, I'm doing all this work for you, right?
20:52
Instead, it's like you have to show the initiative, you have to have some skill.
You have to demonstrate that you have the skill and that you can identify a need for another person.
Like it's basic level, but that that basic level is a hurdle that most people won't jump of.
So I'm a little lit on this because I.
It just happened yesterday.
That is, that is the.
21:08
Best explanation?
I freaking love that.
That is probably the best explanation I've ever.
Ever been given with like the two caveats?
Because yes, I've always believed the principle of like, hey, add value and whatever, but man, those freaking 2 caveats are 100% true.
21:25
Because yeah, if I have somebody come and be like.
To your exact point, I I have guys in my Dms or whatnot all the time, but the people that actually create the value and give it to me, you cannot deny that, right?
You just can't deny it.
So it's it's absolutely phenomenal.
That's great.
21:41
Great concept.
One of the cost they don't quantify is how much your time is worth, right.
So let's say right now market rate like any CEO wants a big exit says, hey Chris, I'll pay you 25,000 an hour to like have your time right.
And so for you, it's like an hour of my time market rate is 2535 grand, whatever it is, right?
21:58
And if the work that this person is doing for a whole year is $35,000 worth of work, if you asked me or you need an hour a week of my time, right, I have to think about the opportunity cost of what my time is worth.
And so like, you're actually, like, you have to make sure that the value you're providing is in excess of the time it's costing me.
22:18
And the higher up the person is, the less of their time you're going to be able to take.
Not only because, like, it's really valuable, but like it's going to be a cost that you're never going to be able to overcome.
If you take an hour of my time and say you got to be able to make a million a year, and that's just at cost that's breaking.
22:35
Like, I would like to get a return on my time, right.
So you got to be able to make 10 million a year for me.
For me to give you an hour week of my time.
I'm not going to like, I'm not being a Dick here.
I'm just saying, like, that's just the Max, right?
And so the real real is the higher up, the higher up the person is that you're trying to go after.
You might have to do what we just said for somebody who works for Chris, for one of Chris's leaders.
22:56
And then you prove to that person that you're worth it and then you get a seat and then you have, then you get two or three steps closer.
And that's the idea is you keep trading up so that you can get closer to the person.
Like, I can't reach out to Elon Musk and say I'll work for you for free because he wouldn't care.
Why is he going to care for you?
23:13
He'd be like Alex who?
Alex who?
No, I don't want him.
So I love how your stuff is just so black and white, right?
Like 1 + 1 = 2 or we ain't doing it right.
Like it's just there's no being around the Bush.
It it makes it work.
So how does somebody get to Alex or Mosey, right?
23:32
Like, what value are you lacking that if like somebody offered holy crap man, I I would give that guy an hour of my time.
All right.
Two easy ways that you can identify what somebody ahead of you might want that you could offer them for free, right.
So number one is look at what they're currently doing and think, is there a way that I can do more of what they're doing or can I help them do it better?
23:54
Now, I wouldn't say, hey, I think your stuff sucks.
I can help you do it better.
The amount of people who say that about my social media, like in my DM.
So, like, hey, I think you're really missing the mark here on this.
They say from a, an account that has 500 followers to my million person account.
And I'm like, really though, like, do you think that's the angle you're going to try and take?
24:10
Like probably not the best strategy, right.
And so it's like you want to see what I'm currently doing, do more, see like, hey, you might need more clips of you, right.
So I can help do that.
And instead of saying it, you do it first, right.
You don't say I can do more clips, just do it.
Or you say, I think we can do them better because there's some, there's some trends that you're missing out on.
24:29
Again, do it and show it, right.
Show, don't tell.
So that's number one is looking at what they're currently doing and can they do more or they can they do it better.
The second thing is looking at what they're not doing but you think they should be doing.
All right?
So for example, I don't really e-mail my list at all.
Like we have 1000 people every day that join e-mail list.accosis.com and it's because I do want to make sure that anything I provide is exceptionally valuable and I haven't had time to do it.
24:54
So like I've sent like 2 emails the last year and so like somebody who can help take my words from other places and then craft them in the emails that are valuable would be something that would be great for me.
They might notice that I'm not on Pinterest, right?
Like I'm not on Pinterest because I don't understand the platform.
And so like, if you understand Pinterest and you want like, then start making Pinterest posts for me, like talk about easy opportunities, go somewhere I'm not and help me take the stuff already got and repurpose it.
25:20
Like how much time is that for me 0.
How much value is it for me?
More than 0 because I'm not doing anything there, right?
And so it's more better of what they're currently doing.
And then looking at are there places that we can add new into the current mix without them having any costs.
So I'm incurring the cost of sifting, sorting, understanding the platform and posting it on Alex's behalf.
25:40
Now I'm using this as an example, but the person might be going after might not be an influence or whatever, like they might have other needs.
I'm just giving you like simple examples that someone can think through of like OK, how do I make an offer for that?
So right now, man, to your exact point, like I'm not phenomenal at YouTube, right.
25:57
Like I'm just getting going on YouTube.
It's really starting to understand that platform.
It's a platform that I've avoided for for so long, right.
Instagram, Facebook known that for a while known how to to do the marketing and whatnot.
But yeah, Pinterest, I mean a lot, a lot of the things that you're you're saying e-mail.
26:13
I mean you, me, me and you operate a lot very similar, right.
I don't e-mail a list.
I don't, I don't put on Pinterest.
I don't you know all these all these things really starting to to get in you know and and for me it's like if somebody could come and help me figure out how to you know better leverage.
26:31
My time in a lot of ways as far as like identifying deals like bringing me deals to the table, right, Because cuz I'm, I'm in a in a similar position as you where I'm I'm in deal mode right, Like looking and evaluating or whatnot.
If somebody went and actually sifted through a deal and said Chris, this is the reason like.
26:50
And not only am I bringing you a deal, but I did all the due diligence and the research and here it is, right like and it can cut out a lot of the the my time, my my effort or whatnot and would actually physically bring it to me.
I mean that right there whenever somebody like shows up and and does something that is of high value.
27:11
Like it's it's really hard to turn that person down, especially if like you said, they are one to two steps behind you, right.
If it's some some employee that's never done a deal, that's never done it, whatever, and they're trying to bring a deal to me, no way.
But if somebody's got a track record and it's like, hey, I've done 1000 transactions over the last three years and I've done transactions with Alex, I've done transactions with, you know this, that and the other person.
27:38
And This is why you're gonna want, you're gonna look at what I have to offer or what I'm bringing you the value I'm creating.
Like I'm paying attention, right?
And so, yeah, man, like there are so many, so many different ways, and people just aren't creative enough.
27:53
They just go and they do the stupid Dms that they copy and paste across 100 different influencers platforms and they expect results, which you know, you got to applaud the the hustle.
But it's like dude, just just think for a minute, think like would this, if I was sitting in your shoes would this appeal to me?
28:12
It's interesting.








0:00
Real quick guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
0:19
So the single thing that I has to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Whenever I think to myself, like men, I'm going to look dumb or people are going to make fun of me, or people are going to say these comments, right?
I just always remind myself I was like, do I want to be the type of person who changes my life to suit people who I will never meet?
0:39
Like, I'm literally letting them make my life less comfortable because I'm afraid of what they're going to say.
I'm like, find better problems.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:55
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wish Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I'm about to show you a bunch of life hacks that will make you happier, healthier, wealthier, or none of those things.
1:11
Number one is you're like man Alex, how are you just so incredibly male model looking with this porcelain skin that's just untouched by the sun?
The answer is, I always grown up knew that, like, putting sunscreen on your face is a good thing.
It's like one thing that, like all dermatologists say, it's like you protect yourself from the sun.
1:28
And I've actually tried for like a decade to get myself to do this.
And so I tried a bunch of times to try and figure out how to get this stuff on my face.
And I actually could never stick with it.
Like, I know how to actually put it on my face, but I never got to stick with it.
And the first thing is, I wouldn't start doing it.
1:44
So I fixed that by using a concept I call watering holes, which is there's a few places around my house that I congregate all the time.
So it's like there's a seat I eat in, there's a seat I chill in usually, and there's my office, and then I've got my bedside table.
So there's the only few places that I actually spend time in.
It's like you might have a massive house or a tiny house, doesn't really matter.
2:01
You only tend to sit in a few places throughout the day.
And So what I do is I use those watering holes as where I put stuff so that I get constant cues to remember to do that stuff when I sit down.
So it's like if I'm having coffee and I always sit in the same seat and I want to do it in the morning, then I put it next to my coffee maker or I put it in the seat that I sit in while drinking my coffee.
2:18
And so I saw problem one is that I started doing it, but what happened is I started getting punished for doing it.
And what I mean by that is I hate having oil on my hands.
Like I just don't like it.
And so I stopped doing it.
And so the other day I was, I was looking at chapstick and it had SPF on it and I was like no way.
2:36
And so I took it and I put SPF on my face and it actually stuck longer than the sunscreen did.
And I didn't get anything on my hands.
And it was way more like, targeted.
I could, like, just put it on areas or whatever.
And I tend to have dry skin and stop flaking all over people.
And so that is life hack number one.
2:52
Try this instead of sunscreen.
I think it's one of those things you might, you know, be thick before like 30 years from now, and I'll give you the subpoint.
Life Hack #2 is that if you're an ugly dude, recommend having a hat and a beard because the hat covers the top half of your face and the beard covers the bottom half of your face, so it leaves as much of your face up to the imagination of the opposite sex.
3:14
So Life Hack #2 there and Life Hack 2A is that if you do care about sun damage or try not to get skin cancer or anything like that, the hair on your beard is actually like SPF and the hat actually covers your eyes.
So there's actually very little of your face that gets exposed if you spend a lot of time outside.
And I spend a few hours a day outside in the sun and so just little life hacks that I've collected along the way.
3:34
And I'm a big hat fan, which you probably noticed all of my content.
It's like I've got my instant nap creator whenever I need it.
If I'm lifting, I can go into lifting mode and I can go back because usually I put my head no closer to something so the bill doesn't get in the way or if I'm doing shoulders or that pull downs or whatever.
3:50
And yeah, it works.
Life hack number three, stop spending so much money and I'll show you two hacks on how I think through it to get myself to actually stick with it.
So right now let's say people talk about like if you dollar cost average to the S&P, you know like it, it'll be worth a lot of money in the future.
So let's say we make, we put $1000 in and we put $100 a month towards whatever, towards investing in the S&P 500, which isn't even my favorite thing in the world to invest in.
4:14
But even if we just did a normal investment, right?
And let's say we do this for, I guess, what am I, 33?
So let's do it for 50 years for fun.
So let's say this gets the stock market and we're going to compound this annually.
All right, so that $1000 with $100 a month becomes $1.5 million in 50 years, compounded at 10%.
4:33
And so here's how I harnessed this to actually spend less money.
So what I look at is okay this $100 or this $1000 is this much money in the future and you can type it in.
It doesn't really matter what it is.
But the point is that like for me, you can just do a basic back of napkin and say it's going to be 100 times bigger.
4:51
So if I spend 100 bucks on a shirt and that $100 is 10 grand of what my future self would use with the money.
And basically what it does is it increases the local cost of making a short term decision such that you're like, you know, what if it was just 100, I might have bought it, but if it was 10,000, I won't.
5:09
And so that's like hack number one for getting myself to spend less money.
The other hack for spending less money is thinking about how much it costs me to get the money.
And so for example, if I, you know, let's say you make $100,000 a year, if you have $100,000 a year, it means you make 50 bucks an hour.
So 2000 hours.
5:25
So 100,000 / 2000 hours is 50 bucks.
All right.
And so that means that this was two hours of work.
And so I then imagined myself, if someone said, hey, I want you to work for two hours, I'm going to give you this shirt.
I'm going to be like, I'd rather not.
But when you make the purchase, you do make that decision.
5:42
And I made a short about this and add a few silly pants.
Be like this guy's trying to tell you to trade your time for money geniuses.
You make money during time, so you divide how much money you make by how much time it took you to get it.
So if I make one trade this year on the stock market and I make $1,000,000 and I did that this year and I spent all that other time researching it and planning and networking and whatever, by the way, that costs time.
6:08
And then I still have all the time that I work divided by the amount of money that I make.
So no matter what you do or no matter who you subscribe to, you make money per unit of time period.
It doesn't mean you have to monetize that way, but you still earn income over time period.
6:24
End of story.
So I like to think, would I have traded this time for that asset or that liability?
And probably no.
And so then I don't buy it.
So there's are two frames that I use to get myself to spend less money on.
Shit, I don't need life.
Act #4 is I wear what I want to wear every day and I spend an inordinate amount of time on decisions that I will have to repeat.
6:45
And so I think it's less about what I wear and more about how I came to figure out what I wanted to wear.
And so I think about the things that I do every day a lot.
Because if I can just spend a little bit more time on the front end to figure out what the perfect decision or best decision is, then from that point going forward, I get to make the best decision every day without thinking about it again.
7:04
And so common things like that is like you go to bed every day, you eat every day you you sleep.
I will.
Obviously you sleep every day.
You wear clothes every day.
So these are things that I do every day.
And so I have a lot of process or time that's gone into figuring out what the best thing to eat was.
Best way to sleep, best way to dress throughout the most days of my life.
7:20
And so I have this outfit that I wear.
It's almost like a uniform.
And I actually get really reinforced by wearing this thing for a couple reasons.
One is that every time I wear it, because I know I put about 16 months into testing, probably in total 4 or 500 different pieces of clothing to find the best brand, the best size for every article of clothing that I wear.
7:42
And so it's like this beater.
I tried 30 or 40 different types of beaters to get the right brand.
And then when I had the right brand from material and stretch and cut standpoint, then I tried different sizes.
And then I bought multiple packs of each size because sometimes mediums on this round is different than mediums on the next round because they're not as consistent.
7:59
And so once I found that, then I was like, OK, this brand this size is what I wear and now I don't need to try anything else on because I know that this is the best decision.
And then, you know, like from my shoes perspective, people have seen me probably wearing lots of different types of shoes.
And as of this point, these are the best shoes that I worn for the most environments that I'm a part of because I tend to always be in warm climates.
8:19
I can go to the pool, I can go to the restaurant, I can lift in these, I can walk in these without getting blisters.
They don't smell bad.
They don't create sweat underneath your foot.
I don't slip in them.
They've got great grip.
They also have a good amount of padding, so you get some support.
I also used to wear barefoot shoes for years until I actually got basically arthritis in my foot because people want to talk about barefoot walking all the time, but they don't talk about the fact that you were barefoot walking on grass.
8:42
And so people were like, it's the natural way to walk.
It's like, yeah, but you're not walking on natural environment.
And so I I, I bought into that.
So I'm just giving you this warning from five years or 10 years in the future is that I did that and I actually got a lot of pain in my foot that I still deal with now.
And so like, there's a reason that there's cushion in shoes.
It's because you're walking on concrete.
8:57
I walk on concrete every day.
And so I now have shoes that are padding and my feet don't hurt anymore.
All of these things are things that like that just went into my shoes are probably have 100 different shoes that I tried on over a year because I had multiple rounds of tests for each shoe.
So it's like, one is like I put it on and does it fit.
Sometimes it just doesn't fit right.
So if it fits then I'd give it a little walk around my apartment.
9:15
If it feels okay then that goes into like basically the rotation, which is can I do one full walk, which for me is an hour and change without getting any blisters or any pain.
Now if I pass that round then it's can I wear it for a week or so in multiple environments?
9:31
So, like, the gym going out to eat and then can I wear it for a longer period of time and will it smell bad?
And so it went through each of these rounds of tests until I finally found a shoe that checked all of these boxes.
And it was hard.
There's a lot of boxes that I wanted to check.
But now I don't need to wear socks.
And I can wear the same pair of shoes.
9:46
And when I travel, I will have a bag that's tiny because I can wear the one pair of shoes.
I can wear my beater, I can wear the shorts that I'm going to wear.
And I went through the same rounds of tests for all of these things.
And you're like, well, you probably can't get into restaurants with a beater.
And you're right, only for the nice ones.
Which is why I have flannels that I put on top.
10:02
And these are nice and stretchy for me because I tried a bunch of flannel types on and they work right.
And so I have four different temperature settings.
So I told you that I'm in different temperature environments and so I'm never really between 40 and 120 degrees.
And so I try to think it's like okay.
10:17
With one outfit, I can cover the most amount of different environments.
And if I go to the restaurant, I wear that.
If I go to the gym, I wear this, If I go to the pool, I wear this.
And so it just gives me the most flexibility, which is why I call it my Darwin outfit, because I'm the most adaptable.
And then that way I get reinforced by it because every time I put it on, I always think to my like, it's ridiculous.
10:36
But I think to myself, I'm like, this is the perfect outfit.
And I mean like, I get Flack from all sorts of people be like, I can't, their shoes are so ugly or those shorts are so ugly or that takes off doesn't, you know, you look like white trash or whatever it is.
But like, fundamentally, my big belief is if I claim to say that my opinion matters more to me than other people's opinion, the moment I wouldn't wear something because I would fear that other people would judge me for it means that I elevate their opinion of me more than my opinion of me.
11:02
And like, why would I care if they think I look cool?
Like, it's just like, why?
Because I know that I can walk and my thighs don't shave because I thicker thighs because I lift.
I won't get blisters.
I will stay cool and I can do all the things that I want to do.
11:18
And so, like, for me, that's Nirvana.
And so anybody who's going to, like, say anything against that, it's like, well, then wear whatever you want to wear.
Like, why does what I wear affect you?
It doesn't, right?
But of course the Internet trolls will try and make you feel like their opinion matters, but it doesn't.
11:33
They like, they, it's like they don't exist.
It's irrelevant, right.
And so if there's one bottom line of this, it's like, just do you.
And this is just my process more.
It's not this outfit per se.
This is just my Darwin outfit for my life.
I spend lots of time in these environments and so like, you might not go out of the five star restaurants all the time, so you might not even need that, right?
11:52
Or you might be in a hotter climate, or you might be in a colder climate and need more stuff.
So it's more about like, I think the thought process than the outcome because if I were in a different environment I probably would have a different outfit that'd be better suited for it.
Life Act #5.
I wear nasal strips so for breathing and it's probably seen him some of my videos.
I actually believe it or not, I try and take them off for my sepias because I get more questions about them and it has a bit like I didn't wear them to make a statement.
12:13
I wear them so I could breathe better.
And if you ever listen to some iPhone videos of me, you can hear me breathing and people are like, is it a fashion statement?
I've had two nose operations and I probably still need another one.
The 1st doctor ever showed my like inside of my nose too.
He refused to operate on me.
12:29
He was like, this is fucked up.
He's like you need like a super specialist.
So I went to that guy and he was like, I'll give it my best shot and he gave it his best shot and he was like, let me have a second round.
It's like, all right, did it again and now I have like one of two nostrils.
Before this I had like 100% couldn't breathe out of 1 and I had like 15% airflow.
12:47
On the other like I couldn't breathe at all and Layla and I basically accept in different bedrooms for like a year which people are like oh what does it help your marriage on the rocks?
I always think as a side note, I think it's ridiculous because when you started dating you didn't live in the same place and didn't have the same bedroom and did you still get it on?
Probably just I think there's a lot of over romanticism about that stuff.
13:05
We now sleep in the same bed again since I got this done and now I have the nose strips.
But just as aside, I think people like, read into that shit too much.
So I wear the breathing strips because it prevents me from snoring.
So I don't snore anymore when I wear those, but I I keep wearing them during the day because if I don't mind, nose collapses.
13:22
Probably more information than you care to know, but that's why I have breathing strips.
Again, I think the underlying thing here is a lot of people, especially before it was like Mosey Nation and Alex Mosey.
Like I was wearing the shit before.
It was cool and it was because like, breathing was cooler to me than other people's opinions about my face.
13:37
I guess if there's one underline here, it's like you've got to do shit because, like, it massively improves your life, but it looks stupid.
Who cares?
Like, really?
Like, just like, I would be so ashamed.
And this is what I have to read to myself because I'm a person.
Like, I, you know, like we're raised when we come up to care about other people's opinions because that's how we Orient ourselves in the world.
13:54
We say, what does that mean?
What does that mean?
They tell you what it means, right?
And they tell you how to behave.
So people are like, I don't care about anyone's opinion.
I think that's silly because one, you respond to the marketplace.
If everybody wasn't watching videos or like, they only watched the type of video, what would I do?
I'd respond to the marketplace and give them that.
So, like, the idea that I don't take feedback is silly, right?
14:11
But I think that there are some decisions that incorporating other people's feedback is valuable.
And then there are other decisions where it's completely invaluable.
And I think people mix the 2 And so like about like what you wear and like on your person, what you eat, how you spend your time.
Like that's you.
14:26
Like that doesn't affect anyone else.
If you want to make a product, absolutely you have to listen to the marketplace.
You know what I mean?
And so I think it's it's separating those two things out.
And for me, the thing that reinforces that is that whenever I think to myself, like, man, I'm going to look dumb or people are going to make fun of me or people are going to say these comments, right?
I just always remind myself I was like, do I want to be the type of person who changes my life to suit people who I will never meet?
14:48
Like, I'm literally letting them make my life less comfortable because I'm afraid of what they're going to say.
I'm like, find better problems, you know what I mean?
And so that's how I get myself to not worry about that stuff.
Life hack number six is finding the right environment to live.
15:04
And I'm going to say environment, because I think there's a couple important points here.
One is that if you want to change your behavior, change your environment, change your circumstances, you probably behave differently in a church than you do at a rock concert.
Right?
You do.
Yeah.
Some churches are like rock concerts nowadays.
15:20
But like, we'll just leave it at that point.
Being is that you behave differently in different circumstances.
A lot of people are trying to will try and say something to the extent of, well, that's because you're like, you're not secure in your identity.
And I think that's complete BS.
Like, I hang out differently with my friends than my grandma.
Right.
It's just different.
And so if you want to change your behavior, then the fastest and easiest way to do that is to change your environment.
15:39
So I'm gonna give you a quick story, then I'll give you the the life hacks.
So in Vietnam, I think it was like 20% of of soldiers tried heroin.
A massive percentage of people tried heroin and the US government thought they were going to have this pandemic or epidemic of heroin addicted soldiers when they got back.
15:57
But that's not what happened and you might be like why?
And before I give you the answer that when people get on heroin in the US and then they go to a rehab center, they have a 90% relapse rate, meaning they go to a clinic, they rehab and then nine out of 10 of them relapse back into taking heroin.
16:13
So what is the difference?
The guys who came back didn't go through a rehab program and the people who go through rehab programs don't succeed.
Like why is that?
It's because the environment changed.
So if you are a heroin addict in this environment and then you change your environment to a rehab center, then all of a sudden you're not a heroin addict in that environment.
16:30
You don't have the queues, you don't have the access, you don't have the resources, etcetera.
And then you go back into the place that you have the same access, the same resources, etcetera.
Then it cues the same behaviors now, or rather it rewards the same behaviors that you were doing before, which is why you did it to start with.
Now the soldiers had environments, but they were one time environments.
16:47
And when they came back to the US, they lost all of those cues and all those rewards associated with why they were doing her to begin with.
And so because they changed their environment, they changed their behavior.
And so if you want to change your behavior, it is the easiest way to make massive changes in your life.
That's the overarching scheme.
17:03
Now let's talk tactics.
So one is you don't have to change cities to change your environment.
Like literally just moving 30 minutes across town can be one of the biggest things that you do in your life. #1 #2 just moving out from your parents place can be huge.
And I honestly think not just moving out from their place, but like, I think just moving out of driving distance, like you can just get, like if you got, if you cross 40 minutes for the drive, it's enough that they don't pop in anymore.
17:28
If you're 15 minutes away, that's on the way to work.
On the way back, I was just in the neighborhood, just get it like you need to flee the nest for a little bit, get some space.
So number one is you don't have to leave the city you're in in order to get some space and move out on your own, #2.
The living expense you have, especially if you're starting out, I think is one of the biggest overheads.
17:45
That's no value at, especially if you're leasing and not buying, which many like.
I'm not even getting to the difference right now.
And so minimizing how much it costs you to live is one of the best ways to minimize risk so that you can go on the offensive and other aspects.
And the offensive isn't like people would think.
It's like, oh, I'm going to go invest in this thing.
It's like, no, just invest in you.
18:00
Which is like if you have an extra $1000 a month, an extra $2000 a month because you're not spending 1015 hundred $2000 a month on living.
But you split a place six ways and you're living on 200 to $500 a month in rent because you're splitting it and you're willing to be uncomfortable a little bit.
Then you can take that extra money, buy skills, buy courses, go to seminars, read books, whatever, so that you can then get yourself in a situation where you can earn more.
18:22
Now, I think a lot of people over index on taxes.
All right.
And so I think there's kind of two levels of this level.
One is you can go to a tax Free State in the.
If you're in the US, If you're abroad, then well, honestly, if you're anywhere besides the US, you can leave the country and live tax free.
So, like, amazing for you, but for all Americans.
18:39
So, like, the US is the only country to my knowledge that does this.
But you are a global citizen.
Meaning if I go to Dubai, we're like I could question like, Alex, why don't you move to Dubai?
Because I would still get taxed, the exact same rate I get taxed as American because I'm an American.
Now if you live in the United Kingdom and you move to Dubai, you pay Dubai taxes.
18:57
So you only pay whatever the Dubai tax rate is.
I think it's zero.
And so the only way to get 0 taxes as an American is you give up your you relinquish your citizenship.
You say I'm no longer an American, I'm a citizen of a different country, and that's a big ask.
And then I wonder to myself, the amount of people who leave countries and are willing to give up 40% of their income in order to live here is a lot.
19:20
And so a lot of people complain about America, but I still think it's the best one we've got.
And so I lean towards not doing that.
And so within the micro of America, I don't see a big difference between tax rebates and non tax restates in terms of my livability.
And so if there's minimal cost difference, but you've got, you know, California 13 to 20 depending on what it is, cuz like capital gains is 20 in California and 13.7.
19:42
I think on income tax there versus somewhere else, like I don't have a massive difference.
So I'm willing to go somewhere where I have lower taxes in the micro.
But the difference between a third world country and here, big enough for me to say I'd rather be in America.
Now, the big obsession about taxes in my opinion is because most people don't understand how wealth is created and wealth isn't created through income, it's created through asset appreciation.
20:04
That's what that means is you get.
It's not based on what you get paid, it's based on how much the stuff you own is worth.
And appreciation in general is tax free.
So we see all these billionaires on Forbes.
It's not because they have a billion dollars in their bank account.
It's because they own something that's worth a billion dollars.
And if next year it's worth $1.1 billion, they didn't get any taxes on that $100 million of appreciation.
20:24
But they can't take loans against that appreciation.
So they can have access to the money without having to get taxed on.
And if you're like, man, that's unfair, consider the alternative.
What are they going to do, get taxed on money they never made?
It's just learning to play the game, right.
And I didn't understand this, which is why I used to be really obsessed with trying to minimize taxes.
And I spent a disproportionate amount of time, tried to optimize for it.
20:43
And I'll give you the most extreme example.
An acquaintance of mine set up a shop in Puerto Rico, and he lived in Florida.
And so he could make a pretty easy trip back and forth.
And he did it every weekend.
And so he did, He did his weekdays in Puerto Rico, and he did weekends in Florida, which I get that because then he's spending more than 51%.
20:59
He doesn't have to think about it.
But I remember asking him, I said, so do you think if you didn't have to go on 104 flights a year that you could take all of that time and just live in the place that you want to live and make the 30% more?
21:17
And he was like, fuck.
And so we ended up actually moving back to Florida.
And a lot of people actually do that because at some point, in my opinion, realized that you just do this circular logic.
You say I want to make money so that I can be free to do what I want.
21:35
And then you're like, okay.
So then I'm going to give up my freedom so that I can make more money to live in a place that I don't want to live most of the year, so that I can write like, where like the logic circle breaks down.
21:50
And so in my opinion, remember why you started, Remember why you got on this path to begin with.
For me, I optimize for freedom, and I want to live wherever I want to live.
That maximizes my benefits of all kinds.
And so if you're trying to pick a city in the US1, here's my little checklist for what I would look for.
22:06
One is I want to go in a city that has the most of the industry I want to be in.
So that means that there is no right city.
There's a right city for you, for the career path or the season that you're in.
And so, like, if I want to get in film, I might go to LA even though it's tax shitty, right?
Or if I want to get in tech, I might move to Silicon Valley or Austin, right?
22:24
Or there's some.
Actually, Denver's actually becoming like a hotbed of of software and tech stuff.
And so like, I would look at the different hotbeds and I would be like level one.
Level 2 is, do I know anyone who's there?
Because it's funny because if you hear somebody say, oh, I went to Cincinnati, Cincinnati sucks.
There's no way that you actually experienced Cincinnati.
22:41
Someone went there for three days and they went to eat at 4 restaurants and they saw maybe like 10 people.
And then they made a judgment on the entire city based on that micro experience.
And that's why I said earlier, if you just go from where you live to like 30 minutes away, it can feel like an entirely different thing, which is why people do staycations.
22:59
It's just a change of environment.
But like, it's just as much of a change in environment to do that as to fly somewhere and then get somewhere that you don't know people.
So I do.
So number one, is it in the industry that I want #2 is, do I know people that, like, I might like or have some, you know, some things in common with #3 is if there's some tax advantage between two places, I would probably go towards the tax advantage one.
23:21
Number four is I want in the micro wherever I live, to be walking distance from a lot of the stuff that I use.
And I know for me having a sick gym is actually one of the few things that I really care about.
Like it, it improves my my, my subjective well-being like I have a better mood more if I have a good gym, like in walking distance.
23:39
And So what else do I like in walking distance?
It's like I like good places to eat in walking distance.
I like fast casual stuff.
I also like nice stuff.
So both of those things I like to have in walking distance.
And I like having places that I can walk in general.
And I prefer walkable living areas to not like drivable areas.
23:54
We have to drive everywhere.
And again, I'm sharing my preferences, but you might be like I like suburban life, which is fine, do that.
And the fifth one is I think about access from whatever city I'm in.
And if I have the the choice between a mark and the C market, there are advantages to both of those.
The C market, you can buy more real estate for less money, you can get more space.
24:12
The disadvantages are it's harder to find talent, harder to get people to move there.
If you're a business owner and it's harder to fly in and out of, it's literally more secluded in a market, you can get more people to move there.
You have access to better talent.
And the bigger the a market, the more ways you can directly fly in and out of.
And that sounds like a small thing, but the I guess the higher up you go in business, the more you travel.
24:30
And so for me, having direct flights to as many places as possible is actually like a huge life hack.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon.
It's called $100 Million Offers.
At over 8005 star views, it has almost a perfect sport.
24:45
You can get it for $0.99 on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1000 hours into writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars so that later on in your business career I can catch the bargain with you.
25:01
So that's my give.
Go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
And so the last piece is if you're a place where it's a common destination for most people.
Like, the reason that I spend a lot of time in Vegas is because most people flying to Vegas every year or two for something, they fly in for a bachelor party, Bachelorette party, for a conference, for big fights, for comedy shows, for like, whatever.
25:27
There's a lot of things that are going on.
And so I actually have built in networking.
That happens for me.
And so people know that I I spend 51% of my time here.
And so I'll get hit up by people be like, yo, I'm in town, let's grab lunch, let's grab drinks, let's grab dinner.
25:43
And the beauty of that is that they're here for something else.
I'm not entertaining them for three days.
They have other reasons they're here and I get to check in.
How you doing?
High five.
Awesome.
And they go on their way.
And so I can maintain more relationships at a high level without having the cost of entertaining for days at a time to maintain the acquaintance life.
26:02
Hack number seven, stop drinking so much water and you're going to be like, what?
Let me explain.
So number one, I think there's this massive obsession about water.
And I can't wait to see the troll comments about this, but believe it or not, ancient humans didn't drink as much water as we do, and yet they still survived.
26:18
And when I think about the pros and cons, I absolutely acknowledge that there are pros to being super hydrated.
But for me, there's one massive con.
And the massive con is that you have to get up to pee all the time in two different times.
One is throughout the day, which I hate the interruption.
Some people are fine with it, but I literally hate working and then having to get up to pee and then come back to work.
26:37
All because, like, I did it.
Like, whatever you're about, you're about to talk about.
Like I did the gallon of day thing.
Like, I get it, I tried it and I did it for a while and then I was like, this is so inconvenient.
The other part of it is that you actually deplete your body of minerals, usually a faster rate than you put them back in.
And so a lot of people who actually drink a lot of water end up getting more cramps, feeling shittier, having headaches.
26:56
And I experienced all this stuff now.
I then adjusted in party, then I started adding minerals to the water that I was drinking and I was like, what am I doing?
I'm literally just adding shit so that I so I can drink more to then deplete myself to put the stuff back in that I'm depleting and I'm like, what am I accomplishing here?
And so the other part, the second the flip side of this coin of peeing more, is that while I slept, I have to get up once, twice 3 * a night.
27:20
And so then I'm thinking to myself, all right, I'm depleting my body of nutrients that I have to add back in throughout the day.
I'm interrupting my work throughout the day because I have to pee so much.
And then I'm getting way worse quality sleep so that I can feel good about my influencer status as being a hydration pro expert.
27:37
Nah.
And so I actually went completely the other direction.
And I only drink when I'm thirsty.
And when I drink, I drink enough to not be thirsty, not enough to be full.
And here's what's crazy, is that your body will adjust.
So what happens is when you drink more water, you pee more because your body's like, hey, we got a lot of water, we got to pee this out.
27:59
If you have less water, your body is like, I'm going to conserve water a little bit more.
And so then you pee less and you stay pretty hydrated still.
And what a lot of people don't know is that a lot of food has water in it.
And so if you, like, eat fruit, like if you eat a pound of fruit.
And I eat about a pound of fruit every day.
That's pound of water.
Like 90% of that's water.
28:15
And so like a lot of people think like you have to drink a gallon of water every day.
You might be getting half of this from your food and actually drinking a gallon and a half of water or two gallons of water every day if you take into account all the other things that have water in it.
And so I think the obsession about water for me again, if you're like, dude, I love drinking water, then drink water.
28:35
I don't care.
I am sharing what worked for me.
And maybe if you're somebody who pees a lot and it disrupts your day and it disrupts your sleep, then consider not drinking as much water.
And I'm telling you, if I get a good night's sleep where I don't get up once, it is worth me not drinking water by a mile and especially if you're over 30, it might be something you want to consider.
28:57
Give it a shot for a week and if you're like I miss my water, then like it won't affect me.
It doesn't affect me.
Me saying this doesn't affect you either.
Life hack #8 comma and that's OK.
This is more of an approach overall that I think has benefited me a lot in making content.
29:15
Approaching new opportunities, assessing risk, assessing failures, comparing myself to other people.
A lot of times.
I was saying this earlier today, but a lot of us have heard comparison is the thief of joy, and I actually think that's not true.
Let me explain.
29:32
Comparison is the ruler for measurement.
It's how you can see where you are compared to something else.
Like you have to be able to compare in order to see if there's a difference, so that you can improve something.
And so it would be like saying you should never get feedback.
You absolutely need to get feedback to improve.
And so the question is, how can I get feedback without feeling terrible about myself?
29:50
And so it's not that comparison is the thief of joy.
It's the judgment about your relative standing that is the thief of joy.
And so if somebody runs faster than I do, then I should be able to look at what they're doing, agree that they're running faster than I am, see what they have in their form that I don't have, and see if I can learn from them to get better where it becomes the thief of joys if I say I suck because I run slower than they do.
30:13
And that's where people, I think, get in trouble.
And so one of the monikers that is actually my team that turned me on to this because apparently I say it a lot, but it's just that I will have a negative situation and then say comma and that's okay.
And so it's like Warren Buffett is wealthy than I am comma.
30:29
And that's okay because it would be expected that he's be he'd be wealthy than me.
And are there things that I'm doing now so that I can create that kind of outcome for myself later.
Yes.
OK then I'm doing fine.
Right.
And so a lot of times we have these negative things that happen like you know we messed up this meals launch a few years ago.
30:46
And my the employee that I had at the time sent out the text for when the massive launch that I'd spent like half a year planning a day early sucked, lost me probably $1,000,000.
And I just thought to myself, like, immediately I was like, comma, And that's OK Why?
31:01
Because it's already done.
There's nothing else I can do about it.
And So what am I going to get from this now?
Well, I've got an amazing story that I've now told many times about this.
And I actually now created an incredibly loyal employee because I asked her, I said, hey, what do you think we should do?
She's like, well, you're going to fire me, right?
I was like, no, of course I'm not going to fire you.
Why would I do that?
She's like, well, I just messed up.
31:17
I was like, well, what's the likelihood you're going to mess up again and do that same mistake?
And she was like, well, I'm never going to make that mistake again.
I was like, well, then you're more valuable than you were before.
Why would I fire you now?
I was like, I just paid $1,000,000 to learn this.
I was like, now I'm completely confident you'll never mess up a a a text date and she was like never thought about it like that.
I was like, right, because you only fire someone because of the likely that they're going to repeat a mistake in the future, right?
31:36
And so again it was like, it gives me the space like whenever something bad happens it's like comma and that's okay space okay.
That means that I can still compare without having to judge negatively about my my relative standing.
And so, like, could that launch have gone better?
31:53
Absolutely.
Do I suck because the launch sucked?
No, I learned.
Because would it be, would it be reasonable to say that if you're going to grow a billion dollars in value that you're going to make $100 million of mistakes?
Yes.
So then I have to, that's going to come from somewhere.
And when I do make $1,000,000 or $30 million or $50 million mistake, then I have to learn from it.
32:12
And that's just part of my journey because at the end of the day, I'm going to give it all back because I can't take the money with me and I'm going to slide the chips back into the middle of the table and it's going to get recycled.
The whole point of the game is to learn.
And so how can I resent making mistakes when they're the only way, Not the only way, but they are among the best ways that you learn Lifehack #9.
32:28
I hang from elevated services in order to stretch my back and shoulders out.
I've been lifting for a long time, and the longer you lift, the more you realize that it's about staying in the game longer than it is about intensity.
Meaning, if you lift for 20 straight years, you're going to be bigger than anybody who lives really hard for a year.
32:44
And so the game switches to being about how can I keep training as hard as I can without hurting myself.
And so the more you train, the more you actually start wearing down joints.
It's just part of aging and it's kind of like opening and closing a drawer in your kitchen.
Like you do it 1000 times, you do 10,000 times.
Like it starts to wear down.
33:00
And so one of the things that can help reset posture that I found after, you know, zillions and honestly a lot of money spent with experts and what not, like the biggest bang for buck is I just hang from a pull up bar for three or 4 minutes, ideally before and after I train.
And there's a host of benefits in terms of stretching your back out, decompressing it, especially if you do any kind of back loading for any of the stuff you train, but also for like shoulder stuff.
33:21
So if you bench, you do overhead press, Lotto, raises, any kind of back work, all of that stuff like tightens up your shoulders, Then it starts going into your neck and so it just kind of resets.
All of the all of the stuff that I moved the wrong way while I trained gets reset every time I do that.
And it's been the probably the single biggest bang for a buck move that I've done in order to extend the longevity of how hard and long I can train life Hack #11, which is really a series of life hacks on how I manage my time, probably the one they were looking forward to or maybe the one I was looking forward to.
33:50
Time is the one thing that we can't get more of.
And so for me, it's my scarcest resource.
And so whatever we learn lessons, we pay for our lessons with time or money or both, and we tend to pay with the thing that we value the least.
And so, like, if you pay for all your stuff with time, it's because you value your time less than you value money.
34:07
Because if you can learn the same thing with money, then you should do it right if you have the money.
And so time has been something I continue to spend a lot of time thinking about because fundamentally, if you master time, you can master money because money is a compressed unit of time, right?
So like, everybody trades their time for money, which is the point I was making earlier in this is that like, you make money over a period of time and you trade a certain amount of life in order to accomplish it.
34:30
And you can look at that over the span of your life.
You spent 80 years to amass this much and you made X per unit of time.
And so money is really just our way of capturing that time that we spent to make some money and then trade it for someone else's time at most basic level.
34:46
And so people who are the wealthiest understand time better than anyone.
And so I've studied this a lot.
Subsection 11, I give myself permission not to reply to people.
This might be one that is relatively controversial, but all you have to do is take things to a logical extreme to prove the point, which is like okay.
Let's say you get famous enough that you get a million people who message you every minute and you literally could not respond to all of them.
35:06
What would you do?
You would come to terms of the fact that you can't respond to people.
And that means that if I can make that, if I can consolidate that or I can come to terms with that, at its most extreme, then I can come to terms with that today.
And so if there are people, especially as you start leveling up in business, that people just always reach out to you because they want something from you.
35:23
And it might be directly or indirectly, like they're just trying to maintain your relationship because they haven't asked for you in the future, which happens a lot.
I give myself permission to not respond.
And that's hard because that means that what are they going to think of you?
And again, this is how I do things, because the people who really know me know how to get in contact with me and the people who don't usually want something from me, I used to feel really guilty about it.
35:45
But I realized that being feeling guilty about it didn't serve me in any way.
And I took it to that logical extreme.
And I was like, okay.
At some point I'm going to have to come to terms with this, so I might as well come to terms with it now and start doing the benefits of that now.
And a big part of that is that one of the biggest time sucks is the cost of change or cost of switching tasks.
36:00
And so, like, if I'm doing something and then I get my phone buzzed, if I stop that and then address this and then come back, I lose a huge amount of efficiency.
And so for me, choosing not to respond and even just turning off my, you know, going to airplane mode or not accepting new messages has been something that's really helped me stay productive during the time that I have #2 under time with hacks is I think it's been really beneficial to have like a really simple kitchen timer or something for work and just something that's really visible, like right under my screen.
36:27
And I like that because when I have the impulse to check my phone, check slack, check whatever, I check social media, I just looked back down at the clock and it's like, if it's not done yet, I don't go check.
It's just like this one extra piece of accountability to hold me focused on the stuff that I do, #3 is that I control my environment.
36:46
So this is a little bit less of a time thing, but more of a work thing, which is that I'm a huge believer in cutting out all distractions.
So texting is part of it, but the other part of it is like literal physical distractions.
And so I think about it in terms of visual and I think about it in terms of audio.
So visually I almost always work in a closet without windows and I do that because like I want to stir out the window if it's a nice day.
37:07
And every time I do that, it detracts from my work.
And so we'd be like, well, isn't it nice to look out the window If that's what you want to do, go for it.
For me, I am more productive and my net long term benefit being more productive means more to me than the short term benefit of the window.
All right.
From an audio perspective, I actually AA double headphone.
37:25
So I actually put ear plugs in and then I put gunshot headphones on top and with that allows me to do those that there's always noises.
And what's crazy is like try this is that if you ever feel really stressed one day, like if you're like, man, I have a lot of anxiety.
Like there's a lot of stuff going on.
Like just try this, put earplugs in.
37:43
Put everyone's on top and you quite, you will literally feel the world get quieter.
And then all of a sudden you're like, it gets you into a little bit more of a meditative state because the only thing you can hear is your breath.
And so for me, when I work, like imagine this environment, I have this massive screen.
So the only thing I look at is my work.
38:00
I have no windows, I have a timer that's keeping me on task and I have two things stopping any noise from getting in.
And so I get my work per unit of time that I'm allocating to.
It goes up by a lot.
I'll give you life hack like many time life hack #3 is that I use grayscale on my phone.
38:15
There's now actually a lot of research that came out about this, but it decreases, I think, phone usage by 30 or 40 minutes a day on average for people, which is roughly like 20 ish, 25% of the average person's phone usage.
And so, like, I want to stack the chips in my favor.
As much as I can think, we all can agree that we'd like to use our phones less.
38:32
And so just making it black and white changes your behavior.
So think about this.
Colors change behavior.
So if you see an apple, that's red, it means eat.
If you see an apple that's black, it means don't eat, right?
If you see a light that's green, it means go.
If you see a light that's red, it means stop, right.
38:49
And so colors influence our behavior, the influence our mood, the influence what we do.
And so if we want to change our behavior on the phone that we can change what we're looking at, we change the colors.
And so just going to grayscale affects how frequently you will check your phone.
And I found myself not checking it nearly as much and staying on it for less time because it's less rewarding.
39:07
Oh, OK, Lifehack 11, subsection 4I schedule my time back to front and I start my day early with no meetings with all my priorities, and I'll explain what that means.
Right now this is probably the biggest one that you can use.
And like, if I think about the fewest things that I have done from a habit perspective that have given me the most gains in productivity, it's this.
39:27
So like this is the writer downer.
It's that I start my day as early as I can and I waste as little time as possible between when I wake up and when I start working now.
Wasting as little time as possible can mean different things for different people.
If you want to have 30 minutes with your wife in the morning, then is that wasting time?
39:43
Fuck no, right?
Probably the highest hour away time you have on your life, right.
I'm about being deliberate with the time that you have in the morning more than saying that this is what you need to do.
For me, I spend time with Layla in the morning.
We have coffee together and that's kind of where we set our intention for the day, what we're going to do, what she's going to do, etcetera.
39:59
Then after that I go right to work.
And for years, for the last decade, I have tried to As soon as I wasn't training sessions in the gym, I pushed as much as I could until the afternoon.
And it wasn't because I didn't want to work in the morning.
40:14
It's because I wanted to work more in the morning.
And I knew that as soon as the afternoon would come for me and the gyms it was I would start doing sales appointments and I'd meet with trainers and staff.
Once I, you know, leveled out of that to the turn around business, I would do all the ads and do all the creative and check the metrics in the morning and then the afternoons I would touch base with the sales team, touch base with the managers, all that kind of stuff.
40:31
Once we transition to gym lunch, I would do all of my heavy creative work in the morning and then I would do all my meetings in the afternoons and that's what I did for the first decade.
So that obviously worked.
I now have one more wrinkle on top of that, which has made it even better and even stronger for me.
I would wake up four or 5:00-ish in the morning and I would start working.
40:47
Back then I started working at five or six.
I think now I work probably like an I probably shifted my schedule about an hour later and I think it's because we go out more, we're up a little bit later, which net has actually been beneficial for me, but I would work from 5:00-ish in the morning until 1.
And so I had eight hours.
41:05
Like, I had a full work day before I would actually start working.
And so I got to do all the stuff that I, as an individual contributor, could do.
And then I could go into leader mode and do okay.
What do I need to be informed about?
What do I need to be consulted for?
What am I holding other people accountable for?
And then what am I responsible for?
41:20
Right.
And so that's my the second-half of my day.
And it would start at 1:00.
So my team always knew 1:00 is when he'll start his meetings.
And so they would start booking them.
So here's the hack, is that recently.
And Layla suggested this.
All right, So kudos to Layla.
And she was like, hey, why don't we start booking Alex back to front?
41:38
So meaning instead of saying start booking him at one for his appointments, what would end up happening is let's say there's a day I booked out from 1:00 until like 3:30 or four.
Well, it's like now I still have this gap in between then and dinner.
That's not large enough that I can really do a ton of stuff.
And I'm probably not going to get back into deep work for like 90 minutes, which you could.
41:55
I just don't.
And so we now say Okay, when is the end of the day for him, which let's say Layla are going to go do our walk and then we'll go to dinner at, you know, whatever, it's six or seven.
I'm not saying that's when we do it, but I'm saying if I were to do that, I have my end of day cut off.
42:11
And then we say Okay, well, he has three meetings.
And so they're all 30 minutes.
And so that means that the first meeting is 4/30, Nexus 5, Nexus 5:30.
And that means that from 5:00 AM until 4:30, I have nothing on my calendar.
And so with that, I have all the time to go really deep on stuff like this, writing the book, dealing with a, you know, a complex model that I need to build out for an investment or whatever.
42:35
And that has now taken what was already a great strategy for me and just expanded even more because now my total utilization per unit of time has gone up even more.
Because now basically from the moment I wake up until the moment Layla and I both stopped working, I am fully optimized for work.
And so you might not be able to set up your schedule like that.
42:54
I'm sharing how I have scheduled myself and you might be able to take pieces of it to apply it to your life and then maybe in time get to the point where you can have a little bit more control of your calendar where people will cater themselves to your times.
The other thing I do is that I give myself permission to demand how I want to be communicated with, and what that means for me is I really dislike video and audio messages.
43:16
And so by the way, what was the nation?
Please don't send me audio messages, I'll never listen to them.
And the reason for that is because audio and video are convenient for the sender and inconvenient for the receiver.
And So what happens is people click record and then they decide and figure out what they're trying to say while they're sending it.
43:34
What I would like people to do out of respect for my time is that you think about what you're going to say ahead of time and then you send me the bullets.
Because if I can, and this is if you've ever respond, if you've ever seen me respond to anything that's video or audio, I just say send bullets.
And then usually you can take a 3 minute waste of time and put it into three things.
43:50
Or like, just wanted to invite you to my podcast and then I'd be like, cool, I can do it, or I'm busy or I can't do it or whatever.
And that allows me to make quick decisions and not take 3 minutes to listen to somebody, not decide what they actually wanted to say.
And everybody on my team, especially on the company side, knows that I don't want to communicate via audio.
44:08
Now the most convenient method to communicate is that you send audio and you receive bullets because it's convenient for you.
But I out of respect for everybody else, I send bullets and I receive bullets because I also, I hate inefficient communication and I would rather be very deliberate about what I'm saying and say fewer things that get the point across.
44:31
Which is why, if you've ever seen my books and all the stuff that I have out there, it's like I want to compress as much information into the smallest package as possible at the lowest grade reading level so that I have the highest comprehension from my the person I'm trying to send this to.
And so that is one of the things that I've done to save myself time and also teach people around me how to communicate with me most effectively.
44:50
And I think that it's not about what I do.
It's about if you have certain, like SOPS or standard operating procedures that you know, you're like, you know what, I hate it when people do this or I hate it when people do this.
Then if you own a business or even if you don't own a business, you can say, hey, if you don't own it, say, hey, I'll communicate whatever way you want.
45:07
Just so you know, I'm more of an audio learner or I'm more of a visual learner.
I'm more of a reader.
It helps me to do this because I end up just translating what you have.
I will absolutely do that if what you want me to.
But if you have no preference, it would mean the world to me if.
And that way you can train teammates, train even superiors to communicate with you in a way that you're most effective.
45:25
And so, like, this is just how I can help you more time management, Tip #5, double dipping time.
And what I mean by that is I like, I think they call it net time, which is like no extra time.
There's different ways of saying it, but basically where you can get multiple things done at the same time effectively.
And so an easy example is like, I like doing meals with people that I work with because I have to eat anyways.
45:47
And so if I can eat with them, then we get to like build rapport.
I get to answer questions, I get to educate, talk more about the vision, understand what's going on in their departments while we both have to eat either way, right?
Just like a very simple thing.
So I think to myself, like, what are all the things that I have to do no matter what?
And is there a way that I can do them with other people or do them in a way that I can leverage it to get more out of it?
46:07
And so a different example would be like, okay, I can work out with my team and that gives me three things.
One is like I get my workout in two I get to spend time with them.
And #3 I can capture to make content and so like the more opportunities I have that can double dip or triple dip on time, I just get no extra time.
46:24
I get more for the time I put in, which means that it is leverage.
Like I put the same input in and I get more output.
Time management tip #6 is how to create new habits.
So there is so much more research that I could possibly handle in one little quick thing, but I'll just give you 2 little tips.
46:43
One is making it as easy as possible to do.
And So what that is for me is that I don't try and create new habits.
I try and Daisy chain it onto an existing habit.
And so when I was teaching people to like start taking supplements when I was selling prestige labs for a supplement company of the gyms, what I would do is I'd say, hey, I need you to take this in the morning.
47:02
What do you do?
First thing you wake up and some blades would be like, I wash my face.
Some people would be like, I drink coffee.
Whatever it was, I'd be like, OK, so I want you to do is like, do you have like a face wash to put in the morning?
They're like, yeah, I'm like, I want you to take your AM pills and put it right next to it.
Right.
And I take a piece of tape, I stick it on top and I write 2 be like, you need to take two of these in the morning.
47:20
And then I was like, OK, do you always drive the same car to the gym?
And they might say yes.
And I'd be like, OK, So what I want you to do is I want you to have your pre, your intra and your post in the car.
Leave it in the car.
Why?
Because you're always gonna have it with you when you go to the gym.
And so that way, like, you won't forget it, cuz it'll literally be with you.
And I'm like, OK, cool, got it.
47:36
And I was like, OK, what do you do at night?
And it's like, well, I brush my teeth before I go to bed.
It's like, OK, well then I want you to take three of these and put it right next to your toothpaste.
Like right before you put the water on to wet your toothbrush.
I was like, put a cup in, take the pills, swallow it, and then start brushing your teeth.
So like, I want to Daisy chain the new things onto the old things.
47:54
And it's much easier to start new habits that way because you're not actually starting new habits, you're just continuing habits you already have.
And when you do it that way, you actually, the habit itself hopefully should reward you over time.
And then it becomes self reinforcing.
And so the tip #2 is like, is there a way that I can create a reward for doing this?
48:12
Right.
So for me, I've, I've always been a random teeth brusher.
Like I brush them throughout the day or whenever I like, remember it.
And I was like, I really want to do this at the same time every day.
And I've, I've struggled.
I told you about the sunscreen thing earlier.
And so I actually heard a comedian, Jim Jeffries, talk about how he pees and brushes teeth at the same time at night.
48:31
Right.
And so I was like, you know what?
I pee every night no matter what before I go to bed.
I was like, I'll just brush my teeth when I do that.
And so I was like, I'm already going to the bathroom.
And so all I did was just Daisy chain in brushing my teeth and it was no extra time because I'm sitting there peeing anyways and so I got to brush my teeth at be at the same time.
48:49
That may seem graphic, but whatever I try and think, how long are the things that I take to do that I do no matter what?
And how many other things can I tuck into those activities?
And that has been one of the easier ways for me to change behaviors or add new behaviors in that I wasn't doing before.








0:00
Real quick wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
0:19
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The objective of the game is to keep playing the game is to stay in the game and not quit.
Then you need to look at your business and think how can I make these customers more valuable?
0:36
Me, and by extension, what do I need to do for them in order to make them more valuable?
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:52
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
Layla and I were having this conversation and it was basically that all of the gyms that we've seen and we've worked with over a long time, not even just gyms, just people who've been marketing online for a while, complain about the same thing, right?
1:12
They complain about the same things.
Like, man, Facebook's not as as cheap as it used to be.
And I wanted to make this one video because I think it's incredibly important.
Like, you just need to get over it.
You just need to get over it.
Like, it's never going to be as cheap as it was.
And guess what?
1:28
It's never going to be as cheap as it is today, because tomorrow it's going to be more expensive.
And so, like, you can either continually whine and complain about things that you cannot control, or you can accept the fact that it's a marketplace, it's an auction, and it will continue to rise.
And if you look at Google and you look at history, whenever new platforms open up, they're widely under priced attention and eyeballs.
1:48
And so you can make a massive killing even if you suck at business.
And the reality is that a lot of people who got in on this game early sucked at business, but they just happen to be in on it early.
And so they could make money on penny clicks, because it's not hard to make money on penny clicks, right?
2:04
But when you have $10 clicks, all of a sudden the game changes because you have to make 100 times more money, right?
Or whatever the math is 1000 times never it is right and so.
Right now, if you're like, man, I wish, I wish Facebook ads were cheaper, man, I wish leads were cheaper.
What you need to focus on is what you can actually control, which is the monetization of the customer, right?
2:25
We've been able to continually spend 4 years for six straight years, I've tried to outspend everyone in every market I've ever been in, whether it was an intellectual space or was a local geography.
And the reason we've been able to do this because we focus on how much the lifetime value of the customer was because that was under our control.
2:41
And so right now, if at your gym you're only selling workouts and you have no other ways of monetizing a customer, then you were losing out.
Because The thing is, is the water is going to rise, right?
Your ability to spend money and capture leads and buy attention and buy eyeballs is going to continually go down.
So get the fuck over it, right?
2:57
Stop whining.
It's not going to get better, right?
And so like, it's like I just, I'm I'm being purposely harsh because it's you just need to accept that that's the reality that we live in and if you want things to improve.
Like if you want things to improve, like you're just what is it wishing on a star or whatever it is?
3:16
And what I will say is, if you can remind yourself right now of the feeling that you have of like, man, I wish I had spent more when he was cheap, right?
Remember that.
Because that is when the next thing that comes along, you need to double down.
And believe it or not, you still need to double down on Facebook ads.
3:32
Why?
Because it's still cheaper today than it's going to be tomorrow, and it's still the best price stuff, best priced attention that's out there from a targeted standpoint, right?
So like, if you think about a big picture, like if I can get a 5 to 1 return on something today and I could get a 20 to one return on that same thing two years ago, is it still a good investment today?
3:52
Yes.
Is it as good?
No.
What's my alternative?
Shrugging, Right.
And So what you're focused on as a business should be always improving your mousetrap, should always be improving the actual business so that you can buy and afford eyeballs on any platform independent of the maturity level.
4:07
If the only game that you can play is for penny clicks, it means that you're going to be a penny stock type business owner, right?
You're not going to be able to play with the big boys.
You can't play with the blue chip guys.
Most of those guys wait for five years, for 10 years before a platform even matures, before they're like, OK, we're going to get into this because they're in boardrooms and they're like, we're not sure if it's worth putting the attention towards opening this new platform.
4:32
You guys love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check on my YouTube channel, it's.
Absolutely free to check that out if that's what you are into, and if not, keep enjoying the show.
4:53
Right.
And so, so like, right now, if you could only survive in that environment, it's because your business sucked.
Right.
If you could only do LBO's and only afford getting leads for $3, and if it was more than $3, you only had $10 leads and at $10 you priced out, You've shady business or you don't know how to do math.
5:08
It's one of the two, right?
And so you have to be less emotional.
You have to be able to let your math do the dictation right.
Like this is a ME soft toss and you know what we have.
But like if you have a diagnostic selling process and you're selling one-on-one accountability, nutrition on top of it, you can sell your membership for $425.00 a month.
5:26
How do I know that?
Because we're all doing it in gym lunch.
Can you get $1000 upfront on average upfront ticket?
Yes.
Do you think that would help you in your acquisition costs?
Probably.
If your business isn't doing that, is that going to be Are you going to be beat down by someone else who can?
Yes.
Why?
Math, right?
Because they can continue to play, right?
5:42
And so when the sandbox gets filled, or when the level of the water rises and only the best players stay because they can keep swimming, because they spent the time to build the mousetrap that built the highest lifetime value per customer because they were in the end providing the most value.
Those are the guys that are continuing to stay and continue to play.
6:00
And so if the objective of the game is to keep playing the game is to stay in the game and not quit, then you need to look at your business and think, how can I make these customers more valuable?
And by extension, what do I need to do for them in order to make them more valuable?
All right.
And that's where you need to add the intangibles.
6:16
Because if you're only selling workouts, you're only selling your quote community.
Guess what, take a ticket.
So is everybody else.
All right.
So if you want to stand out so that you can provide more value.
Look at the things that like, I mean look at what we're doing, You know what I mean like this is free content, you know I mean look at what we're doing, sell 101 accountability, sell 101 nutrition, sell it in a duration based place.
6:36
So sell them on to goal.
Sell them for 40 weeks upfront, paid in full.
Right.
That's how you're going to sell a big ticket.
And that's how if one out of five people who walks in your door is going to buy a $3000 thing from you, that means that per show up, you're making $500 per show, right?
And if you know that you're getting one out of three leads in the door to show, that means you can spend 150, two, $100 a lead and still break even on the acquisition and still have the lifetime value of the customer to collect.
7:02
And so if you don't have that, you're just going to get beat by someone who does because they're going to be able to continue to say and play.
And then you're going to be looking around me like, wow, wow, Facebook guys don't work anymore.
Oh, the ad platform doesn't work anymore.
Believe it or not, this story has already happened, right?
Like, before this, it was direct mail.
Before that, sorry, Before this was Google.
7:18
Before that was direct mail.
Before that was newspaper ads.
Like it just kid.
Before that was catalogs.
Like, it just kept going back and back and back.
And so if you're just a student history when one of these things open up.
Pound it, drive it as hard as you possibly can.
Ride that thing right?
And you honestly should still ride it.
7:35
And if you can't right now because your business sucks, right, it's because you haven't figured out a way to monetize your customers properly, right?
It means you're not providing enough value.
So instead of lamenting, instead of complaining, instead of being upset, instead of stopping your feet and pouting and being like, well, it doesn't work anymore, do what you can control.
7:52
Figure out how you can find more value to your customers.
Figure out how you can make warning more money upfront from the people walking your door so you can liquidate acquisition costs so that you can continue to stay and pay.
Hopefully, if your goal is to help people over a long period of time, build something that lasts.
It's a game.
You're going to have to clock her anyways, and the platform doesn't matter where you buy eyeballs.
8:12
Doesn't matter.
Whether it's Facebook, whether it's Google, whether it's YouTube, whether it's whatever, doesn't matter.
The only thing that matters is your mousetrap.
And if the mousetrap is right, you can buy wherever you want for as long as you want.

I didn't understand how to make a billion dollars for a very, very long time.
And the first misunderstanding is that you don't make a billion dollars to become a billionaire.
You own stuff that's worth a billion dollars to become a billionaire.
Let me walk you through how I used to think this worked.
So phase one high school, Alex, was like, OK, in order to be a billionaire, I have to make a billion dollars every year, which is ridiculous.
0:22
But that's what I thought the second phase.
I was like, oh, silly high school Alex, that's not how you make a billion dollars.
All you have to do is take home a billion, $2 billion before taxes over your lifetime.
And so then third season, which is where I'm at right now and you don't make it, you own it.
So let's say you own a business that is making $10 million a year top line, all right.
0:42
Now half of that is your profit.
If this company is worth 10 times its earnings and I'll explain why that that why a company like this might be worth 10 times its earnings after taxes.
I take home you know three good for me next year cuz I'm in Mosey Nation and we focus on the main asset that we have our business and I go from $5,000,000 a year in profit to $6 million a year in profit.
1:00
Doesn't sound like a huge win, right?
It's like hey, I added 1,000,000 bucks at the bottom line.
Cool.
This is great.
Well, if we have a 10X multiple, then something I own went from being worth 50 million to being worth 60 million.
Now I own 100% of that thing, and I just got something that appreciated by $10 million that I didn't pay tax on.
1:17
Wait a second.
What I got out of the business only went from three to three and a half million after taxes, right?
Six at 40%, you get 3 1/2 to take home.
I only made an extra $500,000 after taxes this year.
Now you made an extra $10 million after taxes because the thing that you own appreciated by $10 million.
1:34
And that's the thing that I didn't understand for a very long time.
And so now let's zoom out.
You want to be a billionaire again?
It's not by me side hustling my way to a billion.
Like Zuckerberg didn't have Airbnb's.
He was flipping on the side while he's building Facebook.
What did you do to become a billionaire?
He built Facebook.
1:51
If you have the opportunity to spend half of your time obsessing about your passive income rather than saying, huh, I wonder if I could take my $5,000,000 profit business, focus all my attention on it, and make it into a $6 million profit business.
And then all of a sudden I just added $10 million to my net worth.
2:07
And so this is how billion dollars actually is made.
You have something that makes between 80 and $100 million in EBITDA or fancy word for profit that you get a multiple on.
And usually companies of that size tend to trade 15 times earnings, like if you look at the S&P, right.
So you'd really only need somewhere in the area of like $70 million in EBITDA to be a billionaire because you own the company.
2:28
So it means that you have to make a little bit more than $1.3 million, one point $5 million per week in take home, which I know that that sounds crazy, but like you have to think in increments, like imagine how much you made five years ago as an entrepreneur.
How crazy small does that feel to you now?
Because you've leveled up.
And so as much as whatever number I just said to you might sound like a lot, 5 years from now, you might be in shooting distance.
2:47
And so it's really just about understanding, like, how do I reverse engineer what has to happen?
And if you want to be a billionaire, it's like, OK, well, how to make a million dollars, $1.5 million a week in profit?
Well, if I'm running a 30% March in business, I got to make $6 million a week.
There's 52 weeks, I got to make $300 million top line.
OK.
So then you can start actually putting tangible goals to this.
3:05
I want to become a billionaire.
You become a billionaire by owning something worth a billion dollars.
If you really want to be smart about it, don't shoot for a billion.
Here's why you want to shoot for 10 billion or 50 billion.
And I know this is going to sound crazy, but realistically, I would never imagine trying to pursue an opportunity that was capped at $100 million a year.
3:23
You would have to think about opportunities that one, were not limited by your time.
Two could serve a very big marketplace.
Three had very high gross margins And four you'd think probably on a very, very long time horizon.
And then all of a sudden you're thinking like a billionaire.
The goals we have matter matter more because of how we measure them and the increments in which we used to build them more than what the actual goal itself is.
3:42
And so when someone tells me they have a goal to make six figures, what happens is they're going to think that six figures is the cap and they're going to break it down in a tiny itty bitty units.
And they're going to basically say 100% of my effort equals $100,000 and they're going to measure in tiny units and then they're going to do what, 100% effort and they're going to be like I was at 94 this year.
3:58
But if you thinking about making $10 million, then you can you'll thinking like, OK, for me to make $10 million, I got to sell, let's say a $10,000 thing and I got to sell 1000 of them.
OK, that means three $10,000 things a day.
And if I those one out of three calls, that means I have to take nine calls a day.
4:14
Okay.
Well, how much do I have to spend to get a call for this thing?
All of a sudden, you start thinking in a much bigger increment.
And if you're like, I don't know what I could sell for $10,000, well then you got to figure out something that makes someone else $100,000, and you can sell something that's worth 10.
The reason you're not making enough money is because you don't know how to provide enough value.
4:30
The reason that, like a lot of the wealth in the world sits with financiers just because they know how to take someone passively and they can say, hey man, just give me a billion dollars and I'll just make you 10% a year on it.
And they know how to make 15% a year.
And they make that extra 5 on a billion and they take home 50 million a year.
4:45
And they're like, works for me.
If you can approach the problem that way, you'll start thinking more along the lines of the people that I think you're trying to emulate.
You don't make it.
You own it.
You get paid for what you do.
You, it returns on what you own.
That $50 million business that we talked about before, 10,000,005 million profit 10X, why would someone pay 10X for something you're like I wouldn't pay $50 million for business that's making five.
5:06
Let me tell you why you would.
So if that business went from 5:00 to 6:00 and then went 20% again because that was a 20% growth, it went to 7.2 and then 20% again would be 8.6 and 20% again would be 10.2 and keep going.
If you added all those things up, you'd be at fortyish million in earnings over the next five years.
5:25
Remember we bought it for 50, but wait, now we still own the thing and it's making twelve and a half million in profit.
Wait, if we just applied 10X and realistically at this point it probably closer to 12X, but let's just still apply 10X for this.
Now we have $125 million thing that we paid 54 that already paid us 40 back and this is where it gets even juicier to buy that $50 million thing.
5:45
I didn't write a check for 50.
I wrote a check for 15 and I took a loan for 35.
Huh.
And so then at the end of this whole thing, I put my 15,000,000 down.
I pay back my loan for the 35, so only have $10 million left over.
Then I gotta, I gotta pay back.
And now I get 100% of that 125 million minus my original 10 because I covered 5 of it from from the cash flow.
6:07
Oh, I should meet $120 million.
That's why people do it.
The smart money, if you want to sell to institutional investors, they think that way.
And so you have to think that way about the assets that you own and the assets that you're building.








0:00
Switching from business to investing is a massive change in mindset because when you're in business, you're used to selling all that, but when you're doing deals, it's actually about trying to get to know.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:20
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good So.
Acquisition.com, obviously a big shift from from Jim launch, like I love your play right now is like just create value, value, value, value, value and basically have the natural like people reach out.
0:38
And then where you just have your, your picking, what are you focusing on with acquisition.com as far as like if you had the ideal company to invest in, what would that look like?
So an ideal company to invest in, you know for us is going to be doing you know 2 to $10 million in EBITDA.
0:54
They're going to have a founder that wants to scale.
It's a big one.
A lot of times people think they want to scale, but then, like, they don't actually want to scale.
You know what I mean?
Like, they double or triple their income.
And then they're like, oh, wow, good.
Like, we had a company that we tripled the the profit for.
And then all of a sudden, like, the the CEO is golfing every day.
1:12
And I was like, bro, what's up?
He's like, dude, I'm making more money they've ever made my entire life.
I'm like, yeah, but like, I'm not in this for this triple.
I'm in this for a 20X or 50X.
Like, that's why I want to do this, right?
Like, we want to do big stuff.
And so it's like they have to have big eyes.
They have to have big dreams of what they want to accomplish.
1:28
They have to be coachable.
And that's a big one because, and this is actually probably one of the hardest ones to find, is that anyone who's achieved a certain level of success has some level of confidence that they're good.
But the problem is, like, the difference between and you, you can appreciate this.
They're just doing a million a month, and 10 million a month is oceans.
1:46
You know what I mean?
It's.
And they're like I'll just do 10 times what I'm currently doing.
It's like not because if it were that you wouldn't be stuck right now.
And so they have to like is there, there's really two aspects this.
So like I'll rewind real quick, there's the business component and there's the founder, right, Like who are we doing the deal with now?
2:01
For us the founder matters a lot more than to like a traditional private equity fund and because traditional private equity firms exclusive almost exclusively by majority, we sometimes buy majority.
But if we buy majority it's like a micro like you know we're like 51 you know what I mean?
And that might be because we have some sort of brand element that we're tying into it whatever reason, right.
2:19
Like of all the holdings we only have one majority.
We will probably do more because that one's doing really, really well.
But most of our deals are like you know 334951.
You know I mean that's kind of the range that we we do.
We have a couple early deals that did at 20, but there's the founder in the business.
The founder is coachable.
2:36
They are have big dreams.
We like actually hanging out with them because this is like, if I don't look forward to talking to somebody, like, to me that's a big red flag.
Like if during the process any of us have any hesitations like we have it.
We have this thing called the five flags, which is like, if any of these five red flags come up, we stop the deal immediately.
2:52
So we don't need like 3 strikes, we just need one.
And so we just try and codify who's looking at these things, like if there's any kind of dishonesty or any discrepancy between numbers, if we feel like they have like a culture of like fear within their organization, those are all like signs for us that we're like okay.
This is probably not a good fit on the business side.
3:10
It's the more traditional stuff like.
I wanna dive a little bit deeper into cuz you said you wanna have somebody that has big goals, not someone when they triple they're gonna go be on the golf course.
So obviously that can't be motivated by money.
Cuz both you and I know that like, money is essentially oxygen, right?
3:27
Like once you have enough.
It no longer motivates or pushes or whatnot.
So like, how do you identify the person that really is able to be driven past money, past accomplishment, past you know, a certain level of achievement.
3:42
Where, how are you identifying that person?
So it's usually in the language patterns that they'll present with.
And so I'll give you a couple different examples that are different but still would accomplish the same thing.
So some of them might be like I really want to create an amazing place to work that would be 1.
Where like that's going to continue to grow.
3:59
Like they might want to continue to get more and more people in and create an amazing place to work.
If they said I want to change this industry.
It's like if you want to change an industry, it's like you have to have a big vision for it if you want to change your community.
Same thing like if you want to change the local area, like again, big, big impact.
Some of them, it's like, I just want to do something big.
4:16
Like their desire is to see what they're capable of.
Like they they want to test their own metal.
And so the whole point of the game for them is to continue to move the bar, right?
That would be another example.
And some of them just straight up say like, I do want to make a ton of money.
And to me that's fine as long as that's true, right?
4:32
Like they're like, I want to get to a billion dollar company.
That's badass.
Like, that's fine.
I totally respect that.
But it's that they actually want that and they're already have all their their personal needs filled.
Like if they already have their monetary needs filled and they still say that to me, I'm like, OK, this guy wants to run.
So those are like the positive flags.
4:49
What are the red flags that you see of like somebody that will be satisfied?
Usually they just talk in small numbers.
They talk in small numbers and this is from the business perspective.
The majority of our flags are actually about the founder.
So, like, the red flags for the business are, you know, just like, OK is if it's going down, if it's not profitable, if we don't see a path for growth, if it feels too complicated, if the founder has like shiny objects syndrome.
5:13
So like, they can't focus on one thing.
They're like, oh, yeah, I've got this other business I want to start.
This actually happens all the time.
Somebody comes to us and they're like, I've got this business I want to partner with you on.
I've got these other three businesses too, and I'm like, close all those.
And I'll work with you on this.
And so it's like, and sometimes guys will do that and then they come back.
I'm like, this guy's in it.
Other guys are like, I can't do that because of XY&Z and I'm like, cool, then go chase 5 rabbits and hope you catch 1.
5:33
And so, like, are they focused?
Are they coachable?
Are they honest?
And all honesty is like, you know, a lot of people think about it in terms of like black and white, like honest or dishonest.
But it's really like, how honest are you?
Like if I hear a lot of exaggeration at all points in time, like everything just seems to be rounded, You know what I mean?
Like, we're amazing.
5:48
Everything's like, if you don't know where the bodies are buried, you're not close enough.
Like you should know where the bodies are buried in every single department, right.
And that's actually one of my limits tests as a CEO.
Not that I am anymore.
But when I was CEO, if I don't know what's going wrong in every department, I'm too far away.
6:06
If something's just good, it means I don't know what's going on.
Cuz of course there should always be opportunities for imprudence.
I gotta know what's happening.
So if I hear that kind of language, those are red flags.
And then just the big one up, just they talk in small numbers in terms of growth and they talk in small numbers in terms of the ultimate size that they want to grow the thing because like I can't make you believe more than you do.
6:23
You bring up a great point of not only knowing where the bodies are are buried in different departments, but being willing to admit where the bodies are buried, right?
I think there's an aspect of business owners where they want to lie to themselves, whether you're in sales, whether you actually own the business, whatever.
6:40
You're managing a department, right?
Like one of the most important things.
In order to enact change, in order to improve.
And it is actually being able to admit we're weak here, we suck at this, this, that and the other like getting real right?
6:56
You know, non self deceived right?
Self deception I think is like the greatest downfall of any CEO, any manager, any salesperson, right?
Like I I I'm sure you'd agree with me on that if they're like microcontrollers right.
Like they they want to micromanage everything.
7:11
Like that's another example of like the because the equal opposite right there's the pendulum like on one side they're too far away they're too disconnected.
The other one is they're too close to everything.
And I want to make a point that I think it is worth making.
But they also have to have realistic expectations of value and they have to be willing to have a smaller slice of a bigger pie like a lot of people think they want that until they're like they want to have the the round shape of the pie, right.
7:33
And I know you probably can can preach to this more than anyone.
That like the more people who are trying to build something, the bigger it can get, right?
Like you didn't have 100% circle of your circle.
And guess what?
Elon Musk has 20% of Tesla, right?
But that still made sense.
7:48
It made sense for him to give 80% to other people to help him build it, and he can still become the wealthiest man on the planet.
And so like, having to shift that belief in someone is really hard if someone doesn't already come in believing it.
Like I'm willing to part with the chunk of the business in order to have a 10 times or 100 times more valuable thing, right?
8:08
Like if they don't believe that.
And then part of it is also unrealistic expectations of valuation.
So this is actually a pretty big one.
So they hear about your exit, right?
They hear about my exit and they think, oh, that multiple applies to my $2,000,000 profit, you know, company that is basically me with a couple of helpers running around.
8:28
And if I die tomorrow, the whole thing dies.
Like, no, it doesn't apply to that because.
And here's here's a stat that might astound your audience for businesses doing less than 10 million in sales and 2 million in bottom line.
All right.
So those are the two hours top line and two million bottom line.
8:45
The average, like the median trading value is 2 1/2 X on profit.
That's the median.
All right.
So like that's, that's the, that's the middle right and over 80% depending on the source.
So this is SBA.
So Small Business Administration is, when it comes out with these stats, have a huge component of seller financing.
9:03
And so that 2 1/2 X is also not cash like that 2 1/2 X is the total enterprise value and the person who's bought, like.
So like, let's say you did a hypothetical deal with somebody doing $1 million a year.
OK, So one in profit, All right.
So $1 million a year, 12 months.
And let's say they got the median valuation.
9:19
So the person who's buying is adding no value.
They're just buying the asset.
They're coming in to do nothing, right?
Because that's who is buying this, right?
If you and I might want to buy something, I would expect to get a discount on something because I'm going to be doing a little work to grow the thing, right?
Like I don't want to pay you to work.
9:35
So the idea is like, OK, let's think through this million dollars, 2 1/2 X is the is the median and let's say 90% of them have seller carry.
OK, well, if you're selling half the business, then now we're at 1.25 and let's say and you have a seller carry.
So you you might only get a few $100,000 for half the business.
9:51
Now again, the part of it is that people then in that situation and this is where deals don't happen, is that they're like I'm worth at least 10.
It's like you're not, bro.
Like you're not because you can't walk away.
Like you could walk away from business and it still grows.
10:08
Like Jim launch continues to grow and Alex is on a podcast with Chris right now, right.
The idea is that you have to build an asset that can grow on its own and that takes time.
And The thing is, is that people are really impatient or they feel like they're getting, I mean and to be fair, that's the nature of deals is that both people have to agree, right.
10:25
But like, that's that's a big one, is that a lot of founders will have all realistic expectations about how valuable the company that built is because they're measuring it based on the effort they put in rather than the output of what's been created.
Yeah.
It's so interesting how many people are self deceived on on the actual total enterprise value.
10:42
I had a guy give me an offer the other day for he's got an Instagram profile with a ton of followers and he's netting like 350 a year and everything like that, and he wanted something like 5 or 6 multiples on a social media platform.
10:58
Like a social media account that is dependent on him as the face.
And it's just like, dude, what in what world is this worth?
5 to 6 multiples?
You're you're crazy dude.
Like like you get out of.
Here, man.
And it's so amazing, like how selfdeceived people are.
11:16
Dude, I want to, I want to dive into to one other thing that you kind of mentioned and I know that you're phenomenal at, is like walk me through.
How you get to know right?
How do you tell yourself no and get away from like the shiny objects?
And how do you keep digging in the same hole that is boring or what not Like?
11:36
What are the mental exercises for you as an entrepreneur that keep you disciplined, to continue to say no and only say to the yes to the one thing that is giving you the most value?
I think that this is probably like if there's a single trade of entrepreneurs that can make them successful, It is if they can master this.
11:54
And it's also probably the hardest one to master because we're the best people at deceiving ourselves when it comes to this.
Like we convince ourselves that this new opportunity is going to be worth more.
And there's a lot of natural, you know, followup questions, like when do you know when to pivot?
Like when you know you've tried enough, like when you need to change your idea, things like that.
I would say that post product market fit alright.
12:11
So this is a big caveat and This is why advice gets hard because it depends on the season, right?
If you don't have product market fit, meaning people don't want to buy your thing, right?
Right.
Or they don't like to sing yourself, then yeah, you should iterate, keep trying new things until eventually you start getting buyers.
At that point, you lock it.
And then you say, if I only did this thing for the next 10 years, would I get this outcome?
12:32
And if that outcome is a yes, then anything that's not that, like you already have the deal with yourself that you're willing to get that big outcome.
So like for Aqua, I mean imagine the amount of opportunities that we get right now that are like dude, could you like dude if you built this thing and and like dude people are like dude, you should sell of course.
12:51
And you know what?
If I did, I probably would make more than long horse creators.
So like if I did that but with that detract from the one thing that mattered most, right?
And I think most times the focus is that people can't say no to the fast money.
And by doing that, they say no to the big money, which is the long money, which is the money you got to waste for, right?
13:12
Because like, no big things love that are built fast.
Like, I'm very convinced about this.
Like almost everybody goes to this like five to seven years of eating period where you just don't, it doesn't feel like you're making progress.
And as tacky as this may sound like your overarching strategy is hope, like unshakable faith that it's going to happen, but being paranoid about the present that it's going to die, right.
13:34
So it's, it's and I think Jim Collins, he has some sort of just position that he said more elegantly than me, but it's maintaining both those things.
And so for me, my ultimate vision is that like acquisition.com compounds into a billion or or higher company and we do it doing it our way, right.
13:50
And like that's that's what I want to do.
And whether it takes five years, 10 years, 20 years, like it's a game that I'm I'm dedicated to playing And anything like I know the plan that we set out for because we spent 18 months thinking of all the different things we could do, What do we want to do?
We said we want to combine social media and investing that was the big that was like something old and something new.
14:08
And we figured if we create proprietary deal flow and do significant value add to businesses that we could buy a good rates and we could add value to them too because typically investing is 1 or the other either you buy really cheap like that's warm.
Buffett's strategy is buy really cheap right now he says wonderful companies at fair prices whatever.
14:25
Or you you've got somebody who's like a really niche like if you bought solar stuff but you can't cuz you're have you're not compete.
But yeah like if you if you didn't have your not gonna be like you going into a solar business it's like well you have expertise there you'll immediately be able to grow right.
And so you don't even need to buy at a great multiple because you know, if you 10 exit, it doesn't really matter what you bought it at, cuz you're gonna, it's gonna be worth way more, right?
14:43
And so for us, we try to combine both those things to create an investment thesis.
And the problem with and and like you're you're in the season now, right, is that switching from business to investing is a massive change in mindset.
Because when you're in business, you're used to selling all day, right?
15:00
It's selling and promoting and selling and selling and selling and selling.
But when you're doing deals, it's actually about trying to get to know which is so counter everything that we've, like you and I have had ingrained in our minds.
It's like, God, I want this person to say yes.
But The thing is, is that like if you keep upping the price and changing the terms, then you can get someone to say yes, but it might be a terrible deal for you.
15:21
And so like it no longer is about yeses.
It's about, you know, coming to agreements within a defined box that you defined for yourself that like this is a deal that makes sense for me, right.
And so that's been probably one of the the hardest transitions for me, going from business owner to investor, but in investment vehicles also doesn't give you the quick hits that business does.
15:40
Like you and I could rattle the sales team and then boom, we'd see sales hours later, you know, coming in same day.
I can't rattle the deal team and then like get a deal closed, right?
Like it just doesn't work that way, right.
And so there's this huge lag on when we start doing stuff and we start seeing the results.
15:56
And so you think about like even improving a process, it's like it might take 90 days or six months to get through from beginning to end on the deal.
And then we don't even know how the deal went.
It's going to take us another year or two before we really even see like, OK, this was a good deal.
16:12
This was a good company, this was a good pick.
So your feedback loops are so long, you have to figure out games to play in the meantime so that you can let the big machine work.
And so like right now we have a snowball.
But I mean, investor years, we're like, I did my first deal in 20 in summer 2020, some three years.
16:30
So like in investor years, three years is like nothing.
It's nothing.
It's child's play.
And so I had to really change my perspective of like business versus investing and that's been a very hard thing to do.
But it's changed me a lot and I'd say hopefully for the better.
16:48
Real quick guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, showed it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed.
17:05
You or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
I love the distinction between you know running a business or being in sales or or whatnot versus versus investing because you're exactly right, it's drastically different.
17:25
I love the phrase in regards to what you're talking about aggressively patient, right, like just being aggressive in the moment, but very patient on any results, any lag, any, any, anything that's going and and I think that that drastically applies to both sides of of owning a business.
17:44
And also in in the in the investment world, right, like I'm doing everything to increase deal flow and increase opportunities on one side and the and the other I'm creating as many transactions but not caring about the results and just it may be boring and maybe maybe long and maybe you know suffering on day-to-day and and the interesting thing is like you don't have to be an entrepreneur to apply these principles right like.
18:08
You you could be in sales, you can be in a in a career path, you can be in in any one of these things where you've just got to fall in love with the boring work, not get easily distracted, not looking for another opportunity wherever they pop up.
And because it's it's the compound effect as as you talked about earlier as far as like increasing your audience size.
18:30
The same thing as far as skill set, right?
Like every every month, every year that I'm hammering down on this one skill set and it's just compounding.
And then all of a sudden the results come fast and quick at the end.
Yeah.
The amount of growth that your company had in the last year is probably more than it did in the first five years, right.
18:52
And so like that's yeah like and and it's a it's a tough gear shift.
I mean like this is me just I know you're you're in the process of this too.
But like when you go from comparing your year 7 to year eight growth of a business that you owned to year 2 to year three growth of a newer thing that you're doing.
19:11
It's like we can't compare the two like this is, this is.
I'm just telling this is what's been hard for me that I've had to like wrap my head around is that like I'm like God, like it'd be so easy for me to add another like 10 million in EBITDA to the solar business, right.
Versus like or or in gym watch like add another like 6 or add another 10 whatever it is, right.
19:28
Like adding that kind of like EBITDA like that can happen pretty quickly, right.
Whereas the new thing like, you have to think in percentages rather than in absolute amounts because otherwise you'll just get way too bogged down.
Like you'll get way too sad about things are working as fast as you want them to and so that's that's been helped too.
19:47
So shifting from absolutes to percentages to relative changes.
And also just at least for me thinking that like different businesses have different pain at different times.
And so like, I'll give you a quick extreme example.
It's like on one extreme you've got like info businesses, right?
There's lots of people who got this.
The pain that you experience is when you want to get past a million a month, 2 million a month, 3 million a month.
20:09
So you basically pick a vehicle that's easy to start, easy to make money fast for it, but you're not going to make massive money, right?
It's very hard to do it.
Not so you can't.
It's very, very hard.
On the flip side, you start a software company and like if you do it the right way, you're probably not going to make any money at all for a long period of time.
20:26
And so all your pain is front loaded.
But once you achieve critical mass, then the things just starts compounding on its own, month over month over month and at no incremental cost to you.
And the thing becomes a profit monster, right?
And says, like, those are completely opposite sides of the spectrum.
And it's really just like, where do you want your pain?
20:43
And if you know ahead of time, this is where the pain's gonna happen, Not being surprised when the pain comes.
That is one of my favorite principles that I believe applies to every area of life.
Your your fitness, your relationships, everything is choosing pain now versus later, right?
20:58
If I choose pain now, I experience real long lasting fruit later.
If I choose pain later, I get fake fruit.
Short bursts, quick hitters, right?
Like, I hit the alarm clock in the morning, right?
Hit the snooze button.
I get a quick hitter in the morning, right?
21:14
Like I feel good sleeping a little bit longer or whatever it is.
But I mean, it's my fitness routine or whatever it is, you know, which the long pain is way, way more enduring, way, way worse.
And so this principle applies to literally everything.
21:30
I want to get your your take on on one thing.
So I asked.
Ask Grant.
Cardone it it's it's really really similar to this perspective that that you're talking about is like so the question I asked Grant and and this and I'll give you what he he answered and I don't want to hear your your thoughts on it was a young guy he's wanted to launch his wanted to launch his first business.
21:53
He's thinking about taking taking the leap away from corporate America going to do it.
What do you, what do you advise?
Like what advice do you have for that guy?
Grant said he said.
Don't do it, he said.
Don't go and launch a business, he said.
Go and find somebody that has put in the years of essentially compounding and is pumping the brakes.
22:15
Go and figure out how to partner up with them and.
Leverage that compound that's already been created, right, and participate in the upside.
And then I think it's a lot of like what you're, what you're talking about as far as like year seven through 8:00 is way easier to wait, make way more money than 0 to one, one to two what whatever it may be.
22:34
And so with that, like what are your thoughts on that question on that advice?
I think that I will have slightly a slightly different take from brand and it's not because I disagree with his advice but because I think it depends on the context that it's given.
And so I think that for me to start over or for you to quote start over, I have a lot of experience in business.
22:56
And so for me it makes sense to go partner with those companies and you know let them have incur that first pause so that I can walk with them to the much bigger upside, right.
It's just that if you have no business experience, one it's tough to get that business owner to say, yeah, you're going to be a huge value add to my business and #2 you also.
23:18
And if that person doesn't say that and you want to go with the finance route of I can route some friends and family and get a bank loan and then try and buy this business cuz I took a course on acquisitions or whatever.
You still don't know what you're doing and you don't know how to analyze what is a good business cuz you don't have a baseline.
And so a lot of these things are.
23:35
And again, I, I, I agree with the advice from my, like what is the best opportunity to, I mean like private equity is literally based on this.
Like you get into private equity, you start a fund and you can go like a billion dollars in five years, right?
Like, sure, all you got to do is raise a billion dollars, go buy five companies for 200, you know what I mean?
23:50
Let them double naturally over time.
And there you go, you made yourself a billion dollars.
Like sounds easy to do, significant, right?
What are we doing here?
Right.
Why?
Why do we suck so well, Right.
But it's a lot easier said than done, right.
And so like Grant at his station in life, because I had a conversation with Grant, I'll give you, I'll give you a micro example of this.
24:09
And so I was thinking about what I was going to do with our big hunk of money.
Right.
And I'm going to give you 2 very different perspectives on the advice.
All right.
So I talked to Dave Ramsey.
And I talked to, sorry, I didn't talk to you, David.
I watched the video of Dave Ramsey when you talked about this.
And I and I had a conversation with Grant about this.
So Grant said, go buy a massive building.
He said, go buy the biggest building you can possibly buy.
24:26
That's what we should do.
And I think the caveat there is that's what Branch because Grant's been doing realistic for 30 years.
And so for him, him putting all his eggs in one basket, he's like, yeah, I can't lose.
He's like, hey, just pick it and get a manager in there done right.
Dave had slightly different perspective.
24:42
Dave said if your experiences and your skills were a pie, right?
So think about a pie 100%, he said.
How would your experiences break down between like investment assets, So you got like stocks and bonds, you've got like, you know, the skills you had, you've got business, you've got crypto, whatever it is, How does that pie circle out for you?
25:03
And when I look at my pie, it's 100% business.
It's all business, right?
And so when I heard that advice and I talked to a lot of people when I was in the, like, really the season that I think you're you're you've just entered right now, which is like the post transaction season, right?
I talked to every single guy I know who's worth over 100 million.
25:21
Every single guy I probably had, I don't know, I want to say minimum 40 conversations with guys who are worth 100 hundreds of multiple billions, right.
And was like, what should I do?
And what tough part was is that all of them gave me different advice.
And So what they, what many of them gave me is they gave me what they would, right.
25:38
And that's to be fair, that's fine.
They're like, this is what I would do.
This is what I did, right?
But The thing is is like, you're not them.
And so for me, I'm good at business.
That's where all my experience is.
That's where I can recognize risk, I can recognize value.
I can see where I can add value.
25:53
Like, I can see all that stuff.
If you put an apartment building that's worth 20 million in front of me and you put a business that's worth 20 million in front of me, dude, I got to the end of like 4 different real estate transactions that were in the in the neighborhood of like, 15 to 30 million, right?
And I would get right to the end.
You know what I mean?
Like, I would do all the deal.
I had the excel sheets, the projections, all the stuff, right.
26:10
And right before I need to write the check for like 3 million or 5 million I was like.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I've never done this yet.
I don't know.
Right.
And I didn't want to buy a tiny house.
Who gives, right?
Right.
Why am I going to buy 100,000?
It's a waste of time, right?
Whereas me pulling up to a business that's worth 20, me writing a check there for 5 million, I can do it an instant.
26:31
I don't even need the complex for like I know what I get, the business.
Like I know what's I know where the risks are.
Like I get.
I I know the termites, toilet tenants, whatever it is for that business.
And so I absolutely agree that the, the best opportunity is leveraging what already exists and then going more right that's the entire private equity industry.
26:49
The hard part is how do you develop the skill set to get to that point.
And so I think that's the, that's the nuance that I would add to which is like once you have five years or 10 years And This is why in my opinion most businesses at on a long enough time rising become investment firms like they become on some level of it, they have to reallocate capital.
27:10
Now the 1st and obvious place that you reallocate capital is within the business.
You look at how can we bolster out new new product operations or new business lines or whatever it is, right.
And then the second kind of layer of investing is that you look at strategic acquisitions.
You see if you can buy other companies that are that are creative or value add to your own business, right.
27:26
If you can vertically integrate, I mean your business is like an obvious perfect example.
It's like OK, well, if I can buy the financing company, yeah.
And I can buy the manufacturer of the solar pieces and not just add the sales team.
I'm gonna have a way more valuable business like that's a, it's an accretive acquisition, right.
The third level is just saying, is there another place that I can allocate capital that will get me a higher return than my current thing, right.
27:46
And so all businesses once they are successful enough, become investment firms.
They have to make decisions based on returns on capital.
And so I figured if that's where all businesses eventually lead, then that's what I'm going to focus on at scale.
And so that's my two cents is like, you gotta learn a game, and then once you learn the game, then you can recognize where the arbitrage opportunities are so that you can unlock all the upside.
28:10
And I'm sure that the many people who gave it specific advice would probably agree with me on that if given an extra 2 minutes to ask the question.
Dude, I love it.
So you know the interesting thing is like exactly to your point, right?
In order to get to a point where you can go and leverage a big business, you have to have the experience, you have to have the skill set.
28:29
And there's really two different routes that you can go to get there, right?
You can go the employment route, you can go as an employee.
And I think if you're going to be as as an employee, you're going to want to be an intrapreneur.
And and typically that's that's in in a sales aspect, right?
Like go and learn the product.
28:45
Learn how to sell, Learn how to elevate it.
Try to participate.
Paid in in some long term incentive plan or whatever it is, but you're building a skill, right?
Getting up to the point where then later you can leverage and where somebody could look at you and say, hey this guy can add value.
29:00
I'd be willing to share in some upside to help me scale up or you can go the entrepreneurial route go and fail figure out things what it whatever it may be.
And so I love your advice that like, yes, grant, that's perfect advice after.
29:16
You have positioned yourself to be able to do so and so that's just phenomenal stuff, man.
I appreciate you.
You're dropping lots of good bombs for my listeners.
What's the about best platform to follow you on Instagram, YouTube.
Where's the best spot?
Well, if you're a podcaster, I have a podcast called The Game.
29:34
So you can go Alex the Game with Alex Mosey.
You can just like if you type in hormosey, you'll probably find it.
And then if you type in hormosey on any platform, which is Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and if you're a business that is doing over $1,000,000 even and you want to go a lot more than that, then go to acquisition.com.
29:51
We'd love to see if we can help you out.
Freaking dope.
Last piece of advice that I want and then we'll let you go.
So somebody is is just going through a tough time, whether it's in a relationship business, like really, really struggling, wondering you know, can I keep going?
30:09
Like, is this even worth it?
What advice are you giving to that person?
Whenever I have the thoughts, like why do I even bother?
Like why should I keep going, I just remind myself that this is the point where most people quit and that's why they don't.
Live.
Love that.
Love that.








0:00
Real quick wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
0:19
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I think that's why in a lot of ways, general entrepreneurship is about being a Jack of all trades, master of none, which is that you have to know enough to be dangerous.
0:35
You have to know enough to recognize what the true constraint is at a macro level and recognize what has to happen to deconstrain it.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:50
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wish Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
Over the last three years I've invested in 22 companies, either as majority owner where I took over control of the business or a minority owner where I just assisted in the growth of the business.
1:10
And each of these businesses are doing over $1,000,000 a year in profit.
So not top line, but bottom line.
And I want to share with you the lessons that I've learned in investing and growing those companies and some of the mistakes I've made so that you can make better decisions in investing and growing in your business or investing and growing in other people's.
1:27
And if you have any interest in becoming a portfolio company, I'm going to give you a checklist in the next part that will help you make your application as good as possible so they have the highest likelihood of actually making that happen.
And at the very least, you'll probably learn a lot from the checklist itself that you could apply to your own business even if you weren't interested in that.
1:43
And so either way, which the end and I'll walk you through it.
So the entire theory behind acquisition.com was that we take something old and something new and there's a lot of magic between the two of those things.
And so for us, something old is investing and something new is social media.
And so it was my theory and it continues to be my thesis that I'm proving out is that you can generate high quality deal flow, proprietary deal flow, meaning just for us from social media.
2:07
And so, you know, a lot of people have built businesses around, you know, building an audience and then they sell stuff to that audience.
I had a theory that I could build a very large audience of specifically business owners and actually only work with a tiny, tiny percentage and still have it make economic sense to the whole.
2:25
And the benefit of that is it would allow me to build a brand based on a lot more goodwill than anyone else could because I would be giving to 99.999%, but still able to make it make economic sense.
And so one of the big misnomers out there is that like Alex is some sort of like giving St.
2:40
It's not that at all.
Like this is just a business strategy that's different.
And so rather than trying to sell to everyone, it's really just can I make deals with a couple of really good companies that they find out about me through my content.
And so just to give you a bit of context, right now we get about 2000 companies per month that inbound apply to work with us and some people might find that as disheartening if you want to do a partnership, but I'll walk you through it kind of like through the funnel.
3:05
So basically you know right off the bat half of the people don't qualify because as of current we only work with US and Canada.
We also work with international companies who are willing to convert to the US So if you're willing to have a US Corp kind of be the hold Co for your foreign Corp, that works too.
3:21
But half the businesses are not in that in that bucket.
The next is qualifier is just size.
So a lot, you know, a lot of the companies that apply are, you know 0 to $1,000,000 a year in top line and that's doesn't really work for us.
And so our minimum minimum is 1,000,000 and so someone's like I'm at 900,000, do I qualify?
3:39
The answer is no, because it's the minimum, like it's already low.
But we're willing to look at it because sometimes there's some really promising entrepreneurs and founders that have companies and it's $1,000,000 in profit.
But right now I can probably look with the median profits probably about fourish of the companies in our portfolio.
3:55
Just to give you a little bit of of reference to size, the largest company is about $20 million from profit and the smallest one is probably like 1 1/2.
And so that just gives you a range of the size companies and the biggest companies we have in the portfolio didn't start that way.
And so that's why we're Okay taking on a company that's doing 3,000,005 million, 8 million because we feel confident we can help them get to a lot bigger than that.
4:15
Now the thing about investing in general is that it's not a game of quantity.
And so that might seem counter to like my my advertising strategy of of making content because we get so much inbound deal flow.
But if you think about it like if you invest in one Facebook, you only need one Facebook.
4:31
I don't need 11 other side hustles like it would be better for me to just invest in fewer high quality companies, which is why for us it's a definitely a quality over quantity game.
And so you might hear 22 companies over three years and be like, oh, that's a lot.
But as we've gotten better and better, we actually have done, we've been doing fewer and fewer deals despite having more and more deal flow.
4:51
And so just to give you a little bit of context, over the last, I think since November, I think we've done 3 deals.
And so our rate of deal doing has gone down.
Our quality of business has gone up.
And it's not that the businesses earlier weren't as good.
It's more that the ones we do now are better fits.
And so we've just learned more about how to identify those, which is the point of this.
5:09
Now, how acquisition.com deals work is that it really depends on the founder.
And so for us, at a baseline economics level, like it has to make economic sense, like we have to buy into a business for a certain established price that we feel is reasonable.
And we see that there's significant amount of upside for us.
5:26
And the founder and the founder feels like that we can add significantly more value than they could accomplish on their own.
Like, that's the basics, right?
In terms of deal structures for us, I I have kind of two buckets.
I've got active and I've got passive investments.
I don't consider anything that's passive in the acquisition.com portfolio.
5:42
And so like there's a variety of like tech companies and kind of like Angel checks, which is very small checks you do for lots of companies that I have invested in.
But I don't consider those part of my main game.
Those are just some like businesses that I thought were really interesting and I was willing to take a small bet on them.
But the my bread and butter where I make the vast majority of my wealth is in me writing checks that I actively work in and that is what acquisition.com is about.
6:06
So this is an active portfolio.
And so there's really kind of two types of investors.
Again, this is a continuum.
It's not binary, but on one extreme you've got pure betters, which is you could have one guy looking at a zillion screens making bets, right.
And you can make bets in the micro, which is like the whole day trading thing, which I think is more of a job than actually investing.
6:26
But we'll get in that today or on the other shipment you've got, you've got Warren Buffett who is just making one you know or two concerted bets over a year and that's his bet, betting that this value is underpriced and it will go up over the long haul.
On the other extreme, you've got like turnaround specialists, so people who buy like distressed assets or people who do rollups, it's a private equity play if you're familiar with that, which is like I go by 20 different dental offices that are all doing $1,000,000 in profit.
6:52
I roll them together under one flag and I sell a $20 million EBITDA.
So profit per year business which gives you multiple kind of step ups in the multiple that you can achieve and how much money you make, right.
And so that's like super, super active.
And so we are, if we're looking at this continuum way more on this side.
7:10
We are active investors.
We have a huge team at Holdco.
We have more people at Holdco than we have actual companies in the portfolio for context.
And so we are very much directly guiding the strategy and the implementation and even recruiting for key roles to grow the companies.
7:26
And this is more or less why I think our rate of investing has has gotten to a nice steady cadence because obviously in the beginning you have more people than you have companies.
So then your rate goes up.
But then as we feel like we're, we get into a nice rhythm of how we can onboard a company over you know a half a year to a year and get key players in place, identify the constraints, figure out the plans that we're going to do, implement those people etcetera, etcetera.
7:48
Now we've got kind of like a nice rhythm and so for us, the deals obviously depend on how much we're investing in the business.
So I currently don't do any deals for less than 1/3 of a company that were actively invested in.
And so the majority of them are greater than that.
So I'd say of the last four deals we did, three of them were 49%, one was 40.
8:07
And so that's just give you a little bit of context on how we structure the deals.
We actually that's not sure one of them was 51 and so just to give you a range.
Now we obviously have more investments that but we're very actively involved in them and it's because I couldn't take a minority position of like 10% in a business and make it make economic sense for the amount of actual resources I'm pouring into the business.
8:29
So let's say for example that I invest $1,000,000 a year in in basically payroll of work of consultants and you know recruiting and things like that that will install into a business you know like doing a full CRM implementation etcetera over the next five years, it's $5,000,000.
8:46
I'm invest into a business.
If I'm, if I then also have to buy into the business, right, then that business would have to be really, really big in order for it to make financial sense.
And that's not really the target of what we have.
And so for us to invest those kind of resources, we tend to get a disproportionate or a proportional share of the companies that we're investing in.
9:07
Now the good news is though that I think every company we have is over what I would consider the free line, meaning not only do they get compensated for the equity that we bought into, but their remaining share is already worth more than the whole was prior.
9:26
And so for me, that's always the big, you know, the big objective is like okay, how do I grow the pie so that everybody wins.
And you know, I I made a quote about this, but I think it's really true.
Is that like my goal with every company?
Because my reputation matters to me.
I mean, my reputation is why everything is happening in my life is that every deal that someone does with me is the best deal they've ever done in their life.
9:44
And so part of that is leaving some meat on the bone, if you will.
I mean, if you think about the amount, you know, if I were to like sell something to my audience, like there's a lot of meat on the bone there, But I'd always rather be, you know, 49 on the table and give 75 so that everyone wins.
And that's that's just kind of like a more of a life motto.
10:03
And I'm going to walk you through a bunch of the lessons I have from the 22 companies that we've invested in and bought.
But before I do, I want to give you a little bit of context because otherwise you'll be going in blind and not understanding like how the whole thing works.
And we've done deals across ecommerce, brick and mortar chains, consumer services, business services, SAS, so software companies, sales organizations and anything else you can really think of.
10:25
So we're we're more generalists when it comes to business because what we have realized is that our specific niche is more size of company.
And so companies that are going through going from 500 ish a million a month ish to multiple millions a month, they all encounter the same problems.
10:41
And so that's where our play books are really effective to just quickly de bottleneck them and you know transparently This is why I do this and by percentage the greatest amount of enterprise value is unlocked in that jump.
And so for me that's where I get my huge return is because most businesses that are at 2, three, $4 million in profit.
11:04
As much as headlines will tell you that companies sell for 20 times earnings that's publicly traded companies.
And there's a number of things that those companies have that companies below $5,000,000 don't have because if you look at biz by sell, they publish their stats publicly, which the actual median transaction for small businesses is 2.28 to 2.5 three times and with 80 to 90% of those having seller finance notes.
11:29
So how is that, how do you have 2:00-ish X and 20 ish X on polar extremes?
And it's like, well, that's where the enterprise value gets built up.
And the nice news is that getting a company from 3:00-ish to let's say $8 million in in in profit can sometimes take a company from almost in uninvestable like it's not really sellable in a clean transaction to a fifty $80 million exit.
11:56
And so that little step up is where we focused all of our attention because that's where the by percentage, the greatest amount of enterprise values created.
And I'm not going to publicly tell you the names of the companies.
And the reason for that is actually to protect the businesses and let me explain.
So if I pump a company, right, what would happen is that, well, some of the companies could literally couldn't handle all of y'all.
12:16
And I appreciate you.
But if I were to pump the company, what happen is that I now become tied to that company's success.
And so a future requires somebody wants to buy that company would then mean that Uncle Alex has to go with the deal.
And that's not why I invested to get myself another job.
That's not the point.
And so the idea is that I need to grow them independent of my influence so that they can on their own grow their own enterprise value, which is ultimately the goal of most entrepreneurs not to be relying on me and see a couple quick hitting facts.
12:43
Number one is on average we increase top line by 80% within the first 12 months.
We increase profit by 3.01 X within the first 12 months.
We increase top line revenue by 1.8 X within the 1st 24 months.
And then within the same 1st 24 months, we increase profit by on average 4.7 X.
13:01
So we're pretty good at this.
So may have you identify the types of businesses I look for so that you can look for those types of businesses too.
All right.
So #1 is I look for at least for me, a minimum of $1,000,000 in EBITDA.
If the company has what we call transferable value.
Meaning if you own, let's say you know, 5 candy stores and all 5 candy stores do $200,000 a year in profit, then that would be something that I might be interested in.
13:27
As long as it's not your face.
That's the reason that they're doing, which most local businesses is not the case, right?
Or if you own an accounting firm that was doing $1,000,000 a year in profit and it's not based again on your face, then it would be something that I would be okay with.
If it is a personality brand or based on a creator or a rounder creator, which I get probably disproportionate amount of because I am this way, then the minimum minus $2,000,000 a year in profit.
13:50
And again, the reason there is that there is actually less transferable value in that business and there's actually more work that has to get done to remove the face of the founder so that there is enterprise value.
So like for example, Jim launch, I know this story because I lived that story.
So I built Jim Launch around my face.
And then it took me 24 months to transition from Alex's, you know, gym licensing business to gym launch a suite of consultants who understand how to implement a very specific set of playbooks into this type of gym, which is micro gym and get this very reliable outcome right.
14:22
So it took 24 months for me to do that.
And then and here's the crazy part is that the company went from, again, almost uninvestable or valueless, despite the fact that it made a lot of money into something that had transferable value that someone could compensate me for, which is ultimately why we were able to sell it for just under $50 million.
And so that's the quantitative side of it.
14:40
The qualitative side of it is 2 pieces.
One is that you want to have product market fit.
And so that means that the person is still not trying to figure out what they want to sell, right?
The reason I published my first book, $100 million Offers, is because I want to make sure people knew what to sell, right, and make really good offers because once you get that right, then you can usually quickly skyrocket above 1, two, $3,000,000 in profit per year.
14:58
And then it's much more interesting for us.
We don't want to incur that cost of trial and error and iteration because it's just, it's not that we don't think we could figure it out.
It's just not worth the time.
I'd rather work with companies that already have that and then scale it on the soft side.
15:14
Then the other piece I want to say was the other piece is growth and cash flow, right, which is we want to make sure the company's growing.
Like we don't want to catch a falling knife, which is a saying in the investment world unless it's very specific set of circumstances.
One of the, ironically the biggest company we have actually had cut, it was like down 70% when we started working with them and then it doubled from their all time top, which is a massive jump, which is awesome right?
15:38
But that was a herculean amount of effort over 12 months to really reverse the nose dive into something awesome.
The next one is just return on capital or cash flow.
What that means is, like there are some companies that don't have a lot of capital expenses, right?
So like, if you're an accounting firm and you generate profits, there's not a lot you don't have to buy heavy equipment to increase your capacity, right?
15:57
Whereas there are some companies, some businesses like a brick and mortar chain for example, that once you Max out your 20 locations, to get to 30, you need to buy or or lease or build out 10 more locations.
Like there's capital expense that has to go out.
Not to say that's bad.
We have two very, very large brick and mortar chains that are awesome, but we like to trade off how many of those we're going to do because these ones don't spit off cash flow because we actively reinvest the money into growing it because we get higher returns on it.
16:24
And then there are some companies that we actively bring the money back into whole coast so we can redeploy it into another asset that's going to increase in value.
So I just went over some of the specific criteria we look at to pick companies and now I want to talk about specific process that we go about picking them in general.
OK.
So we just talked about the criteria that we look for in order to provide value and now let's talk about the actual process of providing value.
16:47
So with broad brushstrokes, we follow a what, who, How framework, which basically is what is the biggest what that we need to do to grow this business?
Is it, do we need to 5X the sales team?
Is it we need to do 5X the ad spend?
Is it, do we need to make five times the content?
Is that we need to cut churn by 5X or do we need to completely reconfigure the pricing mix or the product suite?
17:10
Like there's a number of different things that we might identify as the biggest issue that will grow the business or the biggest lever.
And once we've identified that, what then comes down to The Who right, which is who's actually new this implementation.
One of the biggest things, especially at companies of this size is that you typically have a founder who sometimes has one or two helping hands, but they don't actually have a full leadership team or full leadership suite.
17:31
And so this is usually a very painful time for most businesses when they're at three hundred $500 million a month because they are still, they're in this in between place of, like they're still having to do some of the things they're good at.
They've given away stuff that they suck at.
17:48
But then they're still trying to keep strategy.
But then there's problems.
So they have to jump back in and they can never really feel like they're getting their head above water because like, right as they fix one thing, something else breaks.
It's kind of this like continuous cycle.
And that is the symptom.
The core issue is personnel, is that they don't have enough talent.
18:03
And so the easiest way to envision this, if this is you or if somebody you know is think about your best employee.
All right, imagine if you had six of them.
How much more money would you make?
Probably a lot more money.
Well, that's kind of the idea.
So for example, I was talking to a really cool like tech enabled service yesterday.
18:22
We're moving forward to invest in and this founder has tons of hustle, great guy, and he has homegrown all of his talent, meaning he has actively recruited people into base roles and as the company has grown, he's promoted people from within, which is not a bad ideology overall.
18:38
But here's the catch.
If everybody that you've brought into your company has been at base level or maybe one level above that, and you have taught them what you did to build that function or build that role, it means that the entirety of the knowledge and the entire company is from one person's brain.
18:55
And so if you think about this here I'll give you my little triangle.
So if you think about how a company grows, I'll tell you one of the big beliefs that I've learned is that the peak of the company is based on how much, how many brains there are at the top that know different knowledge.
19:11
So if you've got a company that has one brain, it's like that's how big the company is.
Now if you have four brains at the top, the company's way, way, way bigger.
And so it's almost like a Christmas tree of dissemination of knowledge at scale.
And so like, if you don't like and this should make sense because if you want to get to $100 million a year, for example, well, you're not going to die and then be reborn and then live the next 20 years as a CFO in order to know how to run the finances of that company.
19:40
And you're not going to die and then be reborn and then do 10 years of product so that you know how to build something that's sticky and that people want to keep buying and renew on and you're not going to die and be reborn and learn how to market and sell, etc.
And so most of the times, the founder has a strength or two that has gotten them to this point, and then there's huge deficiencies in the business.
19:58
And so one of the big misnomers about growing a business is that people say double down in your strengths, which is absolutely true for the individual.
But the business needs to be balanced.
And so that's the push and pull that people, that people miss in context is that even though you may be really good at sales and marketing for example, your business in order to get to the next level still needs to have an exceptional product, still needs to have a financial function, an HR function, an IT function, so you can track data.
20:24
And so we talked about the what and then we've got The Who and now we've got the how, which is like the actual rubber meets the road hands meeting the, the machine, getting the stuff done.
And so we have all the playbooks that we've used to grow each of the companies that I founded myself to multiple millions of dollars a month each that we implement within each of these companies.
20:43
So whether that's you know how to onboard somebody properly as an employee or how to onboard somebody properly as a customer, as a customer or at what points do we make Ascension offers in order to upgrade people and how should we structure those offers and how do we monetize them.
And if we're making content like what is the ratio between how many times we give versus how many times we ask that times a million across all the different functions.
21:05
And so to give you a little bit of context, we at hold Co for us have what we call SME's or subject matter experts.
So we've got directors of marketing and then we have Directors of sales who can build up sales teams and stand up sales departments.
And then we've got Directors of customer Success who can lead the results and the experience for every client, whether it's physical products, software or services, right.
21:26
And then down the line IT, finance, legal, etc.
So that we can ultimately build the whole business.
Because the big problem with what I would consider single solution thinkers is that if all you know, for example how to do is build sales teams, then you think that the problem of every business is that they need to build a better sales team.
21:44
If you really know content, then you think that the only thing to do for the business is to make more content.
And if you, you know, really know finance, you think you need to restructure finance and do some sort of financial engineering in order to grow the business.
And in my experience it's been wrong.
And I think that's why, in a lot of ways, general entrepreneurship is about being a Jack of all trades, master of none, which is that you have to know enough to be dangerous.
22:06
You have to know enough to recognize what the true constraint is at a macro level, and recognize what has to happen to deconstrain it.
But you, specifically, I don't like.
I'm not the best copyrighter in the world, but I'm decent enough that it was no longer the constraint of my paid ads.
22:22
Or like I I get a lot of credit for being good at sales, but I'm not the best salesman in the world.
I'm the best sales trainer in the world.
I know enough about sales to make sure that the fundamentals are done at scale.
And so one of the interesting things is, I mean you know I talked to all of our, our directors within Holdco and it's cool that they have learned a really cool lesson I'm going to share with you which is you would be amazed at how much growth can happen when all you do is the fundamentals in every single department.
22:51
Like really taking this in.
A lot of people want to make things fancy and I have this little sag fancy fails, simple scales.
And the whole idea there is that like you don't need a 17 pixel retargeting ultra campaign.
23:07
Like if you nail the hook, you have a good offer and a clear call to action for the vast majority of businesses.
That's all you need to do to run ads.
And it's also the same thing that you need to do if you're going to run a cold call campaign.
And it's the same thing you need to do if you're going to run a right hook into your audience from content, right?
Like as long as you have those fundamentals in place, you're going to get 80% of the gains.
23:29
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check on my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free to check that out if that's what you are into.
23:45
And if not, keep enjoying the show.
And so understanding what those core pieces are at scale across the departments is the responsibility of the entrepreneur.
And then going deep into the implementation is the responsibility of the experts.
And so that's why we have experts.
We bring in the person who's going to be underneath of that CS person, for example, to cut sure and fix pricing, drive profit in the business.
24:08
And then we copy and paste that knowledge into the new person.
And then that's how we can scale the value of the enterprise itself without needing acquisition.com.
And so like top to bottom, if you think about a customer journey, right.
So we're going to start with how do we generate demand, right.
24:23
And whether that's cold calls, cold emails, making content, running ads, having an affiliate network, having a really strong referral program, having agencies that we partner with across different platforms or simply like scaling the employees to do more of the stuff we're already doing.
All of those are things that we will do to generate more demand.
Once we have demand, it's about converting that demand.
24:40
And so then all of that comes into the sales function.
Now that could be sales scripts, it could be video sales letters, it could be written sales letters, it could be webinars that we do on a weekly, basically live events that we do conversions from like all of these are different selling mechanisms and we have companies that literally do all of them, right.
And so again, I am not a master at any of them.
24:57
I'm pretty good at it.
I know when it's right and then I can move on from that.
And then from that point, the next thing you move on to is customer success or product right, which is somebody to make sure that all the I's are being dotted and the T's are being crossed and that people have any exceptional experience and making sure that we maximize revenue in the back end.
25:13
A lot of people think it's like customer service, which is not the right perspective in my opinion.
You and the whole customer success industry really only started 20 years ago.
Like it's it's actually still a relatively new function and the reason that the salaries in that department are skyrocketing is because they are unlocking so much value for businesses if you know what you're doing.
25:33
And so for example, if you have a company or you have a product that has $100 price point and it goes from 10% churn monthly to 3% churn monthly, you tripled the value of the customer.
And there's very few other things that you can do to triple the value of the customer.
And so that is why mastering the CS function is so valuable.
25:51
From there we have the the the data function, which is really what I T is and that sounds really lame, but if you want to get to a really big company, you have to be able to make smart decisions and if you don't have data, it's really hard to make smart decisions.
On the flip side, if you have really amazing data, it's really easy to look smart because you just make common sense decisions based on the data you're presented.
26:12
And so getting that implementation in place is one of the key things that we help with for companies to go from like in between different Google Sheets and like hodgepodging on one CRM and two other tools to having it all centralized so that we can track everything in real time from Click to close.
Beyond that you didn't have to walk your backside, which for me is a function of legal, finance, HR, right.
26:31
And so you've got the legal which we still like we don't get in house legal for the portfolio companies.
We have that so that we can help them and then it saves them money, provides more value the finance function so that they can actually do a big transaction later on.
So like if you a big part of the reason that small companies can't get big multiples is that they don't have clean financials, right.
26:49
They're still doing cash accounting, they don't have, they're not accounting based on accrual and they don't have somebody who could actually give them cash forecast.
I'll give you an example of this.
So one of our portfolio companies was growing like a rocket and all of a sudden they they pretty much, they basically plateaued at around 2,000,000 bucks a month for like 6 months.
And the problem that the founder was, was vocalizing was that he was like, I just don't know how many more, how much more I should be investing in these new things based on our cash flow.
27:17
And so you kept going, he's like, am I doing too much?
Am I doing too little?
I feel like the cash is so lumpy and volatile because I was the nature of the business had extended payment terms.
And so I remember pulling aside and saying, I want you to remember this feeling because the feeling that you have is that you don't have a finance function.
And so he knew sales, he knew marketing, he knew customer success, but the feeling he had was a lack of data around money.
27:38
And so he kept, he didn't know how to put his finger on it.
But I have been there because I had a impromptu $9.2 million tax bill that came up one year.
Why?
Because I, and I'll tell you like I live these mistakes.
I hired somebody frontline, promoted, promoted, promoted until they were director of finance without ever having that experience.
27:55
We sent them to a a conference that I paid for and then at the conference Friday afternoon she emails Leila and I and says by the way, I just learned that after a certain, after over a certain size, you can't pay your taxes at the end of the year.
You need to pay them quarterly.
28:11
And we hadn't, we had been not paying taxes for that year because that was what we had done the year before.
But we had grown a lot.
And so if you've heard me say that I had that $17 million by second year at Jim Lunch with $17 million in profit, well, I had $9 million in taxes that was due at the end of Q1 of that next year.
28:29
And so I actually had Q1 because I had to pay quarterly plus the five quarters or the four quarters before that.
All due.
And when she emailed me, she said it's due Monday.
And so she's like, you might have to move some stuff around.
And so, you know, we called her up and she's like, hey, I'm busy at the conference.
I was like, this is 1 where you can step out of the conference that I paid for.
28:46
And so obviously stepped out.
We talked about it and I wrote a $9.2 million check that next Monday.
And so again, I know what that failure feels like.
And then finally, from the HR perspective, there's two kind of sides to HR, right?
You've got like the benefits, payroll, compensation, incentives, ish side of HR and then what I would consider the most value added if not that incentives in comp aren't valuable, they are.
29:10
But in terms of driving enterprise value, it's actually the recruiting and head hunting side because what we have also learned in this process is that you don't actually grow companies, you build people who build companies.
And that is a key piece that took me way too long to understand like the reason that Jim Lunch became a very valuable thing was because I found valuable people to then run and grow the company on my behalf.
29:34
And until you get to that point, you don't own enterprise.
The enterprise owns you.
And so for us, we take a lot of entrepreneurs from that level to being owned by their enterprise.
The genius with 1000 hands, just one person who's got all their brain plugged into everybody's still like managing chaos, even if it's super profitable to transferring that into an asset that they own, that sits on their balance sheet that grows tax free in the last discipline I'll consider, and this is probably the one where Layla and I contribute the most to is and I I feel even weird throwing myself in.
30:00
This is probably more Layla is leadership right?
And because if you think about this from a metascale perspective like leadership sits on top of all of these things, both on the org chart and also in terms of priority.
Because from a first principles thinking perspective, if every if anyone in the world would work for you, then all you have to do is master that skill and then you can get every other skill.
30:22
So that skill of leading people, of attracting people, of influencing people to do things on your behalf, once you have that skill, you can get everyone to do everything else for you without even needing to know anything besides that.
Which is why sometimes you see some of these really old guys running really cutting edge technology companies, even though they have no idea how the technology works, but they know how people work.
30:44
And if you're thinking about value, it is one of the most valuable skills because and they found this, there's a big McKenzie study that looked at this, but the contribution to growth for coaches on teams is the same as the contribution of CEO's to businesses, which to me it just means that people work the same way, right?
31:04
And that was the median was 30%, which means that if you're in the top 10% of leaders, that's how you come in.
And 10X100X a company because of the culture, the norms and new rules of behavior that you install within a business that then unlocks discretionary effort from the entire employee base.
31:23
So if you could imagine what the difference is between everyone in a company working at just the level to not get fired versus everybody working at the level of trying to impact and accomplish a mission together in alignment.
I mean, the difference isn't double.
The difference is 10X.
31:39
And that skill is the meta skill that unlocks the most enterprise value.
And that's the one that Leila and I probably work the most with on the individual founders and sometimes real talk.
Some founders recognize intelligently that they're like I feel like I'm too far off from this.
And so I recognize my own deficiencies.
31:56
I actually like product better or I just really love being CMO or CRO, meaning Chief Revenue Officer or Chief Marketing Officer.
Or I just want to be just in charge of the sales team or I just want to be in charge of success.
And we have founders that are in each of those positions because over the time they get, they increase their own self knowledge and they don't see it as a deficiency, they see it as a plus that they're more selfaware.
32:18
And in so doing same thing as Larry Page and Sergey Brin, they brought in Eric Schmidt because he was going to be the leader that was going to help grow Google Now.
They were amazing product people, incredibly good technologists.
But he knew how to build the actual build and operate the actual company.
And so was it a bad move for them to do that?
32:35
Absolutely not.
It was obviously worked out for them.
And so having that level of self-awareness and humility to be able to quote hand over the reins to an operator can sometimes be the most valuable thing that you do the business especially from an enterprise value perspective if you want to own something that can ultimately work without you in the future.
32:51
So there's six key areas that hold Co will basically dump value into or invest resources into growing where we feel like the highest leverage points are.
So you've got marketing on the front to generate demand, you've got sales in order to convert demand, You've got customers assess to deliver on the promises that sales and marketing made, you've got IT and technology that allows all of those things to work together and have data to collect off that platform.
33:15
You have operations which underneath of that output legal, finance and HR together in terms of actually getting people to do the things not going to jail, paying your taxes and all that stuff.
And then on top of that, so like 5 + 1 is just leadership overall so that you can unlock the most discretionary effort across the entire team so that the organization grows together in alignment.
33:35
So now they have a little bit of an idea of kind of the context on how we work with businesses, how we provide value, how the deals usually work, what we target in terms of the companies, their growth rates and the quantitative data.
Now I want to shift to some of the stories and lessons that I've learned in investing in 22 companies and some of the failures that I've that I've been fortunate enough to learn my experiences from.
33:55
And so I want to break this into kind of three sections.
So one is beliefs that I've held from the beginning that remained unchanged.
The second bucket is beliefs that I believed in the beginning, but now I believe through and through and have doubled down on.
And the third bucket is, is beliefs that I once thought were true and have been completely disproven and have completely new beliefs around the same subjects.
34:15
So within the belief bucket of things that I thought coming into this investing world and things that I continue to believe, I have 3 beliefs.
So belief #1 is that cash is still king, meaning companies that have low CapEx, as in capital expenses and spit off lots of cash flow are in general healthy businesses that we like to invest in.
34:38
And the reason for that is that one, it's you can weather storms when you have cash flow.
Cash flow is like oxygen to the business.
If as long as you've got it, you can still pretty much spend your way out of problems, sell your way out of problems over and over again.
34:54
If you don't have cash flow, you're a ticking time bomb until something happens.
And the unfortunate part about business is that something always happens.
And so I see cash flow in some ways as insurance on whatever purchase or investment I'm making.
And it also opens up the bucket for Belief #2, which is that I have cash flow to reinvest in growth.
35:15
And so the growth can happen organically, meaning you know if I have an accounting firm that I'm looking at, they can continue to grow without actually having to redeploy capital.
But if they do have capital, then there are other things that we could potentially acquire.
We might acquire A bookkeeping business or we could acquire a piece of software that works out well or we can acquire immediate property that would feed deals into that company.
35:37
Or we could invest in, you know, writing a book that would then position the firm as thought leaders to then get more business, etcetera.
And so the idea is that, one, I want to have lots of cash from the business.
Two, I want to have clear ways that I feel that we can grow the business that don't take huge leaps of faith.
35:55
And so for us, we have to see what we call 2 triples.
Now a different way of saying that would be to sit to see a 10X, But in my experience I can see triples a lot easier.
And if you see two triples you get your 9X10X.
36:12
And that's not to say that thinking in order of magnitude is not a good idea.
I absolutely think it is.
But when I make bets, I like to choose really high probability bets that I think I can 10X.
And that is again my investment style.
Venture capital, for example, will take 50 bets that are very small, hoping for 100 X.
36:33
That pays for the whole portfolio where everyone else pretty much loses money, right.
And so I have a different style.
Our style is we want to win on everyone and I'm okay just hitting ten X's across the board and having and ideally not having any zero X's whereas venture and it's just a different investment thesis.
36:49
But again our risk is our time invested in the capital we put in.
And so I don't like taking losses.
And so that is why we're really selective about companies because if we do move forward with it, then you can be pretty sure that we feel confident that we already see the 10.
And so growth is a big amorphous topic, but let's just break it into the three buckets.
37:09
That growth happens from an enterprise value perspective, all right.
So number one is you can get more customers, right?
If everything else stay the same and you double the customers, you double the business.
The second bucket is making customers worth more.
And there's eight ways you can do that, but I'm not going to do that.
But like you, could you increase the lifetime gross profit of the customer, right.
37:27
If you sold the same amount of units but you doubled the lifetime gross profit of the customer, then you would double the business yet again.
Now the third bucket is one that I've I've learned over time, which is de risking.
All right.
Now for example, if you had a company like let me show you 2 examples of two companies, one company is super volatile and it has big years and low years and high years and big years and low years whatever and profit swings a lot and it's only been around for two years or three years, whatever.
37:55
And on the other hand, you've got a company that's been around for 10 years and has grown at 10% a year and they both in this year are the exact same size.
Which company is more valuable?
This one, the second one.
And the reason is because you have a high degree of confidence that it will continue to generate profits into the future and ideally grow in those profits.
38:17
And so we think about all the different ways that a business can go to zero and think how can we prevent all of those from happening.
And so on the extreme, you have a business that's absolutely guaranteed to make money.
So like if you had a 20 year contract with the government to maintain its lawns and you had a lawn care service, that would be an incredibly valuable business.
38:37
It's almost a bond at that point because the government's not going to default and the contract's 20 years, they're probably not going to change the contract either.
So like you're set pretty much.
And I say this because a buddy of mine had a an app that he contracted with only public municipalities.
It was like an anti gun shooter safety app or whatever for prevention.
38:56
He got 1200 municipalities on recurring annual revenue and he sold it for several $100 million.
And from a revenue perspective, it wasn't even close to that, but because the likelihood that that cash flow didn't continue on into the future was so miniscule that people were willing to pay huge amounts of money for it, right.
39:16
And so the idea is even if we don't necessarily change the top line and bottom line of a business, but we can derisk the founder, eliminate key man risk, add a couple acquisition channels, you know, eliminate customer concentration, meaning you have like 1 customer that's 80% of your business.
39:31
Eliminate financial risk, meaning like you don't have audit ready financials.
You're just like doing QuickBooks and like doing crayon napkins.
I'm just kidding.
And even like key man risk from each of the roles.
So like you have key man risk from if you have a public facing founder, for example, or you have key man risk if like you have a genius coder founder who like if this guy wasn't here, the product would never continue to innovate the way it has.
39:51
And so all of these are risks that in the future it won't continue to perform the way it does.
And so when we think about a checklist of adding value to a company, we're increasing unit sales, we're increasing LTGP.
And we're increasing the likelihood that it will continue on into the future and this is where actually the huge multiple occurs.
40:10
And so if you think about units sold and lifetime gross profit, that's what the EBITDA or profit of the business is going to generate.
Now the multiple on that profit is how likely it's going to continue.
And so it's the interplay between these two things.
So like if we can for example, take a company that would be maybe valued at you know $5,000,000 that's got $2,000,000 in profits.
40:31
So that would be taking that biz by sell stat 2 1/2 X, right.
And we take that company to let's say $5,000,000 in profit and then it gets an 8X multiple.
Then you have a $40 million business compared to a $5,000,000 business.
And so that's an 8X difference even though all we did was we doubled the profit of the business, right.
40:52
That's the key.
So we went from 2 million in profit to 5 million.
So it was a little bit more than 2 1/2 X the profit of the business, but we 8X the overall value and that's the magic.
So the third belief that I continue to believe is focused founders and that kind of has two aspects of it.
41:09
So focus in terms of the avatar that we're serving and the problem that we're solving, as well as just the ability to say no.
And so Steve Jobs was quoted for saying that focus means being able to say no to truly phenomenal ideas.
41:26
And he said you can count how focused you are to be by the number of truly phenomenal ideas you try you choose not to pursue.
And The thing is, is that the bigger the company gets, the greater the opportunities become.
Can you imagine the like, if Apple does anything, it's going to make a billion dollars?
Like think about it.
Like anything Apple does, it'll make a billion dollars or many billion dollars.
41:44
And so it's not whether something makes money or not is is it the best allocation of resources.
And I actually see this problem all the time, especially with like creator based founders who have like big audiences is that they get what I consider false positives.
And so it's like they create an umbrella business for their rain channel and they're like, this is what I'm gonna sell.
42:05
But is making umbrellas the best opportunity?
Will they make money?
Sure, right.
They could probably sell sauce with an audience that large.
But it doesn't mean that it's the best use of the resources to capture the highest percentage of the market at the highest LTV's, right.
And that's the idea.
When I say LTVI mean lifetime grows profit.
42:21
So focused founder on what specific avatar I want to serve and what specific problem am I solving for that avatar.
And I'll give you a little story about this.
One of our companies is A is a PR company, just pretty generic B to B public relations.
And we specifically took this founder on because we just really like the founder and that's something that I'll share later in terms of some of the lessons I have.
42:43
But I really like the founder and they were doing a lot of, you know, selling a lot of units.
So they're selling 100 ish units a month of services.
The problem was they had super high churn.
And so I saw, OK, we have clear demand, there's a lot of people want this stuff and we're really bad at delivery.
43:00
And so once we went through our diagnostic process, which is what we do at the very beginning when we take on a company after we invest, is we say, OK, let's find out more, right?
Because the last thing you want to do is immediately jump in and then just change everything.
Like that's not smart investing.
So we go in and we look at the customer mix and we survey the customer base and we find out that 85% of the customers are one avatar and 15% of the customers are completely different avatar.
43:22
And here was the funny part is that the 15% of customers were paying three times more than the 85% and they churned at 1/3 the rate.
And so you're like, wait a second, three times the price, 1/3 of the churn, yes, they were nine times more valuable.
And so I had a conversation with the founder.
43:37
I said, hey, look at this data.
What do you think about this?
And his initial reaction, understandably so, was, well, what am I going to do about it?
And I said, well, what we're going to do is we're going to stop selling to 85% of your customers.
And so you can hear the world's largest.
Gulp.
And I was like, yeah, so we're basically going to kill like most of your business.
43:55
And mind you, this is after I'd like to get invested in this business.
And this is the thing he, having a lot of faith in us, decided to take that jump.
And over the next six months, we reconfigured all of the marketing messaging, all of the sales scripting, the offer, the price point.
44:11
And you'll notice here, this is 1 where I don't like doing product market fit.
This is me reimagining product market fit for a company.
I don't do this because it takes a lot of time and a lot of effort, a lot of trial and error.
But that being said, we identified the avatar, we identified the offer, we identified everything.
44:28
And here's the cool bar.
After we made the entire switch, the new customer lifetime value went from $6000 to $75,000 and our response rates are advertising went up despite being more narrow.
And so the idea was a lot of people think that you have to go general and there are times we're going broader is the right decision.
44:49
But often times, especially if you're smaller or starting out selling, going general means that the vast majority of people don't resonate with your message.
And so you have to make up for having this huge amounts of volume, whereas we were now able to to cold outreach to a significantly smaller audience and get three times the response rate and close rates at higher prices by making that switch.
45:13
So I've only done this massive change twice and I'm about to do a third, but it's at a very different stage in the business.
But in terms of like making product market fit at a base level, I've only done twice outside of all the companies I founded.
I want to zoom in on this because I think it's a really powerful lesson.
45:31
Most entrepreneur, I would say most entrepreneurs are not willing to do what this founder did, which is take two steps backwards so you could take 10 steps forward.
And ironically our second largest company that we have that this exact same thing happened when they came to us.
They had two aspects to their business model and I saw both of them and I hated one of them and I love the other one.
45:51
But the other one was way harder to do at scale, but it had the most enterprise value.
This one was fast, easy money but didn't scale the same way.
And so I told him to cut his personal income by 2/3 in order to double down on this.
And this took nine months.
46:08
Stand up and it's easy for me to say nine months.
But when that nine months is 280 days of feeling like shit every single day and second guessing because he doesn't know when he's going through it that it's going to work out.
And so think about your six months in and you gave up 2/3 of your income and you still don't know if this is working right.
46:27
And so that's where having trust with partners and that's a lot of, I'll get to some of the beliefs that we've learned later is so important.
And so I think one of the big things a lot of entrepreneurs don't do is they don't play it out right is that they judge their self worth by their monthly cash flow.
46:43
And what that prevents you from doing is seeing the bigger picture.
Which is why, to be fair, it's nice to have an outside investor in because I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna sidequest here, but I think it'll be, I think it'll be worth it is that there's a really well studied phenomenon called the Solomon Paradox.
47:00
And so the Solomon paradox is simple, is that people give better advice to other people than they follow on their own.
And they've actually studied this in a variety of settings, whether it's business, relationships, finance, people actually give better advice than they follow.
They even take people's actual situations, whitewash the name, and then ask them what the person should do.
47:16
And it's different what the person actually does.
And so now you can hypothesize this because they're emotionally detached and they can just be more logical about it.
But at the end of the day, they see higher, higher correlations with better decision making when you are not emotionally invested.
And so having somebody on the outside or really on the inside who doesn't have the same emotional buy in can ultimately allow you to grow the business to a much larger degree because their identity isn't associated with it.
47:41
And so it allows you to have some outside perspective to be like, dude, it's cool, Look at what five years looks like.
Because if you keep doing the other game you're playing, you're just going to plateau at 10 million a year and you're going to stay there.
And I'm pretty sure that you don't want that.
And so as soon as you realize that you know you can make money and you decide that you want to build a bigger thing, then you are making progress by taking a step back.
48:05
You just have to redefine what progress is.
You're making progress toward a much bigger goal.
You're not making progress on your monthly cash flow tomorrow.
You just need to expand the time rise and see that you're on another path that's way more profitable.








0:00
Real quick guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ass is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
I'll say this is that the founders who are willing to have hard conversations are the ones the that unlock the hard to get to growth.
Because most of the growth in every business sits on the other side of two or three hard conversations.
0:39
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy the three beliefs I'm about to share with you are ones that I have leaned even more on.
0:59
So I I believe them at at the beginning and now I would say their core pillars of how we make investment decisions.
So number one is being founder friendly.
And so the idea that we wanted with acquisition.com because I've gone through several transactions with institutional buyers, meaning like people who have lots of money is I didn't enjoy those transactions.
1:17
I didn't enjoy necessarily what happened afterwards.
And this is no like they're all great people.
I just, I think that the way that the process was approached could be better.
That's more what I'm saying.
And so we wanted to create something different.
We wanted something to be founder friendly and rather than basically taking out the the founder entirely, which is the vast majority of the investment world with the exception of like VC who is super, super tiny fractions, it's is there a way that we can marry the idea of hey, we're going to buy in at a discount.
1:47
We both know that that's because we're going to be investing a ton of resources.
That does have hard costs for me, but your slice of the pie will be worth 10 times more than it is today, even if the shape of the pie is different.
And so this is one of my big like visuals for you is that you can have a round shape of pie, but the round shape of pie can be like this.
2:05
Or you can have a triangle shape of a pie that looks like this.
And to give you a bit of a proof point on this of you know the if you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together.
The average IPO and most people would consider founders who IPO their company is pretty successful by by traditional standards.
2:20
I mean you have to have at least $100 million in revenue or basically you have $100 million company or hire just broad brush strokes.
Those founders on average IPO at 12% and so the idea here and again that's the minimum.
So some of them are doing billion dollar IP O's and 12%, yeah, 12, so they're 12% owners.
2:40
Those founders still have 12% ownership.
So you think about the slice of the pie, it's like this, right?
It's an eighth of the company.
And so that's okay because maybe the alternative to that was them owning 100% of a business that's worth $10 million versus owning 12% of a of a company worth a billion dollars.
2:57
And so making that shift as a founder is important.
And it was one that took me too long to understand was that the more people I get aligned to my ultimate goal, the bigger the pie ultimately gets.
You don't lose by getting more people involved.
3:12
And so here's a quick laundry list of reasons that I think traditional pea sucks.
Now this is no, like, I love the partners who who bought in the companies that I've sold like this is a big describer.
They're awesome people.
They generally are awesome people.
But I think it's more of a model thing.
So one is the the process is incredibly long and incredibly painful for really all parties.
3:33
Second, it's incredibly litigious, meaning lawyers are paid through the ass to be as painful as seemingly possible.
And you're constantly asking, playing banana phone between lawyers to translate things back and forth, negotiating on, you know, phrases of sentences and wording.
It's terrible.
The entire private equity model is the vast majority of them are based on not actually growing the business.
3:53
They're based on financial arbitrage.
This basically means this company, we can put a ton of debt on it and then use that to buy other companies and not actually grow the business in general.
Now, I'm not against debt, to be clear, but I do love growing businesses organically because it's, in my opinion, one of the easiest ways to grow a business.
4:12
But that's because that's in our skill set.
Most private equity people in general don't come from the world of actually founding and growing businesses.
They come from MB A's who learned spreadsheets, who learned how to raise debt, who then deploy that debt.
Like that's how it works, all right.
And again, different skill sets, not saying it's bad, just different.
4:29
Then the entire diligence and deal process as a whole is feels like a root canal.
Basically they're, you know, I remember during our diligence process this is 2021, they were asking about an $8000 order from 2017 and we were like why are we doing this?
4:46
And it's because everyone is following checklists and doesn't want to get fired for making a mistake.
And it's because their incentive system internally is basically zero reward only punishment for messing up.
And so everyone like my CFO answered that one question that she didn't have the receipt from this $8000 purchase. 9 times she showed me the emails of every time they continued to ask the question.
5:08
She said I don't know how to say this differently, don't have the receipt, not going to be able to find it.
The company we did that thing through is out of business now and they're not responding My emails, I don't know what you want me to do.
It was five years ago, whatever it was four years ago.
And so it is a really, really tough experience.
Like if you don't have audited financials, you don't haven't built out a data room that has access to all your data in real time like a full deck, a sit.
5:29
Like there's a lot of steps to.
I actually made a video about it about how people in like every single step in that process.
And a big part of this from a negotiating perspective is that the longer a deal takes, the more it's in the favor of the buyer.
The shorter a deal takes, the more it's in favor of the seller.
5:44
Meaning the founder or the business owner is more advantaged to a shorter process.
Why is that?
Because they always have the gift of knowledge.
The person who's selling the company always knows more than the person who's buying the company, right?
That's the idea.
So like the investor knows less about the company than the guy who started it.
And so the longer it takes, the more the person who buys will know.
6:02
Also the more wore down the founder will be.
And that is part of the psychological process of this is that they will get typically a founder to say yes to a price to get you to go exclusive with them.
And then they will start this root canal with you.
And then they will slowly chip away at your valuation and tell you all the reasons why your business sucks.
6:22
And then they will produce a smaller offer at the end.
But you've already gone through 6 fucking months.
And so you're like, you know what?
I can't, I don't want to do this again, I like fine.
And so that is how they get the vast majority of founders to do that.
So given all the pain associated with that, we wanted to create something different.
6:37
And so for us, we went from a terribly litigious process to having plain English contracts.
We try to jointly involve the attorneys and say this is a friendly transaction.
We try to have all negotiation or conversations between us, not the lawyers, so that we can come to agreements, which I'll give you an example of a deal we just closed.
6:56
We made a minority investment in a company and the lawyers were coming back on.
Their lawyers were coming back on a non compete clause, all right.
And they said we want the non compete to be a 50 mile geographic area and for only 24 months post transaction.
7:11
All right.
And so we were like, no, why are we going to invest in a business?
And in 24 months, the founders are going to go and compete with the business that we just invested in.
That makes no sense.
So non compete just means you can't compete with the business.
So like, if I own 5 gyms and I sell you my 5 gyms that I can't.
7:30
Tomorrow after selling you this asset, e-mail all my clients and say fuck that gym, come to my gym.
It's literally across the street.
Just cancel with them, Sign up.
For me it's the exact same business if you don't have a non compete.
The founder could do that and to be fair the founders that we do business with would never do that.
But people are shitty, especially when big amounts of money are on the line.
7:49
So the non compete the lawyer came back with was 24 months and so we hopped on the phone with the founder and we're like are you planning on competing with the company in the next two years that we own, that you own majority of?
And he was like, well, no.
And I was like, well, your lawyer is making that case.
8:04
He's like, oh, well, that's ridiculous.
And I was like, yeah.
And so for that reason, we have the conversation face to face and we resolve things in seconds.
That in my deal, because everybody has to be so litigious with their lawyers and have teams of lawyers on every call, it would take three weeks to get that one clause out when it shouldn't even have been there to begin with.
8:23
Right.
So planning those contracts face to face, us talking through, it's really a conversation, not a negotiation.
It's probably the easiest way to say it.
We try and target our process to end to end be 60 days, meaning the actual LOI to to close is like 30 which is unbelievable compared to you know he will say it'll take six months, it's going to take a year in terms of like from when they start talking to you when the deal actually closed and I think for us it was actually two years.
8:47
So like very painful and so we're looking at all of these things.
It's like how do we make this more founder friendly?
And on top of that, any enterprise value that we're going to unlock, they're participating basically 5050 and ish rather than being a 10% owner in the thing that we then 10X, right.
9:03
And for us, the founder always stays on unless there's some sort of explicit thing, but we want the founder there.
And I'll tell you the reason we're able to do deals faster is because the founder's still there.
So we don't have a material change in leadership.
So this is part of our model overall.
9:19
Not to say that if we did have majority, so like we just did it, we did a 51% deal as referencing earlier, the founder still chose to stay on, but we had some other things that we included in the deal that made it make sense for the founder to do that.
And so they're still going to unlock a ton of value and we already have unlocked a ton of value in that business and they're participating and their 49 is still worth way more than their 100% was worth prior and they still got compensated for selling the 51.
9:45
By contrast, a lot of private equity firms entire playbook circles around going in, buying the assets, firing everyone and then putting those assets in another company that is 100% of Playbook.
And so that is not our playbook.
And so again, this is not to say P is evil.
10:02
It's not to say that they are bad people.
It's just that they are different business models.
And I believe, I mean it's a capital market, so you can do whatever you want.
But the way we wanted to approach it was simple legal conversations, not negotiation, keeping the founders involved after the transaction, allowing them to participate meaningfully in all the upside that we're going to create and not materially changing the business or only doing that if it's a last resort and not our intention.
10:27
And this segues perfectly into the second belief that I have doubled down.
I mean this might even be the biggest one which is jockey over horse.
And the reason for that is because the private equity world almost exclusively values the business and not at all the founders.
And that's because they immediately remove the founders as soon as they get in and take control.
10:45
The VC world almost exclusively values the founders, not really the business at all because they're pre product market fit.
So they know they have to change a bunch of things anyway.
So the business model doesn't really matter.
What they care more is how do these people interact, what types of people are these, How dedicated are these the mission, are they mission oriented?
Do they have strong beliefs loosely held, right.
11:03
And so for us, we are kind of this interesting blend between the two because we still have the founding teams and the leadership in place when we buy into a business.
But we're buying into bigger businesses than VCs do, right?
Because most of the people come to us don't actually want money.
11:18
They want help.
And so they actually want to unlock what it's like to go for a million a month to 5 million a month.
They want to go along for that ride, not get kicked out and then have the ride gone on without them, right.
And so since founders are so key to our long term success within our strategy, we actually way more heavily vet.
11:39
And we just literally month after month after month, we just get better and better and better at vetting founders to the degree that now 80% of what we look for is the founder.
Because we've had a couple of times we've had to change the business model materially.
And so the thing that we bought into isn't even the thing that we ultimately ended up doing, but we believed in the founders and their ability to manage change, manage growth and honestly just manage their own egos.
12:02
And so I'm, I'm working on this because I want to have this really cool chart but basically show compliance against growth.
What I mean by that is, hey, we think you should do this.
And then the founder says great, that is what I will do, matching the people who do that grow the most, the fastest.
12:18
And the reason is the Solomon paradox.
We have a lot more context and we also have way lower emotional tie in.
And so like we have way more data and way less emotion That makes a very dangerous combination of better decision making and better strategy which is ultimately why a lot of people come into our world.
12:34
Let me give you an example of half followed advice.
And so it's a lot like diet advice, right, where I say, hey, I'm going to give you this diet and so six days a week you're going to follow it and then on Saturdays you're going to do a cheat day.
And the reason for the cheat day is it's going to refill all your carbohydrate stores, boost your metabolism, etcetera, right.
And so a month later you talk to the person, you say, hey, so how's that die going?
12:53
Oh, it's awesome.
I love the advice.
I'm killing the cheat days, not doing as well on the other half of the diet.
But the cheat days, I'm crushing And they're like, yeah, but it's not really working because I'm actually gaining weight.
And so you can't half follow advice, You have to wholly follow advice.
So I'll give you a business example.
So we had a company that clearly needed an operator.
13:12
They had promoted somebody from frontline all the way to basically giving a a director of operations title to somebody who really should have been.
And this is not a slight to the role, but somebody came in at like a seven, $8 an hour roll and just really became that person's assistant.
13:29
And they were paying this person way more than they should have been paying them.
And that person had absolutely no experience and was completely had a chokehold on the business and didn't let anyone else in because the less control they had, the less influence they felt they had over the founder, right.
And so we said, listen, you need an experienced operator to get this business from, you know, 5 million in profit to 25,000,000 in profit.
13:50
And so because this person was so entrenched in the founder's life, they refused to let that person go.
And so they then hired another operator.
And so we had two operators in the exact same business with basically the exact same title and responsibilities.
And So what do you think happened?
Who's in charge of what?
14:07
And then you have two bosses giving two sets of directions, absolute, complete confusion and chaos, finger pointing, blaming and ultimately a very terrible situation.
Just not fun.
And so the big lesson, and again we learn these things like we've learned this, is that you can't half listen to advice.
14:23
And so we need founders who we have a certain level of trust with.
And it's not even trust because I would say that even that founder knew that they should do that.
But they they for whatever reason, same reason, people know they should follow die and don't.
They couldn't take the jump.
And I'll say this is that the founders who are willing to have hard conversations are the ones the that unlock the hard to get to growth because most of the growth in every business sits on the other side of two or three hard conversations.
14:50
You know, you should have but haven't had yet.
And that's where having some from the outside be like you know this is a problem.
And they're like, I know, but she's my sister.
I know, but she's been there since the beginning.
Or I know he's a Dick, but he's my top sales guy, right?
15:05
Like everyone has that story.
But I can tell you that when you make the call, the entire team goes up.
And that is just a micro example of being willing to put the business above your own personal and emotional needs.
And that's tough for a lot of people, which is also why most people don't grow.
15:22
And so for us, the three values that we have at acquisition.com, sincere candor, unimpeachable character and competitive greatness are the three things that we look at every single founder but like, really look at them.
And.
But I would say that at this point, when I started this, Leila and I were completely diametrically opposed in terms of our expertise.
15:40
Like I was all the hard stuff.
So like quant numbers, conversion percentages, CT R's like all of that.
And Leila was all the quote soft stuff.
And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, but like this is the stuff that matters.
And over time, Leila's influenced me a lot.
And you know, probably, you know, five years in, it became you need to have the hard and the soft.
15:59
And I would say that I have now actually swung even more in her direction, which is I used to think this is the only thing that matters.
And then I thought this matters plus culture.
And then now I just feel like culture is strategy.
And so a company that has superior culture will beat the one that has superior strategy every day of the week.
16:16
And I'll tell you two stories.
So we actually made two investments and we actually kicked the companies off in two days back-to-back.
So it was a ton of work for our team, but it was one of these crazy like tale of two businesses.
And so we had two completely different businesses.
One was a really cool platform that we were really excited about in terms of the actual business opportunity.
16:38
The other was a business that was kind of boring from an opportunity perspective, but like such engaged and enthusiastic founders.
And so we went back-to-back and what was crazy is that My Portfolio operating partner who basically runs the strategy for the implementation teams that help grow the businesses was it was actually his first day when we on boarded these two companies not with not in business but just starting with us.
17:01
And he made his own internal bet of like which of these companies do I think will do more or do better.
And he bet on the company that had the much more exciting opportunity.
And Fast forward a year later, that company has floundered and the company that had the dynamic founders that were full of energy enthusiastic about the mission they were going after, even though it's kind of a boring opportunity, have crushed it and become a really rising star within our portfolio.
17:27
They've already tripled in less, like a little less than a year.
And so the lesson that we've all taken from that is that we now put founders above everything because if they execute what we already know works, then like we've already derisked the implementation or rather, we've already derisked the strategy.
17:47
We know that this playbook works to get from here to here.
And so it really comes down to degree of execution of the founders and their enthusiasm around it.
And a lot of that comes down to humility and saying, like, OK, you've taken more companies from a million a month to many, many millions a month than I have.
18:05
So I'll just use your playbook.
If they can say that, they'll crush it.
But it's still hard for a lot of founders.
Because here's the thing that if you're watching this or listening to this that you might not get is that somebody who's doing $1,000,000 a month might feel like they're the coolest, richest person they know.
And this kind of goes to a different statement that I have which is like if you feel really good about yourself you just need to get into a different room is that you need to try harder stuff.
18:27
And so like the I've said this before but like one of my neighbors took him like $935 million in income last year, income not revenue income for a company that he wholly owns 100% of.
So 45 years in the making and does 3.7 billion in top line revenue and paid I'm pretty sure no income tax on it because he has a massive real estate portfolio that he depreciates against it.
18:55
And so when I walk into that room the air is sucked out of it or the other way when he walks into a room the air is sucked out of it and so is my ego because he's much better at it than I am, right.
And so like, and this is half note to founders, is that, like there's always a bigger fish.
19:11
And so just a piece of advice there is that like you don't, you stand a lot more to gain from listening than talking.
So the third belief that I've doubled down on is the theory of constraint.
And so if you're familiar with, there's a book called The Goal by Eli Goldblatt, I think.
19:29
I think that's his name.
Anyways, I haven't read the whole book.
I've read part of the book, but enough to I think I actually learned about theory of constraint before I read the book.
Doesn't matter.
Anyways, point is, is that every single system has a single point of constraint and if you properly identify the constraint and then relieve the constraint, the business will grow until its next constraint.
19:46
Which is why sometimes you see businesses go from like 300,000 a month to three million a month just straight line, and then they hit a wall and that wall is the next constraint.
And right now, if you're not moving as fast as you want or you've been the same exact line of revenue for a year, it means that you're doing the wrong stuff, You're focusing in the wrong area, or probably more realistically, you're focusing in too many areas and none of them are the ones that matter.
20:08
And so we have really ingrained the theory of constraint into our operating model as a holdco in terms of how we prioritize what companies do.
And so if you think about strategy, it's just a fancy word for priorities.
Right.
And so strategy is how you choose to allocate limited resources against unlimited options.
20:28
There's technically anything that you could do, but the question is what should you do that will get you the most bang for your buck, the most return on your energy, time, money.
So to give you a tactical realization of this, we used to have a six week diagnostic process where we do a huge deep dive into every single department of the company.
20:46
And then we'd have 100 plus different things that we thought were wrong with the business.
And then we'd say, OK, here's 100 things that are wrong with the business and let's start at the top and start checking them off.
What ended up happening was that founders became a, incredibly overwhelmed and B, they felt really bad about themselves and C, wherever they started.
21:07
Sometimes that would change things down the line on the other items that we had snapshot identified as problems.
So for example, if you change the branding of a company which does take longer, you might all of a sudden attract better customers who are less likely to churn.
And so churn might have been an issue that we wanted to resolve with tactical inputs like better onboarding process, better explanation, better activation points, lead, you know, leading indicator metrics, etc, etc.
21:30
That we do on the decreasing churn side.
But if we fix the brand issue, then all of a sudden the churn issue might disappear.
And so some of our, you know, the identification of all these problems might actually be moot by the time we would get to that issue in the future.
And so we've radically changed our approach to the businesses and just said we will look at everything in a much shorter period of time and just say what are the three things that they should absolutely work on and in what order.
21:58
And if we have three things, it would usually be because there are things that could be worked on concurrently that do not affect one another.
If there were things that had to be done in sequence, then it might just be the one thing that matters most.
And so for example, if we had a, a company that was, I don't know, stuck at 1,000,000 bucks a month and all the metrics were Okay and they're outbound, I might say Okay, you've got 20 sales guys, let's get to 40.
22:20
That's the constraint.
And so I'd be like founder, anything that you talk to me about that is not how we're hiring, onboarding and training new sales reps, I do not care about that.
Is it massive focus on the constraint and then the business double s, right.
And then when we do that, we look at it again and say what is the biggest constraint, It could still be going from 40 to 60 sales guys and that might yet again be the biggest constraint.
22:41
We do it again, right.
And so we look at this on a quarterly basis and think what is the one thing that is limiting this business's growth.
And by simply laser focusing on that, we achieve higher growth rates and way less stressed out founders.
And I think the beauty of that is that they actually grow faster by doing less, which is beautifully elegant, which is everything what we're about, which is doing high leverage activity.
23:04
So if you didn't know anything, I'll give you a little sidequest here.
The acquisition is not com logo.
It's comprised of three separate ideas that have been combined together, which is why I like the logo so much.
One is that there's something called the three term contingency, which is that many frameworks are based on before, during, after.
And so oftentimes frameworks are triangles because they account for all three of those things just called a three term contingency, which is why triangles are cool for me.
23:27
The second thing is that this is a fulcrum for leverage, right?
So if I had a stick here, I could pull this and I could lift the world.
Archimedes, right.
The third is that I believe the single governing law above all else in business is supply and demand is at the end of the day, many people overcomplicated.
And what's interesting is that if you read some of the autobiographies from some of the wealthiest people in the entire world at the end of this, it's kind of like the full circle of like you just got to have something that a lot of, a lot more people want than you have supply of.
23:55
And then you learn all these terms and CP L's, and CP M's and and KP I's and metrics and and I T and leadership and recruiting and all the stuff.
And then at the end of your career, you say like at the end of the day, you just need something that a lot of people want, right, That more people want than other people can supply it for, right.
24:12
And so this is true in real estate markets, it's true in stock markets, it's true on the micro level of actually transacting in business.
All of those things are true.
And so I believe that's why we have this logo.
And so when we focus with the theory of constraints, we focus on what thing will give us the absolute most leverage on the resources that we deploy in the business.
24:33
Because if you really zoom out, I said strategy was prioritization and it's because every business has limitations.
We have time, money, energy, etcetera.
And so the best founders, the ones that move the fastest, are actually efficient allocators of resources.
24:50
And so in the beginning, you have to learn all these micro skills.
But once you get your first real level of leadership, and I'm talking executive leadership, then you're zooming out and saying, OK, we have all of these people, We can only really pick one or two big things.
Which of these things will get us the closest to our ultimate goal over the next 12, I'll say 12 years, 12 months, five years, 10 years.
25:12
And then you take that one big bet.
And that's ultimately we're trying to get to with all of the portfolio companies.
So let me give you a simple example of theory constraints.
So let's say that you are a deadlifter and you can deadlift 500 pounds is your current best lift OK?
25:29
And let's say that your back, your legs, your quads, everything can handle a 700 deadlift, but your grip can only handle 500.
If you go do more lat work and more hamstring work and more quad work to get all those muscle stronger, what have you actually done?
25:47
You've added potential to the system, but not more throughput, and so you might have gone from a 700 potential Max with every other muscle to an 800 potential Max with every other muscle.
But your grip is still limited by 500.
So six months later, when you do all that strength and you expended all the energy, allocate all those resources, ate all that food, what's your deadlift?
26:05
It's still 500, and this is where a lot of businesses stay stuck.
Now you could say 500, you could say 500,000 a month.
It still works the same way.
And so instead of doing that and then all of a sudden somebody comes in and says dude, let's just do grip work and put everything else on maintenance.
And then all of a sudden they go 50 every month in growth because their grip gets so much stronger that they can get all of a sudden to an 800 pound deadlift and they go from 500,000 a month to 800 thousand a month in a very short period of time.
26:32
And it's because the actual constraint of the business was identified and properly deconstrained and then the business just grows on its own.
And that's the crazy part about this that I have now learned is that once you deconstrain a business, it will just continue to grow until it hits the next constraint.
If we're investing in a business, it's usually because we see somebody who's dead lifting 200 pounds that has 1000 back and just needs 800 pounds of grip work.
26:55
And we can just see that we just fix that one thing and then they go from 200,000 a month or 2 million a month to 10 million a month from that one change.
And those are the huge leverage gains that we try and pick and find.
And it's a big picture here, is that like we prefer across everything to find businesses where it's about more better, whereas how can we do more what we're currently doing, how can we do it better?
27:16
Because often times that is the constraint and it's just not nearly as sexy as most entrepreneurs will think it is because they get distracted by something new and something exciting.
But the business doesn't exist to satisfy your personal needs.
The business exists to satisfy the market's needs.
And the market may need you to just keep doing more of what you're doing and keep doing it better from a mathematical perspective, and I talk about this in my book, $100 Million Leads.
27:37
You can actually identify what the constraint of the business is by fixing an absolute improvement across every function of the business and seeing which of them when multiplied together gives you the most increase.
So let's say we in a micro example of just a sales setting, we had 50% of people were scheduling, 10% of people were showing and then 50% of people who showed for their appointment closed.
27:58
That's current state to identify the constraint.
And if you're like wow, this is an obvious example that is the point.
But I'm going to show you how math wise you can prove it is that if I take a fixed amount of improvement, so I say 50% schedule rate goes to 60%, what's my improvement?
I get a 20% improvement across the board, right?
28:15
So if I multiplied it through .6 * .1 * .5, you'd be at 1.2 of whatever the original number was, all right?
So it'd be 20% improvement if I do a 10% improvement on the close rate, So going from 50 to 60, I again would have the same multiplication through and I have a 20% improvement.
28:30
But if I go from 10% show rate to 20% show rate, then what would happen?
I would double my throughput.
And so the area where you get the largest increase in throughput from the same fixed increment of improvement is what the constraint of the businesses.
28:47
Now sometimes we look at companies like that come to us like this and I'm like, dude, we can take the show rate from 10% to 50% and just like that we 5X the business.
They're like, but we've got all these.
It's like I don't want to talk about anything that isn't show rate.
I don't want to talk about anything.
If it's not show rate, I can't hear you.
29:05
And having that kind of ruthless discipline is what will ultimately grow a business.
And the beauty of finding these big value unlocks is that it's so much less work than all of the brute force that they're usually pushing through the market.
The last set of beliefs are the beliefs that I was wrong about and have cinched, rewritten and taken a new view on.
29:25
And so there are five of them.
So this would be the meatiest one of our buckets.
So number one is disruptibility by a I.
So obviously the world's changed in the last, I mean 30-6 months.
The world's changed the access to A I, the knowledge about A I and some industries are beginning to get disrupted and I don't think that's going to stop.
29:40
And so now one of our big criteria is how likely do we think that A, I will have a huge disruption on this industry, right.
You know, if we have a mechanic shop, it might be less likely to get disrupted compared to a design shop, right?
That does graphic design, right.
And so that would be like that's how we'll start waiting companies because again, a lot of it remember thing that risk factor of enterprise value.
30:01
Well, what's the likely that this company is going to continue on?
Well, if there's a massive likelihood of disruption from an A I, it's not to say that they're going to go out of business, but we're going to have to basically risk product market fit fix.
Again, it's basically starting over in the future.
Now that's where having amazing founders is really important, But is it a risk that if I can't avoid it, I can.
30:21
So I do.
So that's bucket number one.
So belief #2 is bigger chunks of bigger companies.
And so this is actually a pretty pretty typical investor path.
And in the beginning we were investing in smaller chunks and I think part of that was because like I was getting into it and so I didn't want to, you know, I don't want to make as big a bets with companies.
30:41
That's that's partially me.
The other part of it is like we've gotten better and better at it in terms of like the value add.
We're just like clearer like we're just tighter and tighter and tighter at what we do.
And like I said earlier, it's not a quantity game.
And so like if you find one Facebook, you don't need to really invest in anything else.
I mean, you can look at Berkshire Hathaway right now.
30:58
Like over half of their portfolio is just Apple and they're huge, you know what I mean?
And they're still, but their largest holding by a mile is Apple today.
So there's the best investors in the world.
I think last time I checked, Warren Buffett has already made $90 billion on the trade he made for Apple.
And so yeah, like Warren's G and the fact that he's still getting the returns he is with so much capital allocate is mind blowing for us not buying Apple, just the idea of having taking, you know like buying bigger chunks of bigger companies forces us to be even more disciplined in which opportunities we really want to pursue that we think we can both Dr. Meaningful value but also have tailwinds and grips that need to be strengthened that we can easily unlock huge value.
31:39
And a big part of that is that like you can have a smaller chunks of many pieces of pie strategy if you're not doing a lot of value at.
And so if you're a passive investor, if you're buying and trading stocks, you can have 100 stocks in your pool, it doesn't really matter.
Like you're not doing anything, you just buy them.
That's it.
But for us, because our value add is active, we have to be like prioritization, right, Limited resources and limited options.
32:00
We have a lot of options to invest our time and money into, but which are the buckets that we think we're going to get the highest return on.
And so that is what we choose to allocate our time and energy towards, which is meaning if I'm going to allocate this, I should take a bigger bet on it.
And so for context here, when we're thinking about like opportunity size, we're looking at companies that really at minimum we think we can get to a $50 million plus exit, but ideally 100 million plus.
32:24
And part of the benefit of the founders that come into acquisition.com is they get to work off of my scale of what's meaningful.
And so one of the things is like if you hang around with a lot of poor people, you'll adopt A poor ruler stick right?
32:41
And so for a poor person and again you can tell how wealthy someone is by the increments of money and time they talk about.
So the wealthier someone is the longer the time rise and they talk about and the bigger the the the bigger.
The money stick is meaning they talk about increments and millions.
Like literally on Wall Street term is a stick.
32:57
They even have a a shorthand for what $1,000,000 is.
It's like 2 sticks, 5 sticks, right, Because that's literally a a measurement unit.
When I was really poor, a Chipotle Burrito was a measurement unit of how much money I made.
I knew that this paycheck would buy me this many Chipotle burritos.
I was like wow, I got 200 Tripoli burritos, right?
33:12
I knew how long, how many, how many meals it would literally buy me, right.
And so as you level up, your ruler changes.
And so one of the benefits of just like when you work out with someone who's way stronger than you, if you hang out with someone who's way richer than you, you start to adopt their time rises and their their money measuring sticks.
33:31
And so if it's going to be meaningful for me, I typically have a higher net worth than most of the founders of the companies that I invested because most of the times they're first or second time founders.
And so if I think it's meaningful for us to have a I think we can get this to 250 million, it's usually meaningful for them.
But somebody else who might be broker might think, well, I'll take a $20 million exit.
33:52
To me, it's just not as it just it's not going to change my life at all.
And so for me, I want to allocate my time to things that like any one of them could change my life in a meaningful way.
And the whole underlying principle around this is actually a a phrase I heard from Sean Savatsu, who's the president of Real that publicly traded a real real estate brokerage.
34:09
And one of his mentors told him this, which is she only has to get rich once.
And so our goal with the founders is that like I said, this beginning is that this is the best deal they've ever done and they should only have to make this one good deal one time.
And so we take them from where they are to a a level of exit or a level of enterprise value if they want to keep it for the long haul either or that they don't have to get rich again.
34:31
Like they get rich once and they are set for life and they create generational life changing law.
That is the idea.
And again This is why it is a founder friendly company.
In terms of how we structuredacquisition.com believe #3 is that I don't need the business to be perfect.
So I think in the beginning, I was looking for unicorns that don't really even exist.
And the more I've just kind of been in the game, it's just like every business has skeletons.
34:51
Every business has bodies buried everywhere.
And so the question is like, are these bodies material to the likelihood that it's going to be here tomorrow?
And so we don't need businesses to be perfect in order for us to invest in This is partially like a soft plug, which is like, I've had a number of founders like, I want to fix this, this thing.
35:07
I have this huge issue where they're like embarrassed about it.
It's like I I told you there was going to had 25% monthly churn, which is atrocious, right?
But they had other things that were really good and we're like, all right, well, we can fix this.
This is a grip issue.
Like in some ways if you have a massive hole, sometimes it's like you're about like, we can help you unlock a mass amount of growth really quickly rather than waiting and slogging through on your own not knowing what to do.
35:26
And so yeah, like imperfect business is the name of the game.
The question is what is the potential?
So how strong are their backs compared to the grip that we can identify as the constraint?
Belief #4 is that a business doesn't need a compounding vehicle within the business at the point of the acquisition.
35:41
Meaning if a company doesn't have something that compounds unto itself some flywheel that continues to spin, it doesn't mean that it's a bad business.
It means that it's an opportunity for us to install one of those flywheels.
So I'll give you an example, a couple different flywheels.
So if you continue to make content and your audience can compound month over month over month, then it means that no matter how big the company gets, it can still grow by 10% each month.
36:04
Because those people tell other people, right.
If you have a compounding vehicle for capital, they don't mean that like we have a way that we can reinvest capital every X period of time and get Y return.
And it doesn't matter whether we're investing $1,000,000 or $100 million, we're still going to get the same return.
36:19
And so that is something that can compound over time.
Berkshire Hathaway is a compounding vehicle for capital for money, right?
If we have an incredibly strong word of mouth strategy, right where every person who comes in brings 1.3 people with them, then whether we have 10 customers or 10,000 customers, it will still compound unto itself.
36:37
You pretty much have to have a compounding vehicle to unlock crazy levels of growth and enterprise value.
And that's what most companies who are going to acquire for the several $100 million and up are going to look for is that there's at least one vehicle that compounds independent of scale.
36:53
And so we just try and find OK, even if this company doesn't have one, what could it be and do we feel confident that we can make that flywheel spin.
So a simple example is like you can calculate the hypothetical Max of a business by multiplying sales velocity by a lifetime value, all right, our lifetime gross profits.
37:08
So we've got a business that does $1000 a month, agency service.
The average customer stays for 10 months.
That company signs up 10 customers a month.
Even at $1000 a month, we know that month one we're going to get 10,000, right?
Month two we're going to be at 19,000 because we're going to lose one from the first month because we have a 10 month Ltd, so it's 10 month churn.
37:30
So churn would actually be like 8%, but point being you're going to lose someone from churn and then it'll be an asymptote which basically looks like this on a chart.
Basically month one you have the most growth, month 2 by percentage you have a little less, less less until eventually it flatlines.
That flatline is a hypothetical Max that you can calculate for yourself, which is sales velocity, which is number of units multiplied by the lifetime value or lifetime revenue of every average customer.
37:55
So in this example, if it was $1000 a month, the average person stays 10 months, then $10,000, just the lifetime revenue from the customer.
And if we sell 10 customers a month consistently, then 10 * 10,000 is 100,000.
So this company will not grow past $100,000 a month unless we either increase the number of units sold or we increase the lifetime value.
38:15
Now let's say we double the lifetime value, what's going to happen?
It'll just continue out again until it re plateaus at 200,000.
What if we just double the sales velocity mean we sell twice as many customers just from 10 to 20.
Well we'll do it again and we'll we'll hypothetically Max at $200,000 a month.
38:33
And so the idea is that when we see one of these issues or see one of these businesses, we have to have a way that we can see basically uncapped growth.
And so that means we need to put a higher leverage front end in so that we can actually grow the number of sales that we get every single month or that we can increase the lifetime revenue of every customer every single month.
38:51
That is the idea.
And so I used to reject companies that didn't have a compounding vehicle because honestly it was just my own.
I don't know pickiness if you want to call it that way, but just being like well you need to have XY&Z and I I want to see that.
But now I see it actually just has a big opportunity for us to add huge value to the business with not a ton of effort on our part because we just know we can identify how to implement those flywheels in a business.
39:15
So for example, if we have a like one of our companies has a founder driven face, right and they use organic content in order to generate the vast majority of their leads.
And so for us, what do we do?
Well, he has a fixed number of media people and he puts out X number of content.
And so for us to improve that, we can increase the number of content which is a linear improvement, but we can make the quality of the content better, which is a exponential improvement.
39:39
And so if we do that then we know that his audience will grow disproportionately every single month and keep getting bigger and bigger.
And so that's a very big unlock for us to continue to get more and more leads every single month, month after month with a limited one time effort.
On the flip side, if we were to, you know, change the deal structure on something so that we can massively extend the LTV of a company like cutting turn from 10% to 3%, then we will unlock huge amount.
40:01
Not what we'll do is it'll unlock growth until the new hypothetical Max.
To be real, there are sometimes where the hypothetical Max gets unlocked to, let's say $4 million a month and the company's doing 500,000 a month.
I'm good with that win, right?
Like even if it's not forever, we can still basically linearly grow now that we've unlocked this next level until we tap out at $4 million a month.
40:21
And at that point we have a $200 million sale if that's what the guy wants or he just wants to keep printing money, which we're also okay with. 5th belief is that businesses should have Gray hair on the team and it doesn't mean literal Gray hair, but it's more been there, done that.
And so think about this is 8020 and this is kind of Leila and I's rule of thumb is that 20% of your team should have already been to where you're trying to go.
40:39
And this is super important, especially for first time founders because what I was mentioning earlier, we have one brain that becomes the cap of the business, right.
And so if you're teaching everyone how to do everything, the likely that you're going to make it a massive business, especially on a short time horizon is really low.
When I say short, I mean like five years.
40:55
So like you can't solo get your way to like 10 or you know like 20 years later you can get there.
It's just to take so much more effort for one person to download their brain into that many people.
And you have to be exceptionally smart because you got to learn really deep on lots of things.
It's not realistic or at least it's not my preferred way to grow.
41:11
And so we want at least 20% of the team, which sometimes we have to right size and say, hey, we need two big leaders or experienced leaders who have been there, done that in these functions to get us where we want to go.
An example that would be like pulling in a true CFO for a company that's at $1,000,000 a month and say, OK, this person is going to help us get all this stuff cleaned up.
41:29
So that in a year and a half or two years we can be at two and a half million a month and we can actually have audited financials and actually do an exit.
Or let's say we're in a company that that the founders the the was the salesman moves up to managing a team of three to five sales people.
But he's never really stood up and scaled a sales team well.
41:46
Sometimes it's good to bring in an outside person who scaled multiple companies from 5 to 50 and have that person come in that role move the founder over so they're operating or doing something else that they actually do have more experience or expertise in.
And so the idea is we want someone who has Gray hair or most people in Gray hair on the team so they can also be mentors to the rest of the team.
42:05
It also gives an interesting feeling of stability for attracting talent.
So especially if you're a younger founder, like having a few people in their 40s or 50s on the team, when other people who are new and talented are interviewing, they're like, OK, this is a stable thing.
This isn't just like 4 kids who like are doing this in their basement.
42:22
And like, again, this isn't me hating on that.
I love you guys and that's why I'm telling you this.
But like when Layla, when Layla was 23 and I was 26 or seven, we hired Suzanne, our CFO.
And I won't say what Suzanne's age, Don't worry Suzanne, She'd been in the industry 35 years and she had been Southside 40 times and she'd been on the founder's side of the table selling 40 times.
42:43
She'd done a $15 billion, a 5 billion, a 1 billion and her most recent transaction was 750 million.
And so we felt really confident that she had the experience to help our company, which at the time was valued about 150 million.
And you feel like, wait, didn't you sell for 50?
Yeah, I did.
I sold for way undervalue, if you like.
42:59
I just being very upfront about it.
I sold a gym company during COVID.
So like take that for what you want, but it's because I wanted to do this more.
And for me, I knew that I'd for me when I'm gung ho on something and this is what I think about every morning, like it was the right move for what I needed to do.
43:14
So it's going to be a great investment for the private equity firm that bought it anyways.
Gray hair on the team can give you a little bit more emotional stability, can give you somebody to bounce ideas off of, can implement things that you don't know because here's a a good litmus test for this.
In the interview process, if you don't feel like you're learning something from the person you're interviewing, it's not the right person.
43:36
So if it's a role or department that you don't have experience in.
So if it's like you're hiring for HR, you're hiring for finance, you're hiring for IT, you're hiring for marketing, whatever department you don't know anything about, if you feel like you know more than the person you're interviewing don't hire.
They should be teaching you.
And that is actually where the next level of education happens As a founder is the talent that comes in your company because you've built something of appreciable enough size that you can attract a higher level of talent.
44:02
And then everyone starts getting better and cross pollinating and cross learning.
And transparently one of the big competitive most that we have at acquisition.com is that we have a big brand.
And so we are able to attract really high level talent that a smaller company might not otherwise be able to attract.
44:18
They will respond to our emails.
They will take our phone calls.
They will do our interviews.
And they will believe us when we vouch for a company because they know there is a, don't take this the wrong way, a professional or legitimate investor that backs the company, right.
And so in that way, we have, I mean, this is a competitive mode.
This is an advantage for us and so that we can get a disproportionate amount of value in a company that that the IQ per square foot we can jam into a company goes way up and then that unlocks a huge amount of growth that founders wouldn't otherwise have experienced.
44:45
Yeah.
And so at the beginning, I promised to give you a checklist of things that would increase the likelihood that you could get selected as a portfolio company or move further in the process with us.
And just as a quick side note.
And if you go through the process, my promise to you is that as long as you're meeting the basic level of quantitative qualifications, if we decide not to do a deal with you, we will still give you what our recommendations are that you can benefit from for your company.
45:07
And we will tell you the things that we think you should fix that would make us interested in again.
Or we want to say, hey, this might not be our type of deal, but we'd still recommend you do these things that would increase the value of the company.
And that's our way of trying to always make leave everyone better off than we found them.
So that's one of my promises to you.
And if you ever feel like you didn't get that, please let us know.
45:24
That being said, checklist.
So one is know your numbers.
Like if you don't know your numbers, it makes it really hard to assess anything.
It's also kind of a leading indicator that someone's like really not that organized.
And if you want to get really big scale, you got to know your numbers.
So that's like seen Shark Tank the first thing this is like know your numbers #1, #2 don't this is like the correlator but feels separate which is don't inflate your numbers, all right.
45:45
Which is, you know if sometimes I don't really get this, it's like you're not going to talk to me, right.
Like it's not like you're hopping on the phone.
That's like, that doesn't happen until we close deals.
So you're not going to like fool us and be like, Oh yeah, we're doing a million a month and we'll be like, cool, send us the financials and then it's like, oh, you're you did $1,000,000 last year.
46:03
That's not $1,000,000 a month.
Well, yeah, but I mean, like, we're gonna and it's like that that don't like that'll immediately disqualify.
And we'll also like not really be inclined to like give you a big laundry list as if because you've lied to us.
So don't do that #3 is having a big goal.
And so this is important because I said earlier that you get to adopt some of my litmus test or my measuring sticks for for money.
46:23
Is that like if someone comes in and says they want to have a $20 million exit or something?
Like there's nothing wrong with that.
It's just it's not interesting to us because I have to allocate our resources and it has to be the biggest bangs for Buck in terms of founders.
Like it's not about the size of the company, it's about the size of the founders vision.
46:39
And so if the founder has, you know, 5-10 locations of a thing and they want to go national and they're like gung ho and they're mission driven and they love the product and they've great repeat customers because there's amazing word of mouth and like, I'm let's do it, you know what I mean?
Like I'm in for it.
But if someone's like, yeah, I just want to get to, you know, 20 locations and then exit.
46:57
Unless it was like us buying majority up front and then them staying on for a period of time to then help them like, you know, exit from that perspective, then maybe that's what we do.
But that's because for us, we're going to want to do something that's going to go big, #4 is speed and decision making.
So there's a kind of like parallel sides.
So speed is one of the best ways.
47:14
And I learned this from Mark Roberge in Sales Acceleration Formula.
You can actually test someone's attention to detail and work ethic by the speed that they communicate.
And so if someone is very quick to respond throughout the entire process, we know that they'll be very highlighted to be very quick to respond as a founder inside the portfolio.
47:31
And so the way you act during the deal process is a great predictor for us or a great measuring stick for us to see how you're going to act afterwards.
And so there's many founders that we disqualified simply based on their behavior during the process because the bigger thing that we're looking at is who you are.
The secondary thing we're looking at is the company that you own and the company that we're investing in.
47:49
And that again is because of the big lessons that we have learned, is that the tale of two companies.
So how you act is more important than what you own.
For us and our business model, the decision making is also a function of speed, but it's really the way that you approach decisions.
48:07
So if we have somebody who is really skittish, really back and forth, says yes, then no and changes their mind, that is very hard to do business with from a deal process and then post deal.
If we're like, okay, let's implement this price change and like, yeah, let's do it.
And they're like, oh, wait, what if this happens?
48:22
Oh wait, no, I wanted to actually.
I do want to do it like very, very hard, very erratic, really tough. #5, I think I'm on five is focus.
And this is, I said it was a point earlier, but I'm reemphasizing this because there's a couple ways to get this manifest.
One is the guy who owns 10 companies and you're like, well, wait, Alex, you own 10 companies.
48:40
I'm not CEO of 10 companies.
Big difference.
Just like you can own 10 stocks for 100 stocks.
All right?
Like, I'm not CEO of this companies.
I am.
I'm not even CEO of this company.
I'm founder of this company, all right?
And I just make videos if somebody comes in and says, like, help me grow this thing.
And it's like, yeah, this is like, I only, it's only 5 hours a week and I've got this and you know, like all that.
48:58
Like, no, like we just say like, Nah, I'm good, man.
Pick one and we'll have you grow that one and get rid of the rest of them.
And so yeah.
And so those founders, we don't work well with and then focus from a future perspective.
So if someone's like, hey, I want to do all these things and and we need to like there's so much money on the table and we need to vertically integrate and we need to add this thing.
49:18
I need to build a software.
It's like dude like you sell cleaning services.
Calm down like let's just sell more cleaning services.
And for some founders, that answer is too difficult because their emotional needs for novelty surpass their deeper desire for growth or impact real talk.
49:38
Like your short term need for something new surpasses your long term need to make a big difference.
We need those to be flipped.
We need someone to say, man, I would love to be distracted by these shiny things, but I know all I need to do is keep doing these things.
And I would like your help to unlock all of these levels of growth.
49:55
That is the type of founder that we want to work with.
Number six is the the beer at the airport test.
But I do like this because I think it's very simple.
If we don't look forward to talking to you, we just won't do the deal.
And this one actually like more and more and more like I'm so stoked about the companies that we have in the portfolio and in the pipeline right now.
50:12
Like, I like all of them.
And a mentor of mine said this and I really like it.
He said the litmus test for doing deals at he's at our level, I was very honored by that was if you wouldn't do, if you wouldn't help the person for free, don't help them as a part of a deal.
50:28
And he's like, that's how I have to feel about it, is that like, I want to help this person and the economics is only there to just make it make sense.
But like, that was a great litmus test for me to say, like, am I looking forward to hopping on calls or talking to this person or like having dinner with them or seeing them, you know, having them fly out or whatever.
50:47
And it's not really advice for me to use, like be a cool person.
She's like talking about a cool person, right?
But that is a huge part of it, right?
And I will share something that has been interesting and not necessarily a red flag, but just something that I have found, which is Y Combinator, for example, doesn't even accept solo founders.
51:05
So Ycommer is one of the probably the the most storied incubators in Silicon Valley and they judge exclusively off founders and they their entire process is 10 minute interviews.
And that's that's how they make the call.
And when you talk to the founders, they say, when I say found founders of YC, they say we could do it in three, we just would feel impolite.
51:23
So we do it in 10 like to give you some context of how important they bet on the jockeys plural.
And so one of the things that we have noticed is that the growth rate in general of companies, again, there's always exceptions, but in general companies that have more founders or more vested partners, key point doesn't have to be like Okay, there's three founders, they're all 1 thirds.
51:43
It could be a solo founder with three people who have some sort of equity percentage that feel ownership over the business that are really stallions that can really drive stuff.
Those companies in general do better because you have more brains working on the thing that are independently intelligent and problem solving.
51:59
And in that tale of two companies that I was telling you earlier, this is 3 equal founders, one founder 100%.
So it's like we've seen these types of examples because if you have a founder who's over customer success, a founder over marketing and founder over sales, you can implement changes and improvements in all three departments and know that they're all getting done every quarter.
52:17
Whereas if a solar founder might be like, all right, I can do the sales one this quarter, the marketing one next quarter and the success one the quarter after that.
So we can get three times the rate of progress.
Now in theory, you want other people who can execute those things on your behalf, but sometimes when you're earlier on, you don't have the ability to attract that level of talent.
52:34
And again, that's how we come in.
And so, yes, big picture, be speedy, be honest, actually have the numbers that you say you do, be focused on the actual business that you say you want to have.
Have a big dream for where you want to go because it has to be compelling for us, be cool and have other stallions that are in the stable with you trying to run in the same direction.
52:54
And tip #7 is more of an observation than it is a command or recommendation, having a few other people on the team that have a little bit of equity.
When I say a little bit, I'm not saying give 10% of the company.
I'm saying give one or two percent that can invest over a few years of the company to get people bought in.
Like when we sold Jim Launch, we didn't own 100% of it.
53:10
I think we sold we, we owned 94 percent or something like that.
And so it's okay to let other people make money.
And I think the trade is almost always worth it.
And so again, multiple founders or multiple vested parties in it is just a plus.
53:26
It's not a requirement.
It is an observation that we have seen in terms of me equipping you with the things that make you most likely to go through and win with us.
And my last piece of advice, since we spent the whole time talking about the acquisition.com business model, is that if you're a company that's doing over $1,000,000 a year in profit or $2,000,000 a year in profit if you were kind of a founder face, obviously if you're not a founder facing, you're doing over $2,000,000 Here, that works too.
53:48
Go to acquisition.com, fill out the form, and our team will be in contact with you.
And we'd love to help you understand more about the business, See where we can unlock value.
And the worst case scenario is you get a full plan of what we would do on your behalf if we were to work with you.
And the best case scenario is that we partner with you and we take this thing to the moon.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
It's going on everyone.
Happy Tuesday.
Welcome to the high-ticket secrets group, and today I'm going to be talking about, I'm going to talk to you about how to teach 2x your show operates and how my sales team always doubled sales.
And every Market, they were in on these five days.
0:34
This is a story that I tell probably every single day I am on the sales coaching calls for Jim watch.
And I tell it every time because it is worth telling every time and and so let me enjoy.
0:51
So every so for those of you don't know, so, Jim launch before we created the business that we have now where we showed you, one knows exactly how we filled Jim's actually started filling up.
Jim's first, right?
It's crazy concept.
I actually feel my gyms, right?
Need six of them filled those, but then I was like, hey, let's take the show to the road.
1:09
Let me see if I can if I can fill up other people's Jim's, right?
And so, I started flying around and going from Market to Market 28 markets in total on my own with my wife going out and literally setting up a tent outside of gyms in the middle of nowhere and turning on ads, and selling 100 people on average in a 21-day period at a 5.
1:29
Under dollar ticket.
And these are guys, these were markets where people were selling hundred dollar memberships and struggling to do that and I would tell them that this is what we were going to do and they were like, well, good luck with that.
I was like, okay and it's kind of shows the power of belief.
But anyways, that's not the point of the story.
The point of the story is that after we started doing that because we wanted to make sure that it works in every single marker before we, you know, we would, you know really invest even more money into this.
1:53
After we had done that, we started to hire a sales team.
So in the first month we hired the sales team, I went right out the gate, you know, swing in and we hired six guys right off the bat.
And so we started six gyms at the same time where I'd fly salesman out, put them up in the hotel, we pay for the rental car, pay for the flights pay for everything, pay for adspend pay for commission's, right?
2:14
And then still, with all of that be able to make a profit.
And so for those of you were doing rupture companies, you're leaving a lot of money on the table.
Let's put it that way.
But whatever.
Anyway, Point is this, is that the way that this that it had to work was that they would be on site for 21 days, right?
2:29
It was three weeks on when we walked out that that was the deal that I haven't sales guys and so they would stay there for 21 days, usually the younger guys, but some of them are married which is, and which is why we ended up switching over the model because it's really hard on them.
But but in the first two weeks, they would always have like, in the neighborhood of like, you know, 50-ish percent show rate on their appointments, right?
2:52
And And I could say whatever I wanted to in like in terms of all the different things that we do to get people to show up because when I done this for me, I always had around a 70% show rate.
So I was like, what am I like?
What do we, what am I doing here?
You know, like how can I isolate this so that we can repeat it, right?
3:09
Which is why all the testing that we put into this stuff before we gave it to anyone was valuable because we spent lots of time in the day, figuring it out, but we ended up doing was.
And so, the last week invariably sales would always Double.
All right, so that's the last five days to answer the headline.
3:26
And so, the last five days of every campaign, the sales would always double right.
And I'll start looking into it.
I'm like, why are the sales doubling in the last one?
Like, what am I, how can I just have those last five days like a hole, right?
So like a lot of times, the guys would do literally 50 sales in the last week so they do 50 and their first two weeks and about 50 in their last week.
3:45
So for those of you not like kick, like for those of you keeping score at home, that means they're doing twenty five thousand dollars in upfront sales in their last five days at these.
Jim's.
Okay, so if you would like to have this, then you should probably listen.
And so the only thing that they actually changed right between the first 14 days and then the last week of them being at the gym, Was nothing.
4:08
And the only difference was that they knew that they were going to leave because if they could not get that person in the door by the time that they left, they would not get the sale.
And so what that does is it creates two things, scarcity and urgency, right?
4:23
But the difference is that people talk about scarcity and urgency but they don't believe in this Christian urgency that they're actually doing, which is why the best type of scarcity and urgency is real scarcity in urgency or be good enough to under, like to fool yourself into believing that it really Is real, but there's in my experience, there's nothing better than the real thing.
4:40
So how did, how did they get these people to show up at twice the rate that they would, in the weeks?
Prior, the script didn't change, right?
We didn't change the script, there was no script scripting, you know, whatever.
Right, the only thing that changed was how they said it was their voice.
4:56
Was their intonation, was their tonality was the pauses that they had, and then the eventual conclusions and how they talked about how they were going to get someone in the door, right?
And so if you're thinking like if you're like hey like Think think think through this as you're saying, like, as I'm saying this, so you're on the phone with, you know, a prospect and she's like, you know, I can't really make it in.
5:15
I'm really busy this week, he find us time for me next week, right?
If you're like scarcity mode, gym owner, then you're like, oh gosh, I don't want to scare them away.
Yeah, yes, yet we can we can find a time next week.
That's fine.
You know, just to next Tuesday.
Work, you know, and just FYI.
One of the first things I'll tell you, if you do end up joining, Jim launch, is that same day, next day appointments, that's it.
5:35
Same day next day.
They don't you say maybe next day, don't settle the like don't schedule the appointment because if it's not seen the next day, the likelihood that they show up on that third day is way way, way way way lower, okay?
And so you might as well not schedule them and then confronted as an obstacle on the phone call to get them to do same-day next day and the easy overcome for that Circle back to the finish.
5:55
What I was just saying is what time were you going to open?
Tell me.
You're planning on working out and then they'll usually tell you what?
I was planning on working out after work.
Okay?
What time you get off work, five, cool how 6:00 I gotta know.
Opening there.
Right?
You just come back at them and a lot of times, you can get someone schedule that way because you're asking through different vehicle and if they like, why can't make it, you know, tonight or tomorrow.
6:15
I'm like, oh, then what are you going to work out?
If you can make it two days were like, how many times we can plan on working out really?
Well, I'm trying to work out.
I'm like, well, least three, right?
So, every other day, well then, which of these two days where it's like, and then in this is, here's where the tonality ships.
Like I'll stay late for you.
All right?
I, and my shift is six.
6:31
I was like, but I'll stay at 7:00, you make it?
A seven most Nation real quick.
If you If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 1500 dollars, plus we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
6:56
And so it's the way they would talk about it because they knew that, if they did not get this, if they could not get them to come in, they wouldn't get the sale.
Because after that Friday, that last Friday they were on a plane home.
They weren't going to get the commission and so they would do everything in their power in the way they talked about it, they're like sure I'll come in early, I'll come in late.
7:14
Like, I don't know, I've got two points at this time, but can you come in later can like, they, they talked about it, like, they believe what they were saying because it was actually true.
And so, to me, that's fascinating, is marketer because nothing changed.
Except their belief in the fact that they knew they were going to leave in that?
7:29
There was no way for them to actually see this person and so if you can double sales simply by the fact that, you know, you're not going to be able to do it later.
Why can't you apply that same concept, even when you do know you're going to be able to do it later, right?
So you should do that.
7:46
Now, here's a belief that I would give you.
That is valuable for you if your struggle with this one.
The likelihood that someone actually like, shows up, if they let's say the schedule for days out, okay, the likelihood that they show up is 25% or less.
8:04
And that's if you're like really lucky, if it's four days out, okay?
Even with all the reminders in the world.
So now you have a one out of four chance that they show and let's say you close half, okay?
Now you've got one out of four that they show and then another 50% cut on that.
So now even twelve and a half percent of this person actually closing, right?
8:23
And so because this person has to reschedule then show and then close there's a lot of Hoops that has to happen for that person to actually become a customer.
And so if you want to actually help this person, then you need to understand the psychology behind someone who is just barely dip their toe.
In the water.
8:38
They were taking a poop, they swiped, right?
Whatever you don't.
I mean they opted in for, you know, a challenge or whatever it is your face.
Book add and like they just put this much effort into it.
And for them, they psychologically feel like they accomplished something just by saying that they signed up for the gym, right.
But the reality is that for us, that's where the story Begins for them.
8:55
A lot of time, that's where the story ends.
And so what we need to do is take them through this huge journey to get them actually show up the gym, right?
And so you need to awaken that in them by providing what scarcity and urgency and actually remaining the mill.
Why they even signed up in the first place, right?
9:10
And so man I totally lost my train of but The the point of this is that the belief that you need to have, there it is the belief that you need to have for yourself and for your salespeople and for your appointment Setters, or you're free, you're free or front desk for them to get people to show up and be able to exhibit that kind of scarcity.
9:29
Is that it really is scarce because if they don't show up tonight and they can't schedule an appointment tonight or tomorrow night, the likelihood that you will help them is 12 percent.
Right?
So, if it were me and my say that I want to help people, right?
Right.
Then I need to do as much as I humanly can to help them which is like the first part of that is to get them to show up.
9:50
And so if I need to create artificial scarcity, in order for them to take action in order for me to help them.
I'm willing to do that because I know that for them removing remote like removing the option of saying, hey, we don't you re schedules if I can double show up rates by saying that we don't do re schedules and then not doing them.
10:07
Well, great that cuts down my work and then it also helped me helped twice as many people That sounds like a win-win, right?
And so, if you can use these types of little strategies and then really, the main one is the belief that this person cannot schedule taters tomorrow, right?
That you can't see them.
10:23
And if you actually confine yourself to that window, you will talk differently, you will speak differently.
They will hear you differently.
And then the likelihood that they come in the likelihood that they sign up, in the likelihood that you can actually make an impact on their lives is dramatically increased, and so hopefully that was valuable for you.
10:41
But show up rates are a huge thing.
It's, I mean, even doctors, whatever, like everyone struggles with them and no matter what industry you're in right now struggles.
But like, I mean there's show no-shows cost time, right?
And so if you if you come at the angle of like I want to help this person and I need to maximize the likelihood that they show up.
11:01
And the thing that I need to do is you can implement the exact same thing that my sales team did accidentally, which was believed that they were going to leave and never see them again.
And so, if you actually can slam the door right, and do that with confidence and conviction because you're actually helping them by saying, we don't do reschedules, please confirm your appointment and the only reason we don't is because we want people are very serious.
11:23
That makes sense, you know, they're like, yeah, I get it right when you slam the door, you double the show up, right?
And then you have more people now.
Just here's a, here's a quick side note for that.
I had Chris and Robin Barnett, who did our fall hacker TV episode where we launched a gym in Boise, Idaho?
11:39
They did 171 signups in 19 days if anyone would like that, right?
If anyone's curious, I spent 9 Grand on the campaign to get 171 signups.
Do the math, still worked out.
Well, gotta gotta spend money to make money, but what happened there?
11:58
Last week, same, exact thing happened there, show up rate doubled, they would avoid five percent or almost double.
They went from 45 percent to 70 percent show up rate.
Then the only thing that happened is they said Can't you reschedule can't do it next week.
You have to get into the otherwise you're not going to be able to do it and so just like that they were able to double the productivity of their phone.
12:17
All of this entire process by the belief that they had in their voice and the way that they were approaching the sale.
So I hope this was valuable for you.
I guess, I hope that you stories of my sales guys and Kristen Robin or net was useful.
I promise you that same the next day, if you can confine yourself to that window, you will ultimately help more people by making them confront, the fact that it will take time and that they do.
12:39
Have to find a time that works well for them and just ask them.
When were you planning on working out anyways and then you can usually get in the back door that way to find a time, all right?
Lots of love.
Have an amazing day.
Happy Tuesday.
All right.









0:00
In this video I get really in depth on the actual scaling of a sales team process, the training process, the onboarding process, the management process, etcetera, so that you can scale sales within your organization.
The interview process, what we're testing for is the speed of response.
You can test work ethic by how quickly they get back to you because you are a lead to them #2 somebody who's intelligent.
0:17
So if somebody sounds like an idiot, then it's the impression that they're going to be giving up your brand.
The next one is you want somebody who can listen.
So someone's dominating the conversation.
They're talking.
They're, you know, motor mouthing, not a good idea.
You want somebody who's kind of an ambivert, somebody who can listen and can talk when it's time and socially aware.
You want someone who's coachable.
And so you can measure coachability by saying, hey, I want you to role play with me in this situation and you just give them a little bit of context.
0:36
I don't care about how well you sell me.
I just want to hear you talk through things.
And then what you'll do is you'll give them feedback and then ask them to try again.
Now if someone can take the feedback without an ego, then you have somebody who's coachable.
And if they make improvement on the second try, then you know that they can improve.
If someone is not coachable and they do not take feedback, well, you can already know way ahead of time that they're going to be terrible fit for the team.
0:53
Now at this point they have to transition their our knowledge of sales to your specific product or service.
Now I think one of the things that's overemphasized is product knowledge and what's under emphasized is prospect knowledge.
What we should be focusing on is who are we selling to more than what are we selling because who matters more in the sale, the person, the product, the person, right.
So we want to understand their problems so indepth because if you can explain to somebody exactly the problem that they're going through, they will buy whatever you have because they will believe that you so intrinsically understand what they're going through.
1:18
Once we've decided to hire this person, I like to have a 14 day onboarding period.
What is covered in the onboarding period is that we want them to listen to sales calls that are good.
Now if you don't have any sales calls that are good, like I would recommend you go and sell and do it well and then record those calls and have them listen to it.
You want them to be bathing in good sales.
1:34
All they're doing all day long is listening to sales calls, listening sales calls, listening sales calls.
And you can see if they watched it based on most software.
Once they've watched let's say about 40 different sales calls, they're going to have a pretty good idea.
Now in between those watchings, you want them to work on the script.
The script should be in my opinion, a question based framework, the framework of questions that lead someone naturally to the conclusion.
1:51
When I review the sales scripts for portfolio companies, when they're trying to improve, there wasn't a core decision that was articulated.
The salespeople in general would multiple times about the sale just say, do you have any questions for me?
Do you have any questions for me?
And that's an indication that the salesperson doesn't know how to close.
Clearly not following the script because you're not asking the prospect to come up with more reasons to not buy, right?
2:10
You're asking them to make a decision.
So you have to be very clear at the beginning of the call, which is clarifying why we're here and then labeling them with the problems.
That's the closer from it, Clarify why they're there.
Label them with a problem.
Overview their past experiences and pains.
Once you have that, you've gathered enough info, you say cool, I think you'd be a good fit and I'll tell you about it.
You get invited to sell, which is the S and then you explain in very short analogies why you think you're going to be able to solve two to three of the problems that they explained.
2:30
And then you ask for the sale and then E&R are explaining whether their concerns and then reinforce the decisions.
And so once we have a script, do you want to boil down the decision to the most basic unit possible?
And the reason you have to do that thinking is because you don't want them to try and think about what the decision is.
You want to give them the decision that they have to make by the end of the call.
2:47
And so if you were selling A/B to B service, it would be like the decision we have to make is whether you're going to make more money on your own then you will with us in excess of our fake.
What most people do is they just talk for 30 minutes and then they just present the price.
And they just don't have any structure of the conversation and they don't actually do any fact finding.
They go on off onto these, all these tangents.
3:02
Why are you here?
What is your problem?
What if you try to solve?
Here's how I think we can help you given what you just said to make this one decision, which is, can we help you more than you could on your own?
Yes or no.
Fantastic.
Close.
That's it.
Once we've clarified what that scripting needs to look like.
And that's big picture.
There's obviously wording, but for the sake of this video, I want to talk bigger picture.
3:18
So once you have that and this person has washed themselves in sales, they're studying the script, what you want to do is you want to role play with them and role play with them every morning during that process.
So they get better at it once they pass the role play test.
Right.
And you feel like, whoa, that sounds like a lot of work.
Well, it is a lot of work to build a great sales team.
Once they sell you on them, being able to have the sales conversation, then you put them on the floor on 1/2 schedule.
3:38
You're not going to give them a full schedule because you want them to blow through a ton of leads.
You give them a half schedule the second-half of the day, they're still reviewing the calls they had.
And then you're still meeting with them twice a day, beginning of the day, end of the day, the second week of this training.
When you're reviewing the sales cost with them, they now have fresh ones that they went through that you're you're going to give them feedback on.
3:54
Here's how you have these meetings.
When you do sales manager meetings, you're communicating the goals, which in sales is usually pretty straightforward.
You're making sure they're motivated and then you're training them.
That is the point of the job.
You motivate and you train.
As long as they're clear on what their Kpi's are 30 minutes before the call that you have with the new trainee, you listen to one or two of their sales calls at 2X, you know, speed, take written notes of all the things that you would want to improve When you get on the call, then, which would happen immediately afterwards because it's going to be fresh in your mind.
4:19
You then look at your notes and then you want to bold or prioritize one to two highest impact things that they can do.
Now there's probably 100 things that are going wrong, but you just want to start with the highest impact things and then you give them those things.
And it takes about 5 minutes to communicate that, 30 minutes to review and write the notes, 5 minutes to communicate the thing that the one to two highest leverage things that they can do to improve.
4:37
And then 25 minutes where you role play again with them with the new changes.
And then they go back the next day, they do more calls.
You listen to see if they did the thing.
They didn't do the thing.
Role play again the next day, you listen to recordings.
Now maybe they got it right and you say, hey, keep doing that, you're getting better.
Now let's also do this thing.
4:53
When someone says, I got to think about it.
When someone says I have to talk to my spouse or when someone says that's a lot of money, let's drill this, overcome this is what I need you to say.
You have to flex that muscle as many times you can get those reps in within that 25 minute period.
And so as you're scaling a sales team, you need to do that with all of the reps That is what sales management is.
5:08
It's not just like sitting there having one weekly meeting and checking in on people and asking them what their pipelines at.
You need to be reviewing sales calls with written notes, prioritizing where they can improve the most and then communicating and drilling them on those things.
Maintaining the culture of the team through three things.
One is having a leaderboard that is visual and UpToDate at all times.
5:27
Salespeople are competitive.
You want to foster that competition. #2 is that you want to have clear Kpi's and some sort of bonus.
And we like every 30 days to 42 days, every four to six weeks having some sort of big little thing that they can brag about, winning some sort of sales competition.
Of the different objectives that we have optimized for, the one that has worked best for all of our portfolio companies is optimizing for cash upfront.
5:46
There's three things.
One is the leaderboard, 2 is the KPI in competition, and the three is that you have to cut the bottom 10% on a If you're not cutting, you're communicating the team.
That's okay to suck and it will drag down the culture of the team.
And so the job of the manager besides the training is motivation.
Motivation comes from culture and the standards that we set for ourselves and what you agree to tolerate.
6:05
And so fundamentally, sales management is the skill of tolerance, is the person who tolerates the most is the one who has the weakest team.
You can tell the difference between the winning teams and losing teams, usually by the coach.
How can you have one coach go from a losing team in the NFL to almost undefeated team in one year?
Because of the leadership, because of the culture, because of the mojo, because we say we know longer tolerate these things.
6:24
Like if you want to be here, this is a world class sales organization and if you are on the scene, it means that you were bringing to that.
There was a time a few years back where our sales team got a little bit bloated, got a little bit fat and so I ended up cutting more than half the team.
And then I had a meeting with everybody afterwards and I wanted to reset the tone and I was like guys, if you were here, it's because A, we value and we think that you're a solid, but B, it's because we think that you're going to buy into the vision of what we will have for the future, which is we want to build a world class sales organization.
6:48
And if you want to stay on this team, then it means that you're agreeing to that.
And I don't want to say that you're inherently agreeing to that.
I want to let you guys sleep on it.
Because tomorrow, if you want to quit, that's fine.
You just let me know in the morning.
No harm, no foul.
I'd rather you just tell me because what we're going to go through is going to be a significant change.
And so if you're a sales manager coming into an organization, you say these are the new standards of what we will do.
7:05
I expect you to all attend our 5:00 AM training for an hour where we drill together.
I expect you to show up on time to every single call.
I expect you to clean your pipelines every single day and that you put the call notes in the CRM as required.
If you do not do those things, even if you're the best close on the team, I will fire you.
7:22
Are we clear?
And the reason I do that is because I want the culture of this team to be one of excellence in everything we do.
Because if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.
And so you have to set that tone on the team to get them to want to raise up.
And that's where the leadership of sales managers are so important.
As a side note, I have rarely found that the best salesperson is the best sales manager.
7:39
Sales managers tend to be more giving in general and more stable as people.
There's less emotional highs and lows.
They are more even.
They need to be the rock of the team that people look up to.
No one respects a sales manager who says do all these things and doesn't do it themselves.
And so they have to emulate or exemplify what work ethic looks like, what following through looks like.
7:59
Would finishing your checklist every day looks like being first to show up for the meeting in the morning before everyone else does.
Like you have to lead by example.
The last piece I want to hit on here is the cadence, which is what frequency are we talking to our salespeople The 1st 14 days, you're going to be talking to that person once or twice a day when they're getting on boarded.
Once they get out of that training wheels period, which is the half week, if they meet the quota, which is the minimum allowable close rate or whatever metric you want to use, then they can get a full schedule.
8:22
Once on the full schedule, they're still kept on that and everyone understands that if you drop below KPI for two weeks, you go on a PIP, which is Performance Improvement Plan, which means you go basically regress back to being a trainee.
Which means I now have to train you the way we were and I'm going to take even more attention to fixing your calls and getting you back on track.
If after the next two weeks you still haven't improved, you're all, that's the name.
8:40
Now, when you hire people, you also set that expectation.
This is how this works.
This is a dangerous place to work.
We do that because we expect excellence.
You want them to be fired up and be like, let's fucking go.
The cadence after you've graduated someone from training to full time is you would meet with them on a weekly basis, and then maybe after a year every other week if they're just killing it.
8:57
But most times, most salespeople meet on a weekly basis just to clean the engine, check in on things, give them a couple of tidbits, hear them out, etcetera.
The structure of those calls already outlined in terms of how you give feedback, that same feedback structure applies to all of the existing guys. 2, which is an hour per guy per week, is for the sales management.
9:13
And so you take 60 to hear maybe two calls because you can listen to it on a faster rate.
And then you can have your written feedback.
And after you have the call with them, you want to message them or e-mail them the salient blocks.
And if you're an organized person, which I recommend you be if you're a manager, I like having a tab of all my sales guys and having the things that I want them to work on each week so that I can just date it and say like last Monday I said these two things come back this Monday.
9:34
And so when I'm reviewing it the next week, I'm saying this is the two things I told them to work on today.
Improve it.
Yes.
No.
Cool.
When I I come back to that call, I'm like, hey, we said these two things.
Did you do it?
Did it result in you making more deals?
Awesome.
Cool.
Big meeting cadence.
You've got your weeklies, you've got your monthlies, you've got your one on ones that happen on a weekly basis or more frequently if they're on a performance plan or a trainee.
9:53
And then you have as a team, daily huddle, end of day huddle.
The end of day is a short, just like, hey, how's it been doing?
Checking in.
Cool, awesome.
Make sure you clean your pipelines, etcetera.
The early morning one is a training.
If you want, you can make it optional.
And if you're on a performance plan or you're a trainee, it's mandatory with the right culture teams, most guys always attend.
10:10
That's the overarching structure for scaling a sales team in an organization.
The only other thing that can happen is that they will lose conviction.
That's when sales can get cold.
The things that keep people motivated are the competitions, because that keeps things fresh, because it's a very repetitive job, but also reading testimonials of clients they recently sold in the results that they're experiencing.
10:27
And you do that so that they feel like they're good guys.
Because a lot of times sales can feel very hunt and kill.
But you want to self replace of empathy, genuine empathy, not nice guy.
But like, I really want to help you, which means you need to make a decision.
And that's what I'm like.
I'm not going to let you hide in your excuses again, because I really am trying to help you not say I am.
10:43
Because I've seen guys just like you change their lives by doing this.
And I know you're just putting bullshit up and you're afraid.
And that's OK because we're going to help you.
You have to have somebody who who's willing to push through the know because they believe in the product and the transformation the other person's going to experience, not because they have their ego tied into it and they want to close the sale to be #1.
11:01
You get there backwards.
And you do that by having people who were clients hop on a sales call and talk about their experience.
The second best thing is to watch videos of testimonials with the team before you start the day and then early morning huddle.
And then the third is just just read them out loud yourself.








0:00
And so I think what a lot of people need to do is figure out the games they need to play in the meantime.
And so experts at things don't really have more impulse control.
I think it's a fallacy they figure out more ways to win.
In the meantime, welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:23
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Alex.
So grateful and honored for you to join me today because we spent so much time together, so it's only right that we actually sit across from each other face to face.
Let just for the audience sake, how how have we spent time together, Danny?
0:43
Dude, so many podcasts, so many YouTube videos.
Like a disgusting amount.
Like, I'm like, are you kidding?
Like I've spent so much time with you.
Because you're such an incredible communicator because you are able to to have 10 years of knowledge into three, a 3 minute second clip.
1:04
I'm just like what is going on?
And so I'm learning so much about business, about communication, about life, all from you.
So thank you so much for being you.
And and that's why we spend so much time together because I continually get value from the things you say.
Well, I will do my very best to continue that trend, even though that is big shoes to to fill.
1:23
Well, I mean, it was so funny because one guy I remember just not being able to talk to one guy because he's like, oh, Alex Formosi, I don't get any value from him.
I'm like, all right, well, we're just not going to be friends.
So that's yeah, that's.
1:39
But this interview is about you, not my spending time with you.
And that is I would love to start with a psychology assignment you had at 19 years old.
When you had to pick someone who had a psychological disorder and tell the story of how they went down that path, will you tell that story, please?
1:57
Yeah, sure.
So I, like many young men, had lots of angst and felt like the world was not fair and that I had not gotten what I quote deserved and that I thought that my parents could have done a, quote, better job of parenting me in general.
2:15
And I resented them for that.
And so I had an intro to psychology course.
And the assignment was, as you said, pick somebody who had any pathology that we had cut, you know, studied over the whole semester and then write the story from their perspective of how that pathology might have developed.
2:31
Right.
And what happened through the course of going through that assignment was not what I expected because as I went through and I picked my mother and she's, you know, she's been public about suffering from, you know, depression and a DD and things like that that I picked that and in kind of inhabiting her shoes as an immigrant who came here not speaking the language and having, you know a Serbian father who is very authoritative, rightfully so.
3:06
We're talking 1950s, you know what I mean?
Just different different times and what her upbringing must have been like and having a split life between being an American at school and you know getting beat up for not being able to speak.
Because back then it was almost expected and and normalized to beat up the foreigners to to you know, then being the, the first person to you know first female class at Hopkins to be in that as a doctor.
3:41
And so thinking about that trajectory, I all of a sudden like realized the amount of pressures that she had put on externally that other people had put on her externally throughout her whole life.
And what happened was I felt like I understood and Blaise Pascal who's you know Pascal's triangle.
3:58
So people remember him.
He was a mathematician and also a theologian.
He had this quote that I love which is to understand is to forgive.
And I I believe that you cannot both hate someone and understand them at the same time.
And so like if I am very angry with someone it it's become a check for me where I'm like, oh, I must not understand something.
4:21
Like there's something about them or something about their experience that has made me not understand why they do what they do.
And then you have the secondary statement of most people.
If you were born with the same genetics and live the same life as that person, you would see the world the same way as they do.
And so carried within that is this very jarring idea that what if our viewpoint of the world is something that someone else hates entirely and in their mind we are wrong and but in their mind like hard to even really get into that and like empathize with someone else's point of view to that degree.
4:51
But me going through that process has actually been one that I've repeated multiple times in my life when I was extremely angry with someone.
It's usually around loyalty or betrayals or things like that that happened to all humans.
But when I started writing narratives around how someone experienced life that would make it reasonable that they would act or behave or believe what they believe, all of a sudden I felt like I understood.
5:18
And so in a matter of a few weeks what felt like a decade of hate and anger directed towards my mother.
I went back from school to complete the story.
And I remember she picked a fight about something.
I can remember what it was.
And she, you know, we had, you have your normal routine of getting into a fight with someone, right?
5:37
And I just remember having no, like, emotional.
I had no adrenaline spike.
And I just felt very like it felt like she'd hit a button, but the button wasn't hitting the normal trigger path that it was supposed to.
And so I just remember looking at her and being like, I understand and I'm sorry.
5:56
And she, of course, you know, burst out into tears and it was, you know, a huge emotional moment.
But like at the end of the day it was like I I get it.
Like you went through a lot and I'm sorry that you've had to deal with these demons.
And it wasn't about me.
And I think it's a lot of us, we have these like self-centered viewpoint because like we are the center of our own universes and therefore expect that everything that has ever happened is because of us.
6:18
Right when we're children, we just expect our parents got divorced.
Must be my fault because like you think that way.
It's like at a base level.
And so realizing that it wasn't my fault necessarily that she felt that way, and I guess in some way giving her permission to just be who she was and not constantly tell her why she shouldn't be this way or why basically her basic existence was insulting to me.
6:43
Unpacking that made for a less contentious relationship because then the triggers were somewhat removed.
Because if you understand why someone doesn't speak English and they keep looking at you and making noises at you, it's hard to get upset because you know they don't speak the language.
6:58
And so even you can just replace like speaking English with speaking Alex and it works the same way.
And so that's how that little intro to psychology assignment both changed my life with my mother, but then also helped me unpack anger driven situations that I had with other close people throughout the rest of my life.
7:18
It's really interesting that your.
Normal reaction to her wasn't the same and thus her reaction was different to you breaking down because it almost reminds me of how Layla, your wife sometimes acts when you get angry.
7:34
She meets it with love and then you're like, oh, I see what this is, which is very fascinating to speak to human beings in our nature of when we meet fear with love in some respect like the fear dissipates.
So cool to, like, make that realization.
7:53
I think it's just very hard to step out of the emotion in the moment.
Yeah, and sidestep it and try and get outside or above whatever analogy you want to try and say like, okay, what do I not understand?
And then it becomes a question to solve rather than a person to attack.
8:10
Do you have any other examples, frameworks, mental models that help you do that in a quicker way?
I mean with with something that's like super deep, like anger, stuff like that.
8:25
I mean that was years and years.
Like I think it takes more, more work to do that.
But in terms of frames around decreasing the stakes of a situation, I have lots of them.
So like for example, one of them is, you know, if you zoom out far enough, you realize that you can't even see the earth.
8:42
And so when I'm really upset about like Wi-Fi or something, I'm like, OK, maybe this isn't as big of a deal, you know?
And if you, if you go back, you know, let's go back 20 years, like, what thing really bothered me 20 years ago?
I probably can't even tell you what really bothered me 20 years ago.
8:58
And so I can probably expect that what's bothering me today, I'll feel the same way 20 years from now.
And so if it's not going to matter, then it probably shouldn't matter now.
And a different frame would be like, okay, well, look at the ancient accents.
And when I say that, I mean like the Romans, the Babylonians, the Sumerians.
9:13
And in 5000 years, we will be the ancient Americans and we'll look back on this and we probably won't remember maybe even just the leaders names, let alone the daytoday strikes that we deal with.
And again if it's not going to matter then, then it's not going to matter now or shouldn't matter now.
9:29
Another one is the frame of the veteran, which I like a lot, which I got from Doctor Kashi, which is imagine whatever this bad circumstance is happening once a day malt, sorry, once an hour every day for the next year.
OK.
So that's, you know, let's say it's 12 times a day times 365 a lot of times, right?
9:48
Well, how would you feel on the two thousandth time of that happening?
Well, by that point, if you really thought about it, you'd be like, well, this is probably, you'd probably just be like, well, this is just how this is, this is how life is.
And then you wouldn't be upset by it because you just adjusted your expectations.
Which meant if I could change my expectations on my two thousandth time of my maids putting the spoons in the wrong drawer, then I can readjust.
10:10
And I say that it's somewhat tongue in cheek, but you can replace that with whatever, you know what I mean?
With somebody double parking you with your boss being short with you.
Like if your boss was always short with you once an hour, every hour of every day in a year, it wouldn't upset you because you would expect that.
And so a lot of the like the angst that we experience, the anxiety, the saddest, the ang whatever it is, it comes from the fact that our expectations are unmet.
10:32
And so either we can demand that an uncaring universe changes to meet us or we can change our expectations.
And I think that if it's you versus the universe, unlike what most of the Americana propaganda will put out, the universe will win.
10:52
And so I think that that is 1 where you surrender to reality through acceptance.
And you say like this is period and it's not good or bad, which is probably the 6th frame, which is that we have this situation, let's say the spoons one cuz it's ridiculous, right?
11:09
Where I say I have this problem, right?
And so one of my favorite ways to solve a problem is to stop defining it as a problem to begin with.
And so it's the least effortful way to actually solve stuff.
It's like, is this really a problem?
What if this was good?
And here's a weird one is that most short term problems are actually long term benefits.
11:31
So think about this.
It's like you've probably heard the story of the the man and the the boy and the horse.
So you know, kid, kid, kid gets a horse.
Everyone says this is amazing.
Kid falls off the horse.
People are like, oh, that's terrible because he broke his foot and then Army comes to recruit, but he can't go to to the war because his his foot was broken.
11:51
People said that was amazing.
And so like, you keep going through this cycle and that it's only within the time period that you measure.
But over a long period of time, we don't know whether the thing was quote good or bad.
And if we don't know if something's going to be good or bad, then why even bother ascribing the label to it?
Because the only thing we actually know is that it happened.
12:07
And so I see it a lot like the weather, where you say, like, people will ascribe a situation like sunny days or rainy days.
And they say sunny days like they're good days and rainy days like they're bad days.
But if you're in a drought, rainy day comes from heaven and another sunny day comes from hell.
And on the flip side, if you have a wedding the next day, a rainy day sounds horrible on a sunny day sounds amazing.
12:27
And the crazy thing is that there's two people praying for the same thing at the same time.
One's going to be upset and the other person isn't.
And I remember when early, you know, dealings with Christianity and I was thinking about just having a God.
I remember praying for good weather because I had some outdoor event.
And then I thought to myself, man, there's a farmer who's really praying for rain right now.
12:46
And I was like, shit, maybe this is flawed.
Not to say that praying in general is flawed, but just that construct of this, it being my way is therefore good.
And I think getting used to not getting my way, comma, and saying that that's OK has been one of the big psychological hacks that I've had in my life that have decreased my anxiety levels and my anger levels around responding to stimuli that I wouldn't at the onset say was what I wanted.
13:17
Because I might not know.
And maybe today's rainy day is tomorrow's sunny day and maybe sun is neither good nor bad.
It just is.
It's beautiful.
It what I love so much about what you talk about is like there's a surrender there to the moment, whatever it is.
13:33
But that doesn't negate hard work either.
And and a huge part of who you.
Are and what you present is like you just need to do more reps for the thing.
So it's like maybe you want it to be your way, just do more of the thing.
And so I mean, I think the best example to me that really hit at home was with the Flyers on the cars.
13:54
So could you tell that story for people who might not know?
Yeah.
So I had a mentor way back when when I was starting my gyms and he was like, yeah, we do Flyers.
That's how we get customers.
I was like, OK, so I'll do some of those.
You see, you should try that.
So you know, print out 300 Flyers and you know, advertising was expensive and I was broke and so 300 was was the appropriate amount of advertising that I could stomach.
14:17
And so we put out 300 Flyers and I waited and then the next day I got a call.
I was really excited and as soon as I pick up the phone I was like, oh hey, it's like I got one of your Flyers.
I was so excited.
And he says, yeah, you dinged my Mercedes and I just immediately panicked and hung up the phone.
14:34
I didn't say anything.
Thankfully you never called back.
But that was the only call I got from my 300 Flyers.
And so I called the the the mentor back and I was like, hey, you you told me to do you know think you know a decade plus ago and way more entitlement.
14:50
I was like hey, you told me this was going to work right.
And and I and and he didn't even respond to that.
He was like well how many did you, how many did you put out for your test size?
And I was like, what do you mean by test size?
He's like, well, what was the first batch that you tested on so that you could then scale it?
15:07
And I was like, well, I mean, I put out 300 in total.
And he just started laughing.
And I was like, why?
I'm like, I'm having this very serious moment.
You know what I mean?
I was like, what are you laughing at?
He's like, hard to know if anything works With 300.
He's like, well, we test with 5000, he's like and then if we get half a percent back he's like then we're OK 1%.
15:28
I'm scaling to the moon 1, 1/2, He's like, I'm singing, singing praises.
He's like, if you had a half percent on that, he's like, you'd get 1 1/2 people.
He's like, and that's tough to see with 300.
Can't really know if anything's working.
And I remember thinking that moment like I might have been doing the right thing, but I was not doing nearly enough of it.
15:48
And I think that there's a lot of early and like I think that story can apply to a lot of things, to early entrepreneurship.
It's like we can get disheartened by our first month of making content that we haven't made money yet from it.
But it's like, not that you're doing the wrong thing.
You just might not have been doing it either a long enough or enough of it.
16:05
Which time is really just also a proxy for doing enough of it.
And so I, and I think what a lot of people don't get myself included when I was earlier starting is people don't get the amount of volume that it takes to be successful, right.
Like I actually, I'll tell you I had a different conversation the other day.
16:20
So good friend of mine very successful and like to the to the B level successful right.
And so he's, he had a conversation with me.
He's trying.
He's wanted to start building a personal brand just because he wants to give back.
And he was like, dude, why he's like, your stuff just crushes compared to mine.
16:37
Like, what am I doing wrong here?
When I gave him a couple tips and then he was like, well, how much cost are you guys putting out a week?
And I was like, I think we're at like 350 pieces a week.
And he just like, he looked at me and he was like, thank you for resetting my minimum standard.
And because he's an experienced entrepreneur.
16:56
And so he could immediately translate that into what he needed to hear because he was like me with my 1A day.
He's like, he's like, I think it's significantly less reasonable that I expect to have your outcome with with 130th of the level of volume that you're putting out.
17:11
But here's the context is that back to that Flyer story, he was saying 5000 and then he said he would go to 5000 per day after that, meaning that in 30 days he put out 150,000 Flyers.
In that same 30 days, I put out 300, right.
17:27
So I was I was doing 1/5 times whatever 5 * 115 hundredth divided by 145 hundredth of the level of effort that he was.
And so a lot of times people think in double s and triples when it's the level of effort.
17:43
But just like the example I gave with the guy who's successful already, it wasn't him doing twice the work he needed to do, like 30 times the work to get that level of outcome.
And I will tell you this is that across super successful people independent of how they advertise.
And this is just specific to advertise, but it works with product iteration.
18:01
It works with editing for videos.
If you know two editors, I can imagine I'm looking at my own, my own chief of brand behind me.
If you have two editors and you say, hey, how much time did you put into this video?
The new guy says, oh, I put a ton of time into this video.
I put like 2 hours into this and the experience editor laughs and he's like, so that was the first round of edits that you did.
18:19
And they're like, no, that was like the whole thing.
He's like, well, hard to edit anything in two hours, right.
In terms of like if you had a video, right.
And so the the, the, the, the huge discrepancy between someone coming in who's new and someone who's experienced in terms of how much work they expect to do to get an outcome is the difference between mediocre and world class.
18:42
And like the context to your and I'll give you, I'm going to keep giving examples because I think it'll maybe drive it home.
But like my book, the book that's coming out, I put 2000 hours personally into that book.
So six hours a day for almost 2 years, every first six hours of every day was writing and rewriting and rewriting.
18:59
I wrote 19 drafts of the book before it will now come out right?
And people see the last book.
And that book sells 25,000 copies a month with word of mouth alone.
There's no paid ads.
It just.
And it grows more every month.
Meaning people who buy the book read the book, tell more than one person about the book, and it keeps growing.
19:16
And so I have a bunch of other friends who are business people who are like, oh, I'll go write a book.
And I they'll text me and they're like, dude, I'm already halfway through, started 2 weeks ago.
I don't, I don't even need to know.
I can tell you right now, the book's not going to be good because like, nothing exceptional takes little time.
19:35
Like great great work takes great struggle because if it were easy, then it means it's low hanging fruit.
And if it's low hanging fruit, other people have already done it and it's it's the high fruit that take the ladder, that take the climbing, that take it and cut by thistles and leaves and whatever, that's still there for the picking.
19:52
And The thing is, is that like most of the big winds in life come from the hard to attain fruit.
And the key to most of those treasure chests is actually right in front of most people.
It's just that there's just a time clock on the treasure chest.
The key's sitting on top of it.
20:08
It says wait five years and then you can unlock.
It's in plain sight.
It's not a secret.
It's just the thing that makes it hard.
Is not the complexity, is the consistency.
How do you know when something like the book is is ready to go after 19 drafts?
Why not 20?
20:24
Why not 27?
Why not 127?
Because at that point there was nothing else that I could think of that I could do to improve it.
So most people will ship something and be like well cuz like I'll give you the editing example.
So someone says this video, I just edited it and I say cool, if I give you 2 more hours, what would you do?
20:42
And they'd be like, well, I'd probably do this better.
I'll probably do this better.
I'll probably do this better.
I'd be like, okay, do that, come back, come back in two hours, be like okay.
If I give you 2 more hours, what would you do?
Well, I would probably do this, this and this.
Okay.
Cool, they come back.
Now here's the trick one, If I give you 20 hours, what would you do?
20:59
Well shit, I would probably restructure the story entirely to make it really flow.
Not just like the surface level edits, but I'd really structure like really just rearrange the entire thing to make it like way better.
Okay.
Do that.
And then that clip gets a million views.
And so it's like, there's sure there's duct tape and and there's lipstick that you can put on stuff, but like, why go from version 18 to version 19, right?
21:25
Because probably version 18, given the audience I've had, will probably would probably still be a best seller, right?
But in my opinion, the difference between great and world class is, is so much more effort on the front end, but so much more output on the back end.
21:44
Meaning I could spend half as much time on this book, right?
And I'd probably sell close to the amount of books that I'll probably sell like from the event and all that stuff, like people will buy it, right?
But it's the second wave that won't happen.
It's people will say this book was good, but they won't be.
22:02
They won't, it won't blow their minds, right?
Because it'll have just been like enough stuff that wasn't totally broken down all the way.
The hard work of digesting a concept that takes 4 days to break down one paragraph.
Like my team laughed about this.
Actually my CEO of Jim Launch I I sent him there's a there's a there's one page in the book that's special.
22:24
I'll just.
I'll just leave it at that.
All right.
And I and I sent him a draft of that page and I read it to him out loud and offhandedly.
I was like, yeah, I've put, I've, I've spent the last 20 hours on this over the last two days on this one page.
And he didn't say anything about it, but he then made a clip about that because to me, that's how long it took me to write every page.
22:45
If you do the math, like I spent 10 hours basically on every single page in the book.
And so for him, he was like, thank you for resetting my minimum standard.
And so a lot of times, I think if you looked at the book and what it'll probably do afterwards, it seems significantly.
23:03
And Michelangelo, this is used to say my buddy Michelangelo, he said if people saw how much work I put into my art, they wouldn't think it's as exceptional as it is.
And so a lot of the exceptionalism is that people see the output, not the input.
23:21
And so people said, if I said, hey, I spent 2000 hours on this book, maybe it's not that exceptional when you think about it like that, right?
But it is exceptional compared to people who put 50 or 100.
And so if I put 20 times the work into a book and it becomes three times better than other books, my output to input ratio on the front end is way worse than theirs.
23:42
But I would rather spend 2 years building an exceptional product and then let all the customers of that book spend the rest of their lives promoting it for me.
Then spend two months making a decent book and then have to spend the rest of my life promoting it because no one else wants to do it for me real quick wise.
24:01
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
24:20
So the single thing that I has to do is you can just leave review.
They'll take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world with someone else.
Yeah, it reminds me of how Steve Jobs thought of the iPhone.
You're thinking about the same thing for.
24:36
Writing a book, which to me is a revolutionary concept but makes sense.
Another thing that I love about what you discuss is like how your own bar for excellence continues to rise year over year, how what you would have accepted as great work a year ago, five years ago, 10 years ago, was much lower and that gave me some peace for some reason.
24:58
Could you talk a little bit about that?
The more you do, the more you realize you can do.
And so it's like you prove to yourself in some way, you get a positive reinforcement loop that like if I spend an extra 50% longer on this, I get even more positive feedback.
25:15
And so in some ways you could say that I've just become addicted to that loop, which is that the more obsessive I become about anything, the more positive feedback I get on a longer time horizon.
And that's the part that most people struggle with, which is like, think about this for a second.
25:31
I spent two years writing and editing this book.
Years.
And it could also flop, right?
It could.
You never know.
It could flop.
No, I'm going.
To be tweeting it every second.
It won't flop but it it could flop.
25:47
But most, and I think this is like this is a muscle.
It's a skill right, that you develop over time.
And so I don't if if you'd asked me 10 years ago there is no way.
And I, and I mean this, this isn't me, like trying to trying to posture on this.
Like there is no way, and I can say this confidently that I would wait for two years for anything.
26:05
I wouldn't have waited two years for anything.
Just I I couldn't do it.
There's no way I could do it.
And so, you know the marshmallow test that people talk about with the kid, one marshmallow 2 marshmallows, right?
Well, what's interesting about that is that I would love like a third test of this.
26:22
And maybe it's somebody who can send it to me if they've if they've done this, but it's how long can you make the kid wait for the marshmallow?
Because we have a binary of okay, wait 15 minutes or wait 30 minutes.
And if they eat the the marshmallow in the 30, they're not long term thinkers and if they have some level of impulse control and if they wait 30 minutes they get they get the second marshmallow.
26:43
But what if you said you have to wait a day to get the second marshmallow?
What if they said you would have to wait a month to get the second marshmallow?
How many kids wait now?
And it's certain at some point the kid starves to death.
So like the the analogy blades, right?
Or it's no longer the leads their foot off, but the idea.
26:59
But like you can still take the concept and apply it, which is I can.
I can almost guarantee that the kid that can wait a month to get the second marshmallow will win no matter what it whatever he does.
And it's because the amount of input that they're willing to do before getting a result far exceeds everyone else's.
27:19
You said before that you know you couldn't.
It would be impossible for you to wait two years for anything 10 years ago.
That implies that you were able to increase the amount of time that it you were, you became more of a longterm thinker.
Over time.
How can somebody listening to this become more of a longterm thinker intentionally?
27:40
You have to figure out what to do in the meantime.
Like patience isn't actually active.
And this is a big finding for me was that people like be patient.
It's a terrible directive because no one knows what to do when you say be patient.
Right now I'm being patient for every other thing in my entire life except for this podcast, cuz time is elapsing and other things are going in progress.
28:02
I have long term 10 year goals that right now I'm being patient for by being on this podcast with you.
And so I think what a lot of people need to do is figure out the games they need to play in the meantime.
And so experts at things don't really have more impulse control.
28:18
I think it's a fallacy.
They figure out more ways to win in the meantime.
So if you've been on a on a treadmill and and you and you see 30 minutes, right, and then you and then you're like you, you get 5 minutes in and you're like okay only five more 5 minute chunks, right?
That is in a nutshell what an expert does when they approach a project.
28:39
They don't try and think I'm going to run 26 miles, right?
If they're running the marathon, they say, how do I break this into a chunk that I can manage, right?
And then what they do is they create more ways to win.
And so in those two years, it wasn't like I just sat and suffered for two years and then the book's gonna come out, right?
28:56
I was.
I would have many, many victories along the way that would happen.
Oh, we just destructed this whole this chapter.
I just rewrote it again.
And it's killer.
Or I just got this beautiful visual that just completely explains this thing with three, three shapes.
And it just, you know, it explains the whole concept, right.
And so you get these little mini reinforcers, and then you have the long loop of reinforcement that is, for me that I have now learned over and over again.
29:17
Is that the longer, the more time I put into something, not necessarily longer, but the more time I put into something, the fact that time elapses is secondary.
The more time I put into something, the better it is.
And what happens too is when you're working on projects, you're working on anything is that if you work on it over a longer period of time, you have more time for creative solutions to come to you, to the problems that you're thinking through.
29:40
Like the best launch I ever did in my life so far was actually of Prestige Labs, my sophomore company.
And it was because we actually planned it for a year other companies and other projects.
I, because I was impatient, was like let's do this in 12 weeks, right?
29:56
And I hear, and I can quote that a contrepreneurial you gotta break shit and move.
You gotta you know what I mean?
I I do all that.
But you don't work really well.
When we had thought through every contingency in every scenario and we were completely staffed up and we had done a beta test and we had done a five times bigger beta test and we had ran processing through.
30:11
We made sure paths were on time.
We made sure we had inventory tracking that was automated.
We made sure that we had the right ratio between customers, you know, service people and the number of tickets that were going to get bought.
We knew we had supply chain lined up so that we could ramp up at a 10X or 20X month over month type of scaling because we're going to thousands of locations, right?
30:28
Like that doesn't happen in a week.
And so like, great, great triumph takes, great sacrifice just is what it like.
There's a quote in BF Skinner, who's a behavioral psychologist, and he starts one of his books.
30:44
He says many variables exist and therefore many variables must be studied.
And it's just about the context of human behavior.
And so a lot of people want to make these idioms or these truisms that are like 1 + 1 = 2.
It's like the human behavior has a lot of variables and so everyone wants to have the shortcut.
31:01
And he just was like many variables must be studied.
It's just like you can't shortcut the work.
The work has to be done.
And so I think kind of like that level of acceptance to go full circle with what we were talking about earlier is like I we have this expectation that we want this amazing big outcome and we aren't willing to put in the level of work required to make that outcome.
31:21
And so interesting.
Like Coralier on this is like, if you want to double, like if you want a double output outcome, you might have to work five times harder.
And if you want like a triple output, you might have to work 10 times harder.
And you're like, wait, there's there's an inefficiency there.
31:36
And it's like the answer is yes, but there's also an asymptote on the other side.
So let me give you an example.
So if I said Olympic sprinting, right, these guys trained for four years to shave 1/10 of a second off their runtime.
And let's say one guy works twice as hard as everybody else and he just gets 110th of a second faster than the 2nd place guy, right?
32:00
So he wins the gold, the other guy wins the silver.
What is the material difference between 1st and 2nd?
Everything.
Everything.
And so even though the results, there's a diminishing return of the results that you get from the input that you put in, in terms of work, there's an outsized return on each diminishing increment of improvement.
32:24
Because teaching a high school kid how to run with good form, they probably in one training session will make more improvements on their running than an Olympic calibre runner will make in the last four years of their running.
But which one matters more?
The last four years, right?
32:40
And so I see the same thing there.
It's like if I want to create or write one of the best business books of all time that people will put into the Canon, which is my ultimate goal, like my team is that.
It's like when people make the list of these are the five books you have to read.
I want all of them to be books that I've written.
Not because it's a me thing, but just cuz I want that to be the level of quality that we put out, right?
32:59
And in order for that to happen, I might have to run for four years every single day to get this much better.
But so that the first book, not the third book that someone says is the book that I wrote that makes sense.
Yeah, it does.
What have you learned about yourself from writing this most recent book?
33:19
The work needs doing.
It's just like there's no way around it.
It just has to be confronted.
And I think it just like it just comes down to that is you just have to confront the work.
And a lot of people put a lot of extra things between them and the work that they try and romanticize.
33:37
They try and create superstitions around it.
They have all these fancy rain dances that they do, but like at the end of the day, the work doesn't care who you are, it just cares that it gets done.
And I think in some way that's one of the great equalizers about product is that like in a lot of ways, and this will probably be triggering to some people, but like, it doesn't matter who you are.
34:02
Like in a fitness example, 500 pounds is 500.
It doesn't care who you are.
Like anyone, like Arthur, can pull the sword from the stone if you're strong enough, right?
And so, like, there's a level of work that has to get put in to learn how to run ads.
34:18
The level of work that has to get put in to learn how to do cold calls.
A level of work that has to get put in, to learn how to be patient when someone's angry with you, right?
Or how to run a team or how to stick your projects in a sauna or whatever it is.
Right.
And it doesn't matter whether you're old, you're young, you're male, you're female, you're black, white, Asian, whatever, right?
34:38
It just needs doing.
And I think that a lot of people waste a lot of time not starving.
And so I I've told this analogy before, we've probably heard it.
But I'll say for your audience, there's a study, there's probably a lot of studies been done with this, but you can become proficient in any skill in about 20 hours.
34:55
So playing the piano, you know, riding a bike, whatever, 20 hours of concentrated effort gets you proficient.
It's the largest gain in skill improvement is 20 hours of concentrated effort.
The problem is, is that people will wait a decade to start the first hour.
And so you'd be amazed at how much progress you can make if you cut down the time between when you acknowledge the work and when you start doing the work.
35:19
And I think that over time in my career what has happened, it's just that my my delay between when I realize I need to do something and when I start doing it has just shrunk so that I can get to the gain and proficiency that much faster.
And then if you think about that over 10 years, right where one guy goes nothing and then he starts, another guy does, 20 hours and 20 hours and 20 hours and 20 hours and 20 hours and 20 hours by the end of that decade, they're not even recognizable.
35:42
They're not even the same.
They're not even the same stratosphere.
Yeah, when you think about a good writer or a great writer, an unstoppable writer, what comes to mind and what separates the amazing writers versus everyone else other than the work?
Saying the work people do thousand put 2000 hours into a book.
36:01
What makes for an unstoppable, incredible writer?
I don't think there is something else I'll qualify this, which is that the work needs feedback.
So you gain proficiency with expert eyes giving you feedback on the work you do.
36:19
Because if I I'll give you the content example, if I post a short every day for for 10 years and I don't change what I'm doing and I just post the same thing, I might not make any progress.
And I know people who've been doing, who've done made content for 10 years and they have the same size following, right?
Because they don't learn, they don't improve.
36:35
Like I'm going to rewind real quick on this is that the work is required for you, not for the output.
Somebody who naturally gets it on the first try, who really just understands it.
And this is an easy example.
36:51
If if if if Mr. Beast's account got cancelled tomorrow, he can start another one and get it to millions and millions of dollars because he has the skill.
And so it's not that the output requires him to go work for five years in order to build the following his skill required him to work for five years to get the skill, but then the output does the work after that.
37:13
And so like the the time delay that people talk about, like myself included, when I'm trying.
Like this is where nuance of advice comes in, right?
Where it's like I tell people, hey, I want you to do 100 reps every day.
I don't want you to do the same 100 reps every day.
I want you to get better with all the reps And if you haven't looked at the end of the day and said, what could I do better, How could I improve?
37:31
And if you don't have somebody on the outside eyes being like, hey, you stumbled here on this call or hey, when they said this, let's drill this, let's do this a couple times.
That's how you get better, right?
So you have to be willing to do the work and get the feedback to improve.
Like the work works on you more than you work on it.
And I think that's the piece that people miss, like my prescription, like of doctor money of working is for the for the person's skills.
37:56
Not because I care about the fact that you made 10,000 phone calls.
I care about the fact that you got better 10,000 times.
How many sales calls do you think you've been on in your life?
I've closed over 4000.
Oh my God.
So what?
At what close rate?
38:13
Well, mine were in person before the days of the telephone.
Not really like I was.
I'd all myself, almost all my cells were in person from a volume perspective.
Do you think that that is a major contributor for why you are such a good communicator, an incredible communicator?
38:30
I would say.
I think it's part of it.
I think it's part of it.
But it's funny, a friend of mine saw some of my old gym lunch content and they were like, dude, have you, like taken speech lessons?
They're like, I saw an interview with you, like in your garage and you were like, yeah, I mean, I don't know, just do shit and make money and go away if you don't want to work, whatever.
38:53
And so and so.
And at that point, I'd already closed 4000 sales, Right.
Interesting.
But I'll give you something that that will probably just, you know, discourage some people.
I don't think that the sales skill I had necessarily translated into the content skill.
I had to get 4000 reps here.
39:11
And so when I say that we make 350 pieces of content every week, I have a lot of reps And here's the beautiful part about content in my opinion is that you get such fast feedback cycles.
You can immediately see what happens and what worked and what didn't right?
And then you can learn and you can get better and not to get in the nuances of like, don't being algorithm chaser and things like that, but at least from a skill perspective, content's one of those games that you can get really good at really quickly sales.
39:36
You have really fast feedback cycles.
You know, if the person buys, you can see if they change the body language, whatever.
Like, ooh, I shouldn't say that next time or ooh, that worked.
Like, I'll say that again.
Right.
Where the problem that she gets in on this learning cycle, sometimes you learn the wrong things.
Sometimes the person was ready to buy it cuz their friend Sandy preferred them.
And then you do something fancy and then she says yes.
39:54
And it wasn't because of you.
She bought despite you, right.
And so then you get false status.
And this is where skill acquisition gets really interesting.
But overall, I think the reason that I became, quote, more articulate is because I have just committed time to doing this, yeah.
40:11
But that seems to be a recurring theme, 5-6 years of podcasts.
Yeah.
The first four years that like I just looked at a graph at like yesterday I looked at a graph and the day that we sold Jim launch is like the it's like a straight line because I stopped.
40:31
So I started taking all the excess attention that I had from going to the business and taking a portion of that.
I mean like I'm going to learn this skill.
And so it's straight line grew after that.
But it was like 4 years of flat ish nothing because realistically I don't think I took any feedback from my podcast.
40:48
I just consistently made the podcast.
So there's an element there where I'm like, I like, I say this and I'm not saying it to preach.
I'm saying because I lived it, right.
Like I made a podcast for four years and didn't grow right.
I did like 400 episodes before it actually, like, started growing.
41:05
I got the same 2000 people who listened every month.
That's monthly listens, not daily, monthly listens of 2000, right?
And then I was like, I'm going to try and learn this.
And then I started trying to learn it and trying to get better.
Yeah.
And one of your core skills is being a good learner, I feel as well.
41:24
So this is a good.
I appreciate that.
But I'm going to segue into this for the audience is that I think there are skills like, and there are meta skills.
So meta skills are skills that help you learn skills, right.
And so, like, being a good writer is a meta skill for communication in general.
41:40
So if I'm a good writer, I'll be good at writing copy.
We're good at writing emails.
We're going to writing captions.
I'll be good at write scripting tweets.
I'll be good at making short.
Like all of those come from one skill, but it's a meta skill, right?
If you get reading, it's like, well then I can absorb a lot of information so I can then learn how to write copy, I can learn how to make ads, I can learn how to all of those things faster.
42:00
And so in my opinion, the education system should only be on meta skills so that you become like a stem cell for knowledge.
Is that how do we get the person so that they can become anything, right?
Like we don't need to teach 17th century Aztec literature.
42:16
We should do is teach people how to learn and then let them learn whatever they want to learn.
Because people all get interested in something and just and then when they have the skills then they can get good at it and then they can make a living doing it.
Okay, $100 million learner.
What are some of the chapters here?
42:34
Learn repeat successful actions.
Get feedback from people who are further ahead than you.
Expand the time rising that you measure your output on, but shrink the time rising that you measure your inputs on.
So measure what you do today faster, but measure what happens from what you did today longer.
42:56
That's it.
Like find people ahead of you, figure out what they did.
If that's what you want to learn, do the inputs and measure them quickly, short term, get feedback and then don't.
And then wait a long time until you get the outcome that you want.
But I would say instead of optimizing for the outcome, I optimize for progress.
43:14
And so a lot of my team knows this.
Is that, Like, I'll tell you, I'll tell you a quick story.
So when I got into, when I started to start making content, I hired a YouTube agency or whatever because I didn't know anything about any of this stuff.
Right.
Like nothing.
It's kind of it's funny because people were like, asked me to talk about content and like, I didn't do this two years ago.
43:32
And so anyways, I get on the phone and I said, hey, just so you know, I'm committed to doing this for 10 years.
And he was like, what?
I was like, yeah, I was like, I will, I will follow the system that you outline for 10 years before I need to see an Roy.
43:50
He was like, that is the weirdest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
He's like and and and that was the first conversation and it was fine or whatever, right?
And I told him after that I was like to be clear, I was like, I want to make progress.
I want to see that our videos are doing better, you know, month over month over month in general.
44:09
Not this video to the next video, but month over month.
I want to see that, like if I'm putting attention to this, that we're getting better.
That's all I want to see.
And so six months in, things started really cranking, right?
And I think nine months in, I ended up saying I'm going to bring the whole team in house.
44:26
And we had an amicable party, right?
And on the last call that I had with him, he said I just want to share something with you that has changed my life.
And I was like, what?
He said that first call.
He said I have never had anyone in my entire life, friends, family, mentors ever talk to me about a 10 year time rising for anything.
44:48
He's like every client I sign up is like I need to ROI in 90 days or I'm not going to pay you or or like if this doesn't make me money in a month like I'm out, right.
And he's like and it completely shifted the way that I have approached my business.
Just seeing how you approached YouTube and I have been in the business game longer than I've been in the content game.
45:10
And so some of those lessons have carried over for me.
And so I'm like, of course it's going to take a while.
I'm competing against, you know, Mr. Beast.
And I'm not saying competing against him, he's he's, he's amazing, right?
But like I'm competing against guys.
I've been doing it for 10 years.
Of course they're better than I am.
Why would I expect to beat those guys, right?
But I'd like to be better in a month or two than I am now.
45:27
And as long as I have a path towards that, I'm satisfied and I will continue on that path because if I can draw the line between now and 20 years from now, then it is a good outcome.
And I think that being able to draw the line and say like I just want to see that I'm getting better, that's all that people in my opinion should focus on now.
45:43
If you're not getting better and you're doing the inputs and you're putting the real time into the thing, then it means you need somebody to give you better feedback because you don't like.
If you don't know why, you're not not doing better.
Like if I say, hey editor, make this video better and they're like, I don't know what to do, that's when you need someone to say, like, here's six things that you can do better and then they're like, oh, so you need the awareness.
46:03
You need someone to be able to get to bridge that knowledge gap so that then you can bridge the effort gap.
When was the first time you realized the importance of putting in progress leading to a long term result?
I mean what comes to mind for me initially is the.
46:20
The gym teacher who took you under his wing with lifting weights.
But is this?
Is there something else that comes to mind for you?
I I if I if I gave you an answer, I'd be making it up.
I think I've always measured progress, you know?
I just want to know I'm getting better.
Yeah.
Makes sense.
46:36
Which of your earliest jobs are playing the biggest role in your current day-to-day?
I mean, realistically, none of them.
Like, you know what I mean?
Like I I cherish my time as a blended tender at Smoothie King and, you know, as a as an Orthodox Jewish caterer and as a, you know, fur coat brusher in a warehouse.
47:02
But you know, none of those things realistically taught me any skills.
Now I learned through observation to see what some of them were doing.
But I would honestly, when I tell stories about even the fur coat dealer, some of those things I actually had to learn business later and then retroactively looked back at that situation was like, oh, that's what they were doing.
47:22
Like I didn't even have the context to make the judgment at the time.
And like I remember like in the Smoothie King, I was like we would do the sale tally at the end the day and he was like 2003 thousand dollars every day and it never even registered for me like it.
Like I never even thought of it as money.
It was just like the number and there was a certain amount that I had to write that was cash and I put that in the safe and then a certain amount that I was like credit cards and you put it in you'd to tally it up with the cup count or whatever at the end of the day.
47:46
And I didn't think about that being $1,000,000 business or what the revenue run rate was or what the margins were.
I didn't think about any of that stuff.
I was just trying to make smoothies.
And so I'll do a tiny segue for the audience here is that I reject the concept of being a born entrepreneur.
48:08
I think that we get better at things that we are reinforced for doing, period.
And the natural born entrepreneurs are just typically people who got reinforced for entrepreneurial type behaviors earlier.
So I was a very security driven person for most of my life.
So like I just had jobs and then I went to college and then I got a white collar job that had prestige around it and the most terrifying thing in the entire world for me was quitting that job.
48:31
It took me 6 months to quit a job and I was 22 or 23 and I had $50,000 saved up and I was petrified and to this day was still the most afraid I've ever been in my entire life was quitting that job.
Which is ridiculous to me now in retrospect, but it was because I'd never been rewarded for that.
48:48
So it was such a huge change in behavior for me from following the trodden path because I've been rewarded over and over and over and over and over and over and over again for doing what I was told.
Makes sense.
So I think in some ways the guys who did fail out of school and things like that and then became entrepreneurs, it's like, well, they never got rewarded for following the directions.
49:08
I had been rewarded for following the directions, which is why it was so much harder for me to quit.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leila and I are definitely working on our social media presence if you guys haven't noticed, and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn, alright?
It's not as bad as I thought.
It's actually been pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, go ahead and let's connect and let's rock'n'roll.
0:17
What am I doing different?
What am I doing different?
It might not be doing anything different.
You might have just hit the gold nugget way too early in the cycle and now you got to sift through a lot more nose to get to your next one.
Welcome to the game where we talked about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:34
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wish Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I want to share a quick lesson that I had with my 18 year old neighbor who's going through his entrepreneurial journey.
0:49
And this is a lot of fun for me because he's at Ground Zero.
So I'm I'm hearing the anxieties and the worries and the false beliefs kind of come up as they go and I get to confront them and kind of ask you questions.
And so kind of the lesson or the theme of yesterday was around volume and luck, right.
1:06
And so one of the key differences that I see with people who are successful and do grow and do scale is that they have a firm understanding of probability, all right.
And what that means is chance, what's the percentage likelihood that something happens, right?
1:22
If you want to be an investor, right, then you have to calculate the the risk associated with an investment.
That's a probability outcome.
If you are a business owner, right, you have to gamble on marketing and assess the probability that you'll get a return on that investment, right.
1:40
And what's interesting is that volume negates luck.
All right.
So if you can put that in your brain, volume negates luck.
And so luck is a word that people who don't understand probability use as a space filler.
But if I were to say, hey, for every, you know, 100,000 emails I send, I get 1000 back.
2:01
And from 1000 that I get back, I know that I'm going to close 500 of those people on a deal.
That's not realistic math.
I would probably close a lot more than that.
But the point is, but if I explain that math to you, you probably I'd be like, is that luck that I closed 500 deals, You'd probably be like, no, that's just probability.
2:20
That's just, I know that if I reach this many people, the probability that there is one person who's interested in the services that I have is high, right?
And The thing is that if you do enough volume, you can negate luck, all right.
You can also negate Gil, which is a byproduct of the volume.
2:39
All right.
So let me dive into that.
Let me unpack that for a second.
So let's say you suck, right?
Because you're brand new.
And of course you would suck because why would you be good?
Because you've never done this before, whatever it is, right?
And so this is like the conversation I'm having with my neighbor.
2:55
You can imagine me as like, coach, you get 18 year old, get, I'm like, of course you suck.
You're supposed to suck.
You're not supposed to be good, right?
And The thing is, it's like because of social media, because of Instagram, because of all these things, everyone, especially you know, the guys who are younger right now, and I maybe it's the same for guys who are in their 30s, whatever, is that they just immediately assume they should be a millionaire the first year, right?
3:15
It's just like I should be a million.
Why am I not a millionaire, right?
And so that's what stops 99% of people from being successful because they are unwilling to suck, right?
And it hurts their ego too much to be bad.
And so then they say, ah, this isn't for me, right?
And so anyways, back to the point of the volume verse, you know, negating the luck in the skill component is that, let's say the normal numbers.
3:37
Let's say I was, I was coaching him on cold calling, right.
Because that's what he's doing right now.
And I said, listen, it's going to take, it should take you about 1000 cold calls to get, you know, one deal, right.
And let's say he comes to me and he says, well, I've done 5000, right?
I'm like okay and so, well, I don't have a deal.
3:57
I'm like and you suck, of course you don't have a deal.
You've never done this before.
Do another 5000, because The thing is, eventually you will, it will be unreasonable for you to suck anymore, right?
It would be unreasonable for you to not have found one person if you do this for a straight year.
4:17
And I'm trying to paint this longer picture for him.
A year.
And I know when you're 18, a year sounds like forever.
But like, a year, if you did this for five years, if you did nothing but cold call for five years, do you think you would be good at cold calling?
He was like, yeah, probably.
I was like, do you feel like you're much better now than you were one month ago when you started this?
4:34
He was like, odd.
I'm like night and day better.
Like, I can get past, you know, I can open now, I can have conversation I was getting hung up on.
I was like, right.
And so you have this binary measure of progress, which is I either closed the sale or I didn't close the sale.
When in reality, there's tons of bricks on the bridge on the way to getting the first dollar over, right?
4:51
And the first deal the first dollar independent of whatever you're doing, is the always the hardest one.
And it's because you have to learn a lot of little skills before you get the big payoff right?
And most people learn one skill or don't learn a skill and then think up.
This isn't for me.
5:10
Most nation real quick, if you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
And if you like that we would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there, right.
5:31
And so I told him that the only way that I would give him my blessing for him to quit is if she could convince me that the entire industry of wholesaling real estate had disappeared.
If you can convince me that the entire industry of wholesaling real estate has disappeared, you will have my blessing to quit.
5:48
And obviously that's not going to happen because people have been making money in wholesaling real estate for a long time, right?
There's always going to be inefficiencies in marketplaces between buyers and sellers, right?
Unless some magical technology comes through, which it might in 10 years, who knows?
But for right now, it exists.
And so I said the only thing that separates you from what you want is skill.
6:08
And the only way to acquire that skill is volume, right?
And The thing is, is when you have enough skill, you get luckier, right?
You don't need to do 10,000 calls to get that one deal because honestly, maybe in the beginning that is the biggest lay down person you'll ever have.
But then it gives you conviction that it can happen, right?
6:26
And so the more volume you, the better you get and therefore the luckier you become.
But the big picture is that people who invest, people who who do business at larger scale, just understand probability, right?
They understand that there is a percentage.
Now what's what's the?
6:42
The worst thing that can happen is, let's say this is a fun scenario to think about is let's say his first day he gets on the phone and he somehow closes the deal, right?
And that one deal may have been that one deal out of 10,000, that if he had started at the other end of the call list, it might have taken him a month to get there, but he just happens to do it first.
7:04
How much do you think that messes him up?
A ton, maybe.
Maybe or probably even more than working really hard to get there.
And so I don't know about you, but I feel like I've definitely had occasions where I've lucked out.
And then I start questioning myself, what am I doing different?
What am I doing different?
It might not be doing anything different.
You might have just hit the gold nugget way too early in the cycle.
7:22
And now you got to sift through a lot more nose to get to your next one.
You might have to sift through twice as many nose as normal because you got to, you got to account for the nose from the first one that you never actually hit, right.
And so anyways, as I'm walking him through this right, it just reminded me of how when people are starting out, they don't understand that the the concept of large numbers, right?
7:41
If you want to become lucky, if you want to have probability on your side, you simply increase in, increase the number, increase the volume, and eventually you will strike gold.
And The thing is, is that most people just literally don't go long enough.
He honestly was doing the, the, the little system that he's purchased the wrong way up until like a week ago.
8:00
And so I was like, cool, well, your first three weeks are wasted that you weren't doing it the right way, right.
You've now officially been doing this for seven days, right?
Do you feel like it's unreasonable?
Do you feel like it'd be reasonable for you to have a top 1% income in the United States after one month of learning a new skill?
And he was like, no.
And I was like, then stop believing you should.
8:17
I was like, if you do this for four years, because he's not right now, he's, he's pushing off college to do this.
I was like, if you do this for four straight years, I was like, do you think it would be reasonable that you'd be able to close one deal a month by the end of that?
And he was like, yeah.
And I was like, cool, then you're already twice as wealthy as the average college first dude be leaving.
8:35
Right.
Except you have four more years of experience than they do.
And so I'm trying to, like, paint these paint.
They just give him a different frame of seeing success and seeing the work that's required to get there.
And I was like, what happens if it's six years when you're 24?
What happens if in six years, 24, and you're not a millionaire yet?
8:51
What happens then?
He's like, I mean, I'd be, you know, like, what?
You'd be disappointed.
You're not a millionaire at 24.
Come on man.
The thing is is he might actually be right if he actually sticks with it for 6 to 8 years.
But most people end up hopping and always doing these half built bridges where they learn 234 of the skills, but there's ten that they have to learn and they say this isn't for me and they jump to another one.
9:14
They start building a new bridge right when the reality is you just have to keep laying the bricks, keep laying the bricks, keep laying the bricks all the way across the bridge from where you are to where you want to be.
And then the first dollar walks across and it takes a lot of time to put those bricks in place and to figure out which brick you're missing.
And the only way to do it is more.
9:30
And that is how you'll get better at the skill that gets the dollar across the bridge.








0:00
Real quick wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
0:19
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught, like those sayings are pervasive in our community because I think they are the things that are the bedrock of successful entrepreneurship.
0:39
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a.
Billion dollar portfolio.
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
What I want to talk to you about today.
0:57
Is a saying that we have said over and over and over again in our community and some real world applications to it and that saying is don't be cute.
And so the first time I heard this saying was from a serial CEO, he was a mercenary CEO.
So basically that is a CEO who's once a company like a private equity firm purchases a new company, they go have this kind of black book of their All Star players, their SWAT team that they drop in so that they can grow the company, right.
1:23
That's kind of how it works.
And so he's one of these CEO's.
He's one of these guys that's brought into a deal.
They get the company and then he grows it again for the private equity, usually in a three to five year span.
And then they exit.
He's done this exit process four times.
And he was the one who told me this story.
1:40
And so he was like, hey, don't be cute.
He has this Long Island accent.
I was like, I don't really know what that means.
He's like, all right, so you know, when you play in backyard football, I'm not even going to try to the accent.
And I was like, yeah, and he's like, so you've got.
Two, you know, you try and make these super fancy plays.
1:56
You're like, we're going to.
Go fake left and then double fake right, and then we're going to swing around and then you're going to pretend to be the quarterback and then I'm going to throw.
It that way, right?
He's like, what happens, He's like, you try it and then you know Tommy fumbles the ball and you lose 10 yards and you lose the ball, right?
He's like, instead he's like, put the two fat guys in the middle, run to the right and what is that?
2:16
He's like consistent yardage and he's like, don't be cute.
And so that story is always stuck with me because it's so true in business and that's what he was applying it to.
But I feel like so many of the entrepreneurs that I talked to and the ones that we work with a lot of times, myself included, like we try and be cute and we try and get fancy when it's usually the fundamentals that breed success.
2:38
And one of the biggest telltale signs, I think of somebody who's newer is that they do not repeat successful actions.
And that's there's two types of successful actions.
They're successful actions that you do that yield a good result and you think, oh.
I did that.
That works.
Let me go try and do something else rather than doing more of that thing right.
2:55
That's the 1st way.
The 2nd way is where you are paying for a system or you're paying for advice or whatever and the person says do it this way and then you do not repeat their successful action.
And so this is 1 where a lot of times I feel like we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
3:12
And this is one of those instances, because over the last probably week I've had three separate conversations. 2 with entrepreneurs who are doing about 3 million a year and one with a brand new entrepreneur of my neighbor.
I think I've referenced him before and when I was talking to my neighbor, he just bought this system so he can start flipping real estate and he's doing well.
3:30
And she was like, I think I might do it this way.
And I was like, listen, until you make more than the guy who taught you that system, you do the system exactly the way that it was outlined.
All right, don't get cute.
Don't think you were, you're special.
Don't think you're a snowflake.
3:45
Just do it exactly as it's outlined because there's a reason it's outlined that way.
And the two entrepreneurs that I talked to who are on our agency side, who are doing about 3 million a year, we just did a call and I was like, hey, what are your wins from this last month?
And both of them were like, we've been trying a lot of stuff.
4:02
And finally we decided to just, you know, do it the way that you would outlined it.
And we're actually seeing a lot better results.
And they said it kind of.
The tone was like, I don't know if reluctance the right word, but like feeling, feeling silly, right about themselves that they had taken this long to do that right?
4:21
And the reason I'm bringing this up is that if you purchase a system, if you take advice, if you watch a YouTube video of somebody who's doing better than you at something, which is why you're trying to learn, right?
And they're doing it a specific way, there's a reason that they're doing it that way.
It's probably because they have the same goal that you do and probably suffer from the same.
4:40
Cons that you suffer from and they've already balanced those for the best outcome, right.
And so recently this morning I was on a call with our marketing team, our traffic guys and I was looking at our funnel that we're, we're in the process of optimizing and my traffic guys like man, if people knew how much we work on optimizing our conversion process, he's like I feel like they wouldn't want to change anything because they'd know that we've probably already tried it.
5:09
And I wanted to at least pay homage to that because right now we're maybe I'd say 3 weeks into optimizing this conversion process of series of pages and copy and messaging and whatnot.
And even in those three weeks, we've already tested over 100 different pieces of this conversion process, this funnel, this series of landing pages, messaging, etc.
5:31
And so that means we've changed the headlines a handful of times.
We've changed the buttons, we've changed the flow of the pages.
We've changed where each one leads multiple times.
And so these iterations stack and stack and stack.
And so if I'm going to eventually show someone, hey, this is how it works, what do you think the chances are that if they change something, it's going to be better?
5:52
Probably low, right?
And so The thing is, is that we somehow, I think it's an ego thing.
As entrepreneurs, like, we always think we're special.
We think we're different, we think we're smarter, whatever.
But my word of my my rule of thumb for me is until I'm doing as well or better than the person who taught me this thing, do not change it.
6:10
Replicate before you get fancy, right?
And so that's where you know doing the boring work.
Don't be cute.
Those kind of saying we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
Like those sayings are pervasive in our community because I think they are the things that are the bedrock of successful entrepreneurship.
6:27
And it's repeating successful actions and there are certain points where once we get this conversion process optimized where I think it should be, I probably won't change, I won't be pushing as much attention to that.
I'll be pushing more of my attention towards filling the top side, right.
6:42
So right now we just, I'm putting enough attention on bringing in traffic so that I can find the optimal way of converting that traffic.
But once I feel like the numbers are optimized, I probably won't tweak that very much because now it's a successful action and I want to repeat it as many times I possibly can.
7:00
And then I'm gonna be focused all on my attention on bringing traffic into the top of that conversion process.
So you guys, real quick, if you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon.
It's called $100 million.
Offers At over 8005 star reviews, it has almost a perfect sport.
7:17
You can get it for $0.99 on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1000 hours into writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars so that later on in your business career I can.
Catch the partner with you.
7:32
So that's my gift.
Go check it out Amazon and back.
To the show.
And so as a total side note, because that's what these are for, I guess if you are in the process of optimizing something which if you're using someone else's templates or anything like that, then use them the way they are.
7:48
There's a reason they are that way.
But if you're coming up from these things from scratch, what I can tell you is that after having now done this, I've done this optimization process a zillion times in my life now.
The headlines and the messages, the top that literally the first one to two things that someone reads.
8:05
Are going to have the biggest swing on the needle.
And so many times I've spent hours and days and weeks optimizing the bottom part, the images and the pages and the copy bullets and things like that that are below the fold right on the newspaper.
If you flipped it open, there's a fold and then you can flip the second-half.
8:22
Landing pages work the same way.
Above the fold is what someone sees when they land on their desktop or on their mobile phone.
That's above the fold.
Below the fold is everything else.
I routinely.
Have seen changes of doubling to quadrupling the throughput of a page, meaning the percentage of people who Click to do the optimal action you want them to do, simply by changing the sentence at the top, or the sentences at the top and the one image that someone sees.
8:48
And so if you are trying to optimize something, if you're below, if you're way below where you need to be, don't even worry about anything below the fold.
And in fact, you could probably spend 90% of your attention above the fold and get way higher returns than your time, than everything below the fold.
9:04
And I can't tell you the amount of times we're literally just deleting everything below the fold got us better, better throughput on those types of pages and actions than even putting anything there to begin with, right.
And so just recently I changed the headline of our landing page for agencies.
9:19
We're going to be partnering with us for our Allen software and we 3X the throughput of that one page.
Simply by changing the headline and on our scheduling page, which is the third step in this process, we 5X the throughput by removing a headline that was there.
9:38
We didn't even add anything.
We literally removed something that was there and so which was, hey, you know, you finished this process.
The next step is this, we just took out, you finished this process basically.
And so people were like, oh, I'm not done, I need to take this next step.
And so it's just this huge, massive jump by removing something that was there.
9:55
And so all of this, at least for me, is this continuous reinforcement that we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
We need to repeat successful actions when they're there.
If someone gives us advice, or we're taking advice from someone, especially for paying for that advice, to not take advice is akin to literally burning your money, right?
10:11
Because this person, or this YouTuber, or this this thing that you're trying to learn from, this person you're trying to learn from, has already suffered the consequences of trial and error.
And so why would you not at least just duplicate replicate their process and what they're doing 1st, and then when you surpass or at least match them, then and only then you will have the understanding of the process to improve it.
10:37
And The thing is, is a lot of times people become experts because of how many failures they have.
If the first time you set the the plate, you hit a home run.
You may not know why you did that.
Is it because of your hip stances?
Because when you dropped your elbow, was it because you kept your eye on the ball like there's so many other factors.
10:54
But if you want the shortcut to getting to where you want to go, replicating other people's success, repeating successful actions both on yourself and what other people have done is one of the shortest paths to getting there.
And so anyhow, don't be cute, don't try and get fancy, Don't run the the Super crazy whatever.
11:11
Play.
Just look at the fundamentals.
Follow the steps.
Only iterate after you've duplicated the results of the person you're trying to learn from.
And so that was my message for you today that was top of mind.
The same advice I gave the 18 year old my neighbor who's flipping real estate right now, really proud of him.
11:28
And the same advice I gave people were doing 3,000,000 + a year is don't be cute.
Repeat successful actions.
We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
And then just keep doing the same things over and over and over again and you will get outsized returns.
So anyways, have a happy day.
11:45
Hope your marketing is converting like crazy money and leading you to financial wealth and freedom only to realize that it is empty and that in the process you will turn most of the people that who know you secretly against you.
They won't purposely tell you that they secretly envy you, and that's Okay.








0:00
The one thing that limits every business is the entrepreneur.
Not the opportunity, not the business vehicle, not anything else.
It's the entrepreneur.
Everything stems from them.
If there's three things, you've got the skills of the entrepreneur, the character traits of the entrepreneur, and then you have what I would call the beliefs of the entrepreneur is what do they believe about the world to be true, and what do they believe about the world to be true that isn't.
0:17
We have so many of these belief statements that like quote society or things that we inherit, but we just choose to say that this is how life is.
The easiest way to think about this is an analogy, which is if you imagine a ladder right, which you've got the ladder of success on one side, beliefs on the other side, and then you've got character traits in the middle as the rugs.
0:34
You might have a tremendous amount of skills and great character, but your beliefs are limited.
If all of a sudden you see somebody have an overnight success, it's usually because they had two of the three already very, very high level, but they were missing some huge part.
Some belief was wrong.
So for example, for me when I went from 2 million to 7 to just under 30 in a matter of like 3 years, I believe things that were true but the world that weren't.
0:55
And I didn't know that lexansing was a model.
I didn't know I could expand in that way, and so doing I was able to explode because I got into the right vehicle.
The vehicle wasn't limited, it was me and my beliefs about it.
And then as soon as I changed the way I saw the world, I was able to get into a much better vehicle and exploit from there.
The skills we learn through education.
1:11
Education comes from repeatedly doing things and learning from that experience.
The information that we acquire to learn things comes in a lot of different forms now.
The things that I actually invested in workshops, books, seminars, coaching programs, one-on-one tutors, one-on-one mentorships and Google.
1:30
And I would say if I had to allocate amount of time spent learning things, Google was still by far the biggest one.
Funny, the other day I just set up this new widget for our site.
I googled it and I did it in two hours.
And so I think that the amount of time that elapses between wanting to figure something out and doing something the more advanced you get shortens.
1:49
I remember it took me 3 years to figure out how to build a landing page and the day I decided to do it, it took me 4 hours.
So there's me three years and then four hours to actually figure it out because I was avoiding the feeling of sucking.
And so if you can confront sucking faster and just get over that idea that sucking is a bad thing, then I think you compress the time between you and the skills you want.
2:04
The highest value I've gotten from is from 101 mentorship.
It's from people who are far ahead of me that were willing to speak strategically into my life.
And that's usually because those people can identify all three of those things.
They can identify skill deficiencies, they're going to identify character trait deficiencies and they can identify things that you believe that are true, that aren't.
So that is where I've gotten the most leverage in my life is on and I've paid twenty $30,000 an hour to many, many different people just to have them speaking in my life.
2:26
Right underneath of that as I was coming up was joining masterminds.
It was the getting around other people because for me was very lonely.
And so just being around other people doing things it a got my competitive drive up because I was one of to be the best.
And seeing people that I didn't think were like better than me do something better than me gave me hope that I too could do it.
2:44
I'd see somebody be like, I don't think they were harder than me.
I don't think they've got like some genius brain.
If they can do it, I can do it too.
Also when I was in those communities, they would also already have sifted through information for me because there's lots of information out there.
The problem is that we have limited time.
So it's no longer about, oh, information's free.
You can find anywhere.
It's not free.
It costs time to go find where it is.
3:00
And so the idea is when you pay someone for information, it's not you're paying for the info.
You're paying for the time to come to sort through it, to hand it for you.
So you're cutting time.
That's what you're saving when you exchange the money.
That's the idea.
And I think a lot of people don't get that this is the actual order that I bought things.
So the first thing that I did, I did free interviews.
So I tried to reach out to people.
3:16
So I just said, hey, I'll show you the stuff that I've got.
You want to share notes with me?
I can drive out there.
We can meet up.
And that's how I learned a lot of my initial stuff.
Usually those older guys who are willing to like, you know, take a young, young buck under their under their wing.
If you're young, the advantage you have is that you're young.
You can get a little bit of that goodwill from older guys that you might not normally get if they're the same age you were like, well, the millionaire won't let me pick his brain.
3:35
It's like, well, no shit.
His time's more valuable.
Seniors either pay them or you have to go down or run.
You have to keep going down until there's somebody that's either a peer or just slightly ahead of you who you can provide value to any very narrow way.
The next one I did is I joined a mastermind that was $10,000 and I was saying back to yours, mastermind recipes.
3:50
And he actually took enough of a liking to me that he said, why don't you just become my apprentice?
And then he started paying me.
So it's kind of weird.
So I paid him and they paid me back.
And so I work from 4:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day with him basically as his secretary.
And I learned a ton three months, just like learning all these new terms, sales, copyrighting, affiliate market.
I learned all this stuff just from him because he was in that world.
4:06
From there, I started my first gym and I stayed in that gym mastermind during the time.
I also bought a weekend workshop for Facebook ads.
I learned Facebook ads in a small group of 10 people in two days.
It was really valuable for me.
Then I didn't really do anything for a couple years and then I went to Traffic and Conversion Summit.
So that was an event and I just learned more about marketing in general.
4:23
I got introduced to different softwares that I then started using, and then from there I kind of got more into the digital marketing world.
So I joined some masterminds in that world.
I didn't do coaching programs myself.
I actually ended up buying them for teammates.
I think the coaching programs are really effective to teach methods.
So if there's a method of acquisition you want to learn, whether it's like YouTube ads or Twitter ads or cold calling, whatever it is, joining a coaching program.
4:43
But other people trying to learn the same thing from study is good, is a great way to fast track your success.
It just gives you the accountability.
It helps you resolve problems faster.
What you're buying is speed.
It's not that you can't do it on your own, it's that you can do it faster with help.
If you were trying to solve a specific problem, finding specific coaching programs is really good.
If you've been stuck for a long time.
4:59
I think that's where like Masterminds and 101 mentorship is more valuable because you probably have a strategic issue more than a tactical problem now.
Well, the beliefs kind of get solved concurrently when you're in communities because the best way to break a belief is to see someone doing what you thought was not real and then have it happen.
A lot of people have heard of the Roger Banister story.
5:16
First man to break a 4 minute mile and then the next year 28 people or whatever it was broke the four minute mile.
And so the nice things that when you join these communities, the biggest benefit is not even the coaching, it's the beliefs that are broken and the things that you thought were false about the world that aren't.
And I remember there was a moment where I was in a mastermind and there was a guy making, I think, $350,000 a month.
5:33
And he got up there and he sounded like an idiot.
And Leila and I looked at each other afterwards.
We're like, if you can do it, we can do it.
That was when we weren't even doing that much money.
We were probably doing, I don't know, twenty $30,000 a month.
Like, it was not a lot of money.
So when I joined one of the first masterminds, I wanted to get my money's worth.
I wanted to get as much out of this as I possibly could remember, be everyone's number one student.
5:50
I talked to every single person that And I was like, Johnny was good at landing pages.
6:17
Hey, Johnny, remember I have to do that sales thing.
You think you could help me with landing pages?
Sure, man.
Of course.
OK, What else do I need?
I don't know how to run ads.
Hey, Sarah, you were really gonna run an ads.
Where?
That sales thing.
I helped.
You sure?
Of course.
And I get 101 tutoring from everybody on the things that they're best at because I just gave everyone what I was best at.
6:33
That's how I did it.
You want to become the most valuable person in your network, and then in so doing, you gain access to everyone's network.
Like, Joe Rogan doesn't need to network.
He just is Joe Rogan.
And so if he wants access to somebody, he gets access then because he's valuable.
I've never been a fan of, like, the networking hacks.
It's just provide value to people for nothing.
6:49
And then you will have people who owe you stuff.
You've got your skills, you got your beliefs, and then you've got your character traits.
If there's one that is the most important, I do think it's character traits, because the character traits are the wellspring that the other things are found upon.
If you don't have discipline, you'll never be able to actually study anything consistently to gain the skill.
If you don't have focus and you're always building a new bridge every week about the new business that you're going to do, it doesn't matter how many skills you have and the beliefs you have about the world.
7:11
Zuckerberg couldn't start 17 Facebook, so you only start one and have to stick with it.
And so that takes focus.
This is a really important point if you have a trait, and this is where it's helpful to have communities of other people and ideally mentors, etc, who can speak in your life.
And there's not even that many mentors who have the social awareness to say, I don't think you have integrity.
7:26
I don't think you have focus.
I don't think you have discipline.
I don't think you have work ethic.
I don't think you have drive.
I don't think you have empathy.
I don't think you have patience.
Like, these are virtues, These are character traits that people want to embody.
So you're like, how do you develop these traits?
You don't develop a character trait.
You act in accordance to what someone with that character trait would do, and you do it despite being uncomfortable doing it.
7:48
So I'll give you an example.
I was walking the other day with Layla.
I was like, God, I'm so impatient.
I was labeling myself as impatient.
And I I probably, that's been something I've believed my whole life.
I was like, yeah, I'm impatient, I'm impatient person, I'm go, go, go, go, go.
But I also want to be a more patient person.
I want to be wiser.
I want to be more longterm thinking.
8:03
And she said, you're not impatient.
And I was like, what do you mean?
I was like, all I want is for all this stuff to go faster.
And she's like, yeah, but you're not changing direction.
All your actions are one of somebody who is patient.
So the fact that you're uncomfortable being patient does not mean you are impatient.
It means you're just patient.
8:20
And so your internal feelings about what you're doing have nothing to do with the trait.
And so you think about the reverse of that, where someone's like, I'm super disciplined, except they don't do anything that's disciplined.
You're like, no, you're not.
They're like, no.
But I feel good.
Like, yeah, but you're not disciplined.
You have no evidence to support that you were disciplined.
The idea of building a character trait is not, do I have the character trait or do I not have the character trait?
8:39
It's to what extent do I have the trait.
And so if you can think about character traits that way, then you can start reverse engineering the character traits that you lack.
And this is really hard because one of the things that I see with entrepreneurs all the time is it will happen is that they will feel bad about something and then they will want to change something in their business to make themselves feel better.
8:55
They take those emotions and then they try and feel better by erratic behavior that's non directional and then they break their original strategy.
The more willing you are to endure discomfort for an extended period of time based on the decision that you made in the past because you know it's better for your future, means you are more patient.
Character traits, even more than any of them, are a pursuit of perfection that we will never attain.
9:13
But in understanding it that way, you can see it as a journey of trying to stack up wins in your favor.
You do the thing, and you do it so many times that at some point you look back and you realize, you know what?
I do?
Do this most of the time.
I guess I do own this trait.
And then you can label yourself as a patient man, a wise man, a kind man.

You might be thinking, well how long does it take to improve this stuff?
Like if I'm at 1,000,000 or 2 million?
Like how long does it take to improve?
Well, if you have the right pools and systems and the right plan, the right who, the what and the how, you can get the right outcome pretty quickly.
Welcome to the game where we talked about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:40
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wish Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
Long time ago in the Galaxy far, far away, I started a company called Jim Launch and Jim Launch basically turned Jim's around and then eventually became a licensing business that licensed over 5000 locations.
1:00
But here's the crazy part.
We went from $0.00 to $4.4 million per month in 20 months.
And it also sucked.
And that's what people won't tell you, because at the time I felt like the genius with 1000 hands.
I was in charge of every single apartment with my wife and we were basically doing everything while trying to managing and lead, while seeing the company and hiring and firing and training and onboarding and dealing with more customers you could possibly handle.
1:25
Obviously what it felt like for us is this constant roller coaster of emotions.
And I felt like a Dancing Bear on camera because, and every time customers would start going down, I'd be like, I gotta go make some more ads, I gotta go get on camera, I gotta go drum up some business.
And so this thing felt like this rocket that I was holding onto and I was sweating.
But until I hit a wall and I didn't know what to do.
1:42
And every time I went to these, like, Masterminds and coaching groups, I was by far the biggest person in the room.
And so I was like, what do I do?
I don't know where to go.
It got so bad that Layla and I and my wife were walking one day and she said, let's just shut this thing down.
And I was like, wait, hold on.
This might be worth something.
So I called an investment banking friend of mine, and I said, hey, if I were to sell my business, like, do you think I could get anything for it?
2:01
And he's like, you could get millions of dollars for this business.
And I was like, wow, that sounds amazing.
He said wait, but not right now.
There's a ton of things wrong with it that you'd have to fix in order to get an institutional investor to want to invest the kind of money that you would want to make an exit.
And that's what began this journey of figuring out how to take something that just makes money into an incredibly valuable asset that can change your life forever and your family's life from a financial perspective and everything about to show you in.
2:27
This is something that we developed at acquisition.com called the value acceleration method.
Now, you've probably heard of big companies like Netflix and Amazon and Microsoft being worth 2 trillion, five trillion, one gazillion dollars.
How does that even come to be like, how can something be worth a certain amount?
2:44
We talk a lot about value, provide value to people, make valuable content, right?
But when we're talking about value within a business, the person we're providing value to is the investor who's going to buy a share of it.
So there's only three variables that are really going to affect how much a company is going to be worth.
3:00
One is increasing the number of customers.
If all else remains the same, if you 10X the number of customers, you will 10X the value of the business, sometimes more.
The next, something I call lifetime gross profit, which means the amount of profit that you generate from these customers over the lifetime of their stay with your business.
3:18
For example, if I own a food cooking business and I sell meals for $10 and I sell 10 meals on average somebody, my lifetime revenue would be $100.
But if I only make a dollar on each of those meals, my lifetime gross profit would be $10.
3:35
And so if I want to make more money, I'll either have to get more customers or make them worth more.
So then what's the third variable?
Because this is pretty much all it takes to grow a business, which by the way is what it is.
You divide that by risk, meaning how likely is it that this will continue in the future.
3:53
And so if you listen to Uncle Warren, he talks about the value of businesses is taking all the future cash flows that it will ever generate discounted into the present, right.
And so these are the things that are all the cash flow that it's going to generate for the rest of its time.
This is the discount to the present.
And those are the three variables that you have to increase or decrease the value of a company.
4:12
And all these three things put together equal a term called enterprise value.
So take out your notepad because each one of these 10 things unlocks another level of enterprise value in your business.
And you, when you get them all right, you make a lot more money.
4:28
So let's start with piece #1, leadership team in place running the daytoday.
So for each one of the ten that I'm about to go through, I'll explain what it actually is, how I learned it and then how you can tactically execute and fix these things so you can increase the value of your business.
So a leadership team in place running the daytoday means that the person who owns the business can leave the business and the business can not only maintain but also grow in their absence.
4:51
Now The thing is, is that most small businesses, the business owner is the reason the business even exists and if the business owner leaves, so does the business.
The problem is, if you leave and the company goes down, then it means that no one else can buy it.
And as much as this is uncomfortable for a lot of entrepreneurs, many people own businesses that are worth nothing.
5:10
I mean that not as an insult, but more so because what they did was they created a job that pays well, that they have other people who help them, and they pay those people to help them, but they haven't created an asset.
And so always remember the saying, you get paid for what you do.
5:26
You get returns on what you own.
All right.
And so the idea is that if you want to become wealthy, you get wealthy from owning assets.
If you want to become rich, you increase your paycheck.
All right.
And that's the big difference.
So let me give you a tale of two different businesses that we have in the portfolio that tried to solve for this risk.
5:41
The first one ended up just saying, hey, I've got this buddy of mine in my network.
He's never run anything like this.
He's just run little, like, odd job type businesses.
And I'm going to have him come in and be the operator of my significantly larger company than this person has ever run.
And we were very vehemently against that.
5:57
But we sit in a minority position and so we say, listen, if that's what you wanna do, I'll support you.
But I wanna voice the fact that I don't agree with this.
So we will voice the fact we don't agree, but once the decision is made, we will support it to the best of our ability.
Now I'm not gonna tell you what happened yet.
Second scenario is a company where we've continued to grow it.
6:17
It had plateaued at a point where we saw we really needed to help the two founders and bring in more seasoned operator.
And so this is brick and mortar chain.
We took somebody who had taken a brick and mortar chain from 100 to 2000 locations open over a span of 10 plus years, had a lot of experience opening locations, negotiating leases, managing build outs, getting vendors in line on timelines, managing capital allocations so that we can actually roll out at the same pace making sure profitability across all of them, ensuring quality assurance.
6:46
I won't get in anymore of that, but somebody who knew what he was doing, guess what happened.
So we've got our sad operator and our great operator who come into the business.
So with the first instance, what happened afterwards, the business plateaued, cost continue to rise because this operator didn't understand how to manage cash flow, manage profitability, basically got more people into the business without increasing any kind of revenue, which then basically ate up all of the profit in the business business.
7:09
And this business was not profitable for nine months.
It let it just broke even for nine months and this was a very profitable business prior to this in this scenario with the more seasoned operator, this business continued to grow at the same pace, but the profitability increase expanded at a dramatically faster rate with this new person in there.
7:27
And so they even had a peer where he said, hey, I think we should just focus for this entire quarter on making all of our locations just more profitable.
We don't even need to open more and dramatically increase the profitability of the entire business overall.
And that's the difference between having an experienced operator and an inexperienced operator.
7:43
And if I'm a buyer and I'm looking at the business and I say, okay, these founders are gonna disappear.
Imagine the founder disappears here.
I'm like, I have no desire to buy this thing, right Versus here.
I say, well, gosh, I can see when this guy came in, I could see what it increased based on his decision making and his experience.
7:58
Wow, I feel like there's way less risk, which means this is more valuable.
So let's talk about what you can do #1 is this is the type of person who becomes either a manager.
If you have a smaller business, it could be a Director of Operations.
If you have a slightly larger business, it could then eventually become a VP of Operations and then finally become a CFO.
8:15
And one of the early mistakes a lot of entrepreneurs make is they have a four person business and say this is my CFO, it's not your CFO because of the Google salary of what the CFO makes, they probably make more than your entire business makes.
So would it make sense?
All right, now that's what that person title looks like.
Let me tell you, one of the mistakes that I've made so many times early on in my career is that I thought an operator was someone who managed systems and organization.
8:39
That's not what it is at all, an operator or somebody who can lead the business.
It has to be someone that you aspire to be like, that you admire in different ways.
And it should be people that everyone on your team could look up to, because that is what is going to allow you to step out of the limelight a little bit so that they can actually take some of the load off of you.
8:59
And let me give you the litmus test for knowing if an operator is good or not.
If you feel like you have more time now and you have way more bandwidth, they have helped you.
If they try to tell you to do all of these new things that you weren't doing before, they are arguably hurting you.
9:16
So the way that you have to look at this as a business owner is the difference between local and global.
Meaning if I tell the sales team that they have to put notes in the CRM, that actually increased how much stuff they do on a local level.
But by them doing that, I decreased all the work in the rest of the company globally.
9:34
And so if an operator comes in and says everyone has to do all these things, you have to zoom out as the owner and say, does this decrease work globally?
Or is this just giving us more stuff to do?
And a good operator tries to use as few systems as possible to decrease work across the entire company, whereas a bad operator will feel entitled and saying, why aren't these people falling out their checklist?
9:58
They're not finishing the task that I gave them to do.
It's because they add things without removing them.
And so from low to high, you'd have a manager, you might have a director of OPS, you might have a VP of OPS, and then eventually you'd have a COO.
10:14
All of these fundamentally do the same thing, just at different levels of an organization.
I would always prefer to start lower.
Most people over title.
It's one of the biggest problems that small business owners have to over credentialize people and then people beat their chests and get their ego involved.
And then you don't have room to bring people above them.
10:29
Because if you have somebody you're like, oh, this person's been with me since they won.
It's something.
Realistically, they're probably not a COO, right?
They're probably a manager or maybe a director of operations.
And one of the sad truths, and this is just data, is that if you 10X in size, the likelihood that you have the leadership team you had at 1X when you were at 10X is virtually nonexistent.
10:48
People develop skill sets, and those skill sets are good at certain seasons of the business's growth, and then they don't fit anymore.
And the only way for that person to stay on the ride is that they have to grow.
You have to have a growth mindset, and many people don't have a growth mindset.
You do because you're watching this, but most people don't.
11:05
It's a much smaller percentage of people who are willing to do that one.
And then also just because of the the churn and burn of business in life and moving locations and families and drama and whatever that they actually are there with time, you have to always prioritize the business because the business is what feeds everyone.
All the wealth that you want in your entire life is on the other side of a few hard conversations, and so it's a skill you're gonna have to develop. #2 is higher for a purpose, all right?
11:26
So you should have a clear idea of why this person is coming in.
You want someone to come in with a clear goal or a clear problem to solve, and this makes the interviewing process a lot easier, because then you say you don't have to give hypotheticals, you can just say, hey, this is my business, these are the stats, this is the problem.
11:41
How would you attack it?
And if you ask that to 10 people, the way someone answers the question and the way they talk through it logically should give you some insight into how this person's going to work with you.
A lot of times, entrepreneurs just hire people that they think they would be friends with.
But then you hire a lot of people like you.
11:56
And then you still need the people who are not like you to actually run the business.
Look at track record and experience and how comparable or relevant the experience is as one of the number one predictors that they're going to be able to help you go to where you want to go.
So this applies for a CMO, a CFO, a CPO, meaning Head of Product, all of those, C Dash, O's, all of them.
12:15
You still want to think this way, which is like, can they do the thing more than are we going to be best friends?
And when we're thinking about replacing the day-to-day, you've got risk, you've got getting more customers and you've got making them worth more.
So you can actually think about that in terms of leadership.
So you say, OK, if I were to leave, wouldn't we be able to get more customers next month and the month after if I weren't here?
12:35
Well, if the answer is no, then all of the leaders that would make that happen would be checkbox one.
The second check box would be making sure customers stay and continue to pay and maybe increase how much they pay over time if I leave.
Is there somebody or multiple people who are going to make sure that that happens?
If the answer is no, then you need to check that box off.
12:52
And for us at gym lunch for example, my limbus test is always if I step away, does the company continue to grow for six straight months without me jumping back in.
Which means that if they come to you with a problem, you have to say you have to solve it.
They probably already know what you would do and they can just make the guess.
13:10
And a lot of times I would ask be like, what do you think I'm going to tell you?
And they're like, well, I think you told me to do this.
I'm like, So what do you think?
Like, I think we should do that.
Great, do that, right.
And so that's how it can develop over time.
So #1, these are the different type of titles.
This can be just an example of a leadership team in general.
13:25
You're going to want multiple of these roles to fulfill those duties I was mentioning earlier.
Second is you want to hire with a purpose with a specific problem solve, And you can litmus test how good their solutions are when they talk to you against what your actual problem is.
So #3 is that A players know their value an A player cost 25% more than a B player, but A players produce five times more than B players, and so being willing to pay a little bit more to get way more value is one of the single best investments you can make in business.
13:51
That being said, if you are bringing A players on, expect them to want more.
Also expect some of them to negotiate pay.
Some of the best people I've had have tried to negotiate pay when they came in and that's okay.
I actually had to have a conversation with one of our bigger portfolio CEO's because he had amazing talent person that we found.
14:08
He was like, dude, she's trying to negotiate.
If you said if she loves this job, why doesn't she just take the job?
I was like a players know their value and it's now.
He said the all time best hires ever had and he almost didn't hire good.
Founders know that it's about the size of the pie, not the shape of the slice.
14:23
The founder of the company, when they go public, has on average 12% of the equity in the business when they go public.
Right now, most people would say that if you founded a company and then it went public, that you probably are very, very wealthy.
So those founders understood something that maybe you didn't and definitely something that I didn't when I was earlier on, which is that it's about how big you can make the pie.
14:43
And the more people who are incentivized to grow the pie, the bigger the pie gets.
Jeff Bezos doesn't have 100% of Amazon.
Warren Buffett has 30 something percent of Berkshire Hathaway.
Elon has 20% of SpaceX.
I'm going to ask you a visual question.
Would you rather have this slice of pie or that slice of pie?
15:03
So it's not about the shape of the pie, it's about how big it is, and that's what we ultimately care about.
And that was a big belief that took me a long time to break.
As a small business owner, I wanted to not give anything away, but it's amazing how much more discretionary effort you can unlock when people feel like owners.
15:21
All these things put together go to create the first part of the Mosey Lisa.
So let's talk about piece #2, marketing without the founder.
So this is me marketing, that business and sometimes even being in the ads and the videos and making the content whatever it is, that is not an asset.
15:40
That is a job.
This, if I still own it and still happening, is an asset.
That's the difference.
And this is what the investment banker friend of mine was explaining to me.
He said, well, number one, you don't have a leadership in place because it's just you and your wife #2 is that you're in every single ad.
15:56
If you leave, how do we know we're going to still get customers?
I had to step by step fix this with my own business so that somebody else could own it.
I started filming ads with my general manager so we'd film ads together.
And he told me later that the first time we filled ads, he was, like, terrified because of course he wasn't going to be as good because I've been doing it for a decade, right?
16:17
Like, I've been recording ads for my gyms five years before that.
And then I've been recording ads for gym lunch for another five years.
So, like, it been a while that I've been on camera pitching stuff.
And so I would record all the ads, and then he would follow me and do the exact same ones.
And when we started running them, surprise, surprise, mine still did better, but we still ran the ads.
16:37
And he still came with me to do the ads in every session.
And guess what happened next?
He got better and over time, he would start having ads that outperform mine.
And the way that we transitioned, it was I did them and then I would do some with him.
And then those were the ads we ran in the beginning.
16:52
So it was one versus 1 1/2, so only Alex and then Alex plus Kale.
Kale is my CEO.
He's still there to Alex Kale separately to Kale.
So that was the transition we went through.
Think about this from a branding perspective.
The brand is about associations.
17:09
And so if people associate me with this brand, what I need to do is transfer that association to someone else.
And so I say, hey, we're in this together and we run ads together.
And so people are like the brand Alex, this person brand Alex this.
And then eventually you can remove Alex and you have that person in the brand.
This process just from here to here took about 12 months.
17:27
And you might be like, well, Alex, like you have a personal brand.
Why are you doing this?
Well, there's a couple things.
One is that you can separate your personal brand from your business.
For example, you've got, you know, Andy Fascela, has Andy Fascela and they also has first form and they are somewhat different, right?
17:44
You've got Vaynermedia and then you've got Gary Vaynerchuk, you've got Alex from Ozie, you've got acquisition.com.
But I actually have another level of removal because all of how I actually make money is not ads for me, it's companies that we own, right.
So I can sell the assets that we have in our portfolio without it affecting me.
18:02
Like somebody who buys one of our companies isn't going to be like well Alex doesn't come with a deal.
Well, I don't actually influence the business.
I influence how I get deals.
You're always going to be you and so your personal brand is always going to stay with you for the rest of your life.
You should want to make sure that it's not intertwined with your primary source of making money.
Mind you that's if you want to sell.
18:19
If you don't want to sell, then don't worry about it, just go make money.
It's fine.
Not a big deal.
So the third part of the Mosey, we said that my investment banking, Fred said that I didn't have a needed to fix was delivery without the face of the founder okay.
So you're not in the ads anymore, but if I'm the one delivering service to customers or I'm key to the delivery and so you can think about this in two different ways.
18:40
One is I'm literally there doing the things as if you are the face and people come for your expertise in some way, then this can be difficult.
Now sometimes it's just your expertise is innate in why the product is good.
So like if you're a software designer and you're just a genius software designer or you're like an amazing editor, even though your firm may sell this and it doesn't actually have to do with you.
18:59
If you own the customer relationships, for example, like they only work with it because they love you or they love your way of designing things.
Those are all different examples of why a founder would be used in delivery and a risk factor for somebody else coming in.
So what do we need to do?
A lot of people think that when they're going to replace themselves, they need to find one person to replace them.
19:18
But finding another human being who has lived your exact life is impossible.
But it's much easier to find two or three people, or five people who've lived portions of your life in different areas so that together we're going to make this look even weirder.
19:35
You have a hydra of people who can deliver value to the customer.
Now here's how we did it.
I started edifying different people.
Now how I did it was we call them subject matter experts.
So I found people really get one component of what I did.
I might say this guy is my subject matter expert of sales.
19:54
This might be my subject matter expert of retention, this might be my subject matter expert of marketing.
And So what happens is people will identify that person as an expert in that particular area but not necessarily overall.
Now they still could be good overall, but how you brand them?
Within your world matters #2, the people that I did put even more edification into, had equity in the business, which also means that non competes hold weight if there's equity.
20:18
And So what I started doing was I would just like before 1st it's me with them watching, then it's me and them presenting things, and then it's me presenting them presenting, me presenting, them presenting.
And then eventually it was me not even showing up to any events whatsoever.
20:35
And so when we ended up selling gym launch, it took 24 months from when we decided to do this.
In the six months leading up to the sale, I didn't show up on a single client anything because I wanted to prove that the value had been transferred to everyone else.
And so over time, we'd have each of the subject matter experts talk on their thing.
20:50
My general manager would kind of emcee the event, give the state of the union, and it had nothing to do with me.
I owned it.
And to give you an idea of how involved I was in the beginning, to give you some hope.
If you're like, man, what?
Easy for Alex, right?
The 1st 400 days of gym lunch, I did a Q&A for 90 minutes every single day.
21:09
So I just said, hey, if you want my help, I'll hop on with you.
I say this to say that like I had a huge amount of demand to show you how much of A contrast this was from day one today, whatever it was, and put yourself in the shoes of the of the buyer, the investor.
21:24
Why would I want to buy a business where the guy who's literally delivering all of the values like, hey, can you just pay me for the next six years of value I'm not going to provide?
No, of course not.
Right.
It wouldn't make sense.
I will pay you for all the value that your company will provide to customers in the future if it doesn't require you.
21:42
And that's why this affects the risk factor within the business.
Remember this little variable?
We've got customers.
Because remember, if you lower the risk, the lower you make the bottom fraction, the bigger the overall value.
So a mistake that a lot of founders will make is that they'll start selling kind of time with them.
21:59
One off things.
Now mind you, if you're in the beginning and you make money, do what you got to do to survive.
Don't get me wrong, I'm just talking about how to maximize enterprise value.
It's really just more you doing a job and getting paid for it, Which is fine.
It's just not wealth creation, it's income creation.
So point #1 is that it might not be one person, but many people who end up fulfilling your role within the company. #2 is that you want to edify each of those people to the customers in their respective places. #3 is that you want to transition just like the the marketing one before me.
22:26
Lessen them and then eventually just them.
And then #4, if they're high enough up, then you can consider giving them small slices.
Now mind you what I'm saying, giving equity.
I'm not saying like give 10%, I'm saying you can give a half a percent or .1%.
These people said that they're still tied into the business delivery without the face of the founder.
22:43
Boom.
Next up we have this part of the background of the Mosey Lisa, but incredibly important multiple reliable acquisition channels.
So right now, if your business looks like this, if one day someone comes in and this just snaps and you have no way to feed your family over here, all your family, they all die because you can't eat, right.
23:01
Very sad.
So we don't want to do that.
What we want to have is multiple lines in the water that's, you know, a Fisher with lots of fishing pole sticks.
All right.
So there's two elements to this.
You've got multiple and you've got reliable, and both of those make up the fact that you have a more valuable business.
23:24
The idea here is that you want to know that you are not going to have your line snap because you get a ban on some platform if all you do is run Facebook ads.
If for some reason tomorrow Facebook says I ban you because I'm the God of media and I don't want you to make money anymore and your entire business dies, That's a significant risk.
23:42
The same degree if you make content on YouTube and that's your primary way of getting customers, YouTube can cancel you.
Or let's say that you have an emailing method that gets customers in the door if you're doing outbound well yet again, if for some reason you have, your whole domain gets shut down and then your deliverability tanks.
23:59
Now, mind you, all of these things have solutions.
Entrepreneurs are problem solvers.
And it's like, well then I create a new alternate YouTube channel or I create a new Facebook account under my wife's name.
And that one we were able to run.
Or I spun up a new domain so that I could deliver emails Like there's obviously solutions around this, but the more of them you have that are consistently getting customers, the less likely investors going to think, wow, this can go from 100 to 0 overnight.
24:22
All of these things decrease the risk of the business.
And so for us at Jim Wants, I had Instagram paid ads.
I had Facebook paid ads as my only two channels, right.
But what ended up happening, believe it or not, was that during COVID, these actually didn't perform super well for me.
24:40
And so I had to find another way to start marketing.
And so I actually had a guy from a competitor company approached me.
And he's like, oh, I work at a gym company that I hadn't heard of.
And I was like, huh, that's weird.
And I was like, well, if you don't mind my asking, like, what kind of revenue you guys doing is like, oh, we do about 10 million a month.
24:56
And I was like, okay.
So you're telling me that there's another person in my exact space that's doing more than we are.
And I don't even know who they are.
I was incredibly intrigued.
And I was like, well, how do you guys get customers?
He said, oh, we're all outbound.
25:13
And so of course I was never getting cold calls from them because I'm not a gym owner.
Right.
But he had a team of 30 plus guys who were cold calling, called emailing to get customers.
And I was like, well, do you think you could build out the op out system here?
And he's like, yeah, I'm pretty confident he's like it would take me like, you know, some time, but I think I could do it.
25:30
And I was like, all right, well, here's the deal.
I'll give you the job offer, but you're going to start your own department and it'll just just be you and you're going to have to, you know, start everything from the ground up.
And so the Long story short is that 12 months later, it was 50% of our revenue.
By doing that and by mending this, we had outbound as another method And because we had three different ways of getting customers, the acquiring company was like, OK, I feel good.
25:56
And it wasn't just like we get 5% of our customers from this.
Half our customers came from outbound, half our customers came from inbound.
And they were like, this looks stable.
And The thing is, is that over time this has been a lifesaver because sometimes stuff does happen.
The ads get disapproved, One of your top setters goes on vacation where the manager is not doing a good job who you just put in there.
26:15
Like there's things that can break on either of these, but the more that you have that are reliable, the more reliable the entire businesses overall.
And that decreases risk, which increases the value of the company.
And doing this provided you don't drop on your main channel because of your split focus, also increases the number of customers you get.
26:31
So this having multiple acquisition channels both increases number of customers and decreases risk, which is why it can be incredibly valuable.
It is however one of the most time consuming and focused draining things you can do as a business owner.
So I would say be very careful when you want to start deploying energy and resources into it because it's going to take significantly longer than you expect.
26:51
And so now I've stood up multiple outbound systems in our portfolio companies and I will tell you what I told them, which is that it takes 12 months.
I remember reading this in a book and it said it'll take 12 months.
And I was like for normal people it's like I'll stand this up in 12 weeks and it took 12 months.
And if you think about timing, somebody give you tactic #1, is that 1111 offer one avatar, one channel and that's until you hit $1 million per year.
27:15
If you're not there, don't worry about this.
You're not trying to build your a valuable enterprise yet.
You're trying to make money, which is fine.
Once you're here, I still would say just increase how much you're doing of these.
Once you get to about here, you can consider getting another channel going and oftentimes if you do it right, you can have the other channel support the primary channel.
27:35
If I said I want to start making content if I have content.
Content supports outbound content supports paid ads, and sometimes content itself can become paid ads, and so these things do work together synergistically.
It just takes resources, and my recommendation is if you're gonna start with someone else doing it so that you don't stop doing your main job.
27:51
So #2 is what I just went over, which is the first thing that I'm gonna do after I have something working is more and better.
OK, we have paid ads.
Can we do more paid ads?
Can we spend more money?
Can we make more ads?
Can we make our ads better?
Can we introduce different call outs?
Can we introduce different hooks?
28:07
Can we create different value?
Can we get a more voluminous cadence of recording in place?
That would be ways of doing more.
If I was doing outbound, more would be more calls, more dials, more setters, whatever.
Better is improving the scripts, improving the training, improving the offer we give them on the phone.
This is the lowest risk way of growing the business.
28:22
We already know it works.
Let's do it more.
Let's do better to the point where I think my team is probably tired of me saying more better.
And #3 is don't kill your business in trying to save your business.
If you decide to go after the second channel, understand that it's going to take a long time.
And so if your main channel drops while you're trying to start your other channel, you basically create the problem you're trying to solve.
28:41
You want to, one, be patient before you do it and be patient once you start #2 is look at progress more than outcome.
That's what I would highly encourage you to do cuz it's gonna take time.
So even if you're starting paid ads, the first thing you would be is like, are we getting clicks?
28:57
Great.
If you're getting clicks, then it's like okay, Are we getting opt ins?
Great.
If we're getting opt ins and can we get scheduled?
OK.
Are they showing?
OK, Are the people who are showing the right types of people?
OK, yes.
Great.
If they're not, OK, what do we need to do to tweak in the targeting or tweaking the messaging across the whole funnel?
29:12
OK, we're getting on the phone with the right people, but they're not buying.
OK Then we need to add some more friction, We need to add some more selling aspects, etc, Right.
Look at the progress, not the outcome.
Because if you look at that, you might think, wow, this took two months.
We didn't even make any sales.
But think about this way.
Let's say it cost you $10,000 a month to invest in a new way to get customers, and it takes you six months to make your first sale.
29:31
Let's say a sale is worth $1000.
Well, that costs $60,000.
But when you do get that first sale, you got a 12:50 return on that once you got all the tweaks done.
Well, in that next month you could spend 30 grand and make 300 and get 5X on your initial investment.
Think about this as investing in a machine that prints money.
29:48
Of course it's going to cost time and cost money to create the machine, but the machine will pay for itself over and out, which is why business overall gets higher returns than anything else because there are very few other machines We can put a dollar in and get 10 back or put a dollar in and get 100 back in a month.
But business you can't.
But it costs money and time to figure it out.
30:05
My Third Point here is that I would say use others.
And of course there's examples where you could say, OK, I started this one channel, I got a leader in place and I'm going to figure out this next channel.
That's a way of doing it, as long as that person continues to run the thing without you.
The way that I have preferred to do this over time is that I will bring someone else in to start the thing and I will consult and give feedback.
30:27
But I want them to own it so that I don't just create another problem that I'm going to have to solve in the future, which sometimes means that it's going to take longer and I have to make sure I'm focusing on the progress.
As long as every week we're moving towards this, we'll get there.
And if you're looking at, well, OK, well, which one would I do next, which is a great question.
30:42
All right, which is #4.
My recommendation is look at where people in your industry already acquire customers.
So if you are a direction consumer brand and you sell something that is weight loss focused, well then paid ads is a huge source for people in that industry.
And you can be confident that if it's paid ads and it's in this media type for businesses of your size, like don't look at Weight Watchers and be like, well, Weight Watchers is running Super Bowl ads.
31:06
So I should try that.
Probably not the best first step, right, But if you're looking at other people who run local gyms and you could say Okay, well, companies of my size in this space are able to acquire customers here profitably.
So if they can do it, so can I.
And that's kind of how I look at it.
Until you've done this multiple times, just look at what other people are doing and you can iterate off that most nation real quick.
31:29
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
And if you like that we would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can plan anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
31:48
That being said, acquisition.com multiple reliable acquisition channels like Content Town #5 is reliable recurring revenue.
So let me illustrate visually why this is so important.
In a normal business, what might happen is you would sell a customer this month and they're worth 1000 bucks, and the next month you sell another customer's worth $1000 and make another $1000 this month.
32:09
And guess what?
Month three you do the exact same thing and make the exact same amount of money.
That is what most businesses do, which is why they are not valuable.
Now let's say the exact same scenario, except in month one you sell a recurring customer.
A customer who buys this month, he buys the next month, you buy the month after that.
Well, in month two, we're still going to sell another customer.
32:26
So we're going to sell that customer and guess what he's going to do?
He's going to pay the next month too.
In the third month, we're going to sell yet another new customer.
Boom.
Now if you're comparing the before and after here of old way, new way, this is just three months.
Now imagine 36 months or 60 months, this thing would be this high and this would just still be the same.
32:47
And so when you see a business that's plateaued, it's because they sell the same amount of customers every month and those customers are worth the same amount to them and they do not grow.
They've hit a point of homeostasis.
Recurring revenue businesses, if designed properly, will continue to compound.
And so This is why it takes time to build big things.
33:04
And so one of the biggest breakthroughs that I had in my business career was understanding not that you should have a subscription and why it's not just about having a subscription because let's say you get a subscription, everyone cancels after the 4th month.
So this is the 4th month, but every month after this, we're going to have the same revenue.
33:21
So this is going to stay the same because they're all worth four months.
So I'm going to stair step up to four months and then I'm going to plateau again.
What you really want is something called net negative churn.
That's a fancy word, but it basically means that every single month, if you acquired no new customers, you would still make more money.
33:37
So an example of this would be something like Salesforce, which is a company that's valued at a gazillion dollars.
And the reason for that is let's say that this month they have 100 customers.
Now they may lose one or two customers this month, but the remaining 98 customers become more valuable to them the next month than they were that month because those businesses grow.
33:55
And the better designed a business model is, the more aligned your customers outcomes are with your own outcomes.
And so for Salesforce they're like OK, well, if you have more seats where you have more e-mail contacts or more revenue that's flowing through the software, we get a bigger percentage of that.
34:11
And so the remaining growth that they tie themselves to, they get their claws in you allows them to continue to grow.
And so when they acquire customers, think about this, if a customer to them might be worth $1,000,000, how much can they send to Arora customers unlimited.
That's the difference here is that we want to have revenue that will not only stay but also grow.
34:29
And that's kind of the two levels of this.
Like Netflix doesn't really have a lot of expansion revenue besides you getting addons for your family or whatever, right.
But they just hope that you never cancel and that's more common in consumer businesses.
In B2B businesses, because you have way fewer customers, you want to usually have much more expansion revenue opportunities tied in, in a way that not only gets them to not cancel, but actually buy more.
34:49
So remember earlier we talked about enterprise value.
So enterprise value is the value of the business.
Usually the value of the business is measured by a multiple on earnings, meaning how much money did this business make this year or the last year and what is the multiple that we'd have.
So if I made $1,000,000 in profit and I said the company was worth $5,000,000, then it would be a 5X multiple, right.
35:07
And so in public companies, they call them price to earnings ratios.
Let me show you some companies that you may have heard of.
So you've got Netflix here, we've got Amazon here, little Jeffy B and we got a little Billy G, little Microsoft.
And so you might be like all of these companies are super valuable, and they are, but you might not know how much more valuable investors value them compared to their earnings.
35:26
And that multiple is purely based on how reliable they think the future revenue of the company is and how likely it is to continue to grow.
So Netflix right now trades at 44 times earnings.
Man, wouldn't that be nice if you made $1,000,000 in profits?
Someone paid you 44 million, What a steal.
35:42
Microsoft trades at 29 times earnings a little less kind of interesting, good old Jeffy B is getting 310 times earnings.
Now there's a couple things here.
Part of the reason that this is 310 is because Amazon actually runs slim margins.
And that's by design because they continue to reinvest in growth and they look at their returns on capital.
36:01
And so investors know that at anytime if they wanted to make the business more profitable, they could they choose not to make it super profitable which then compresses the amount that is being multiplied for this value.
So there is a little bit of a game to this in terms of understanding why the multiples are so high.
36:16
But when us as business owners, you're probably not going to be in anyone of these scenarios.
Realistically, you're probably looking at one to four times earnings.
If you're a small business owner that's doing less than 10 million a year.
If you're doing over 10 million a year and over $2,000,000 a year in profit, then then sometimes that multiple can move up.
36:33
Again, it depends on some of the other factors we're talking about today, which is when you check all the boxes, then you do own an asset that's valuable and that's the point of this whole thing.
Part of the reason that Amazon also has a higher multiple is that Amazon has a lot more expansion opportunities to think about this.
They have Amazon Prime in their whole marketplace, but then they also have like AWS and they've got Prime Video.
36:49
They could literally sell everything.
So they have tons of expansion opportunities.
Netflix has significantly fewer expansion opportunities, and so it's not valued as highly.
And that's mostly just because they only really have one core thing.
And the other piece is, how defensible is this?
How likely is it that another Netflix gets created?
37:05
Well, we already have proof of that.
You've got Disney plus, you've got HBO Max.
They used to be this category King.
They're the only person.
Then everyone else was like, oh wait, we can just go hire production studios and stream stuff too.
We need to get a couple of big brands by us.
Disney was like, we'll get Marvel and Star Wars, and then they weren't the Dom, but they were just a channel.
37:21
Whereas Amazon, it's virtually impossible to recreate what Amazon's done.
And so they also have this big competitive motor around them, which makes it almost impossible for anyone to beat them at their game.
And so they have this base way of holding on to all their customers.
And then all they're going to do over time is just add more and more and more ways, like buying Whole Foods to make money from their customers.
37:39
But there are 9 C's of recurring revenue.
And when I think about this is like, how can I increase how sticky it is or how likely someone is to continue to pay me for whatever I have #1 is consumption.
Are they actually using the thing that they are paying for?
Right.
One of the interesting things I found out in the gym world is that almost everyone is willing to pay for a gym membership that they use, and almost no one is willing to pay anything for gym membership that they don't.
38:02
The next is collateral.
Think about a storage unit.
They've got your stuff and you have to keep paying them.
A payment processor has all of your customer data and they process all of it, and they make it very difficult for you to take your credit card info, which is encrypted from their payment processor to somebody else's.
And so they have collateral.
38:17
They have some of your shit, and so they force you to keep paying them so that they keep making money.
The next is cost of switching.
Is there a way that I can make it difficult to leave?
Don't think.
How do I make my customer's life harder?
More think.
How do I make my things so much better that they would lose all of these benefits if they left?
38:32
If I have 10 friends in a community and I pay for that community and then I leave and I meet with them in person on a regular basis, I'm going to lose that.
So there's a high cost of switching.
Next is choice.
I don't want many other choices like what I have available for them.
If you have a patent or you have some sort of trade secret that makes it difficult for other people to clone what you have.
38:51
So you're n = 1 of the only option that someone can have next is control the money flow.
This is more in a B2B scenario, but if I have the ability to control the money flow, that's why I like payment processing and software always tries to get the ability to process your payments for you.
Uber process their payments for their drivers, DoorDash does for the restaurants.
39:09
If you can control the money flow, you have a lot more leverage for them to stay with you.
The next is a softer one, right, which is cause charities, movements, things that you associate with.
If you have two different options and you're like, you know what, this one does a lot of good in the world.
I align my identity with their values.
39:24
I want to continue to pay there.
And I hinted at this one before.
But community, right?
Like community is a way to increase the stickiness around whatever the recurring membership you have is, right?
Whether it's a gym or it's an online subscription.
If there is a community now, you might be like, well, there's no community around Netflix, you're right.
39:41
But do you think that there's a community around Stranger Things?
Hell yeah, there is, right.
And you want to be able to say on Monday morning, dude, did you see the new episode of Stranger Things?
That was wild, right?
And so you commune with other people about the content.
Next is contracts, and that's the same ideas as commitments, right?
So if I say, hey, you're signing up for 12 month membership, here's the contract, that's your commitment, then you're going to have a stickier recurring revenue than you are.
40:02
If it's just months, a month you can get.
So whenever you want.
And the last one I'll give you is communication, which is.
Literally, just talking to your customers more regularly.
So in the gym world, we figured out that when we said we're going to run events on a regular basis, Belly Blast or Big Booty Boot Camp or whatever it is, our churn would decrease leading up to the event because they had something to look forward to.
40:20
But then after the event, it would go up.
And So what do you do?
You just always have something for people to look forward to and you communicate that regularly.
So I give you 9 ways to do recurring revenue.
There are more, but that's a good place to start.
Do you think we've checked this one off?
I think so.
This looks like a nice green corner that was anti climactic.
40:37
So our next one is part of my bicep or Mosey Lisa's bicep diverse customer base.
So having a diverse customer base, let's imagine that this is your customer base, you've got all these little fishies here and then all of a sudden one day boom, Mr. Whale comes along and says, I want to give you so much money because you're a small business owner.
40:56
You're like, man, I got to win this whale.
I want to make this money.
And hey, don't get me wrong, by all means to go whale hunting, but The thing is, is that this actually materially changes your entire business and your business strategy.
If you continue to acquire customers here and then you have to keep delivering on and hire more people to deliver for this whale, you've kind of got this weird business.
41:12
And if I'm a buyer, then you really don't have this business.
These are almost irrelevant.
It's like having only one customer.
And if that whale all of a sudden gets sick or just doesn't like you or one of your reps say something rude and he says, I'm going to swim away, then you're sad and then you're like, what do I do?
41:28
And now I have all these people that are over hired for, etcetera, etcetera.
And so if you had the choice between this with a couple of little fishies underneath or a whole school of fishies, then as an investor you're going to want this because it's more diverse.
If I lose 1 fishy, it's not really going to kill me and I can go get another fish.
41:46
But if you're thinking what else could I do?
Well, I'll tell you.
If you decide that you want to do this whale thing and you realize that whales are worth more and you actually enjoy the process more, then go get a whole bunch of whales.
You will still get a diverse customer base of huge clients.
And these are some of the most valuable businesses is if you can get 10 or 20 or 100 whales, then everything's based on percentage of revenue.
42:10
Whale is relative.
If you get Google as a customer, they're a whale.
But if you have Google and you have Amazon and you have Netflix, all the other big companies, then all of a sudden they're just little fishies too.
It's just you have a way bigger pond for your fishies to be in.
And so the idea is that you want to have no one customer be greater than 20% of your revenue.
42:31
Ideally, for me, I don't like anyone more than 5% my revenue just from a personal level.
I don't like feeling like I'll use the language came to mind.
I don't want to be someone's bitch as much as the shortterm revenue of having a whale come along.
Sometimes these guys can cannonball and create too big of a wave in your business that might actually sink your shit.
42:47
And so the risk that we're trying to address here is what if one customer leaves?
So let's say you've got $100.
Whatever.
You can put whatever zeros you want on this.
All right, this is your Business Today, and this is your profit.
Cool, I told you that.
What if a whale is 30% of your business?
43:03
Here's Mr. Whale.
It's like a worm anyways.
Now, if Mr. Whale leaves, so does your profit, and then all of a sudden you're breaking even.
So even though the customer was only 20% of your business, it might be 100% of your profit.
43:20
And so if you can lose 100% of your profit by losing one customer, that's super risky.
And so that is why I prefer to keep it at 5% or less of all my revenue coming from one specific client or customer.
I think there's two big decisions you have to make when you're thinking about diversifying customer base.
43:36
One is, do you take the whale on to begin with because it may create too many waves in your business that you basically have to create a business around the whale that if the whale leaves, you then are left with all these costs that would sink the business if you didn't have them.
So you become really reliant on them.
So decision one is whether you take the whale on Decision 2 is that if you take the whale on, are you going to then go get more minnows or you're going to go get more whales?
43:57
Because it might make sense.
If you say, hey, strategically, I think it makes sense for us to go up market, go after higher value customers and have fewer of them.
And so I'm willing to build this infrastructure for this one customer so that I can have 10 more of them.
That makes sense.
And so if you said this is my business, this is my avatar, this is my nits, this is what I'm going after, then a big part of focus means saying no.

And sometimes a big shiny whale is just another woman in the red dress who's trying to distract you from your ultimate goal.
Because fundamentally, if you had a business that just served that one avatar, you should just go 10 exit.
This will create all of these difficulties that will distract you from the main thing.
I don't think there's anything else to add here, so let's stick this puppy on.
44:32
Diverse customer base forearm and my bicep Looking good forearm piece.
In reality #7 Automated metric tracking.
Every business needs to have metrics because if you don't have data, you can't make good decisions and you'd be amazed how much smarter you seem if you have data to support what you do.
44:48
It's one of the first things that we do when we bring on a portfolio company is get this stuff in place so that we can make better decisions for the future and ultimately give that data to an investor who might ultimately want to buy it for a significantly higher multiple in the future.
So what I'm going to do is demonstrate this in the real world to give you an example and call my director of brand.
45:03
This could go horribly wrong.
What's up?
Alright, pop quiz test #1, how many registrations do we have right now for the book launch event?
We have almost 292,000.
That sounds nice.
Thank you guys.
45:20
How many, how many affiliates, how many people are promoting the book on our behalf as of yesterday, as of this morning, as of this morning, yeah, I can get so 10,800 as of this morning.
All right.
That's, you know, we're two hours away from that real time stat.
So we'll 1813, there you go, 10,813.
45:38
OK.
Thanks man.
I appreciate you.
So that idea is automated metric tracking.
And so he would only be able to say that if he actually had dashboards in front of him that would allow him to answer those questions.
If he didn't, he'd have to be like, I'll have to get that to you tomorrow and I'll have to look at three different Google Sheets and then count manually how many people are doing XY&Z right.
45:57
And The thing is, is that the more difficult it is to collect data and report on data, the less data you end up reporting on, which means that you have few and fewer pieces to make decisions off of.
And so I'm often amazed by how little data is collected in most businesses because I'm like, how are you making any decisions?
And for the most part, the answer is they're just guessing, which is a terrible way to make decisions.
46:15
So one of the best and most important hires you can have and things you can do is switch from a big conglomeration of Google Sheets to actually fully integrating some sort of CRM in your business.
And this is where the things like Salesforce and HubSpot and some of these other platforms exist is to help small businesses become medium sized businesses.
46:35
It's worth paying well to get it implemented in the business so you know data of what's going on in real time so you can make real time decisions.
Automated metric tracking affects how many customers you get, lifetime gross profit per customer and the risk associated with everything because if you don't have tracked metrics, you won't know what your lifetime gross profit is.
46:55
You won't know where your customers are coming from or what percentage of revenue each customer is worth or what your cost per lead is.
And so if you don't know what the basic are, then how can you make the advanced moves if you don't even know what the basics are, how do you improve them?
And so the first thing, if you want to do a grows business is know what current state is.
47:11
But again, I'm amazed at how many people don't even know what's going on in their own business.
If I'm like, hey, how much profit you make that something like, I don't know, I'm like that's Friday.
You should know these things.
You can tell how skilled someone is at anything based on the number and quality of the metrics they track.
A lot of like marketing founders, pure really good promoters are like, oh, our products, amazing.
47:30
And I'm like, cool, what's your time to value?
What's your churn, what's your onboarding process?
And I start collecting, you know, asking just for stats around product.
And they're like, we have a low chargeback rate.
And I'm like that is not what a good product means.
If I said, hey, what's your cost for impression, what's your cost for league?
47:46
What's your conversion rate?
And they're like, oh, I got that, that, that, that, that you need to be as in depth about your product and your delivery as you are about your acquisition.
And if you know the quality and quantitative stats on the front end, you should be paired in terms of how nuanced you are on the back end.
Because the people who are really good are that nuanced.
48:03
And that is my biggest indicator if I'm interviewing for roles by the way, of knowing if somebody is good or not.
If I'm interviewing for a sales manager for example, and I say, hey, you know what metrics should be tracking.
He's like I like to go by feel, you know, manage the vibe of the team.
I'm like that's not bad, that's fine.
But like what metrics do you track And they're like, you know, closing percentage and you know cash collected, I'll be like, OK, cool, that's a great start.
48:23
Versus I have a guy who comes on and says show rates, I like to count offer percentage, I like to count what types of objections we're getting on our nose.
I like to count number of calls required to close.
I like to have cash collected.
I like to have cash as a percentage of total ticket value.
48:41
I like to know what my speed to contact is.
I like to know what my speed to close is in terms of first contact until they close.
All of a sudden, I'm like, OK, this guy gets it.
He's looking at a number of different variables that are highly quantitative so that he can then make far more targeted improvements in the process so that we can make more sales.
49:00
This is actually supposed to be for another, but I'm going to show you this in real time.
So this was actually a before and after of one of our portfolio companies.
And So what we did, we said, hey, let's track data.
And so then we started tracking data and then they were like, oh gosh, these are our stats and we're like, OK, cool, now let's improve it.
49:17
So to make these improvements, for example, for the show rate, we have a huge checklist of like 22 things that we do.
Many of them are automated that we can do to increase show rates and boom, 50 to 70%.
Now you might think, oh, that's a 20% improvement.
That's not a 20% improvement, that's a 40% improvement on the original number.
49:34
So like wow, that contributed a lot here from close rate.
We then started going through our drilling process to train closers and our scripting process so we can get to the sale faster so we can close a higher percentage people and that showed in the numbers.
So from an improvement perspective, this was 14%, but 14% of 27 is a 50% improvement in sales.
49:55
And then the bottom is the end result.
So one of the things that I have is no Silver Bullets, many golden babies.
It's a game of incremental improvements for us at acquisition.com because we work with the same types of companies.
We know what it takes to improve show rates, like we have all the best practices and we just say here's the 22 things we do and we're going to implement all of them one by one.
50:14
And that's the result.
With closed rates, we're like, these are all the things that we have to do in the business and one by one we take them off.
And so it becomes very clear what the next step is because you know, if you do all of those things, the numbers will go up.
Why do we feel that way?
Because we have evidence.
So number one, pick the platform that you want to start tracking the data.
50:29
Number two, pick the data.
Like what data do you want to actually track?
Some people call KPIs, I don't really care.
Pick the data that you want to track.
Number three, person.
So you're usually going to have somebody who's going to be implementing this platform in your business.
Someone needs to own it.
You need to have one chest to poke or throw it to choke or whatever way you want to say it.
And then for game plan and the way that we do this is we operate off the theory of constraints, which is we look at these numbers, right.
50:51
So let's say that we had just collected, so we picked our platform, we picked the data that we wanted to pick and we had somebody who's making sure that this is happening.
OK, cool.
Which of these do I feel like we have the highest likelihood of improving the fastest, right?
This is going to be the constraint of the business.
And the way that you see what the constrain is, you can add 5% or a fixed percentage to any of them and see which one of those will actually yield the most throughput.
51:11
Meaning if I add 5% here, 5% here, 5% here, 5% here, which of those 5% increases actually change this number the most?
And the answer in this instance would be this one which is the lowest number.
So if I'm looking at this and my my next lowest number would be cash collected and the number after that would be show rate.
51:26
And so I would usually attack it in that order so that I could have the biggest bang for the buck for the things that I do.
Which one of these is the smallest?
That's the one where if I if I make an incremental change it'll actually yield the most outcome Fore arm we're getting close.
We've got ourselves a nice corner piece of the Mosey Lisa, which is high cash, profitable, growing with a good story.
51:48
So let's do a little physics lesson.
Sir Isaac Newton's first law of physics was an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion until another force is acted upon it.
And so it's much the same with businesses.
You want one that's already in motion because you know that it's more likely that a growing business will continue to grow than a business that's not growing will start growing because you have to exert force to a business that isn't moving in order to get it to move, stay.
52:15
A business that has high cash flow means that it kicks off cash in excess of what it needs to reinvest in the business to remain competitive and grow.
The 2nd is that it is profitable.
Now you can have a profitable business that doesn't create a lot of cash flow.
For example, if I deliver services and I have to wait 90 days in order to get paid, then I might be profitable on paper but not produce a lot of cash because by the time that cash hits, I have new liabilities that I'm incurring and growing.
52:39
Is that a business gets bigger every month or every year, right?
Pretty simple there.
And ideally with a story, because if you have a story, investors like anybody else are customers and they like to hear stories as well.
So let me give you a very complex visual of what this looks like.
You want a business that goes like this and not like this.
52:57
I'm not saying that a company cannot be valuable if it doesn't have high net free cash or it's not profitable.
HubSpot for example I'm pretty sure isn't profitable and it's a public traded company worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
I also try to cater my content to my audience which is 99% of business owners aren't Netflix or aren't HubSpot or aren't venture backed with tons of money that are hyper scaling.
53:22
Most of them are like us, are self funded in one way or another or have friends and family who invested in their business to help them grow.
And those people have lives.
And I will say this is that we hear all of the Netflix stories and the HubSpot stories, but we don't see the graveyard of the many others that didn't make any cash flow for six years, seven years and then never quite became HubSpot.
53:45
And so the founders spent seven years of their lives, never really took a a paycheck out of the business and then ended up with nothing.
And so for me, especially if I'm investing in a business, I'm a cash flow investor, I want to see how much money does this thing kick off after we have to reinvest in the business to keep it competitive.
And even with companies that have high demands on capital, I'll give you an example, like we, we love brick and mortar businesses.
54:05
So like by the way, if you have brick and mortar chain, we crush those.
Those have very consistent returns on capital, meaning it cost me $100,000 to open a facility and I make $500,000 a year and profit back and then I would say okay, cool.
Well, that's an amazing return on capital.
How can we take that 500 and then open five?
54:21
And even in those situations with an insane return on capital, I would still usually recommend that the founder take a fixed amount out of the business on a monthly basis to de risk them.
Now it's 100% personal choice because risk and how much you're willing to expose yourself to is personal.
54:38
But for me, I'll tell you a quick story.
When I had my gyms I invested 100% of all my profit into open new locations.
I then decided after a few years that I didn't want to be in the gym business in that way anymore.
And so then I basically fire sold my gyms to then start gym launch.
And so I could have, I made a lot more profit during that period of time and I could have sold them for a lot more than I did.
55:00
But because when I wanted to sell them, I wanted to get rid of them.
And so I think in total I think it made like 250 or $300,000 from the sale of 6 gyms, which is not a ton of money.
I put way more that just into building the gyms.
I encourage founders to take cash out.
55:16
I still prefer to put Human 1st and say I I'm willing to sacrifice a little bit of growth for you to like take care of your family.
For example, we started talking to a company called We Whiten, which is a teeth whitening chain.
They had 32 locations by the time we actually ended up closing the deal.
I think this is probably like four months end to end, which is actually pretty decent in terms of timelines.
55:36
They had grown by 30% in that period of time, right.
And this is what made them attractive to us as an investor is that they had, they were high cash flow, they were profitable and they were growing and they had a cool story about how they wanted to continue to see growth.
And this is my bread and butter and I will be excited to tell you what happens in 12 months with these guys because I'm very confident about our playbook.
55:55
But it doesn't cost a ton of money to open a teeth whitening studio relative to the amount of profit that they kick off.
And so because of that arbitrage, we get really good returns on capital, meaning instead of investing in the stock market and putting you know $100 in and getting $10 back, I could put $100 in here.
56:14
And because of also how quickly they become profitable, like how quickly can I pay off a new location.
Well, I could pay off a location in two months, Okay.
Well then that means that I can compound six times in one year off of 1 location.
56:30
Now when you have 32 locations and that's why they have so many so quick, it can, it can get really big really fast.
So when you're building a story for a company, you usually want to track the story to a trend, meaning like a I is a trend right now.
56:45
Here's how a I will help us or how a I will not affect us is a great way to demonstrate a story around why somebody should expect to continue to see growth in the business.
So like if I have a haircut chain, I could probably make a strong argument that people are going to still need to get their hair cut.
57:02
Now if I'm in a design firm, I might have a harder time arguing that AI is going to not affect my business.
Or flipside, I am going to try to put myself out of business and say we're fully leaning into AI and we've already, you know, cut headcount by 50% and 10X productivity using these tools.
57:19
And so now we're even more profitable than we were before with higher cash flow.
So the idea is you want to track the trends that you align with that will give you tailwinds to get one of these stories and not one of these.
I'm going to give a little, a little nug here.
One of the first things that I'm going to give you a little insider secret that I do when I go into a brick and mortar chain, which is probably my favorite thing to invest in is I look at their whole product suite.
57:41
So that means the products and services that they sell out of the facility.
And I'm going to look at two things.
I'm going to look at absolute gross profit and I'm going to look at gross margin.
So what's the percentage, right?
Those are the same thing.
Ones a percentage, ones an absolute amount.
And in general, I look at what percentage of our sales are coming from each of each of our products and then I think okay, this one has the highest gross profit and the second highest gross margin, but we sell it the fifth most often.
58:13
How can I recombine these things so that it becomes the first thing that we sell most commonly in the highest volume?
And sometimes just making these types of tweaks can make massive differences in the amount of profitability and cash flow the company generates.
58:28
And so this is just one golden BB that we do in the process.
If you don't know what your gross profit is and your gross margin is on every product you sell and what percentage of your sales come from each, do that and then reorganize your sales process to emphasize the ones that give you the most gross profit and gross margin.
58:45
And maybe consider down regulating some of the ones that don't.
Weird green tile, high cash flow, profitable story of growth.
Next tile, audit ready financials.
I'm going to make this one a little bit shorter because I know this is where people's eyes glaze over.
59:02
But if you think about audit ready financials from a risk perspective, if I'm a buyer and you say this is what your profit is and I have no way of proving that that's your profit, you can just make up a number.
If you have an audit ready financial, it means that a third party will come in and go through all your numbers.
They will calculate their own measure of profit and it matches yours.
59:21
If that's the case then you have audit ready financials.
A lot of times founders think that their profit is a lot higher than it really is.
Their banker or their accountant often times works for them.
And as crazy as it sounds, if you make the profit look better for the founder, they are happier with you.
Having a third party or making books that are third party ready for audit and getting something called a quality of earnings allows you to say to an investor these have been validated.
59:43
This is like a blue check mark in terms of this is really what I say it is.
So let's talk about this in levels Level 1, have financials in general.
All right, this sounds silly.
And in the beginning, oftentimes you're just gonna outsource it.
You're gonna have a third party who's an accountant or a bookkeeper in the beginning before you have an accountant who's just gonna handle your books, #2 is you're gonna actually upgrade to an accountant who's going to be doing this.
1:00:07
And oftentimes this comes when you go from cash based accounting.
To Gap, which it just stands for Generally accepted accounting Principles, that's all it is, right.
Cash is just money in, money out like.
So if I sell a three month contract for 30 grand and I collect 30 grand today, cash based accounting shows that we had $30,000 in revenue today.
1:00:27
Gap says that we have $10,000 in revenue today as it's recognized over three months and then 10,000 next month, 10,000 the month after, right.
And so Gap smoothes out the company's financials, but Gap accrues for the cost and the revenue throughout the year.
1:00:44
So that you can see over year over year how much money is increasing, right.
It makes it easier to analyze the business.
Level 3 of this is that you have audit ready financials and this could be in house or out of house that you that you get this set up.
I've switched my perspective on this.
I used to be all about in house accounting and in house financials that you do need somebody who's in charge of that function, but it just depends a lot on the business.
1:01:07
If you have a service business that doesn't require a lot of capital expense, meaning you have to invest money and forecast cash flow thing like that, you don't need as advanced of a person for the business.
If you have something that's like manufacturing, you need a very good financial arm because they have to manage cash flow out to collect goods, invoices that are coming from customers as things are getting delivered, payroll in between and you're managing a lot of moving parts while also putting out orders for six months from now for stuff that you know you're going to need in forecast.
1:01:35
So like it depends on the needs of the business.
But I will say this, one of our portfolio companies scaled for three years.
They went from a couple $1,000,000 a year to a couple $1,000,000 a month.
And we got to this plateau point and I was talking to the CEO and he's like, I just don't know where the profits going.
1:01:53
Like I just, I don't know if I have enough cash to open more locations or not.
And I just like how many should I be opening.
He's like, I'm just really struggling right now.
And I was like, okay, I want you to pause.
I want you to feel this feeling right now.
I was like, it's because you don't, you don't recognize this pattern and I want you to recognize for the rest of your life, which is the feeling you have right now is a lack of finance.
1:02:11
Like you don't have the finance function built out and you don't have the support of finance leaders because if you did then you would know what percentage of cash flow you could put towards it and how many locations you could have given the growth rate that you want.
But since you don't know that lack of knowledge, that feeling of uncertainty is because you don't have that thing.
1:02:27
It would be the same as like I don't know where my next customers coming from.
It's like you have a lack of the marketing function and I bring this up because you may feel this right now and if you feel that way it might because you're missing this.
I know this one is the most boring, but it's important and you will literally not sell your business for anything that's material if you do not have this audit ready.
1:02:45
Financials tile number ten 5 million plus in EBITDA, all right.
So the reason that this particular number is important is that most institutional investors do not want to buy companies that are smaller than this.
And that's usually because to get to 5 million plus in EBITDA and EBITDA is just a fancy word for profit for sake of today, because usually to get 5 million plus in EBITDA, you do have a professional management team.
1:03:09
It's not common that you'll be able to do that.
Not common.
Not saying it's impossible.
It's just not common to have a company that is doing that kind of profit and doesn't have a true management team that can run without the owner, All right.
And so this is more of a volume or size requirement.
Like you might have all of the other ones and be at 1,000,000 and you're just not going to get a great multiple because it's just not big enough.
1:03:30
Like, it's interesting because in business it's the reverse of like most other things.
So if you buy one vacuum cleaner, it costs X, but if you buy 1000 vacuum cleaners, you get a discount.
In businesses, it's the reverse, which is if you make $1,000,000 in profit per year versus $100 million in profit, you get a premium because you've already done the work of consolidating all that profit, which makes it available to bigger investors who have bigger checks to allocate, right?
1:03:55
When you have a billion dollars, you're never going to buy $1,000,000 business.
It like the time it takes for to even analyze the business is not worth the time.
And I'll tell you a fun secret, it takes about as much effort to help grow a $1 million business as it does to help grow a $20 million business.
Same effort, arguably less because you have more of an infrastructure, which is why people buy bigger stuff.
1:04:13
Now just to give you some stats around this, the S&P 500, this is the P, the price to earnings ratio.
So the multiple, all right, has has gone from 12X to 18X historically.
Now you can see this big jump now and right now I think it's somewhere on 23 like today.
1:04:29
So this is just for until 2020 and then today it's it's 23, all right.
And so that means that if you, if you made $100 million in EBITDA, then you'd have a $2.3 billion valuation as a company.
All right.
And the reason I think this is so important is that a lot of small business owners overestimate the value of their business.
1:04:48
Like to them because they're friends amongst their friends, they are the richest people.
They own a business that makes money.
So they're like, this is a big thing.
But in the world of business, when you're compared to Google, very tiny, right?
Like that's, that's what they make in the first, like, minute of the day, right, Is your entire year's revenue.
1:05:06
And so again, it's context.
And I share this stuff because I made these mistakes too.
And I mistook the fact that I put years of time and effort into a business for it being valuable, which it wasn't my first ones.
All right.
So you might be thinking, well, how long does it take to improve this stuff?
1:05:25
Like if I'm at a million or I'm at 2 million?
Like, how long does it take to improve?
Well, if you have the right tools and systems and the right plan, the right who, the what and the how, you can get the right outcome pretty quickly.
So I actually actually had my team print out our stats for this.
1:05:42
So our portfolio company on average within the first 12 months, we increase revenue by 1.8 X on average.
So if you're making 10 million, by the end of 12 months, you're making 18,000,000, not bad.
Profit increases by 3.01 X on average.
1:06:00
So you're making $2,000,000 in profit at the beginning 12 months later you're at 6.0 three.
There we go, $1,000,000 a year in profit.
Now think about this and I'm going to show you a little something that I haven't talked about publicly.
The reason that I look for companies that are at at least a million, usually two at minimum, is that most of the companies that I like taking on are in that two to five, two to six range.
1:06:27
The reason for that is because I can come in and do the things that I know I can execute our show list checklists, our closing checklists, our marketing checklists, our content checklists like this right into a business we already know works and then go from 4 million to 10 or 11 in profit.
1:06:45
And from an enterprise value perspective that 4 million.
Now it depends on all the other factors we talked about because remember you can have a $4 million profit business that's worth 0, right?
Or if $1,000,000 profit business that's worth 40 million.
It really depends, right.
But realistically most of those businesses like if you look at biz by sell, the average small business trades at two times earnings.
1:07:06
So you see all these headlines of like 44 and 310.
They make headlines because they are the exception.
They are not common, like the amount of billion dollar companies that exist out there is like 1000, like there's not a lot of them, right.
And so the idea here is understanding reality, which is that if you have a local dry cleaning store and you make $500,000 a year, you probably would be worth in total $1,000,000.
1:07:33
That's that's just the data and that means that's the average when half of them are below that and half of them are above that but half of them are below that.
So you might be trading at one times and that's not that uncommon, which is why getting size is so important when you're talking about valuations for a business.
I like this size because I can quickly go from something that might be worth $5,000,000 or not even have value to quickly plug these holes that I'm talking about and then unlock fifty $100 million of value.
1:08:02
And so I talk about like I hit my net worth as $100 million by age 32.
I don't count any of our portfolio companies in that value.
That's just like money I've extracted from what we have.
All right.
Stuff that actually has been traded on the marketplace, not companies that have equity value in store that I could sell now might be like well is it like a one trick thing?
1:08:25
Not really, because it looks like within the 1st 24 months, so two years, the average revenue increase goes to 2.8 X on average and the average profit increase is 4.7 X on average.
So that $2,000,000 profit company becomes a $9.4 million EBITDA business.
1:08:41
Think about the value difference here, maybe it was worth 6 million when we came into it and two years later at 9, let's say it trades at 7, right?
So that would be worth 63 million.
And like this is how Uncle Alex gets rich, right?
1:08:59
But also how our partners, how the people that we, you know, the companies we invest in, the founders also unlock that kind of wealth too.
And so like that is fundamentally just real data on context of how value can be unlocked.
And I told you about the we Whiten thing.
1:09:14
I'm excited.
So I think I think we will beat those numbers with We Whiten.
But all that to say, if you know what to do, then it just comes down to doing it.
And a lot of people spend a lot of effort on things that are not remember this guy, a lot of people spend a lot of effort on things that are not the bottleneck.
1:09:32
Now this was an example of I think a month difference or two months difference.
Well, it's like boom, well that's a double great.
What are we going to do for the next 22 months, right.
Well, we're going to work on other parts of the business.
This is just the sales and show rate stuff.
And so that's how we think about things.
And we particularly, and we've become more and more disciplined with this, is that we only go after businesses that were like, oh, yeah, like we know exactly what we're going to do so that we can mitigate our risk.
1:10:00
Because if I know that I have like 6 plays that are going to immediately 10X the business, now one won't 10X, but I'm like that'll double.
That'll go up 50%, that'll double and then that'll go 50%.
Well, just guess what?
Just created it, right?
If those multipliers add up, If not, you get the point, all right.
1:10:18
And so big picture, zooming all the way back out.
If you have a company and you want to make it more valuable, you need to sell more customers, you need to make them worth more, and you need to make it more likely that it continues to happen without you.
1:10:35
Which is why when you're making your Mosey Lisa masterpiece with your business, getting a caps deltoid, aka getting big enough and having $5,000,000 plus in EBITDA makes you a significantly more valuable company.
1:10:50
And when you check each of those ten boxes, you make the business masterpiece that can create the generational wealth you ultimately had.
And it's not about selling more.
It's not about making them worth more.
It's about making sure that those never stop happening.
And it doesn't matter if your business looks like this or like this or like this, because what we look at is it's like paint by numbers.
1:11:11
And so if we see that this one and this one are missing, then we say great, we're going to go unlock $10 million in value by putting these right back in.
Then it might be that we need to add an acquisition channel and we need to do get get size big enough.
1:11:26
Or we might find out we need to increase the cash flow of this business and we might have to get automated metric tracking in place, whatever the holes in the painting are.
The nice thing is that the end result always looks the same.
And so you might have your holy version of this painting.
1:11:42
And as long as you know what this painting looks like, and this is the value that we end up bringing to acquisition.com is we know what the Mosey Mosey masterpiece God Mosey Lisa looks like.
This is ridiculous, all right?
We know what the Mosey Lisa looks like, and all we have to do is paint by colors to fill in the gaps.
1:11:58
And that's how we made the company a lot more bad.








0:00
Hey, guys, real quick.
So Leila and I are definitely working on our social media presence, if you guys haven't noticed, and we're just breaking down into LinkedIn, all right.
It's not as bad as I thought.
It's actually been pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and.
0:17
Do not go half in.
There are no half measures.
You can't half impregnate someone.
You can't half marry someone, right?
You can't dip your toe in the water.
It does not work that way.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:37
My hope is that you.
Use the lessons to bring your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
One of the lessons that I've learned, and I feel like I repeatedly learned and I learned in different situations, is the power of of going all in and cutting your ties, burning your boats.
0:56
And so right now obviously you know we're we've talked about hybrid and and the new model that's coming out.
And I I want everyone to know and I'm saying this half to my audience as well as half the people who don't know who we are that it's scary when you make changes, right.
1:12
And the time to make changes is not when your back is against the wall.
Right when the stock market is going well is the time that no one wants to sell.
Right.
That's when no one wants to sell and then it crashes.
And then that's when everyone wants to get out and they lose everything, right?
1:31
And so, like the cost of having foresight of having vision of seeing what's going to come is the courage to break something that isn't broken and sacrifice good for great, right?
That's the sacrifice.
It's sacrificing good for great.
1:46
It's sacrificing comfort for more, right?
And.
It's it's almost like a spiritual experience like you, you have to the old must die for the new to live.
Like you can't do this halfassed.
If you want to commit to something, you have to go all in.
And so like for us at gym lunch, like I told our entire team, I was like we are going all in on this.
2:05
And that's the job of the CEO.
That is your job is to look at your team even when they think you're crazy and say like this is where I believe we are going.
This is where I believe the market is going and For these reasons that support this decision, this is what makes sense and this is where we're going to go.
And there are short periods of discomfort that follow those types of decisions that ultimately grow you and will grow your business.
2:28
And when you endure through those, you will break through the other side.
Now, the amount of people who laughed at, people in 2007, right, right before the crash, who were like, I think things are going to happen.
I'm selling everything.
They're like, you're going to miss out.
This thing's a bull market.
We're blowing like this, right?
2:43
Those guys seemed like fools, except a year and a half later when everyone had lost everything right.
And so I'm telling you right now that the market for gyms is about to contract, right.
The market for large group trading specifically is about to contract or each happen, right.
3:01
You look at in the stock market, there's a whatever, I won't even get into that stuff, but like there's, there are leading indicators, right?
There are more gyms that are closing than are opening right now.
Why right?
Because in a competitive marketplace, once there are too many players in the marketplace, it begins to contract.
3:18
Price pressures increase and drive down pricing and commoditization increases, which means it's harder and harder and harder to compete offering an equivalent service, right?
And when profits go down or pricing gets driven down, profits almost disappear and that is why people start going under Okay.
3:35
So how do you combat against that?
It's not incremental changes.
It's not, it's not.
It's just like not 1.11.21.3, It's not incremental changes.
It's massive changes.
It's one to zero or zero to 1 new things, new models that are going to have to emerge from this, right.
3:50
And so I'm saying this because like we at gym lunch as of 6/28 are not going to be selling gym lunch anymore, right?
We are not even doing legacy anymore.
Everything is all in on hybrid.
Right.
Because I believe through and through that this is where everyone needs to go.
4:08
And I also believe that in 20-4 months people will look back and I'm going to have these videos saying that this is what's what the new models going to be, right?
And this is like the people who get in now are the ones who are going to be able to ride the ride that no one else is going to be able to do because they were afraid.
4:24
And then everyone else is going to try and commit a copy after we have yet all of the profit.
We've dominated all of the market share with this, right?
And so I beseech you right, I'm begging you for your own good.
Do not go half in.
There are no half measures.
4:40
You can't half impregnate someone.
You can't half marry someone, right?
You can't dip your toe in the water.
It does not work that way.
Like it requires burning your boats and making the full decision all in on what you believe is right.
And what is right a lot of times is not what's popular, and it's not what's easy.
4:58
It's easy to do nothing.
It's easy to stay the same.
It's easy to stay comfortable, right?
But The thing is, is so many people stay comfortable, stay where it's easy, stay in the the road that is trodden, right, that is has been walked on.
And those are the people who find themselves in the same boat as everyone else, right?
5:16
And so it's like, I want to achieve what no one else has achieved and you have to do the things that no one else has done right or no one else is willing to do.
And more times than not, it's fear.
It's pure fear and so.
What I will beseech you to do is that you have to walk through the logical outcomes of what happens, what happens next, right?
5:35
What are my fears, right?
And you have to paint out your worst case scenario real.
Quick wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything and so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs.
Make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
5:56
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may.
Change the world.
With someone else.
And Leila and I go through this exercise all the time whenever we make a big pivot, right?
6:15
Mind you, we just made this change, right, and it's we're in the middle of it and on 628 will be 100% done.
But like I am taking a 25% hit on my cash flow, significant right, businesses don't run on 100% margins, right?
So right now if you think about your business, if you took 25% of your gross revenue and kept your costs the same, what happened, you probably would make less, you might even lose money.
6:38
Why would I make such a drastic decision?
Because I'm all in.
Right.
Because I believe that the truth will always win and that the best model will always win, period.
Just given time, right.
And so there's like, my word for everybody today is like, no half measures.
If you're making a change, go all in.
6:55
Don't let it be incremental.
Don't dip your toe in, don't say I'm not really sure because when that happens, you will not succeed and you guarantee it.
And then you start to tell yourself the story of like, well, you know, maybe it just wasn't for us or something like that, right?
You tell yourself that story, but it's because you did not go all in.
7:12
You went traffic and that is why you did not succeed.
So you have to be willing to bring your boats.
You have to be willing to make sacrifice.
You have to be willing to have hard conversations with your staff, with your clients, with yourself, with your spouse.
Because that isn't what's required.
Not what's desired, but what is required to get to where you want to go.
7:28
All right.
Sorry little feeling it today.
So anyways, I hope you guys are having a great start to your week.
Maybe look at some of the things that you've been putting off that you know are the right decisions and and not doing them because I can tell you like.
They only, they don't go away.
7:44
They don't go away.
They come back and they bite you in the ass with interest, right?
The more time you let something to do, let something not change that you should have changed, stay that way, the bigger the bike gets.
And that happens in stock markets, that happens in real estate, happens in business, right?
8:00
And so right now, I'm telling you, this is where it's going.
Like the market will change.
Right now, Lifetime Fitness is goals. 24 Hour Fitness, All of them have group training classes with highly skilled trainers because they're pulling from the same talent pool as we are.
But my community is so great.
Everyone says whenever you have humans in a room, you have a good community, right?
8:18
As long as you're not a Dick, right?
And The thing is that you're not even there.
Your trainers are there, right?
So you're not even involved in it, right?
And that means that you have the exact same environment that they do, except they're offering parking, amenities, pools, everything, right?
Better equipment.
8:34
And they're doing it at half.
To 1/4 of the price that we are because they have the square footage and they can do that, right?
And they have $10 million facilities.
So how do you compete with that?
You do not.
You play a different game.
And that is why I'm so, so passionate about this because I'm telling you this is what's going to happen.
8:52
So anyways, guys, I hope, I hope maybe one person hears this and decides to not not dip their toe in not think.
I'm not sure.
You know what I mean?
Sounds like a big change.
It is.
It's huge.
It's a massive change.
It's enormous.
It's entirely new.
Way new core offer, a new way of doing business, right.
9:09
It's a new way to do business for me.
Entirely new.
I don't need to do this.
You know what I mean?
Like, I don't need to do this.
But if I stay awake at night and I think to myself, what do we stand for, what I want my life to be about, then you're left with no other option.
9:28
And then you take yourself down the logic path and you're like, well, then I guess the only thing I have to do is, is we have to change, right?
We got to grow or die.
We say that they're for tenant, then we got to walk in, right?
And growing or dying is painful, right?
Dying is painful too.
And so is growth.
Both are painful.
It's just which kind of pain do you want, right?
9:45
So anyways, have an amazing day, guys.
I hope.
I don't know this inspires somebody who's delaying a decision that you need to make.
Maybe you need to let a trainer go confront it.
No half measures don't.
Probably wean it off.
Confront right?
Maybe you'll climb.
Sucks confronts.
No half measures.
10:00
You have to make a change.
You got to cut classes, right?
Do it.
Make the change, all right.
No one's gonna wait for you.








0:02
Moser Nation, This is a day in life for Layla and I.
We flew out to do 2 keynotes in Orlando, FL.
And I think you'll dig the presentation on branding.
I've never talked about it publicly.
The first time we took a private jet was out of necessity.
We were in Puerto Rico and it was right as Hurricane Maria was hitting.
0:20
We see the news about it and I check flights and the flights are all like multiple connections.
Do we drink a cup of coffee?
And then like, more news is like, this looks like it might be really serious.
And I check the flights again.
All gone.
All right, well, we're gonna be here.
You know, it's fine.
And then we go to the grocery store to like, pick up some water or whatever.
0:35
And two, people are getting a fistfight over water in the.
Island People are fucking sprinting around the store.
She's like, we have to get off this island.
I was like, dude, you don't want to be here.
When it did get back to our house.
And this old guy has this massive yacht.
He's our neighbor.
I was like, oh, what are you gonna do with that?
He's like, oh, it'll just get destroyed.
And I was like, what?
0:51
He's like, you should be fine, he said.
Just go to the third story, first two floors of Flood.
And Layla at this point is just like, we're getting off this fucking biology.
She was like chart or a plane.
And I was like Chart.
Mind you, this is like the beginning of our wealth.
And I was like, I Googled call plane.
I put it on speakerphone.
They need to get off where we go.
1:06
He was like, it'll be 70 grand.
And, like, we both looked each other.
And I was like, so we're excited.
She was like, yeah, we're decided.
We've both had come to completely separate conclusions from that number.
I was like, so we're staying And she's like, so we're going, right.
And then she looks, she's like, what is my life worth to you?
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?
1:21
35 grand to save my life?
I was like, well, it wasn't 35, it was 70.
One side for mine 35 to 4:00.
So I call like three other charters and I'm like, I got a guy who says he could do it for 50 and he's like, I'll do it for 40.
I called other guy.
It's like.
Five way.
This is the last day you can go off the island.
1:37
And so like literally when he's like, I gotta call some more to get a price.
I was like, Oh my God, we have 4 hours.
I got a guy who's like, I'll do it for 28 and I was like, cool.
He's like, but you have to leave in two hours.
Went straight to the airport and they were like, oh, actually it's coming fashion.
We thought like these will be the last planes out.
We got on the plane and it was the first time in my life where money actually did something like useless.
2:04
The local newspaper, the Gawana, spotting I was getting in my car at the gym the other day.
I get in the car and I have the window down and this guy's like, hey, and I was like, so I actually announced my presence.
Like whenever I walk through, I'm like, I'm here.
2:21
If she doesn't hear me, she just freaks out.
When you sat in the chair in the fucking dark like a psycho, and then you got mad at me when I cried, he scared me so bad I started crying.
I woke up and he wasn't in bed right then.
I go to the bathroom, I come back out.
I just assumed he's left.
2:37
I just hear Hey.
Dream and like, cuddle.
And then I just start crying.
And then he's like, what the fuck?
I was trying not to wake you.
I just like, I'm awake.
I made podcasts for four years.
2:57
What's going on?
Everybody.
I am coming to you with one that I'm excited about and like, real talk.
They were just as good as the ones I have now, years.
Not like.
I did it for 90 days, four years, two to three podcasts a week every week.
And then on the 5th year it hit the real real is.
3:15
It was just packaged as gym specific.
I'd say like my biggest learning of even the last year to two years of my career has been packaging everything I was taught early.
My career is niche down and so I did that and I maximized A niche.
But like at some point you maximize A niche and you have to go further.
3:33
I always am like slow to make those big moves because I want to make sure I'm not doing it out of being a DD.
That was a super tough call.
September 19, September 20, rebranded it as The Game.
I just remember there was one day I was like, I don't feel like talking about gym stuff anymore.
I can talk about business, but like a lot of it for me has always been.
3:49
I'm so afraid to talk about something that that, like, I want to make sure I'm legit.
So I'm going to talk about it.
When I had the gyms, hey guys, I'm Alex and I'm the owner of United Fitness.
I had six, I did 6 and then I did 30 plus turnarounds before I ever made a single piece of content like how you could run a gym better.
So I was like, OK, well, I've been to 30 plus markets.
4:05
I had six of my own.
I was like, I feel confident saying like these things work better than these ones.
I wanted to over credentialize myself for whatever content I was going to make so that I felt like I could take whatever heat someone was going to throw up me because I'd be like, well, here's why I think that, like, here's my evidence.
And I think that approach has been good.
4:22
It just takes longer.
I think the jerseys are dope.
Can I try that on?
I could rock a little, a little double, double.
If you look at McConaughey, when he went from ROM com, ROM com ROM com, he basically disappeared from the scene and then came back and like did Dallas Buyers Club for Wall Street and these other movies where he took like serious roles on, etcetera.
4:39
I was making all gym stuff.
I wanted to push myself away from all gym stuff.
Kale became more public facing.
I kind of slumped to the background.
Only thing I produced at that point was the podcast, which I'd rebranded as The Game.
But I still wasn't doing anything else that was public.
And I was like a year or two and then I started making content publicly.
4:55
So I feel like sometimes you have to, like, give a little bit of distance, kind of like reset, and then you go out with like whatever the new kind of direction you want to go is to me exactly what I did at the Q&A for the VIP day.
I'm going to get up there.
I'm going to write all of the topics I want to talk about, and I'm just going to, like, hit them in whatever order.
5:12
Feels good.
I feel good about it.
Or it'll blow.
I envision a day where we have like the shareholder meetings where all the companies come out and we have that big convention of all the portfolio companies.
That would be cool.
5:28
The whole theme of the presentation's actually own strategy, which is like, I'll be like, what the fuck does that mean?
And then I'll break it down.
Or like, it just means doing the thing.
You get the must make for the buck.
You guys are killing the vibe.
I heard the vibes.
Like, yeah, just like we gotta bring the energy.
I'm gonna briefly hit on brand.
5:45
It's like if you build a personal brand, then you'll make more money from that than your gym.
But then if it's what are we solving for?
You know what I mean?
It's the principle.
It's not gonna.
Yeah, rather than do slides, which is normally what I do, I actually want to draw the stuff, live with you.
6:06
And I think it's more engaging that way.
If you've ever seen, like a math problem on a board and it's just like all done versus like someone walking through the math, it's different.
That's at least the theory.
And if it sucks, you can tell me at the end.
Brand isn't actually a thing.
It's an association we make between things that we know and things that people don't know, which is usually our company.
6:26
If you think about a brand like a bouquet of flowers, a bouquet of flowers isn't actually a thing.
It's many things put together.
And then we put it in our heads as an idea, as one.
But it doesn't.
It's not actually anything, because if you spill it on the floor, it's not a bouquet anymore.
Think of a brand as a bouquet of flowers, but it's your bouquet of flowers.
6:43
And what you're putting inside of that bouquet are the individual, intangible ideas that you want to associate together with the thing that people don't know about, which is usually our company.
And so if I were to say some things about my brand, you'd probably know that I have the best calves ever, right?
6:59
So that would be something that's like associated with my brand dessert.
That's something that's associated with my brand.
Now those are like fun little doodads.
But hopefully some of the things that you really associate with my brand are giving first writing value, being patient, doing the boring work.
7:16
And the reason brand and reputation is so hard to maintain is because so many people want to rub their shit on yours.
So let's say here's my bouquet, then I've got this sad flower.
So this is a sad face flower.
If I handed my wife this bouquet, all of the roses are perfect.
7:32
And there's this one that's just wilted and dead.
The bouquet, the brand, the perception of it massively shifts, even with one fucked up flower.
And so that's why creating a brand is much more about cultivating deliberately the associations you want to make with the thing you have that people don't know, with the things that your ideal audience likes that you want them to like too.
8:11
Cool.
This used to be the first song in my playlist for working out get my Cavs going.
I can choreograph way more like Symphony of Feelings and visuals and charts and graphs when I do the presentation.
I mean, from a prep time though way less.
My presentations are typically 5 slides per minute because I actually think about it as like a movie.
8:29
I'm going to do a voiceover on a film.
There's this amazing video.
I think it's called Death by PowerPoint.
So it's basically just like one idea, one image, that's it, next idea, next image.
That's it.
You do that.
You're like, that's only like 30 to 40 seconds.
You're like, that's why it's so many slides.
I mean, you saw 840 slides for the training thing we're going to do.
8:46
That's how you build great training.
I was enjoying meet and greets with Mosa Nation because I get to hear like the real problems that you guys are going through.
But I get to go a little bit deeper than I normally can on like comments or like a short piece, which makes them one of my favorite ways to interact.
Just in general, what would be your number one advice on how to get the attractive talent?
9:02
Because some people say you want to make the talent yourself.
Some people say you want to try to post them other places.
I think you do both.
I think it's an and you want to have all the training you can because that gets you cheaper talent that you then level up.
But it costs us time.
The more money you get, the more you buy talent rather than building it.
9:18
And so there's times you spend all this time training somebody, then you realize that they're if you were to internalize, it's like I'm not going to picking the right people.
I'm not going to training them.
Like if those are controllable rather than the other person, if you internalize it.
So for a gym, for example, running ads on Indeed and then doing like that or hiring like within your clients, I think both.
9:35
There's all this way you can reach out.
You can do content, you can run ads.
Like just like you get customers, you get employees.
Same exactly you talking about your store with your dad.
And yeah, you gave me that that confidence to make that move.
Wow, that makes the world Congrats.
I know you talked about you with a consulting job with the government and it seemingly fancy, but you just weren't happy.
9:55
But we'll give you the courage to be okay disappointing your dad.
I just didn't feel like being alive anymore.
For me, that was my that was my thing.
It doesn't have to be that for you, but for me it was like, well, I don't feel like being alive until I like the actual phrase I kept repeating myself was like, I have to die to him in order to live.
For me.
I needed a new life.
10:11
And if that many wasn't going to accept the new life, which he didn't in the beginning, I just had to be cool with that.
And I think that's a lot of, that's like the the journey for a lot of guys.
Like becoming a man is like when you start valuing your own opinion of you more than your father, your cousin or whatever's.
It's like you basically elevate your own opinion itself and other people's.
10:28
And then you become more independent.
Like that's how you become independent.
It was my hardest thing.
I think I got a job.
We did.
We got one.
Pick one.
All right.
All right, guys, I got to have.
No, you're good.
You're good.
You're good.
I got to go.
All right, I actually really like these.
10:46
Mine's got like fighting bodybuilding.
It's fighting in bodybuilding.
Comedy's harder to click on because the other two are so much more visual.
If there's just a dude with a mic, I'm like, I don't know if this is going to be funny, but I do know this guy's jacked.
It would be interesting if if images make a comeback.
Because I will say this, when I look at someone's their profile, I actually go only for the images because I don't feel like watching videos.
11:07
Just feels more chill.
So my next book is coming out and I'm stoked.
So here's a sneak peek.
It'll be interesting because I think part of what I want to talk about maybe even at the just I don't know if I want to do it.
The maybe it'll be like they're robably because it's going to be like raw.
11:22
Maybe post.
I'll be like how to get the most out of this book When I look at my audience 76% of people want to start a business.
So like you should read it from the beginning to the end because you won't have context on any of this.
If you have a business lead.
Magnets.
Referrals, because everyone has customers.
The core four way that you advertise and then the way to make that way better which is the core 4 on steroids.
11:41
And then from there you know read the other ones.
Hey sweetie.
Hey Boo Boo.
Hey, supermodel.
Layla's doing her thing.
That's my wife.
I see that.
11:56
Yeah, you're starting to connect the whole thing.
She's the brains in the operation, right?
Yeah, she is on the pretty face you guys got.
There you go.
What I want to do today is talk about how to get other people to do stuff like making money.
12:14
These are the principles, like I said, that we have used to build gym, launch Prestige Labs and now acquisition.com.
Great.
Your book helped me make like 300 grand this year, so I really appreciate that.
Again, really good.
Be really good.
12:29
Oh, that's super weird. acquisition.com croc back.
Thanks.
No, it's great.
No, that's super sweet.
Thank you so much.
Man, all the carnivore guys are like vegetables are actually bad for you.
Do you want to be a bird?
So it's just you and me on stage.
12:47
That's where we just do it like we always do, doing QA in front of a drawing board.
That is my happiest place.
I was incredibly impatient and it's really tough because a year is 5% of your life when you're 19 and it so it feels like a really long time.
13:09
And so the idea of waiting one year or two or three years, it's like 15% of your life.
You're like, holy shit, There's a reason that the sayings, like good things, take time.
Like Rome wasn't built in a day.
Those sayings exist because good shit does take time to build.
And when you have that massive list of should do's, it does take two years or three years to build something exceptional.
13:26
And that's the reason most people can't do it.
It's recognizing that when you're 19, you absolutely are in a season of learning, not a season of earning.
Which means you should be willing to work for far below what you believe you are worth in order to learn to increase what that worth is.
And I had this exact conversation with my neighbor who was 16 at the time, and I just said I can guarantee that you will be a millionaire when you're 30 if you'll give me 10 years.
13:49
I was like, will you sign that contract?
He said yeah, I was like okay then you're going to eat shit for 10 and ten's a long time because he's three years in and he's like 7 more.
Not being in a rush is the single thing that I would tell my 19 year old self and being willing to do anything to learn new skills.
14:08
How do I know who to hire, What to hire?
You're always making a trade with your time to do stuff to get money back, at least from a business perspective.
And so if you're paying someone with money to get your time back, they need to have an alternative vehicle that's going to get a higher return than what you're paying them, right?
14:26
That's the fundamentals of when you're trading your time for money, the order that you trade or replace the time is.
If you look at your our week of activities and Leila has a great activity around this which is doing a time study, make an excel sheet.
You don't need fancy software to do this and you have all the hours of the day put into 15 minute increments.
14:43
And this may sound tedious.
It's also really effective and will make you more money than it costs you time because when you actually have to write what you're doing every 15 minutes, you realize that you are not going to waste 7 hours of your day not doing shit because you want to get credit for it in your own head.
14:58
You do your 15 minute increments, you write down the shit and at the end of the week you're like, OK, of these things, what is the single largest block of time that I can give away for the lowest amount of money?
Mean to love?
I know you strive for excellence in all facets of your life.
15:14
What are your pillows to love that you strive excellence for?
I'm gonna hit this one really quickly.
Of course, meaning of life.
So real quick answer for me.
My purpose of life is to learn, and I defined yesterday learning as same condition, new behavior.
15:31
And so I think that the majority of my life will continue to show me similar conditions.
And if I can become and behave in the way that I ideally want to do at the end of my life, that I've become the person that I want to become, and all of the stimuli between the day I'm born and the day I die exists to help shape that person.
Thanks.
15:49
Would you like to talk about the meaning of your life?
OKI don't know.
A lot of the people there were like, just the mosiation.
And we're not to Mars, not a single question was about Jim's.
I was.
I was surprised.
Last day here at Jim Con.
I've got one more talk and we're gonna go and ask them, the attendees, for more questions about their businesses.
16:08
I had this class in music teacher get everybody a project basically just like really heavily researched one song and that was the whole class was like one person would research the song, they'd play the song for three minutes or whatever it was, and then 27 minutes would be them giving like a full report.
And now that I say it out loud, he just figured out how to not teach anything.
16:25
Brilliant.
The guy who got the highest grade in the class did his thing on Hurt.
As soon as you play that song, I'm like, yeah, that's fucking great song.
Like, honestly, I think that was one of the best things ever happened in Nine Inch Nails, The fact that Johnny Cash covered someone else's song.
Have you seen a music video?
I'll play it for you.
It's sick.
16:51
So good, dude.
He died seven months after this video.
These are some sandals, water sandals, I think, or hiking sandals.
I wear these because I can wear these in the most environments, because I can wear these to the gym, which I actually really like.
I can walk in them.
I can wear these in water.
I can wear these on the beach.
They're closed toe, so I can wear the most restaurants and I don't have to wear socks.
17:09
What else do you need?
Do you mean times I go to the pool and come out and go to a restaurant after going to the gym and presenting fall on the same floor?
Dude, this is a fucking Darwin outfit.
Literally.
Yesterday we did the talk and then I went to the pool and then I walked and then went to a fancy restaurant, drying like 20 minutes.
Yeah.
And these are stretchy and they're last so best everyone else.
17:27
The shorts are inferior.
You even know about that.
Like, you're just not as adaptable.
We get wet, You're fucked.
We go to a nice restaurant.
You're fucked.
I go to the gym.
You're fucked.
All right, come on.
The third time I've been introduced, Alex, thank you.
17:46
We're going to do a cool deep dive together on a topic that I hold near and dear to my heart, which is closing.
The difference between health and manipulation is intention.
Either way, you're going to change someone's behavior or your intention is to change someone's behavior.
If the prospect knew everything that you knew, they should make the decision to buy.
18:03
If you're being really honest with yourself, if the prospect knew everything that you knew and then they would choose not to buy, then you are deceiving them, which is no bueno.
But this presentation will be the best presentation on sales you've ever heard, the worst presentation on sales you've ever heard, or somewhere in between.
That is a promise.
Charlie Munger, a big hero of mine.
He said We have a high more responsibility to be rational.
18:20
Sometimes you've got logical buyers, sometimes you got emotional buyers.
There are different types of people who buy in different styles, just like they're different selling styles, different buying styles.
People want to believe you.
They want to buy.
You just have to help their logical brains justify the decision.
Like most people are like, hey, I can make you a lot more money.
They want to believe.
You just have to help them justify.
18:36
Hey, I can help you get into your high school jeans.
I can make you look the way you did 20 years ago.
They want to believe you.
Make the decisions to help yourself implement like crazy.
Take ownership.
Realize that there are no silver bullets, but some things can move you closer to your goals.
And when those rare acceleration opportunities come in life, take them.
18:53
Because either win or you learn.
And both of those get you closer to wherever it is you want to go.
Thank you.
Overall awesome trip Bob, Jim Con.
It's great to see the gym owners and our community there.
Jim Lords, comment below if you want to see more vlog stuff like this.
19:09
Bye.

If I think about myself at the end of my life, I would hope to be somebody who has strong character.
But in order to achieve strong character, you have to go through hard things.
You can't have one without the other.
And so if I had to pick, I'd rather have the character and the scars to show it rather than none of the character and had a soft life.
Welcome to the game where we talk about to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:24
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
It's great.
Have you met and and of course you and I have you know, over I would say what 6810 months since you've been here, developed a friendship outside of, you know, the business stuff.
0:41
Our girls have gone and had dinners and stuff and you know, that's rare.
Layla does not do that.
Really.
No.
I think in, I'd say in the last year she hasn't done it.
That's the only dinner that she has had without me really 100%.
Oh wow.
0:56
We do everything together.
She and I have been together every night since we met, or rather since we've been married, except for one weekend.
Like we don't like we're a package deal.
What'd you do with yourself when she was out with my wife?
1:13
I just.
I just like, I was like, wow, look at all this time.
You know that I have to myself.
Like no one's saying anything.
This is wonderful.
I just.
I just worked more.
When's the first time you and I met?
14 years ago by chance?
1:28
And then we we we went our separate ways.
But I was a 19 year old at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and a buddy of mine bought tickets.
The Roy Jones fight and we by chance we were sitting in the two seats behind you and we were probably bothering you because we were 19 and fans and I remember my body kept asking you all these questions about lifting and bodybuilding and you were in kill mode that no, I mean you were you were 100% like I remember the I remember the whole thing and at the time like you weren't who like you weren't Flex Lewis as you are now.
2:08
You were like on the come up, you know what I mean?
And you were.
You were so in the mode of accomplishing, you were in the hunt and you said if you want to accomplish your goals, you have to cut everything else out.
2:25
You have to stop the partying, you have to stop the drinking and you need to go all in on on the one thing.
And we continued to bug you throughout the rest of the fight.
Alcohol.
More words of wisdom.
Alcohol was flowing.
2:41
Well, we, you know, we were 19, so that would have been illegal and underage, so we definitely wouldn't have done that.
Or drinking.
Yeah, that was just just normal debauchery from 19 year olds at a fight.
But so with the crazy part about this is that we met by happenstance 14 years ago.
2:59
You know, Flex was early in his career.
I was nonexistent in my career.
I was a freshman in college and we ended up 12 years later reconnecting here in Vegas because I would started going to your gym and and then you know after you know handful of times like do you remember these kids that were behind you at this fight and and lo and behold.
3:23
Yeah, I remember actually do remember this circumstance.
I kind of remember the contacts because it was kind of, you know, I was meeting.
People throw that.
I was super important to you, that's what.
You're trying to say, but I do remember, I do remember two guys sitting behind me and we kind of shed, you know, periodically opinions of the fight.
3:47
Yeah, I did that too.
And I and I do remember some other words of wisdom being spoken about what I said.
I don't know.
Probably the cliche shit this about then too.
No, but I mean you really did though like it.
I I remember the conversation because you were on the on the route to champion.
If not, had you, like you were right there and it was just crystal clear that nothing else mattered to you, that that was it.
4:10
And I remember it was enough that I was impacted by it at 19 to enough that I remember a conversation that happened randomly 14 years ago.
It was, it wasn't even the words you said, Obviously you're like don't drink, don't party, you know, stay out of trouble, work hard, etcetera.
4:26
Like that stuff was the cliche.
But I think the thing that wasn't the cliche was how you said it was that, like, I could hear the conviction, balls to bones, that that's what you were about.
Like you weren't saying it, you were living it.
And I think that was why.
That's why I carried the weight.
And I remember, I mean, million people probably told me to work hard and whatever, but like, I remember that conversation.
4:45
You have been better than yourself in a lot of projects.
I don't know if it's, is there anything that you want to talk about in terms of what you being that you know that you can speak about?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I would say like I have two, there's three big things I'd say going on right now.
One is that we're we're we're building out an office here in Vegas that'll be headquarters for our media team.
5:04
We'll have, you know we'll put probably a big four or 5000 square foot facility in there.
We'll do more content out of there.
And then I just will have all of my stuff which I like having.
So I've it's been in storage for like 3 years.
So I'm very excited to get my own gym back.
It's a big spot, so it's like 17,000 square feet.
So that should be good.
5:20
That's one project that's kind of moving forward.
The other one is the book.
So my second book or a second general business book, third book overall $100 million, one $100 million leads which is the sequel to $100 million offers is coming out.
We put about 3500 hours into the book over the last two years, which for me, the way that I I work is like the first six hours of my day is where I put push all my big projects forward.
5:46
And then the second, like the next half or 4 hours ish or five hours of my day is is meetings and fires and whatever.
And so I've been working that way for probably almost a decade of just like splitting my day that way.
And that's worked well for me.
So whatever happens in that first six hours is usually like my big focus.
6:03
And so for the last like 18 months, the majority of my time of that six hours of creative time has been dedicated to either, you know, scripting out kind of ideas about constant stuff that I want to do.
And more realistically, it's been just book.
And so the book has 18 drafts right now.
6:20
So we're on draft 18 of the book probably written like somewhere in the neighborhood of like 800 to 1000 pages that got distilled down into about 200.
And fortyish pages for the book have like 127 pages of doodles that are graphics.
6:36
That'll go in the book that get to still down to maybe, you know, 50 to 60 graphics.
Not just pages of graphics, but individual graphics that are throughout the book to explain kind of more complex topics for advertising to get more leads for a business.
So that's been like the a big project and that's going to finally come to an end in the next, you know, 12 weeks or so.
6:56
And then the third one is just doing deals because that's that's actually how we make money.
And so we have a number of larger deals in the pipeline right now, which there's just steps to it.
You know, there's the yellow eye stages where you're, you know, negotiating whatever the prices that you're buying in for.
7:12
And then you know, the diligence on our side to make sure that everything is hunky Dory knows there's no lawsuits, that kind of stuff and that we believe that we can actually add as much value as we think we can.
And then there's kind of executing the deal on boarding the companies and that kind of jazz.
So different deals at different stages in that pipeline and that's what I spend most of my time doing.
7:30
Yeah and you know you and I try to get a couple of workers in, but as you said that that time is you know a non compromise for you.
I try to bend, bend the rest and try to get you in the early.
But no, as you said that that that is that part of the day that first early rise and is all dedicated to.
7:49
To to your businesses and stuff and then the the late afternoon is when it opens up for you to yeah, I like to like fatigue my mind and then my body's fresh at the end of the day but my brain is spent and then I go workout and that's been like my favorite way to do it.
I've done first thing in the morning.
8:04
I've done late morning.
I've done split shift which is a good.
I like split shift a lot, which is like that lunchtime lift at like 11 to, you know, oneish and then you have your second-half the day, like that's a nice reset.
I think I'll be probably doing more of that when I have the office gym.
But if I don't have that set up, then I think I end up defaulting to like the 4:00 workout and then having dinner afterwards.
8:27
So it's kind of like marks the end of my day.
I do want to circle back on on that new and devil of the offices and the 17,000 square foot and you know, new building that you're working on but for the viewers who have seen your face all over Instagram and.
8:44
You know, they can recognize you as the serial entrepreneur.
Just can you tell if he wasn't take that he was back on how you got into the entrepreneurial sort of mindset and and what age that started and and what came from that.
Yeah, step by step.
9:00
So I was, I was actually a pretty good student.
A lot of times entrepreneurs are like, I failed, you know, school failed me.
Or like I was enriched in school.
I wouldn't say I was interested in school, but school was fine, you know?
I mean, I did the work.
I graduated early from college.
9:16
Magnum Kamlody from Vanderbilt, which is a school in Tennessee, did pretty well in standardized tests.
Got a good job after that as management consultant.
Had a pretty prestigious firm that just focused on strategy.
But we were in the public sector, so it was defense contracting.
So space cyber intelligence sounds very sexy.
9:33
It was not very interesting for me at the time.
Really, really got depressed during that period because I feel like there was nothing else for me to achieve.
I kind of done everything that I thought I was supposed to do at, you know, age 22 or whatever.
And so I looked into starting a business because that was what I ultimately wanted to do.
9:50
Applied to a bunch of business schools, they were like, you know, how will this help your short and long term goals?
After spending like 3 days thinking about it, I realized it wasn't going to and so I'd figured I would save the 200 grand in two years of not making money and just put it into a business.
I'd saved about 50 or 60 grand at the time when I was 22 and just living cheap, and I used that to start my first business.
10:13
So I was choosing between test prep, frozen yogurt and a gym, something fitness related.
And I couldn't afford the yogurt because it was like 250 grand and test prep I could afford, but I had like a falling out with the person who was supposed to partner with me on it.
10:28
So fitness was kind of what was left.
And I could afford to do it.
And I knew how.
You know, at that point I I was already competing powerlifting, not bodybuilding.
And I was just like super into fitness at that point.
I've been training for I think like 7 years.
Yep, seven or eight years at that point.
And so then I I started a gym.
10:45
So I drove out to California, started my first facility against the wishes of everybody who knew me and slept on the floor there.
Learned a lot the hard way and was able to open up a second location at month 15, then open up a new location every six months after that.
11:01
And then we had six locations.
I sold five of them.
I shut one of them down.
And then I started doing a turnaround business where we'd fly around 2 gyms and get them to full capacity in about 30 days.
That's right when I met Layla.
And so she was flying out with me right at that time.
I had this idea for this new business model.
And so we did that for about two years.
11:18
We did 30 something turnarounds and then from there we got it, we got it really down pat.
And so then we started licensing that to brick and mortar facilities and now we have, we licensed over 5000 facilities that model over the next five years.
11:34
And then we started a supplement company to sell through that distribution base of thousands of gyms called Prestige Labs, the other companies called Gym Lunch.
And then after that in 2019 we started Allen, which is our software company which also sold through that distribution base.
11:51
And in 2021 we sold all three of those companies, two of them to a private equity firm called American Pacific Group for two of those were for 46.2 million.
And then the other one we sold to a Tree Cheek partner which we were under NDA for the price.
But we did 12 million in the trailing, you know 12 months leading into the sale and that was an all stock deal.
12:12
So we basically contributed assets to an entity they did too.
And then the hope is that five years from now that next sale will be you know significantly larger.
And so from there we started our family office acquisition.com and we started investing our own money because at that point we probably taken about 40 things, 40 million in dividends out prior to our exit.
12:33
And so we had a decent amount of cash on hand and I had never really done any investing and I felt like that's kind of the phase that I wanted to get into.
But rather than kind of putting it all in the stock market, which I feel like I'd be competing against people that have an advantage over me, I was like well, why don't I just invest in businesses that I know and understand and can add value to.
12:50
And so that's been pretty much the, the thesis Bond acquisition.com was finding businesses that we, you know, that are simple, that we can understand that we can scale.
And so now we have 16 portfolio companies and right now in aggregate I think they do about 200 million a year, depends every month kind of you know it's a little bit volatile, but that's kind of the current run rate of those portfolio companies and usually we have between 20 and 51% you know of the of the businesses that that were invested in and that's our jam.
13:17
Are they all in the same genre?
And no.
OK.
So everything from you know, photography studios for kids all the way to mortgage sales, you know, just different businesses.
It's really just like do we have a simple business model that has one to do products that we understand.
13:33
A lot of times, you know, like red flags for us when we're looking at businesses is do we see an entrepreneur that's super scattered who can't focus on anything.
You can often see that because a lot of times the business is a reflection of the entrepreneur.
And so if everything's scattered, everything's erratic, there's five different things going on and they're doing 10 million a year.
13:49
It's like, well, why don't you just pick one and get it to 100, You know, and that's kind of the approach that we that we tend to have is like maybe there's a front end product and a back end product, awesome.
And most people end up creating new products because they just don't know how to sell more of the first one and then end up creating all these appendages attached to the business that ultimately make it harder to run.
14:09
Obviously, you know there's there's a little Privy to a little Privy to us.
You know the some more more so this the the, the earlier part of the stories.
Alex is a family, is on shop on Spotify right now.
He's assessing what protein body is going to consume.
14:26
We'll see which one.
I'm going to go for a big A.
Big decision.
There's a big decision, but I'm a little Privy to.
You know, the some inside stories too.
I do want to.
And for the viewers, you know, watching this, a lot of people in the early stages of either starting up a business or maybe they're in the fitness industry and they're looking at themselves as a brand, as a business.
14:47
You know, I know that you mentioned earlier, before you went through this incredible, you know, history of what you started and where you are now, but.
You really had a a rags to riches story.
You know, you you kind of skimmed the earlier part of of life of where you open up a gym, but you really had, you know, a lot of failures that you've learned from.
15:11
And when the earlier parts of you know your story is that you you did get a gym, it failed and can you tell us about that?
Because I think that's a a big and a critical part of of your storyline of of learning from your failures to get to where you are now.
Yeah, failed a lot.
15:31
So I'd say the the biggest failures, you know, right off the bat I started that, you know the 1st gym.
So all the gyms that I had were more or less successful.
I had one gym that I was a 90% owner of.
I'd given 10% to an advisor to kind of like help me with it.
15:50
But then I met two other guys who said they could help me more.
So then they bought in for very little and I use what little money they gave me to buy the other guy out.
But then they ended up buying 2/3 of the facility.
So I was a 1/3 owner of my original gym and I pretty much didn't take any money out of the gyms while we were growing them because I would just take whatever cash to open up the new facilities.
16:09
Ended up having a falling out with one of the two partners.
So me and the other guy bought the other guy out, kept doing, you know, and using you know using cash flow to make payments to him and then also open new facilities until we got to about 6 locations at this point.
And I was like, I don't know if this is what I like.
16:25
It just it was it was very difficult.
We're probably doing, I don't know, 2,000,000 bucks in top line, maybe three.
I honestly don't remember.
And that was when I ended up kind of reaching this weird point where I didn't know what to do.
I wasn't making a ton of money, but I was work.
16:42
It was just a weird spot for me.
And so I went to a speech or like a seminar thing, like a, you know, one of those events.
And there was a guy who was talking about online marketing.
And I was like, man, I need to learn some of this stuff.
So I didn't do anything.
I waited a year.
16:57
And then during this, like, weird moment, I was like, you know what?
Maybe I'll go join one of his like events or whatever.
So I joined this guy's event.
And when I was there, I was like, explaining my whole model and how it opened up each facility at full capacity.
And he was like, you should show other people how you do this.
And so that was kind of the big shifting point for me going from Okay.
17:15
I'm going to go from six locations to 10 locations to maybe I'll start this turnaround thing.
So I started the turnaround thing and it started working.
And so then I sold all the gyms.
It didn't sell for a lot.
I sold them, you know, probably an aggregate for like 250 grand, which for anybody who's listening, that's not a lot of money for six locations.
17:33
It was almost just like the hard costs of the assets.
But I was really committed to this new direction and so I put all the cash that I got from that sale into this new partnership that I decided to do with a guy who had been indicted for fraud, which I knew about.
And I filled up a gym and we were supposed to partner on these new gyms together and he would come and operate them after I filled them up.
17:57
So it's going to be like a launch and go model.
I'd open up one or two facilities every month and he'd come and fill it up.
So I crushed this, launch it at 380 something new members in the 1st 21 days news were at 600 bucks a pop for six weeks.
It was a training facility, not a like a membership facility.
And and then I looked at the bank out one day and all the money I put in, plus all the cash that we generated was taken out.
18:18
And he was like, well, I know that you're skimming profits, so I'm just taking my half.
And I was like, what?
You know, And he hadn't paid for anything.
And I was the one who was guaranteeing the lease, of course, because he had financial difficulties.
Yeah, of course.
You know, you know, I was like, oh, yeah, don't worry.
18:34
It's just a big misunderstanding.
And so anyway, so there I am now and I have no cash in the bank account.
I lost everything that I just spent five years building with the gyms and I have, I think at this point just in my personal savings, I had like 25.
It's not a lot of money and I couldn't sell more people because I didn't want to keep doing the gym thing.
18:53
I wanted to do this other thing.
And so I basically just had to stomach the hard cost of the gym with no new revenue coming in, which was horrible.
So I just basically had to pay payroll and rent everything.
And if you have no inflow it, you know it goes down very fast.
And so within six weeks I was able to close that last facility.
19:11
So that was where the, you know sold five had the the one that I ended up closing down was that one.
And so now here I am.
I have nothing left.
And Layla at the time was like, hey, we should still do that, you know, launch thing where we just, like fill other people's facilities up and we don't own it and we just take the cash that we generate.
19:28
And so we started doing that again.
And so we did the next launch.
We hired a sales guy to go do it.
He did 100 grand in a month, which is basically about what we'd average.
So I was like, okay, this is my fresh start.
I'm going to get this money.
And then for some reason, the money didn't come in.
And so I'm checking the bank out every day.
19:43
And I was like, where's this money?
Like, I we process a payment.
I see it's successful.
And it didn't come in.
And so I called the processor up and they're like, oh, it's a standard annual review.
And I was like, I've been with you guys like 6 years.
You've never had an annual review and called two days later, Same thing.
Called two days later.
And then finally it's Christmas Eve and I'm back at Layla's parents house.
19:59
I've never met them before.
This is the first time they're meeting me, the winner who now had lost everything and had no money, and the only shot I had at making money, the money was not coming in.
And so on Christmas Eve I called them up and I was like, I'm not getting off the phone until you just give me money.
20:15
That is mine.
And they said no.
Yeah, right.
And so I had a sales guy that I owed about $22,000 in commissions and I had $23,000 left after all of this, you know, shittiness.
20:32
And so I wired him 22 and I had $1000 left.
And it was Christmas Eve.
And so that was December of 2016.
So it's, you know, whatever it is now 2023.
So I was at $1000 left in total at that.
That point.
I screenshotted it because I was like, I'll remember this.
20:48
You still have.
That screenshot I do, I do.
And two days later Leila had convinced all of her friends to quit their jobs to join this our thing.
So six of her friends had quit their jobs, which was great.
I felt super responsible for that.
And so I told her, you know, I have this credit card from all my gyms that they haven't cancelled yet.
21:09
I've got $100,000 limit and this could go horribly wrong And so I think I'm a sinking ship and you should probably get out.
And so she didn't listen to me and she said I would sleep with you under bridge if it came to that.
And that was kind of my that was probably my moment for knowing that Layla was going to be the girl I was going to be with for for a long time.
21:31
And so I put $3300 a day on a credit card with only $1000 in my bank account to launch six locations that next month, which made no sense.
And if I were advising me, I would say that's retarded.
But I just, like, was wildly insecure and felt like I lost all the money that I was making and I, like, wanted to have a comeback.
21:48
And I just went for it.
And so mind you, I didn't have a way to process money.
So I'm doing $3300 a day with zero ability to generate cash.
And so we're stacking 60 contracts every day that we're selling across these locations.
And I had no way to process the money.
And so I could, I thought I could get a processor easily.
22:06
That was not the case, especially if you've been shut down by our processor because it's kind of like kind of like a black mark.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And just for context, the reason I got shut down was because I was doing sales through a brick and mortar location, not in that state.
So I was basically running all these launch sales through my brick and mortar location in California.
22:23
But I was in like Canada and you know, wherever.
And they were like this is a regular, seems weird.
We're going to shut it down.
And so anyhow, by the way, they never gave me that money.
So that 100 grand, they just kept it.
They never gave it back six months later.
Nope.
They kept it.
22:39
So I ended up getting a new account that would get.
They gave me a $50,000 limit to process money and thankfully it was per month, per calendar month.
So I got it live on January 29th.
Mind you, this whole time we're processing.
22:54
I'm spending 3300 a day.
We're processing.
We're getting all these contracts stacked up.
And I'd and people are calling us like, hey, like, why aren't you running my card?
We're like, Oh yeah, we're going to get to it.
You know, like, yeah, yeah, it's great.
Good faith.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
And so the 29th of January comes and I run 50 grand in a day and I still have another 100 grand in contracts.
23:12
Holy.
Shit man.
And so then on February 1st, 2 days later, I run another 50 through the same thing.
So I have 100 and I'm spending 3300 a day so I can cover my credit card bill.
And now I'm back at 0 again.
So I'm still still poor, but I got two more processes online and then I was able to bump those.
23:30
And so the next month I was able to do like 180 I think and I think we had like 30 grand in profit and I was like okay, we might be out of this.
And so right as I thought we were out of the woods, March came around, we started the next you know a few launches or six or seven or eight or whatever it was And then two of the locations which for us the sales guys weren't as good as we were, like I would average about 100 grand, I think they averaged like 50 and cash collected per location somewhere in there.
23:57
And two of the gyms that we launched out of six in January stood up on chairs and told everybody to refund with me and that they would fulfill the same thing for half the price.
So just for context, the way our turnaround model worked is we would fly out there, I would spend the money on the hotels, airfare, rental cars, food for the sales guys, commissions, ad spend.
24:20
And our deal was we keep all the cash that we bring in for X period of time, which was like a six week program.
And then after that the gym got to convert however many members.
So it was all free.
It was all free for them.
They didn't have to do anything.
They said to like do a good job for the six weeks that was their actual cost was delivering and then they convert whoever they want on the back end.
24:39
But they were like, hold on, let me do the math here.
They were like you signed up 150 people at my gym for $500 each.
That's 75,000.
I made 30,000 last year and you've ripped 75 out of my gym in 21 days.
Which didn't have anyways, right?
So it's so they just told them all to refund and then sign up through them.
24:56
Not all of them did that, but a couple guys did.
And that's because you know you sell to, you sell to broke people and people broke people do broke people things and that's a broke person thing to do.
And it was done on my part.
I held the processing risk, but I didn't have control over the delivery.
So like I could see it now that that's a risk that I probably wouldn't do as a business owner, but I didn't understand.
25:13
I was younger and so anyways, those guys do that and all of a sudden that cushion of the 30 or 40 grand just disappears.
And so then we were like, well, shit, what am I going to do?
And the problem was that it started to happen again in another location the next month.
25:29
And Layla comes to me and she's like, this model is broken.
Like, it doesn't work because basically we had to sell more to cover the refunds because I only had 30 or 40 grand and we had like 100,000 or 150,000 in refunds we owed.
So I told the guys to ramp it on the sales and we did.
But then the same issue happened.
So it's kind of this vicious cycle of the more we sold, the more we had to give back.
25:46
And like it was very horrible.
I just remember I just couldn't breathe.
A lot of I like wake up in the morning, I was like I just couldn't breathe.
And so I so I'm, I'm thinking like how can I come up with 150 grand in profit in 30 days.
I've never done that my whole life And which is why I think a lot of times like desperation is one of the, you know, the mother of invention.
26:05
And so we Leila had this Queen transformation program, which was like her, she took her personal training in person, clients online.
She was making like 4 grand a month and he was basically paying for food.
You know, I'm trying to, I'm doing all these big numbers and just like losing my ass.
26:22
And she's just got her like $4000 a month thing on the side that she spends like 4 hours a week on.
And so I hit her up, hit her up.
She was in the kitchen and I was like, tell me more about this thing that you're doing.
And you know, quickly it was like okay.
So this is all margin.
It's all online.
I think we could scale this.
26:37
And so she gave me the go ahead and I spent 48 hours writing the best ads, best sales letter, best website I could come up with and started running ads to it.
And within 14 days you're doing 1000 bucks a day online Over the phone she was and I was like this could work because we had eight sales guys at the time.
26:55
So I was like, if I get all eight of those guys to sell, they each do 1000 a day, we could do 8000 a day, pretty much all profit.
We'd make 240 the end of the month cover commissions and ads spend and I'd make about 1:50 in profit.
I was like, we could do this.
And so I called all the guys that were supposed to launch the next month.
So in April, the the 8 gyms.
27:11
And I was like, hey, we're not doing this anymore.
And you know, they're like, well, you said you were going to and I was like, yeah, but you haven't really paid me anything.
So like, you know, sorry, you know, you haven't.
You haven't there's you haven't lost anything by me not coming out And but one guy was just like the first call that I had.
27:29
I was like, dude, I need this.
I refinanced my house.
I maxed out my credit cards to do this gym and like I know you launched my buddies gym and crushed it for it.
Now this is one of the good guys who didn't do anything weird.
He's like, I know you can help me.
And at this point I'm really beat up by the gym industry and just felt really betrayed And I was like, dude, I'm not flying out there.
Like I don't I don't really care.
27:46
And so finally it was like, dude, can you just show me what you did?
Just show me at least and like I could I could get this going.
And so I said, fine, I'll show you, but I'm not gonna fly out there to save your ass if you can't close.
And he said that's fine.
And so he said how much?
And so I just picked the highest number I could think of at the time because I just wanted him to say no.
28:03
He already said he was Brog.
And so I was like 6 grand and he was like 6K and I was like, yeah, and he was like done.
And I just remember looking at the phone and mean like, holy shit should.
Ask more.
Yeah.
So good thing I had seven more calls that day.
28:20
And so I got to do a credit card in the back of a napkin or whatever.
And I was like, holy shit.
So I called the next guy that we're supposed to launch in same conversation.
He was like, how much?
And I was like 8 grand.
And he was like, sure, I was like, what though?
And so I called the next six guys, same conversation.
Next one was 10 grand.
28:35
OK, next 112 grand.
OK.
I made $60,000 in one day.
And I looked at Layla when she came back in and I was like, so I think we're still in the gym business.
And she was like, what are you talking about?
I just got this whole weight loss thing like it's actually working.
28:51
Like, what are you talking about?
It's like, I think we're still in the gym business.
I think we're just doing it wrong.
And so that's when we switched to the licensing model where I basically took all my internal trainings, which is what I trained my sales teams on, what I trained for, like the nutrition consults, everything that we were already doing.
And I just like made them external.
29:08
I just gave everybody else access to them and the the.
So then as soon as that worked, I called all the 30 gyms that we've launched before that had those conversations.
And we ended up doing like I think something like $300,000 in that in that month and that covered my $150,000 pending you know refund thing that I that I owed.
29:28
And then and then it just took off like a rocket because the 1st 30 guys that we put through it averaged $30,000 in additional cash collect in their first 30 days using the system we had.
And then it was just like, you know, we could barely keep up with the phones.
You know, Leila was getting on the phone with, like, she had eight calls a day and each call had five gym owners on.
29:48
Like, it was just, like, hard, even comprehend.
Like one guy was like, wait a second, You're charging each of us $16,000, and there's five of us on this phone and you have calls all day.
And she was like, Yep, Yep.
And it was insane.
And so it went, you know, I think we did 480 the next month just under 800 that we did a million that we didn't want two, then 15, then 18, then two, then 2-3 and then 25.
30:10
And then it just kept going.
And then twenty months later we were at four and a half million a month.
And I mean our first full year of business of the licensing model, we did $17 million in profit and it was, it was crazy.
And yeah, so that's the story for.
Keep on going real quick, guys.
30:28
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, showed it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
30:47
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
What about you is this, So lost everything in 2016 and then lost everything again in the first quarter of 2017.
31:05
And then the turnaround of like when the model switched from, you know, us flying out to then trying the weight loss thing to then trying the true licensing thing that happened like April, May Ish of 2017.
We finished that year at I think 68 top line, 3 million in bottom line and then the first full year.
31:22
So 2018 I think we did 26,000,000 top line, 17,000,000 in bottom line and then next year we did 37 and you know that was when we started the selling company and then kind of went.
From there and you scaled that to, to what I think the biggest year of those combined was 37,000,000 top line and then COVID hit 2020.
31:41
And so that hurt both of those businesses, but we still had a very stable base.
And so it still made the company pretty valuable in and of itself.
And so that's what we sold to American Pacific Group for 46.2 in 2021. 46 to the game 46.2.
31:59
Million, yeah.
Incredible, man.
Yeah.
Do you ever sit back and think, do you have the moments where you you kind of go back into that time of waking up with that crazy anxiety of thinking, shit, how am I going to get through this day and how am I going to, you know, deliver all the time?
32:19
But you do you give yourself a, you know flowers to be like wow, I've I've, I've taken myself from.
You had, you had yourself.
Did you celebrate yourself after your second Olympia and you're ready?
Or third?
This is not my this is my podcast.
I understand.
32:35
I understand the mentality you and I share off the podcast.
But for me that for me that to explain to the viewers like to to see on you know and hear these stories and you know and see you walking around and staying as humble as what you are.
32:52
Because let's be honest, these guys who are.
Make 1,000,000 bucks and now they're driving this.
They're driving that.
You are probably one of the most humblest guys who have got, you know it, insane work ethic.
And you don't come off the gas for nothing.
And for me and to see that, I think that's a good person for me to have around me and my life.
33:12
Just to see what your mentality is to, you know, grow in scaling and you know back into the next project or consuming yourself with the next big thing.
And not coming up forever you might want since I've known you anyway yeah it's I think it gets into a wider world view perspective of like you know for me I think the purpose of my my life is learning.
33:36
So like that's that's people like what's the meaning of your life for me?
And learning And so learning I can only do through doing.
And so if I want to leave no potential Alex on the table when I die, then I have to expose to myself.
33:52
You know, I have to expose myself to as many hard things as I can and doesn't have to be hard.
Like, yeah, cold plunges and whatever, You know, I mean it's just like challenging circumstances that will create character.
Cuz you know, if you know, at least for me, if I think about myself at the end of my life, I would hope to be somebody who has strong character.
34:09
But in order to achieve strong character, you have to go through hard things.
And so it's kind of interesting that like we want to have, all of us want to have really good character except none of us want to go through hard things.
And so it's like you can't have one without the other.
And so if I had to pick, I'd rather have the character and the scars to show it rather than none of the character and had a soft life.
34:27
That being said, I mean we're born in, I was born in America to an upper middle class family.
So I haven't, you know, the biggest contributor to where I am now is luck by far.
And so I've done what I can with what I've been given and I still think I have a lot that I have underutilized.
34:45
And so I just live in constant fear of that, which is I'm not religious, but my favorite verse in the Bible is too much is given, much is expected.
And so I feel like I've been given a lot.
And so to the same degree, I feel like a lot is expected of me.
35:01
And that's mostly just me expecting that of me because during the year that we sold the business or three of the businesses in 2021, I actually didn't work at all.
And that was a terrible year for me.
I was very depressed.
And so I realized that for me, I am good in motion.
35:20
And so it's just about constantly having that pursuit of betterment, of growth, of challenge.
And the goal for me is always to just have challenges that match my ability and then over time hopefully the challenges get bigger as my ability grows and that's that's kind of the idea.
35:40
You you have talked about depression in in some podcasts of old is.
Is that something you're very weary on in your day-to-day or you catch elements of yourself going into and you can stop it?
Because I can for me personally, you know there's there's traits that I see if I don't to your point, keep active, keep moving, keep evolving.
36:03
Is that similar to you?
Yeah.
And I'll be clear when I said say to sorry, when I say depressed, I say that more not in like a clinical sense.
I just was like really aimless and felt like what's the point of everything?
Not like I was in bed and couldn't get up or anything like that.
Like it was one of those kind of situations.
36:21
I mean the saddest I've ever been was actually when I had that job and I had to quit way back when.
Like that was when I was, I was like that was actually when I was the most depressed in my life.
I was 22 years old and felt like there was nothing, there was no point to living.
I want it.
Like that's where, you know, there's like levels to it.
But for me, I think they call it passive ideation, but basically you just hope that you don't wake up the next day.
36:38
That's that's.
What body was.
Yeah.
When I was 22, for sure.
Well, yeah.
I just hated my life and I I lived a life that was for my father.
And so it was all about making him proud.
And this is not his fault.
This is me.
But I lived the life that I thought he wanted me to have, which I was.
He was.
He was happier than he could have ever been during that period of my time.
36:55
And I remember thinking to myself like either his dreams die or mind do.
And so I had to pick whether I was going to die to him or live for myself.
And so that was ultimately, and, you know, a lot of people are like, oh, I probably exaggerated like, no, my dad and I didn't talk for like years after that.
Not really.
I mean like one text every or whatever.
37:12
But me making this the switch to going from, like the trodden path of doing the prestigious consulting thing to being a gym owner after going to, like, a very good school and doing all this stuff he was not happy about.
But that, at least for me, I was free to fail on my own.
37:29
And you know, at least in the early days, for the first, let's say, five years, the biggest motivator was proving him right, that that I was going to be a failure doing the new path.
37:45
And so that was more painful to me than anything that I could go through.
And so that was always my reminder.
So, like, no matter how hard it was, I was like, I'm just not going to let him be right.
And so that just, like, got me through it.
And so a lot of people have, like these really motivational, like, speeches of I just wanted to change the world.
38:03
And I just wanted America to be fit.
Like, I didn't want any of that.
Like, I just wanted my dad to be wrong.
And so, you know, then I, you know, progressed through that.
And first it was like, I want to make, you know, more money than my dad.
And then it was or as much money as my dad.
Then I was making more money than my dad.
38:19
Then I was making more money than my dad's ever made.
And then I realized that I was trying to win at a game that was not mine.
So I was trying to beat my father at his own game and then that's when I realized that I was like, is this the game I really want to play?
38:37
And so kind of shifted gears to like, well, what is the game that I want to play it and where do I find meeting?
And that kind of went to a different place and now it kind of is what I say now, which is it's just learning for me.
And I think we can create our own meaning around the things that that we want.
38:55
And so that's the the most depressed I was was when I was 22.
And having to quit that job or that life for the new path was by far the hardest decision I've made in my life.
By far.
Like still #1 hardest decision I've ever made in my life.
But after that it all got easier.
It was still incredibly hard.
39:11
But that that to me was like death.
Like I actually had to leave my dad, not my dad.
I had to leave that Baltimore, which draws from.
And I didn't tell anyone until I was already halfway across the country.
Because I knew.
Yeah, because I'd already tried to leave and I couldn't do it.
39:28
And because you'd always talk me out of it.
And he had a lot of authority over me at the time because he was the really successful, you know, he was a doctor.
And yeah, so, you know, he was, he was a doctor and he was successful and and he had a, he wielded a lot of authority over me and a lot of my early days was like trying to make him proud.
39:44
And I realized that over time, the approval of my father was something that was always going to be out of reach.
So it didn't matter where it was.
He would always move the goal post.
And that's fine.
I mean, hey, I've.
I've come a decent way.
But I think he was like 5.
40:00
No, probably seven years after I left for the gym.
Do, you know, start the gyms, Like, when Jim Lunch started really crushing it and he called me to, you know, give a momentous apology, Never apologized to me in my life.
And I remember we were out to dinner and he called me and I was like, this is weird.
40:18
Like, he doesn't really call me that much.
So I took the phone.
I was like, hello.
He's like, you're gonna want to sit down.
And I was like okay.
And he said I'm sorry.
And I was like, for what?
He was like, you know, everything.
40:33
I was like okay.
And you know, rather than having that just be a nice moment, which I probably should have done, I was still very angry.
And so I was like, you know, pops, you know, when they have those speeches at those awards ceremonies and people get up there and they're like, you know, I just want to thank my mom, my dad, for always believing in me.
40:56
I was like, I'm not going to say that I was like, because you didn't.
I was like, because you only believed in me once.
It was obvious once I'd made more than you than you've ever made in your entire life.
And he was like, well, we'll see how long it lasts.
And so, you know, we had a little bit of that kind of competitiveness or whatever.
41:15
I don't even know what you want to call it.
I was disrespecting him is basically what that was.
And I shouldn't have done that.
But I was younger and I was angrier.
But now I think we're on, we're on decent terms.
And I think he has come to respect me in a real way for, you know, who I am.
Because the thing that that that I also said in that conversation, which I probably shouldn't have, was you approve of me now.
41:41
And I was like, but I stopped caring about what you thought five years ago.
So your approval doesn't mean anything to me.
And to be fair, it was true because it was.
It was me having to like die to that vision of what he had for me.
That was the thing that allowed me to do this thing because he made it very clear that he didn't approve the decision.
41:59
So I had to go on my own.
And that was why it felt like death, because it was like death of a relationship, death of the the mentor that you have or whatever that you know you.
And up to that point, that was the major driving force in my life is like, I got good grades to impress my dad.
I got, I went to a good school to impress my dad.
I took the job that he wanted me to take.
42:16
I did all those things.
But it always felt like the approval was like one more thing.
Then yeah, OK, then go to Business School and then graduate from Harvard.
And then after that, like, and that's OK because like a lot of people have it tougher than that, you know, that was just, that was my story.
You guys are OK now we're on good terms.
42:32
Yeah, we're on good terms.
Listen, it's not I don't think.
There's no way that he looks at what you've achieved and is any shape or form not proed, You know, maybe it's just he's one of them old school people.
I'm not.
Again, I don't know the situation, but some people are just hard and hard and compliments and trying to, you know, my parents obviously a little different and for me they, you know, coming from a very blue collar upbringing and from the town I was brought up in, there was.
43:04
It was only a few jobs that were highly successful that I was going to achieve, right.
So I done pretty much similar to you.
I went off my own to my heart park the front failed so many times but I got the stories to tell you know right through.
But listen that that is a story that that has obviously got you to where you are right now and and I don't think it's hardened you, it's probably made you more focused on on all these endeavors and.
43:33
But one thing I, I I have learned to do over the years is give myself sort of almost all looking back the the flowers that I never give myself at the time and like I hope that you're able to do that now looking back.
43:50
That's why I kind of mentioned what I did because I'm we're so focused forward that I would always on to the next like everyone these trophies were you.
Every one of them.
I'm always, always on to the next.
Everybody else was celebrating for me and I was like, I got to show next week.
I got to get my way back down there and I'm on the road again.
44:09
I know we're retired.
I probably can more so accept more of that, that praise, even though it's come and gone now we bought, I wasn't, you know, there at the time, even though the after parties and everything else.
I wasn't there, you know.
But yeah, there's so much more stuff that's going to be achieved by you, I think, in the moving forward, I hope.
44:26
But you're able to, like, be present and and celebrate.
I don't know.
I think you're you're so focused, though.
So I see.
That's what I get from you every time I'm around you and every time I give you a compliment, even if it's about your physique, it's like, yeah, it can be better, you know, my cops are not as big as yours.
44:46
Am I wrong?
Let's be honest.







0:00
Real quick guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
0:19
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
If you cut the lowest percent of the team and you have utilization like you have space, you lose the lowest closing percentage people and you gain more closes just by shifting the closing rate overall of the team.
0:40
When you make those changes, in my experience, salespeople get into a rhythm.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
0:55
I always wish Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I have 13 portfolio companies and I just doubled one of them in 60 days by solving 5 key problems.
And what I'm going to do is show you the data of what it was before, why it was wrong, what we fixed and what happened after.
1:15
Enjoy.
So this is the second smallest company in our portfolio.
It's started by three young founders who are all sad because they were not making the amount of money that they wanted to make and they had these problems and they were riding this very bad roller coaster that they were desperately trying to get off.
1:34
And a lot of that was because they didn't have processes in place for each of the key functions of acquisition.
There was a lot of product problem, but I'll get to that later.
As an investor, when I see a problem, I really do see it as an opportunity to increase value and that's what I get excited about.
That's where a lot of the value gets created anyway.
So like, imperfect businesses are what we deal with.
1:51
So before I show you the data, let me explain what each of these terms actually mean.
So show rate is the percentage of people who have an appointment who show up for their appointment.
So in any business, if you deal with people, you will have sessions or appointments.
Do you have a time slot that someone says they're going to show up, right?
2:08
If it's a sales consult, then they are a prospect and they're going to show up to get sold.
So if I have 100 people who have an appointment and 70 show up, that would be a 70% show rate.
The second one here is offer rate, which we forgot to put in the rate.
So let me just put that in for you.
There we go.
Offer rate, which is the percentage of people that we actually make an offer to.
2:26
You might be like, well, why would I not offer everybody?
Well, not everyone's qualified.
And so for example, if I work with only gym owners and somebody comes on as like, oh, I'm a personal trainer, I'd be like, well, you shouldn't be here.
And we had all these other things that said don't be here, but you still came, Why are you here?
I can't offer you anything.
2:43
And so then that means that you don't offer them anything and that's it.
Now, if 100% of people showed up show rate you are able to offer to, then that means that your offering would be 100%.
And that is an indicator of the quality of the lead flow that you have.
The third is close rate.
And this depends on how you can track this.
2:58
All right.
So you can either do it based on percentage of people who show or you can do it on percentage of people who are offered.
What I normally do is I'll just track both.
I'm going to guess that this one is off of offer rate because it's what we have here.
It's good to have both stats here is because let's say a salesman wants to artificially increase his close rate, well then he will just say, well I'm not going to offer anyone unless I know they're going to say yes.
3:21
And so then their close rates high and then they'll show that there's a really low quality score.
But if that salesman, This is why having team stats is so important and individually is because if the team is all saying that they're offer rate 70 and one guy saying his offer rates 30 but he has 100% close rate and they all have 30% close rates, we know where the data went and This is why having high quality data allows you to see what the problems are.
3:42
If I didn't have this percentage then I wouldn't know it's because we have low quality leads or because my salesman suck, right?
This data allows me to identify the problem and then fix it.
So the 4th set here is percentage of cash collected upfront.
Meaning if we're selling $1000 widgets and the average cash we collect today is $500 because people do payment plans, then we would know our cash collected percentage would be 50% units sold.
4:07
This is also a great indication of how good your sales team is as well.
If I have a low close rate but high cash collected percentage, that would tell me a different story than a really high close rate and really low cash collected percentage.
I'd be like, oh, so they're just getting anyone to say yes and taking $10 down if they can versus somebody saying we have a hard line.
4:25
And so it's really trying to find the magic between these two and saying how can I get as many people to say yes and get as much cash collected up front.
The final one here is just units sold.
And this is really just the output of these four.
If we multiple of these things together, how many we end up closing and that's the result.
So let's reveal the data.
4:41
So beforehand we get a 49% show rate.
So let's say we have 100 appointments now we have 49 who actually show for their appointment and then of the 49, we're able to offer 83% of them beforehand.
So 80% of that is 4040.
4:56
People now are getting offered out of our original 100 appointments.
Of the people get offered, 27% of them, which is 10 people roughly are actually buying in that closing percentage.
And then our cash collected from those 10 people is we're getting a little less than half of the cash that we closed down.
5:14
Now I gave you 100 as a number, but the actual number of units sold for this business in the prior month was 56 units, all right.
So this is current state.
If you don't know these numbers in your business, you should so that you can improve them.
Like, let's say I invest in your Business Today, The first thing we do is get the data so that we can see what baseline is, so we can see where the discrepancies are and where we think the biggest opportunities for improvement are.
5:37
And you're going to have to wait till the end for me to show you what happened after.
So let's start with problem number one or opportunity for improvement.
Number one, we had a low show rate as in based on our benchmarks of 70% for any kind of employment type business, we think that we should have at least 70 there.
Allen, which is a company that I had, all we did was show rates.
5:55
There is lots of data that we were able to collect, but we were doing 4000 appointments a day.
We had a machine learning team to think like what was the number of communications that we had to have with the prospect?
What was the delay between responses that got the most people?
How many questions would we ask?
What was their tonality or the total number of exchanges?
6:12
How far apart were the exchanges and how far out would we be willing to book an appointment for the show rate to increase.
And so when we have show rate issues, I feel very confident saying that these are the benchmarks that I can share with you.
So they were low based on our benchmarks.
So their number was 49% of appointments were showing it.
6:29
We wanted them to be out with 70%.
This is our benchmark where we'd say, OK, this isn't a problem anymore.
Now do we want to improve things?
Absolutely.
But where are we going to allocate our effort at the constraint.
This was a constraint.
Now to give context here, this delta is a 40% difference, 40 percent's a lot.
6:46
Think about the SP500, they're like we try and grow 9% a year.
It's like boom, I unlock that, I get 40% growth.
I don't have to do anything else but for like 4 years in the SP.
Alright, big wins.
That's what we look for.
Lots of things can affect show rate.
By the way, the number one, one that affects show rate is number of total time sites available.
7:03
Take that to the bank.
But one of the other ones is the targeting and the offer itself.
So targeting is who's actually seeing this promotion.
If I'm targeting teeny boppers, for example, I might get people to schedule but then realize that they're not here for a laser hair removal appointment.
7:21
They're like I don't even have here yet, right?
So, so the targeting there would be off right and so that would affect our show rate and that has nothing to do with our lead nurture sequence for our salesman or anything like that.
It's just the wrong people we're seeing.
So that was issue #1 for context for us just imagine that's underneath it was 25 to 35 year olds who are gainfully employed and love their job and this targeting that when we came in to look at it was actually targeting 18 to 24 year olds bad act was did not come at hold Co.
7:48
We have media buyers.
We have pros who do this for a living.
And so when they zoomed in on how their media buyer was optimizing the traffic, they were optimizing against what a lot of people would initially think they should do, which is optimizing for the lowest cost leads and the lowest cost appointments.
8:04
What we had to do was switch, to optimize around cost per sale.
If we can optimize around who we actually sell to, we're optimizing for the number of transactions we'll shift where the sale come from.
And just to give you how big of a problem this was, they had to cancel 75% of their appointments before the 49% show rate.
8:21
The sales guys are spending most of their time just looking at their appointment, looking up the person canceling to get their 49% show rate and that's about the closest thing to literally burning money.
So the second big problem was multitasking.
And this really goes for any role, but especially like sales driven roles.
8:36
They had a setting team and a closing team and the setters were both trying to call leads to get appointments and then also nurturing and doing the follow up to remind them of the appointment.
And as similar as that may sound, in your mind it's two completely different activities.
You're banging phones, you're calling people up.
8:52
You're in that flow and then you're like, oh wait, Sarah has an appointment today.
Let me go over mine.
Sarah does.
Sarah gonna shrupt And they're like, wait, I'm calling and then you start like it is, you go back and forth.
So they had three big issues, #1 is that they weren't double dialect, right, Which is one of the most common things that you can do, by the way, if you're doing phone calls, because a lot of initial screens will stop the first call, but if you dial twice, you'll get through #2.
9:13
Is that the time to contact was too slow?
So lead would come in and they would just like sit there for 30 minutes, 60 minutes, an hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, right.
And they weren't getting contacted.
It's like, what did this person do?
They're like, oh, I'd like to find out more information.
Nothing.
9:31
And the third thing is that they didn't have the right time to set appointments and they weren't nurturing correctly.
So we go same day, next day.
I'm just giving you some secrets and they didn't have morning of nurture.
OK.
Meaning if you have an appointment today and you booked this appointment three days ago.
If I don't remind you that day that you have an appointment, the likely that you show is lower.
9:51
And so these are the problems that they have no double dial blow speed of contact and they didn't have any morning of nurture.
But wait, there's more.
The second problem they had or opportunity for improvement was that they had a low close rate and this is based on our benchmarks.
10:07
So I would normally give you a KPI but it has so many different variables in terms of what percentage closer it is because if you're selling in person for example for a low ticket thing you might be able to sell 80% plus of people walk in the door.
On the flip side if you're selling an investment opportunity over the phone on you know first or second contact you might sell 5% right.
10:27
But for this particular type of sale that they had which was a two call close for like I would say a mid price consumer service in my opinion they should have been about 40%.
So 40% is what I wanted them to be at and then current was 27%.
So this is where they were, this is where we wanted them to be.
10:43
And again for context here this is about a 50% improvement.
Don't be fooled with small numbers.
If the stat is supposed to be 10% and you're at 7% you're like we're pretty close.
They did, you're 30% off right Actually shit you're more there 50% off because half of seven is 3 1/2.
10:59
I don't get into the math for you.
So problem #1 is that they had service level discovery.
And if you're not familiar with that terminology in a sales script, there's different kind of phases that you go through the conversation and the opening part is often a little bit of rapport.
And then right after that you get into discovery.
And discovery is where you're discovering what the problems that the person's going through.
11:16
You're trying to understand why they are, where they are, why they're on the phone with you, why they decided to take time out of the day, why this problem's important to them, what they've tried in the past, etc, etc.
Right.
This is the discovery.
This gives you all the ammunition that you're going to use at the end of the sale to close it.
So the way that they were doing was simply saying, how much money do you want to make?
11:34
Just asking the one question, which is the big obvious question.
It's surface level.
But the big thing that you always want to ask when you're selling is intention is why do they want this?
Like what changes as a result of this?
How will your life look different?
What can you not do now that you would be able to do as a result of this change?
11:51
Right.
Who else in that in your life with that effect?
Why does that matter to you?
Right.
So these are all why questions and it's just to dig up their intentions because if you can understand why someone's there, it's much easier to get them to agree to getting them there, right?
But if you don't know that someone's trying to, let's say, replace their income versus quit their job versus just have side hustle money, those are very different intentions.
12:17
If I want to talk to side hustle money, I'm probably not going to be like this is going to take a ton of time, right?
On the flip side, if someone's like, I hate my job, I just want to do something that's not this, that I might talk about what the daytoday looks like in this scenario and ask them if that sounds better to them.
12:32
And so if you think about sales process, what they were doing is they were asking questions that were here service level.
But this is where all the meat is and that's where all the money is, is the questions that are below the surface is understanding why someone's even doing this to begin with.
12:48
Look at that iceberg, fucking killer iceberg.
And so the second issue is that they had a lot of objections coming up on the call.
I'll say objections, but I also mean obstacles.
For those of you who are sales, sales senses, objections happen after you talk about the number.
Obstacles happen before you talk about the number.
13:04
If you come on the phone and I say, hey, why are you here?
And you're like, I just want to find out more information, that's actually an obstacle.
Like, you already have to confront that because like, no, you're not hopping on phone calls.
All you're trying to find information we'll probably trying to solve.
And then they're like, well, and then you get into it, right.
But if you don't address that up front, it'll blow up on you in the clothes.
So objections and obstacles is what they were encountering a lot of.
13:22
And part of that is because their discovery was wrong, right?
They were talking to service levels, so then lots of shit was blowing up on them in the close.
Common objections that happen after you present price is this is too much.
I need to think about it.
I have to talk to my spouse.
I'm not sure if this is for me.
I'd like to get more data.
13:38
Can you send me a brochure?
Like these are all just the makebelieve things that people will say in order to not buy from you.
And interestingly, a lot of times if you stay in the service level, they'll even give you what we call smokescreens.
But basically like they'll just come up with a reason that they're not going to do it and it's not even the reason they just throw a smoke bomb up and they're like, I don't like English, you know walk away, right.
14:00
It has nothing to do with it.
They just want to get off the phone, right.
So those are the two issues that we had on the sales and that was getting us to this 27% close rate.
And what this looks like is lots of argumentation and like, hard closing.
And it's because the sales in positioned properly and they were basically talking at people and not listening.
14:19
If the salesperson is talking more than the prospect in your sales, like these are likely issues that are coming up.
I'm going to give you 2 examples real quick to show you how important delivery of a message is.
So if I say I have to think about it and I say, oh, like, what are your main concerns or what are the main, like, what are the main variables that you're considering?
14:38
You're not thinking, wow, this guy's A douchebag.
I sound like.
I just genuinely want to know.
I call it childlike curiosity and I use, I always cue it by tilting my head.
I'm like, huh, what are the main things, right?
Like and I would and I would increase my voice at the end there.
An improperly trained salesperson might be like, well, what are the main concerns you have?
14:57
And all of a sudden that sounds like a very different thing.
So they're saying the script, but the prospect isn't hearing the same message, right?
And these are little details that actually make a huge difference in ultimately how you close.
There's a lot of things in tone, but I'll just say one is how you raise or lower your voice and the 2nd is where you choose to emphasize.
15:14
If I say I didn't say he hit his wife.
Now if I say like that, I have neutral tone.
If I say I didn't say he hit his wife, then it's like I'm not saying that I didn't say he hit his wife is now saying that like those weren't my words.
I didn't say he hit his wife, is saying he's the one to question.
15:32
I didn't say he hit his wife means like he might have done something else, but he did something to his wife.
I didn't say he hit his wife.
It could have been somebody else's.
I didn't say he had his wife, it might have been his kid, right?
And so it's the same sentence, but simply emphasizing different parts of it, communicate different things.
And so the tone and emphasis create a altogether package of how we communicate.
15:51
And for them, their tonality was way off as a team because they were missing the 1st 5 minutes of discovery and setting the frame properly.
And so I'll give you the last set of problems, opportunities for improvement, and then we'll dive into what we did to solve them and what happened.
Sales problem three, opportunity for improvement.
16:13
People in org structure issues.
So issue #1 is that CEO was the sales manager and that was because he was the best closer.
He had a significantly higher close rate than the rest of the team, but he wasn't a very good sales manager even though he was a good closer.
16:31
By the way, that's one of the main issues that a lot of sales teams have is they promote their best closer as a sales manager.
And oftentimes those are two very different skills and we could see this because the churn on their sales team was through the roof.
Just to be clear, they were a group of young founders.
It's not uncommon because usually when you start a business learning how to promote and sell the product is usually the job of the founders.
16:52
Like how do I get people to want to buy the thing.
And so they end up getting the most reps early on and also understanding the prospect better than just about anyone.
And so one of the big things you guys are a little mini sales less than today is that companies will over educate on the product and under educate on the prospect, right.
17:07
The person that you should be educating yourself stuff on is who we're talking to more than what we're selling.
Because for me, if I know someone deep in their core, what their intentions are, I can tell them anything.
I know someone inside and out and then someone says sell this thing and I know nothing about it.
I could probably get them to buy.
17:24
On the flip side, I know everything about this thing and I don't know who I'm talking to.
Talk to a child, a man, a woman, you know, old, young, different language.
Like it will almost be impossible.
And so a lot of people talk like, hey, sell me this pen, When in reality what we want to do is like, talk to John, the majority of good sales trainers who try to do that gimmick, what they want the person to do is ask them a question.
17:46
It actually has nothing to do with the pen.
And so if they say sell me this pen, what you do is you take the pen and you put it in your pocket and you say, how's it going?
What brought you in today?
Right, Because I got to go from where they're at to wanting a pen.
I'm not going to just be like, hey, buy this pen, give me money.
18:01
Like it doesn't work that way.
But bad salesman do.
So the second issue was the setting team expectations.
One of the benefits of working with someone has more experience is that we know what the benchmarks should be.
And so a lot of times we can reset someone's minimum standard and they're like, well they're setting 2A day and we're like they should all be minimum setting three and that sounds tiny, but again, two to three is a 50% increase in sets and that's across the whole team.
18:24
So that means a lot of productivity, but if you set the bar low, people will just naturally shrink down to that level.
All right.
So you understand the problems and here is the data.
This is before they had a low share rate issue, they had low flows rate and multiple issues around that and they had people and organizational issues.
So I want you to pause real quick if you like.
18:40
What would you do?
How would you attack these issue if this was your business?
And then I'll tell you what we did.
Now there's two elements of solutions.
Element 1 is what would you do to attempt to solve the problem and the 2nd is which one do we do in what order?
The third problem that was actually the first thing we decided to fix was that we hired a sales director.
18:59
And the reason for that was because the CEO was overly involved.
He was micromanaging, He wasn't a good manager and he also wasn't doing CEO stuff.
And so we had to hire an experienced sales director who in this instance had been a sales trainer for a similar type of sale and a consumer good.
This guy ended up being exceptional and being able to implement the rest of the changes that we outlined.
19:18
So this was in terms of order, of importance.
I think if we hadn't done this and it tried to the rest of them, it would have fallen flat.
This is like one of the most common errors that business owners and founders make is that they see the what and not The Who, or they focus on the how and not The Who.
19:33
And if you have the same problem that has recurred multiple quarters in a row in the same department underneath of the same WHO, it might not be a WHAT issue, it might be a who issue.
One of the reasons having experience is helpful is because you know what it looks like when it's right and some of the biggest costs in the business are hiring incorrectly.
19:51
You waste the time trying to find them.
You waste the time onboarding them and training them.
And then you waste the time of all the time it takes you to figure out that they're not the right fit and all the lost growth that you would have had to then start that process over again.
That's tough, but a lot of businesses have to do with that, which is why picking personnel is so important.
20:08
With this instance, we looked at culture fit which is like do we think that this guy will fit in which we usually the founders pick that part out like hey, does this guy fit in Cool.
And then we're going to hardcore drill on usually experience and.
Tactical knowledge and so we have subject matter experts at Holdco like media buying, CRO experts, sales experts, finance experts, whatever.
20:27
And we will then do tactical interviews we talked about earlier.
You can know that someone that's good based on the quality and quality of the data that they collect.
And so I would ask somebody what data do you plan on collecting and how would you plan on fixing those things based on how vague they are and how high level they go in terms of their solutions.
20:43
It'll tell you how nuanced they can be in their thinking and ultimately executing solutions.
Sales director specifically, in my experience, when I have guys who are like, I just wanna build up people, I wanna give these guys skills and they marry that with like and these are the metrics that I track to know.
XY&Z, that's a good sales director.
21:00
The next thing we decided to solve boom, was fixing the ad targeting.
And the reason we did the sales director first was because we're like, well, how do we know if anything else is going to happen afterwards if we fix this Until what we ended up doing here, it turns out, is that we also had another personnel issue.
21:15
The media buyer, I was asleep at the wheel.
They were optimizing around the wrong stuff.
They were trying to split their attention and start their own side hustle.
It was clear that they were negligent.
They actually were doing the right thing, and then they stopped doing the right thing.
And it was clear that that type of behavior the founders felt was not going to correct itself.
21:31
And so they let go of that person, hired a new person and boom, fix the ad targeting problem.
We were back to 25 to 35 year old people who love their job.
What did we fix next?
Boom, we reduce the sales team what?
And we reset expectations for the setting team, reduce the sales team.
21:47
What we looked at is sales team utilization.
If we know that guys can take 10 sales a day and they're actually only taking four, then we have too many sales people.
And in this instance, it gives you an opportunity to cut the fat for like British term and reward the people who are actually doing their jobs and closing Well, if you cut the lowest percent of the team and you have utilization like you have space, you lose the lowest closing percentage people and you gain more closes just by shifting the closing rate over all of the team.
22:15
When you make those changes, in my experience, sales people get into a rhythm.
If you don't take enough sales calls, you're too desperate to close the deal and then you start being too hard and not listening enough because it's about you, not them.
When salespeople have more and more consults, they sell from the back of their heel, They're open minded, they're asking questions, they're feeling good and they get into rhythm.
22:35
The setting team, we we both downsized and increased expectations.
And you're like, how did all these sales increase?
By having fewer people.
We had better people, that's how.
And that also helps recreate the culture of the team so that we can have a new standard set of high performers because there's nothing that demotivates a high performer like a low performer who's still on the team.
22:55
And so we went from 2:00 to 4:00 in terms of our expectation per day for the team in terms of sets, sales fix, numero, quattro.
Yeah, I'm missing all my columns up now.
Just gonna have to deal with it.
So we promoted 1 setter to lead nurture specialists.
23:11
I was saying earlier that they were multitasking, right?
So they're doing some setting and they're doing some lead nurture and that gets really hard for a team of six guys to split those things.
We took one of the setters who was really good and made that person the lead nurture specialist who basically acted as the bridge for both the setting team and the closing team to basically coordinate and remind the people of their appointments.
23:29
And we equipped that lead nurture specialist with one of our checklists for what that role needs to do to get the most people to show up.
And I'm not going to give you all this is a long checklist, but I'll give you 2 quick examples.
One of them is doing a three-way intro once you have the set appointment between the setter and the closer and doing it via iPhone if you can because now you have a known person and an unknown person and a person that bridges the two.
23:49
They might no show on Johnny over here but not on the guide that they just spoke with.
And so the idea is how can I bridge that gap and kind of make the association for them add some trust.
The other thing is that the closers morning of would remind them with either a voice memo or a video text personalized to them be like hey John really excited for our appointment today.
24:08
I saw your profile XYZ personalized to you really pumped for I think we might help you out boom.
So that's just a couple of things that we have on that list that we had them implement and all do consistently and sales team fix #5 boom is we optimize the sales script.
I said earlier that the discovery was two surface level.
24:25
So we rescripted the discovery, made sure we were asking deeper, more meaningful questions.
And a part of that is also bringing some of the objections to the front.
It's much easier.
And this is the this is the terminology that our team uses, which is killing zombies, right?
It's a lot easier to kill a zombie when it's far away than when it's on top of you, right?
24:42
And so if somebody's trying to bring up a zombie in the clothes, another way of saying it is like you want to defuse the bomb before it goes off in the clothes in your face.
We solved the problem before we bring it up.
Now this is actually something that we added to this part of the script, which is prior to the appointment we say, hey, is there anyone else who'd be required to make a decision about this thing?
24:59
If they say yes, then you say cool, well, let's push back the appointment and let's get that person on right.
That way you have all the decision makers present.
So these are just little things, but like little 1% improvements over and over and over again is what yield these 50% boosts.
And the third main change we did was that we drilled the team on looping.
25:17
And looping is just a sales terminology for basically when you encounter an objection, handling the objection and then asking again, handle the objection, ask again.
Right.
Because a lot of sales people are afraid to ask if someone says no and they don't want to ask again.
Right.
25:32
And I can tell you this is that the number of sales you make is direct, proportional to how many times you ask.
There's ways to do it wrong and there's ways to do it right.
The idea is that you should be able to resolve the concern, right.
So if someone says, I need to think about it and you say, well, what are your main concerns, right.
And they say, well, it seems really complicated.
25:50
And you say, oh, what part specifically feels more complicated?
They're like, it's the whole tech thing.
And we're like, oh, we also have a vendor that can actually fill that in.
I think it's a couple bucks extra.
But like, we can just handle that for you.
Does that solve the problem?
And they're like, oh, OK, So you guys, you guys just handed that one part of it.
26:06
Like, yeah, we handed that part up for you.
Cool.
Now this is where the salesman says, great, so what's you want to move forward?
Hey, like, do you have your idea on you, Hey, what card do we like?
You can just make the ask right after that.
And so then at that point, you might say, hey, ready to move forward then.
26:22
And they might say, well, this feels like a fast decision.
It's like, oh, well, what makes it fast?
How long you been thinking about this?
They're like, well, I mean, I just met you and you say, well, how long have you wanted to solve this problem?
And then they would say, well, I mean a long time.
It's like, well, this doesn't sound like a fast decision at all.
26:37
It sounds like you've already made the decision a long time ago you wanted to change.
Now we're just acting on it.
They're like, so now do you want to move forward, right, Keep looping and continuing to resolve the concern, Ask again, resolve the concern, ask again.
So drum roll, please.
What happened in the real world?
26:54
So let's go to the data.
All right.
So in our first column, we had 49% show rates.
And after we implemented sales fix two, fixing the ad, targeting sales fix 4, promoted 1, lead center to lead nurture specialists and sales fix three, reduce the team size and reset expectations.
27:12
Survey says you get a 70% boost, which is almost exactly the KPI.
And that's because when you do things that work, they work.
All right.
So that was a 40% improvement in sales.
And to be clear, this was just over two months.
27:27
All right.
So some of these changes can happen real quick if you know what you're doing.
All right.
The second change we had is our offer rate.
And so here's what happened.
Survey says 80%.
We actually offered just about the same amount of people the offer.
But what will, what I will say change is that the people were getting on the phone.
27:43
Now realistically what they were doing is offering people who weren't qualified because the sales team wanted to eat.
And I get that like there's a human component here.
They were offering people were not qualified the deal because they needed commissions, right, which is what we were trying to fix with the targeting now close rates survey says we went from 27% and 60 days later we were at 41%, so 1% above our benchmark.
28:07
All right.
This is a 50% improvement in sales.
So 40 and 50 cuz I am Next up we have percentage of cash collected, a really good metric for knowing how strong the sales team in it and this is especially important for that early discovery portion and how good they are at looping and closing because the deeper you get the discovery the the more convicted the buyer will be about the solution and the more likely they are to pay upfront as a measure of their conviction in the solution.
28:34
So survey says we own from 47 to 82%.
So we almost doubled the amount of cash that we were collecting upfront per sale in 60 days.
Think about this, we had a 40% improvement, we had a 50% improvement right and we had a almost doubling of cash collected.
28:52
So if we almost doubled the amount of sales that happened and we almost doubled the cash upfront collected, what do we do to the cash for the business for Exton?
Much more enticing, right?
And so after we added all these four changes together and we waited 60 days, what happened?
29:13
Survey says we went from 56 to 93 sales a month, right.
And that was just from a few of these fixes on one particular part of the organization.
You can still apply all of these things to the upsell percentages on the back end.
29:29
You can apply this to how you're creating ads, how you create the landing pages, how you make content, how you do outbound.
The scripts that use all of these elements can be improved, but they take 100 golden BB's and not one silver bullet.
And you might think after we made all these changes that we're done, we ride off into the sunset.
29:45
But wait, there's more.
There were even more problems in the business on the product and customer success side, which we will get to in the next.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else on everybody.
Happy Saturday.
Day for the long weekend, I will be your host today, Alex.
And I am saluting you, because if you're anything, like we are, then that means that holiday weekends and things like that are only days that you just work and don't get bothered by anyone else.
0:47
So if that is you then I salute you were in the same boat but it's something that came with mind this morning and I feel like content has been on like the vein of my thought process recently.
And so I wanted to share something with you yesterday.
I talked about Whether making content for you, specifically what types of content and what is kind of the best use of your time.
1:08
But today, I want to talk about how to consume content.
And I think it's, it's just off just as, if not more valuable of a skill to know, how to consume content, because right now, there's so much information that's out there.
Like, you could literally consume content all day every single day.
And so, having the skill of being able to pick up a book and then being okay with putting it down, I think is incredibly valuable because it preserves the one.
1:30
An asset that you have, which is your time and your attention, right?
And so you are truly spending it and so being a y spender of your time and attention is a like, if there's ever a skill to know how to master.
That is the one, right?
Because what, you put your time and attention to is what is, what will come into you and so guarding yourself for that now.
1:50
So what I wanted to talk to you today is not just about the importance of X, I've like, hopefully, that that should be clear to you.
Like that's really important your return on your time because you only have so much of it and being able to say no, A lot of things, but there's a ton of influences out there.
There's a ton of business people.
There's a ton of gurus, whatever, right?
2:06
And how do you know which ones to listen to?
And this is sort of like an easy guide for anyone who follows lots of different people and one of the key things to understand is context, right?
And so one of the things that happens and I find myself doing this is that I talk about the things that are on my mind about my business in any given time period.
2:26
But the reality is that a lot of Of times, a lot of influencers, a lot of gurus will talk about what's on their mind for their business.
But if their business is a million dollar business, a 10 million dollar business of 50 million, August has 100 million dollar business.
2:45
The things that are relevant the skills, the deficits the bottlenecks that they're experiencing are really not relevant to the majority of the marketplace, right?
Because like if I were to raise my calves are to ask everyone here to raise raise your hands and you were like and it's like in front of me right now.
It's like who here is a small Owner, who has less than three employees.
3:01
Right.
Or is just self employed.
Most people would be raising our hands.
If you go to a conference like, you know, 10x or you know, clickfunnels or anything like that, a lot of these types of conferences, most of the people, there are just beginning have yet to begin or just beginning.
3:19
Which is why like when you see the content around like, like, find your passion and and and the things like that, like, get motivated, all that is really towards Seekers.
This is towards people who are watching foreigners like that might make you feel good but it's not going to be a huge Roi on your time unless you really feel like you're not motivated, right?
3:39
And so that's probably like the mass Market, that's the biggest chunk right there, some big influencers there, but like what they're talking about is not going to like give you huge Roi so then maybe like right after that, you're like okay well if I'm an operator so I like I'm an owner operator and I'm self-employed still.
3:55
Then we'll should like should I listen to all the things about, you know, running team.
Well, you don't have a team.
I'm just being honest with you, like a lot of the stuff about, like, like culture and internal training and onboarding team members and things like that is just like you just catch yourself consuming it and be like, is this really relevant for me, right?
4:15
It's like where I'm at in my business because if you're new or if you've if you've taken the first step in your and you are like let's say your personal training right now.
You're actually full-time or your.
You've already started your gym and it's just you like you need to learn how to Market and sell period.
Like that's all of Your attention should be on learning how to Market and sell because that's the only thing that's going to feed you, like running the team culture motivate like that stuff's all done.
4:38
Now, like you've leveled up, right?
Like this is what you need to focus on.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
4:54
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
5:13
Now once you know how to sell selling is going to be the first skill that you acquire, I think it's easier of a skill than marketing is.
It's also less valuable because selling, you can get a lot of people to plug in for sales.
If you learn how to Market, you learn how to make it rain, right much more valuable.
So, that's something that's a skill, that it can take you a lot further.
5:31
Right now, what's more valuable than marketing, right?
Once you've leveled up from like motivation first, okay?
Now you're motivated, you start.
Now you learned how to sell, right?
Because that's how you actually make money people Give it to you and you actually have to take it.
That's actually what sales is after that you have marketing because now you can you find out how to make more sales by bringing people in and generating interest after that that's when leadership and running the team become the skill sets that you need.
5:58
So if you're listening or you're watching content on a regular basis, listen to it through those filters, if you're like this is not a skill set that I need right now.
It can still be really inspiring and really interesting and I'm saying this because I spent tons of time early on in my like Jim Jim We're going to call it listening to things that I was like.
6:16
That's really cool, that's really important but it never actually applied to how my business was working at that time.
And so like if you only have X amount of time our attention under your control than invest, 100% of the laser focus, and be okay with closing books, be okay, with closing books, be okay with causing a video.
6:34
Because if you're like me, it killed me for a long time to stop things.
Like, no, I'm a finisher like I started video going to finish it because that's like that was the mindset of had.
I like I'm not a quitter but it's not like that.
That's not how it works.
That's not information work.
Some people don't have good content.
Some people make one nugget and take a really long time to talk about it, right?
6:51
I try as hard as I can to keep this concise as possible, but like, that's the point, right?
And so, like, by all means, like if you're watching this and you're like, man, I'm not getting any more value for posit.
Stop it.
Go find something that's more relevant.
But like hopefully this gives you a lens to see all like to see or listen to all of the other content that you have coming at you.
7:11
It's like is Gary Vee someone on.
So follow, I don't know, unless you're just looking at what he's doing for Content, but if you're not making content, and what does it matter, right?
If you, if you're looking at Grant Cardone, that's awesome.
But is he really giving you things?
If all these talking about, how to invest your money in your like, a broke, probably not a very good use of your time, right?
7:30
So look like go consumed from a pipe.
The only things that you need and your current situation.
If you're in the beginning, its sales Nexxus marketing next is going to be teamwork and Leadership to build a team that scales.
So, so hope you guys are having a happy weekend.
This was just all my mind because we Layla and I were talking about content and I was like, you know what?
7:49
I talked about making constant yesterday but I should probably talk about consuming it.
And so this is the other side of the coin.
So if you feel good about cutting things out and going on a low information diet that only is about one specific skill, which is what I would recommend just FYI.
8:05
In terms of how I consume content, what I usually do is I'll bookmark, a bunch of things on one topic and then I'll binge binge sale stuff.
I'll binge marketing.
Stuff.
Especially if I'm creating a new training around something or my, how can I optimize this process?
I'll read two or three books and a few days and then have all the ideas kind of spinning in my head and then create something and it tends to work a lot.
8:25
Better than kind of passive consumption while you're on the toilet.
Thanks Jeff, appreciate it.
Brandi lots of love, man, and I hope you guys have an amazing weekend enjoy the the we call it, the interruption free work day.
8:42
Every day is a workday Saturdays and Sundays just work days without meetings.
So anyways, have an awesome day guys and I will catch you soon.
Have an amazing for the club.









0:00
Most nation real quick, if you are.
A business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus we would love to talk to.
You and if you like that or would like to hear more about it.
Go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to.
0:15
One of our team and see if we can help you get there.
My observation who have become super fit right or super successful in bodybuilding your business are people who can do it for a long time.
And the best way to do it for a long time is to be obsessed with it is to actually enjoy doing it.
The.
0:30
Wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast.
The game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
So I was having this conversation with a friend of mine who exited his business for 15,000,000 and he was like I think that you're so successful in business because of the principles that you learned from bodybuilding.
0:58
And I thought and we had a like a 30 minute discussion about that one topic.
And I think it's really, really important some of the things that we that we talked about or it's just very interesting.
And so the nice thing about what I want to talk to you about today is if you're really good at business and you want to get jacked or shredded, everything that I'm about to tell you will apply.
1:15
And if you are really good at being jacked and shredded and really bad at making money, then everything about to tell you will apply because there's actually so many similarities, but not in the way that you would think.
Right.
And so as I was thinking about this, right, between bodybuilding and business, one of the key things that matters is consistency, right?
1:31
A lot of people think that intensity is what wins.
So they work really, really hard at business for a short period of time, and then they stop.
And they look and they're like, I haven't made a lot of money, right.
Or they workout really, really, really hard for a couple weeks or a couple months, and then they're like, hey, I don't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, like, what gives?
And then they stop, right.
And so I would always rather have somebody workout with a 70% intensity for 10 years, right?
1:52
Then somebody work out with 120% intensity for one month, right in the same degree what happens within business, right.
If you just consistently do something for a long period of time, you're going to be really good at it because the total volume of work performed will surpass the the, the total effort from that guy who is being really intense for a short period of time.
2:10
Because one of the things that happens, I think, over time is that you develop the skill set of persistency.
Like it in and of itself is a character trait that you develop through doing it right?
So if you're like, I'm not that good at sticking through things, then the best way to get better at sticking through things is to stick with things, because then that just like a muscle becomes better for you, right?
2:29
So here's another really cool similarity between bodybuilding and business.
There are a lot of guys who are really good at one thing.
So they're really good at entrepreneurs, really good at sales, right?
Or they're really good at marketing, or they're really good at product, or they're really good at whatever, right.
And to the same degree in bodybuilding, there are people who have really good chests, really good backs, really good legs, and then they have other weaknesses.
2:49
And so in the world, you've probably heard this before, which is you need to double down in your strengths.
And I think that there's a certain degree of truth to that.
There's also a big lie that's woven in.
And so here's the similarity between the two of bodybuilding and business.
Your weakest link in your business will be the constraint of the business.
3:08
You don't necessarily have to be the person who fulfills that weak link, but the business must be balanced.
So just like your physique must be balanced, so too must do the business.
And so just like you have body parts, you have departments, right, within a business, so you've got marketing and sales, you've got your biceps and triceps, right.
3:24
And so you have these similarities that are there, but you can't just be all sales and marketing, right?
You have to have a back end.
You have to have good culture, you have to have finance, you have to have good accounting.
Like, these are all things that must happen in order for the business to overall be successful over the long term and to the same degree in bodybuilding.
3:40
You can't just have all chests because over a long period of time a you'll be unbalanced and you'll probably injure yourself and you won't look good the whole time.
Because the more you get that unbalanced, the more unbalanced your body will look and it looks stupid, it doesn't work right.
So over a long enough time horizon, you can be unbalanced.
In the beginning, it's natural for some people to have naturally better legs or be naturally better at sales and marketing, be naturally better at products and fulfillment.
3:59
But overtime you have to develop those weaknesses because otherwise those would be the things that constrain your business and your growth and the overall physique or business that you built.
So I thought that was a really interesting parallel between to another one's really good hold on.
So skill comes from volume, right.
4:14
And it's high quality volume.
So this is ones that's really interesting.
So I've had, I've worked out with friends of mine who are entrepreneurs and I can't tell you how many times they've worked out with me.
And I'm like, hey man, change this, do this, move your elbows this way.
You know, reposition your body.
And if for some reason it's happened almost every time with back training and they were like, dude, I've been training for 10 years and mighty, these aren't like fitness people.
4:36
They're like business people who are just like, hey, I'll go work out with you and and they're like, dude, I've never felt my back before.
Like, I like today with you, I've realized that I've never felt my back when I trained.
And so think about this for a second.
For 10 years or five years, these guys have been training.
They're consistent, right?
4:52
For ten years or five, they've been training and thinking that they were training their back, but they weren't.
And so the question is how many people are in business and thinking they're marketing, thinking they're selling when in fact they are not.
And so what's interesting about this is naval Rob Kant said this about specified our specific knowledge, right?
5:10
Is a specific knowledge is is knowledge that can be learned but cannot be taught.
And so the way that people learn it is through application doing.
If you can learn it in school, it's not valuable, right?
And so the way that it is learned is through apprenticeship and mentorship, right.
And that's why I'm such a big proponent of finding people who have done what you want to do and then and learning from them because there's so many nuances and and wisps and and the details and how they execute that create the excellence.
5:36
And so I'm going to go on this tangent for for a second because I think it's really important.
So one, my good friend, Doctor Jarakashi PHD1, of the top two smartest people I've known my whole life, he looked, he looked at this big research study that they looked in academia, which was that people who have mentors in academia accomplish 4 times more than people with identical character traits, identical degrees and pedigrees and all that stuff who did not have a mentor.
6:02
Think about that four times the production because of the level of specific knowledge that gets transferred from one person to another, right?
And so for me, I think about that I'm like man, so how much specific?
Not like what does it take to get specific knowledge?
Because people ask me, they're like, man, you sound so convicted.
6:18
Like, your content seems so different than some of the stuff that I see out there.
And I was thinking about this for a second.
I was having a conversation with Brooke Castilla, who runs a $50 million a year Life Coaching business.
She's one of our really close friends.
And she's like, I get the same feedback too.
And she's like, I wish I could teach that thing.
And so we're having discussion about it.
And I was like, I think what it is, is it's first principles, like derivatives, like most people that you see have not done the thing that they are teaching.
6:44
What they do is they are they are spouting things that they have heard and just regurgitating them.
And so they do not understand why it is that way.
They are saying it is that way, but they lack the details.
They lack the nuance of having done it and being able to troubleshoot it because they didn't actually build the thing.
7:03
They observed it being built and then relayed it to their audience and most people haven't done it And that is why things sound different, right?
So anyways, back to the specific knowledge and the difference between bodybuilding and business, right?
And so you have to do the thing well, like training your back well, do the sales well in order for your skill to improve.
7:24
And the way to do that is a lot of times by having somebody who is much better than you teach you how to do it all right.
Because unfortunately the academic system that exists sucks.
And so we have to pay or learn in other ways.
And I think you can either go to a company and learn those skills, specific knowledge from doing it or you can or you can do it yourself, right?
7:43
Like, I like the idea of getting earning while you learn, right?
Go to a company, get paid to learn, right.
I think it's like one of the best things in the entire world.
My 18 year old are now 19 because he's graduated.
You know, he's grown up.
One year, my 19 year old neighbor really wanted to learn how to sell.
And he was like, how do I learn how to sell?
I was like, why don't you just start working on our sales team and I'll like, you'll learn how to sell.
8:01
He was like, OK, and now, you know a year later he's, he's one of our he went through three ranks of salespeople, of sales positions in our companies, got promoted twice and so and now he's a really good salesman and she couldn't suffer crap like a year ago, right?
And he learned the skill by doing it right.
8:16
And now he can teach the skill because he's done it right.
And so anyways, back to the back to the thing.
So a lot of people try and do things too fast, right?
You gotta feel it just like in bodybuilding, like you have to, you have to do it with the specific intention behind it.
So, so many people go through the motions and they think they're marketing, They think they're marketing, but really what they're doing is they're like, no, no, we we do the marketing, we do the, we do that stuff, right?
8:40
No, no.
I do some of that back stuff.
I do some of that stuff, right.
So these similarities between the two, because people think they're executing, but they're actually not.
And then they wonder why they look the same or why their business is the same level as it was when they start it, right?
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
9:00
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can out more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can.
Rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I has to do is you can just leave review.
9:17
It'll take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world with someone else.
And so let me transition to one of the most important points that we hit on, which is that for bodybuilding and business, nothing replaces hunger, nothing replaces fanaticism.
9:35
And I think this is really interesting because a lot of people think this is a really good one because I've dealt with a lot of fitness professionals.
They think that they are very disciplined.
They think they're very disciplined.
But I'll tell you what they're not because they like fitness, which is why they do fitness, right?
9:52
And they've done it for a long time because they enjoy doing it, but when it comes to business, they don't enjoy doing it.
And so they are not disciplined because if you were disciplined, you would do it even though you do not enjoy doing it, right.
So they think that they do this thing of fitness because they are disciplined, but it's because they enjoy it and other people do not enjoy it.
10:09
And so they assume because other people do not enjoy it, that because they do it, it means they are disciplined.
And that is not the reality.
They do it because they like it, right?
And so with that, the only people who went in the long term, the only people that, in my observation, who have become super fit right or super successful in bodybuilding our business, are people who can do it for a long time.
10:30
And the best way to do it for a long time is to be obsessed with it is to actually enjoy doing it right.
Because most fitness professionals that I know have been fit for a long time.
They spend their free time reading about fitness.
They spend their free time reading books on nutrition.
They spend their free time trying new exercise selections, like a different training.
You know, philosophies.
10:45
They try all these different things because they love it and they think about it in all their free time.
And so when I think one of the things that that takes to be successful either there's the self-awareness of like if you want to be a have an exceptional physique, right, the way to do it is to like it.
And if you don't like it then you may want to adjust your expectations because you're not going to beat someone who does like it and also works that long.
11:07
And so to the same degree in business, if you're like, let's say in fitness and you wanted to get in business and mind you, this is not a channel for fitness business stuff.
But if you, if you were in that shoe and you wanted to be good at business, but you just don't spend your time reading about it and you don't spend your waking time thinking about it, you're not always reinvesting because all you want to do is just consume more information on business, then you're not going to beat someone who does, right?
11:30
Because they're, they're beating you in their off time, they're working 16 hours a day, high quality effort because they love it and they're fanatical about it.
And so if you were a technician of any kind and you don't love business, then the likely that you're going to be very good at business is very low.
And so I think people need to adjust their expectations.
11:46
You can be a technician to make $200,000 a year and that's totally fine.
That's totally OK Just be really good at the thing that you do.
You don't need to be good at business, right, But you need to, you need to adjust your expectations in thinking, well, I've been in business for however long I've been going to the gym, working my back for however long and not doing it right because you don't spend any time thinking about it right.
12:06
But if you spend your time thinking about all day long, you will eventually correct your form.
You will eventually do it right.
You will seek out the mentors and people that you need who can actually get you unstuck, right.
So one of the last points that I figured out for myself is I actually have different working styles in business than I do in fitness.
12:25
So this is kind of interesting.
So hear me out.
So in fitness, and this has taken me now 17 years to figure out, is that I actually like working out with people.
Not necessarily with them, but in an environment where there are other people are.
Because my whole life I was like, man, I want to have the sickest home gym of all time.
12:41
And now that I have the sickest home gym of all time, for those who don't know if we have like a ridiculous home gym, I'll just put it that way.
I actually realized that I enjoy going to a $24.00 a month large box gym that has all the equipment and other people around me.
I train harder, I train longer when there are other people around me, and I think that's just because I'm insecure or I have, you know, the tendencies towards insecurities.
13:03
And I like going to the gym and proving myself and proving in front of other people that I can still work hard when I'm alone.
I have significantly less motivation to do so.
But here's what's interesting.
The flip side is that in business I work better alone.
I work better in isolation, right with no one around me, and I think that it's important to figure out what your motivator is like.
13:22
I love business and I'm intrinsically motivated to do it because I love it.
All I do all day long is think about business all day long and when I when I work out, I have an extrinsic motivator.
So if you could think to yourself like, what is my intrinsic motivation for or what is what is my motivator?
13:38
And this is funny for me because I just figured this out, like I have this home gym, and since pretty much I opened my first gym in 2013, right?
Since then I've always had a gym that I owned that I would work out it and it was always alone.
And my motivation for fitness pretty much dropped in 2013.
13:54
So now now I have discipline as a character trait.
So I'll continue to workout, but not nearly as hard as I used to and I used to like really look forward to it.
And I and I haven't really looked forward to it for a long time, right.
But now as I as I'm traveling more, I'm working out in other gyms.
14:09
And I'm realizing that I actually look forward to going to other gyms more than I look forward to going to my own gym, which I thought was really interesting.
So I figured I would just share that with you.
So to bring to bring this home, I want to hammer.
I want to hammer the the the big points that I think matter most.
All right.
The first thing is the people who like the thing are the ones who are going to succeed in the long term.
14:24
If you don't like the thing, you're never going to win because you're not going to be someone who does like the thing, period.
Right.
Two, if you want to advance faster, then find somebody who has specific knowledge in the thing, whether it's business or bodybuilding, you have to do it right in order to make progress. #3 consistency will always beat intensity.
14:42
So if you're really, you're like, hey man, I've done 100 reach out, I got this one the other day.
Someone's like, hey man, I did your rule of 100 and over the last eight weeks I did 160 reach outs.
I was like, well, you're about 9000 to reach out short.
So you didn't do the rule of 100.
The rule 100 is 100 every day, not 160 / 8 weeks.
14:59
Hmm, right.
And so you can't just be intense for a tiny period and then expect it to work.
It's like you have to go to the gym every day.
You have to go.
You have to put the reps in for your outbound calls or outbound reach outs or making 100 ads or whatever it is every single day.
And you have to do it for a long time because then you'll get better, right?
15:16
#4 The people who who are intrinsically motivated, I think will work better on their own.
People are extrinsically motivated, work better in in areas where they can show off.
So if you like that, then join the masterminds.
Join the groups where you can show off.
15:32
I'm going to be real with you.
Everybody cares about what everyone else thinks.
I don't care what anyone says, right?
And so if you have that deficiency like I do, crippling insecurity, then try and try and harness the insecurity to help you, help it help you right, rather than have it hurt you.
And then finally, just like bodybuilding and business, there's always going to be weak links in your game, right?
15:52
Weak links in your physique.
You can be really good at sales, you can be really good at benching, right?
You can be really good at one thing.
But in order for the business overall to succeed, you have to fix the weak link.
And it either means you need to learn how to do it or you need to define who already has that skill and can fix it within your business for you so that your overall physique or your overall business itself is balanced.
16:15
So I hope you found this valuable.
Who found this interesting?
I thought it was a great conversation I was having with a good friend of mine who's also really interested in fitness and business.
And we were talking about the similarities.
And last one is that if you're a, if you're a fitness professional and you are and you're not making money, it's not because you are so disciplined in fitness.
16:32
You're really good at fitness because you like fitness.
And so the key is to figure out how to like business in order to be good at it, because that's the only way you're going to do it for a long enough period of time and be consistent with it.
So anyways, keeping awesome.
And the last thing you know, what I'll add this last piece in last piece is that most people think in months when the people who win think in years.
16:52
If you want to have a champion physique, you want to look like you're absolutely, ridiculously in shape.
It doesn't take months.
It takes years if you want to have the business.
This is my opinion.
That is what you want it to be.
It's not going to take months.
It takes years.
And if you look up after six months or nine months or two years and you're like, I'm not where I want to be, First off, I'm not where I want to be either.
17:10
So that's not going to change, right?
But if you feel like you're not making the progress, that's proportional.
It's always a hockey stick, right?
There's always the years of eating crap for a long period of time and then everything starts taking off because you put all the pieces together and unlike A physique because you have your body whether it's bad or not right.
17:29
In business it works a lot like a pipeline in that if you can get leads but you can't sell, you don't have a business.
If you can get leads and you can sell but you can't fulfill, then like it's very like you have to hit each one of the the steps in the pipeline in order for the business to grow.
And once all of those things are right, then you add more in the front and then the whole thing grows.
17:45
And just like bodybuilding, once your whole body is is balanced, now you add more volume and then the whole thing grows.








0:00
If you understand the steps that I'm about to share with you in this video, you will be able to step by step create a fortune.
If you don't know who I am, I crossed $100 million in net worth when I was 32.
We have a portfolio at acquisition.com that is $200 million a year.
It can be way too long to learn how fortunes are built.
0:15
If you imagine the amount of people that you have sold in your lifetime and whatever business you have, whatever it is, side hustles, gigs, anything, and you were to instead add up all of them together and then they continue to pay you month over month over month at whatever price you sell stuff at.
How much bigger would your business be if it were mine?
0:33
A lot bigger.
My first big business was called Gym Launch.
Gym Launch to date has 5000 brick and mortar gyms that have purchased the licensing from it.
If I had five thousand of those gyms still paying right now, that company would be worth over a billion dollars.
That company is probably worth now close to about 100 million.
0:50
So I've missed out on about $900 million during my career just from that one company alone because it took me so long to learn what I'm about to share with you.
The big problem that most people have when they are starting their business is that they are in the selling business, not in the reorder business.
They don't have recurring revenue.
1:07
They have one time sales and you see these merch drops and these things where people are just selling crap and they get the one time purchase and no one buys.
Again, the reason they can't make money is because they have no compounding vehicle.
What that means is that if I sell somebody today, I want to get credit for that person that I sold today in a year.
1:24
Because what happens is, if you don't have that, then you're always selling for tomorrow.
You're always selling for the paycheck this month.
You're always selling to pay rent rather than benefiting from a sale you made ten years ago and having that person still pay you today.
Because The thing is that you need to harness time.
The people who understand wealth understand time.
1:41
If time is a liability against you, it means you were thinking like a poor person.
For the wealthy, time becomes an asset because the longer you wait, the more you win.
If you imagine a business as a wall of glue and you're blowing people at it, if you never even increase the amount of people you sell, let's just say you sell one person a week.
2:01
In 10 years you'd have 500 customers every month who pay you.
And if you have any price point that is reasonable, that is a lot of money.
That is a fortune.
And the reason people don't have that happen is because they don't get it and they're only thinking about the short sale for tomorrow.
2:16
The easiest question that I like to ask when we're analyzing one of the businesses that we're thinking about purchasing and Is there a way that we can get someone to buy this and never stop paying for it?
Is there a way that we can make this so good the moment their card changes or they get a new credit card, they call us ahead of time because they don't want to stop receiving value?
2:33
If your phone gets changed, your phone carrier, and your credit card goes out, what do you do?
You call your phone carried, you replace it because the value is there.
If your credit card goes out, what do you call Netflix?
You're gonna make sure that your car goes through.
If your utilities go out because your card doesn't go through, you fucking pay it.
If your rent doesn't go through, you make sure that it's paid on time because these are things you cannot live without.
2:53
The goal is to figure out a way to make our value so high that people don't want to stop paying.
You want to be in the reorder, not the order business.
There are recurring revenue businesses and reoccurring revenue.
So this applies whether you have a subscription business or you have a one time purchase business.
3:09
The point is that people come back.
Facebook is a massive company.
They do not have a recurring revenue model.
They have a reoccurring revenue model, meaning I go to the Facebook store today, I buy some eyeballs and tomorrow I might go back again and buy more eyeballs.
3:25
I don't have a subscription, but I reorder over and over and over again.
The question that I ask the portfolio companies and we're trying to grow them early on and really get the product to be exceptional is if tomorrow you could not market anything, you could not get any new customers whatsoever.
And the only thing you had were the customers you have today and any new customer that you get could only come from referral and word of mouth of the people you have right now.
3:48
How differently would you treat them?
How different would their experience be?
And how much better would your product be if the only way you could get new customers was them sending new business your way?
When you start thinking like that, you start thinking like the wealthy, not like the poor.
We're always in a rush for the next sale, the next paycheck, because the reality is you don't get customers to make sales, you make sales to get customers.
4:09
It's an important distinction.
We only transact in order to create the relationship so that we can have revenue again and again and again.
You want that customer to exist like a node of revenue in your business that pumps money your way month after month after month.
So the big issue is that the stuff that most people sell sucks.
4:26
They're constantly focused on promotion.
They're constantly trying to find the next customer because they haven't confronted.
The real issue is that you're just not that good, and that's OK.
But the problem is that you're not focusing on the hard work which is getting better.
There are three steps that you look at when you're actually trying to scale a business.
You want to go to zero to 1,000,000, make a couple 1,000,000 bucks a year.
4:42
You can just promote and sell shit all day long and never build real well.
For me, I want to build a fortune and the only the only way to build a fortune is to get people to never stop paying you.
If that is our goal, we only need to learn how to promote as much as we just need people to start trying our product.
The point of making the first sales is to get customers.
5:00
The point of those first customers is to give you feedback and you keep getting feedback and not even caring too much about how hard you're marketing.
Because the goal is to get the product and service better and better and better.
And This is why most people can't scale because they start selling a little bit and say oh I should promote even more.
5:17
But the problem is they never fix the product.
They keep selling more and more shit.
And then what happens is if you sell 100 people this month, you have to sell 100 people next month just to maintain.
And then the month after that if you up to 200 new sales a month, then the next month you have to sell 200 just to maintain.
But if you have 10 customers a month and they never leave you in five years, you have 600 customers a month that are paying you only with 10 new customers a month.
5:41
When you get customers who do not leave you, you can afford any marketing you can afford to outspend everyone.
There's a company that we're about to make a huge investment in and right now their lifetime value per customer compared to their competition is 10X.
And their cost to acquire customer is the same as their competition.
6:01
Who's going to win in a bidding auction for who can buy the next customer on Facebook or YouTube or pay for the eyeballs between them and their competitors, but win every time, because when you get that right, everything else is easy.
Step one is you promote just to get people to become customers.
Promote it so that you get the first C, which is consumption.
6:18
The second piece is that actual improvement loop.
What happens is when their business gets hard, when they hit a plateau, when people can't grow anymore, they do one of two things.
They start marketing more, which is crazy.
It means that more people find out about the stuff that you sell that sucks, or they create another product.
6:35
If people don't consume your product, people don't consume your service.
It's not that they're numb nuts.
It means that you suck, means you have created such a difficult experience for someone to interact with.
You made it so difficult for someone to on board that they never even experienced the benefit.
The amount of people that I hear, especially in the in the Internet space who are like these people don't work hard.
6:53
They never follow through.
Does Amazon complain about all the service tickets they get?
No, because they fixed the products.
They spent the time to keep solving problem after problem after problem until there were almost no problems left with the product.
Taking full responsibility and saying you know what, we can make this better.
7:11
The way you do that is through surveying the customers to figure out what you can do better.
Looking at their client experience, looking at the results, seeing if you can make it happen faster, seeing if you can make it happen easier.
Making sure that you've added so much value that there's no one else that they can compare your product to.
7:27
You keep doing the feedback loop on those customers until you get a product where people are referring business to you to add the cherry and sprinkle on top.
You make it harder to leave and if you're in a B to B situation, you want to add in collateral or controlling the money flow.
If you work with Stripe, they probably process your money, they control the money flow.
7:46
They don't worry about decline cards because they collect your money for you upfront.
The person who controls the money has leverage.
And then once you crack that, once you say I'm only going to sell so that I make sales to get customers.
I'm going to continue to improve and iterate the same product over and over and over again until the point where I have so many people who are coming to me because of how good it is.
8:03
Then I'll put gas on it and spend as much money as I can on the market, because now I can outspend everyone in the same marketplace.
I'm making 10 * 100 times more than my competitors because when people buy for me, they don't want to stop.
But most people do in reverse.
They sell as many as they possibly can, burn all the good will they have, and then come out with another product, put a lots of hype around it, sell a bunch of them, and then do it again and again.
8:27
But they cannot build a compounding vehicle of enterprise value.
Because if every single launch, if every single customer that they had sold for the last 10 years, we're still paying them today, they would have more money to know what to do it.
It's not about the prices in an absolute term.
It's all relative to the value that someone receives.
So if someone's price is here and the value delivers here, you can make this price whatever you want.
8:46
If this price is a million and they get 10 million of value, they will pay you for it.
Price is what you pay.
Value is what you get.
What we want is a customer surplus.
We want an insane deal.
We want a bargain that people do call ahead of time to make sure that they never stop getting built.
The game is saying, hey, I've got a $500,000 house, I'll sell it to you for 50 grand and I learned how to build it for 10.
9:06
Even if you provide more value up front and it's less profitable, that's because then through the iterations that you have of getting better, you get more and more efficient and you can drive down your costs while also increasing the value and maintaining your brand and reputation.
This lesson took me 7 years to really internalize because when I looked back at my own customer list and I saw 5000 locations on there.







0:00
And you ignore everybody who tells you that you're wrong and tells you that you're not going to get there.
And most of all, you ignore the thoughts that you were telling yourself about why you're not going to get there because you are wrong on a long enough time horizon, if you do the thing.
And so if you do that, it becomes unreasonable that you won't succeed.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:25
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Moving on to the the the you know the obviously the business side of things is phenomenal man.
But were you training and doing that process because obviously we our view was a spread in in into different categories on the podcast.
We have people who obviously big big into the business, the branding and everything else.
0:43
But obviously the there's a big element of athletes and followers too.
During this process were you still committing yourself to the gym was that like a an element of stress view to to get it out in the gym or you know I wish I could say that cuz I feel like that's the common narrative for most people.
1:04
But I would say that I really enjoyed fitness for the first seven years until I opened a gym and then and then it became it literally went from being my passion to being like work.
I actually had a mentor tell me he said never never monetize your passion.
He's like cuz it becomes work.
And I thought that was kind of interesting.
1:19
Cuz it's kind of the opposite of what everyone says.
It's just an it's just a he just owned a bunch of chains of businesses.
He's like, he's like I go and hang out with my kids and I go surfing.
He's like, I'm not going to build a business out of that.
He's like it would just ruin my day.
Yeah.
And it's just kind of, it was just an interesting perspective.
But for me, you know when I had the gym training was required to look like a gym owner.
1:41
So I just kind of saw it as the job.
I stopped competing the moment I started the gym.
Yeah.
And I would say, I mean I'm I'm at 19 years training, can't wait to cross the 20 year club.
But I think the longest time I ever took off from training was six weeks.
1:58
And so like I would say I definitely go, I see things in seasons.
It's probably the easiest way to think about it.
So I've got seasons of relationship building with Layla, I've got seasons of physique stuff, I've got seasons of work business wise and I think of it as like what's the minimum effective dose to not go backwards.
2:16
And so I was talking to Stan Effing about this actually.
And he was like, you know, you use like you have a, you have a passive, you have a passive body.
Now, right.
Like I can maintain this on five percent, 10% of the effort that I did to get here.
And so I think it's actually an interesting thing about like investments that way.
2:33
It's like you, you, you, you work, you work you work you, you you store up this, this nut or whatever and then you invest it.
And then at a certain point the passive off of that, you don't need to work as much active.
Now if you work active too, then it's even better, right?
But that's where the analogy breaks compared to your physique.
But, but for me, I worked out the entire time I work out now, probably because I've always worked out and it's just more of an identity thing than it is something that I look forward to.
3:00
If I train on my own, I don't look forward to it.
I not that I hate it, I just, it just is.
It's like running an errand.
Yeah.
So I work out usually like two or three times a week.
If it's just me.
If I have people that I'm training with, then I'll usually that I look forward to.
3:16
So when I look at my life backwards on the times that I was the happiest, it's when I have a few guys that I'm training with on a regular basis.
No time cap for the training session and I've got two or three hours and I can shoot the shit, hit the heavy sets, get into it, banter between sets.
3:35
That's when I a grow the most.
But I just like, I enjoy training that way.
If I have to just go in there on my own and headphones and that, like, I'll get it done.
But I don't enjoy it the same way.
I can attest that that's what I'm at right now.
And you know, obviously I had a training partner who's just left to go to Florida.
3:52
Yeah, I'm not supposed to be swearing on this podcast.
I've been told to off.
Oh really?
Yeah, so left me for Florida.
But yeah, he just he's just gone and laughed again.
Listen, and I've said this to many of my friends, How can I preach about chasing your dreams and then tell my friend it's like not selfishly you need to stay.
4:14
Yeah.
And help me with mine.
So he's he's gone off and and he's well into MMA right now and he's gone and he's he's doing a lot of different things on the on that side of the coast and coincidentally it's in the exact same town I used to live in in Boca Raton.
But to your point.
4:31
And I look forward to training with him.
I had no, you know, end cap other than me meeting up at a certain time again the session and and then it was part of my day.
Right now I come in and I get so much distractions.
So no, my distraction is grow my business.
4:49
So I come in here.
I actually start my day at 4:00 AM every morning, and that four was that I've gained.
In comparison to shit, you know and I'm I'm already like 4-4 hours ahead of I said before I even step in the office.
So that distraction right now I allowed to you know walk into whatever.
5:08
But how do you stay focused on on with having so many different distractions, even text messages with flexi, which ones can you return?
The six hours thing is like if I look at the the biggest productivity hacks that have served me in my life by far, waking up early to begin work #1 #2, not having any meetings until noon.
5:33
If I if someone just did those two things, like if you wake up, I don't start working at 4:00, I'll probably start working around 6:00.
So I'll wake up at 5, have a cup of coffee with Layla, hang out, whatever.
At 6:00, I start working from 6:00 to noon.
It's like I get six hours every day of moving things forward.
5:51
And it's like the deep work, in my opinion, that gets the ball rolling, that makes things happen.
And then I still have to put out fires the second-half of the day, but that, like if you, Jerry Seinfeld had two hours every day that he blocked for writing.
And his one rule for that habit was that he didn't have to write, but he couldn't do anything else.
6:11
So he's like, I can sit there bored, but I can't do I can write or I can do nothing else.
Non compromise.
Right.
Every day.
And so I think to that same degree, it's like I usually know what I'm.
I mean, I have a list of like two or three things that I put the night before and then like that's what I try and get done in those six hours.
6:29
And sometimes it's a big thing.
You know what I mean?
Like finish book like, OK, you know what I mean?
But it's like, all right, what do I need to do tomorrow?
Like I'm going to fully edit this one chapter.
Great.
That's the big like today it was fully edit this one chapter, create cash flow projections for an investment that we're going to make and pencil have different scenarios.
6:48
And then there was a third thing I did, but I did that today and then I did in the book, right.
And so those were like, there's the things that I that I did this morning and then I came here.
Do you preplan you day the night before?
Not in the way that most people.
I mean, like, I literally have like an e-mail to myself that has the three things that I wanted to do and I don't like, say, like it has to be 3.
7:07
If it's just one, it's 10 and I made the, I mean two new forms for the landing page that I wanted to test.
Out all probably had to jump in on this podcast today.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But that's it.
I mean, like, that's it.
And sometimes just one thing.
I just want to make sure that I have something that I'm going to be working on.
Otherwise I just feel like I waste my morning and I don't like that.
7:25
Yeah.
So your morning obviously is comparable to other you know some some people started there for there's this like you said, you know the, you mentioned the.
PJ cold plants, right?
That putting yourself through that I'm putting myself through this early wake up because I I feel like it's been so beneficial for me to get up this really.
7:44
Obviously for me.
I've got two kids too.
Yeah, the kids don't get up until maybe six.
Yeah, well if you hear me going crazy downstairs in the kitchen making hell of a noise, that up before that.
But that is the time that I get to myself, which I used to have going to bed late, but when I found was going to bed late.
8:06
And I would go to bed, say like 2-3, sometimes 4:00 in the morning, all you would be getting up.
I know.
Two hours after that, and we didn't have our time.
It felt like we were living in the same house.
We worked together, but we didn't have our time.
So now we're kind of on the same schedule.
8:22
But she's an early wiser.
I was never an early bird.
I forced myself into this process.
I know, can't wait.
It's just actually trying to shut off is my issue.
I have so much shit going through your brain.
In my so my brain at night.
8:38
But now I've I've taught myself these new patterns to stay away from.
Certain things don't get stimulated by XYZ and what I was finding was at night I was so distracted, even though I was on my tasks, I was getting so distracted and I trained myself in a loophole and a tonel of nonsense.
8:59
At 4:00 AM, when I get up, I know what I'm doing.
Obviously, the the stock market is going up and crazy and I'm getting all kinds of messages from international to with all my businesses international.
So it's everything that's kind of tied itself well to me, you know, serving myself at that 4:00 AM mark.
9:16
And as I said, the time that I get your, I can just, you know, attack what I need to be doing here.
So what I deal with four hours prior to that is not the gym stuff when I come in here, It's all gym stuff and.
Whatever else is going to walk today as you know it's it's to circle back to what we were saying earlier about like seasons, right, where you know I think I think defining that if I'm in a season of doing deals which right now we're in that season and so we call this a season of no.
9:47
And so it basically means that we don't do, we don't say yes to anything.
And you know the the, I'll say this, take this the way I mean it to the audience, the the the more success we get, the more you know, accolades, fame, whatever you want to call it, the more amount of people try and take time from you.
And so a season of no is not doing things that you probably didn't want to do.
10:07
It's actually not doing things that you kind of wanted to do.
And so I'm turning down things that I would probably otherwise accept in terms of like speaking things and and whatever.
And that's what every big business I've had, we Layla and I consciously go through, we look at each other.
10:25
We're like, this is going to be a season of now.
And so we stick to that season until The thing is done.
And that also means that, like, if working out is one of my priorities, it can't, You can't have multiple priorities.
And So what is then the minimum effective dose to keeping it?
10:41
For me, it's two times a week for 45 minutes.
I can keep the muscle mass I have, OK?
That's what I do.
The rest of like some people are like, I do it for stress relief.
I'm.
I'm not.
I mean, sure, it makes me feel better, but I'm not that stressed.
If I'm not working out, people like I have so much more energy.
If I work out, I'm like, you're not working out hard enough.
10:57
Because if I work out, I feel dead after, you know what I mean?
And so it's just looking.
And even even right now it's like our marriage is on maintenance.
We're good.
You know what I mean?
But like that our focus is not the marriage.
Neither of our focus is fitness.
Right now the focus is growing acquisition.com.
11:14
And we've already set kind of like what we want to get done.
And until that's done, we're going to be in a season to know.
How do you, how do you separate yourself from the personal brand to all the other brands that you're working with because you have done an incredible job of scaling yourself.
I mean in the, in the in the number of years that I I've seen you go from you know the the genre you were in to where you are now your your personal brand has grown tremendously and that is very time consuming.
11:43
So with that said, coming off what you just mentioned too.
How do you cut time for that?
So I see the personal brand as part of my responsibility from a business perspective like that is what brings in a lot of the deals that we do as people who saw me on Instagram read the book, you know and then decide to apply it acquisition.com.
12:06
We have a good team and that's where Leila kind of shines.
So we record every 14 days for our content.
And so we usually have a prompts list of things that the team was like, hey, these are some comments that people ask questions about.
Like, can you answer those?
I also tweet a lot because that's like one of the only platforms I like, really actually like, I really like Twitter a lot.
12:26
And so I tweet probably three to five times every day.
And so then I take my tweets and then we get in front of the camera and I just basically explain with more context what the tweet was about in a short format.
And then probably, you know, four of those tweets out of like 30 have like a deeper story to it.
12:44
And so we then make four or five long pieces of content that become podcasts and YouTube videos from that.
And that's just once every 14 days.
And then the rest of the time it's write the book, you know, cash flow projections from a deal.
12:59
You know, hopping on with, you know, doing a diligence call with a, you know, senior leader at a company we're thinking about investing in and seeing like if we think that they're the person who's going to take it to the next level or if we have to start recruiting.
You know, talking to a potential CEO or CEO who we want to recruit into a company to help them scale.
13:17
Like that's kind of the the day-to-day of what it looks like when we're actually trying to grow these businesses.
How?
Many staff do you have, I know and only businesses, no idea right now it's 16 companies but in terms of like employees across all of them, I honestly have no idea.
At Holdco I think we about 25.
13:34
So like our holding company that then helps each of the portfolio companies.
So we have in terms of like, so the okay, since you didn't ask, I'll tell you anyways so.
Here's coming to it.
Yeah, yeah, whatever it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So since.
So here's how, here's how the whole code structured.
We have subject matter experts across departments because typically we operate from the theory of constraint, which is that every single business is not growing because of a single constraint and a system will grow until it is constrained again.
13:59
And so we spend a lot of our time trying to identify what the constraint of the business is and then can we solve it.
Usually if we can and it's in our wheelhouse, then that's what we is the type of business we'd invest in.
Once those people come in, we kind of go a layer deeper.
So it's like, OK, we have, is it a sales problem?
Is it a marketing problem?
Is it a, is it a conversion optimization issue?
14:16
Is it a pricing issue?
Is it a, is it a delivery issue?
Is it customer success?
Is it third party logistic, whatever the problem is, right.
And we have internal experts who have in you know very deep niche expertise around like building and scaling outbound sales teams, building and scaling inbound sales teams, how to create you know video sales letters, how to you know do like CRO optimization, so conversion optimization across pages etcetera.
14:37
And so we'll then figure out what the constraint of the business is.
We'll task one of our internal kind of experts to solve that problem and then that will deconstrain the business and they will continue to grow.
And then the other kind of half I would say of of Holdco for us is recruiting function.
14:55
And so if the way that we think about things is that you find the people and the people build the business and so we find the best people who've already been there done that.
So if we wanted to take a company on that's doing, let's say 10 million a year in top line revenue in whatever mortgage sales, we would go and recruit an operator or ahead of sales or ahead of marketing, whatever, whatever the constraint is of the smaller business from a company that was at 30 or 50 or 100 million in mortgage sales.
15:20
And then we'll recruit that person in place them.
And we have the advantage of 1, the personal brand that we have because we can attract better talent.
But secondly because we are a family office private equity from you know depending how you want to see it, we get a lot more responses to from higher level individuals where you know a normal you know 10 or you know $20 million mortgage company is not like a huge business.
15:39
And so they might not be able to get responses from what we would consider a you know level A or top tier talent.
So that's kind of one of our competitive modes is that we can tactically add value at the operating company level and we can recruit people into those roles and then they interface with Holdco.
15:56
So it's like sales is a problem.
Go find the salesperson, put the salesperson in, who's the director and who's done this before.
And then we take our sales expert and say, here's our playbook, this is how we want you to do it.
And then they implement that within the company.
And then that way the value is actually built in the company rather than at Holdco.
16:16
So like if the holding company was, if all the companies relied on Holdco in order to function, then it would actually make them less valuable because it means that hold code is required to function.
Whereas if you have a company that can stand on 2 feet and grow on its own, then that company in and of itself becomes more valuable.
16:32
And so it's a harder solution, but it's the better long term solution.
And so that's how we build companies.
Dumb.
How do I segue this into something else?
No, I went a little deep on that.
Yeah.
You gotta remember we got some viewers that are just like, you know, but no, no, listen, I'm.
16:51
I'm thinking of the best segue.
And you got my, you got your video over next to me.
How do I segue that into fitness?
No, but one thing that I do want to try to reverse Edmond back slightly, slightly obviously for for guys and girls who are on the first kind of step right.
17:12
So take yourself back to the fitness days on.
You know, you're on that first peg.
Yeah, not on the peg that you just spoke about.
Yeah.
Which is come from time and experience and working with some incredible people and obviously investing knowledge into everything.
17:30
First steps for for any entrepreneur.
Yeah, fitness industry.
Brandon.
Yeah, what advice would that be?
So one thing to one person on one channel.
So a lot of people try and get really cute and try and do lots of things, but zero to 6 figures which is you know is really just sell something to a specific customer on one channel.
17:53
When I say channel, I mean like you learn how to sell through Instagram Dms.
You learn how to make YouTube videos that generates inbound leads.
You learn how to run ads.
You learn how to do cold calls, you learn how to do whatever acquisition that.
You learn how to recruit affiliates, you learn how to create a referral system.
It doesn't really matter what way you do it.
18:09
One method for one specific type of customer with one product.
That is what gets you from zero to 6 figures.
If you want to go from six figure to seven figures, it's doing each of those steps comma consistently because what happens is most people make a sale and then they stop working.
And so it's being able to consistently do the activities that generate the sales.
18:28
If you just do it consistently, then you get to 7 figures.
At that point you usually have to look at a bigger picture in terms of the strategy of the business, which is okay, How can we afford to get even more customers?
So that's usually when you have to add in some sort of back end products to increase the lifetime value of each customer and then I won't get beyond that, but at that point we shouldn't then yeah.
18:49
And then at that point you'll be able to afford to go through other channels to get more customers and that'll that just I'll cap it there that gets you to a million a month and then we'll.
Stop there.
So basically from.
From entry point here, what would be your first step if you lost everything today?
19:08
Yeah, okay, strip everything back down or you're just giving somebody that's just walked into the gym I want to be the next Alex and Mosey.
Yeah, What would be the very first thing that they need to focus on?
Other incredible beer and cops.
First thing I'd say is be you, not me, cuz you're not gonna be me and be me.
19:25
But you know one, get an LLC set up through the LegalZoom to go to take the LLC to bank and get them to give you a bank account.
Step three, set that bank account, hook it up to Stripe or PayPal to get a way to process money.
Step 4, message people with the thing that you are trying to sell and ask them to hop on the phone so that you can sell them the thing.
19:47
Then they will give you their credit card and then you run that card and then you will get money.
And then you and then you do the thing that you said you were going to do in exchange for money.
That is a business.
That is the easiest way that.
That and the most understandable thing I've used from Your Mouth off podcast to be honest even I was on board with that No.
20:05
But again we we have a wide variety of different people are watching you.
We have a lot of young guys you know Aspire and young you know hustlers.
I know that you know you got a video for next to me.
I was.
I had the pleasure of talking him before we jumped on the podcast and you know he obviously put himself in uncomfortable situations until it became comfy and and put himself into you know, LA until.
20:26
Alex and Mosey was hit up and you guys have linked, right?
So again, I love that approach to you know, just turning hot back to front and hustling.
I I got my own story.
I came here 20.
I knew one person that slept so far wanted to be the best in the world.
I put myself all over California until I put myself into the gym when I had my kick twice a day and I was around people that that truly got the best version of me.
20:51
And then I seen the the best version of me and I realized then I could do this.
So you know you got to get beaten down.
You got to be you know and have a an incredible mindset to to focus forward and learn from every mistake that has come.
And for me sitting out in the in in my shoes, I mean, no, obviously I'm not as accomplished in business as as you are.
21:13
You're more accomplished in bodybuilding, but even is different thing.
But again it's it's more more of the the circle of people.
I have a role me know that that I'm I I pick and I learn from you know again if it was came the bodybuilding.
21:31
I've been around the best I I feel like I know everything in that space and there's nothing else for me to achieve in that space.
But what interests me now is the business element is other things that that scared the shit of me, just like being half naked up on stage there.
So now I'm chasing these new goals and these new dreams and again putting myself, as I said another cliche, the same thing again in uncomfortable situations until it become comfy.
21:54
Just like this podcast, right?
This is, this is nothing I ended up you know wanting to aspire to to be kid from wheels with this accent and incredible lisp that I had to work through.
But again, I I get to be around an interview friends and get to hear their stories and and what the common storyline among among everybody I've had on this podcast is nothing's been given easy.
22:20
Everything has come from trials, tribulations, failures and every still admittingly learning from their failures.
No matter how much success they've had, no matter how great their life is, no matter What Car they drive and how big their house is, they're still aspiring to be better every single day.
22:38
And that's when I look at you made that.
That's something I always gravitate and get from you is you're humble, you're driven, you that you live very frivolously, you don't spend on exotic stuff and front and you probably want, if not one of the most, if not the most accomplished person that walks around this gym in business.
23:04
So for me to you man, I'm about it business.
There it goes again see, trying to take away the compliment which I truly love to be honest.
I do love the humility, but but again, I think that that's one of the traits and many traits obviously that I like about being around you.
23:21
You lose me and half a conversation half the time if you honestly if you like me talking about bodybuilding drop sets and this than the other.
But I'm there to a certain point.
But again, with the viewers we have and getting you on this podcast today, I truly hope that you know a lot of these guys and girls that are watching this have taken you know the storyline of of the success story and and not seeing it as this was given to you.
23:47
This is truly earned.
Real quick, guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, showed it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
24:05
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post.
If you do that, you'll mean the world to me, and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
If I can just and 1st off, thank you, I appreciate it.
24:22
It's very nice if you say if I can toss this out for the people who are you know younger or on the on the come up or they're not on the come up but they want to be on the come up One is that you have to figure out what problem you're trying to solve.
So a lot of people start down a career path, you know, even if it's let's say let's say it's bodybuilding right and they haven't actually played it out.
24:43
So my my three favorite questions to ask when we're trying to make a big strategic decision is #1 what problem we're trying to solve. #2 is let's play it out.
And #3 is, which problem do you prefer?
And so if you figure out what problem you're trying to solve, then you are like, OK, well then there's multiple scenarios to solve this problem, so you play out each of them.
24:59
So if someone's like, well, I want to be a bodybuilder, you're like, why?
They're like, well, I wanna make money.
It's like, OK, that's a different problem, right?
And so, like, to be fair, the only way we're gonna make that is like, you're literally number one or top five.
You know that you'll make realish money, right?
Right.
On the flip side, you could probably become an influencer without even stepping on stage and make significantly more money.
25:20
You know what I mean?
If that's the, you know, the the goal.
So it's again what problem we're solving.
Then you play it out and you're like, okay.
Well, now I've now I'm #1.
Now what it's like, well, I wanted to like for me playing it out was like okay.
I'm going to go to Business School, okay.
Then what?
It's like okay.
Well, then I'll get a consulting job that makes me $120,000 a year.
25:37
Okay.
Then what it's like, well, I guess I have to work up the ladder there.
And then eventually I would save enough money to start a business.
I was like.
Well, what if I just did that, if that's what I wanna do.
And so those are three questions I would ask myself.
The second thing is that if you do not know the input output equation for how you're going to be successful, you will not be successful.
25:56
And So what I mean that by that is you have to figure out what primary actions you have to take that will continue to stack up over time.
So for example if I wanted to create a marketing agency or I wanted to sell widgets or whatever it was like, I will need to get customers and so either I will reach out individually to friends and family.
26:14
I will reach out individually to strangers to get them to hop on the phone and buy my thing right?
I will run ads to get it, or I will post content in order to get more customers.
Beyond that, I could get affiliates or I could get referrals to send me people.
26:32
That's it.
Those are the only ways we can get customers.
If you don't know what the input system is there where you're like, OK, I need to do 100 reach outs a day.
I need to make five pieces of content.
I need to.
I need to get 2 affiliate relationships a week.
I need to whatever the input is.
If you don't know what that is, then you're never gonna get there.
26:49
So you have to figure out what problem you're trying to solve.
You have to play it out and then figure out which problem you prefer, and then figure out what your input output equation is to getting what you want.
And then you do it, and you do it as many times as you possibly can and you ignore everybody who tells you that you're wrong and tells you that you're not gonna get there.
And most of all, you ignore the thoughts that you were telling yourself about why you're not gonna get there, because you are wrong.
27:11
On a long enough time horizon, if you do the thing.
And so if you do that, it becomes unreasonable that you won't succeed.
And so I like to create unreasonable equations for myself, which is, if I did this thing every single day for 10 years and I never stopped, would it be unreasonable that I won't be a millionaire?
27:34
If it's unreasonable that I won't be a millionaire or I won't be a billionaire or whatever your number is.
And I'm like, cool, then that's what I need to do.
And so if you haven't figured out your input output equation, which is what I need to do to get the thing, then is the first problem you have to solve.
Once you do that, the rest of it is wake up early, spend the first six hours of your day making your content, doing your reach outs, recruiting affiliates, blah blah, blah, whatever thing it is.
27:56
And then don't let anyone stop you.
And that also means saying no to things that you probably want to do right now, because the people who are further ahead of you have no more time than you do.
They do things differently than you.
And if you fill your time right now.
Every day, which you probably do because you're alive, you do things during the day.
Then it's not about adding more to your plate.
28:13
It's about removing the things on your plate right now that you're wasting your time with.
Repeat that last sentence.
That's incredible.
The people who are richer than you don't do things that you do.
They stop doing things that you are doing.
Because what happens is if you eliminate all of the waste that wasted activity that you have in your life, you will create room for doing the few inputs that matter most.
28:36
And then that's the thing that's gonna get you to where you want to go.
I think that's the problem with a lot of the the younger generation is they're around so much.
They're losing so much time.
I mean, I wish I could tell my younger self stop around, especially on this phone.
I would have gained so much more space and there's so much more yard.
28:53
Is there anything that you would love to change if you had the chance to to get back and time hop?
Not really, because I I like where I am and I wouldn't want to mess with that.
And so I wouldn't want to butterfly effect my way out of not being in the position I'm in.
29:10
So stole the words in my mouth though.
Yeah, I'm good with it.
Evidence happen for a reason.
I say that I repeat the same sentence.
People ask me if there's anything I want to change in the past.
Everything's led me to this point.
Yeah, and I wouldn't want a butterfly effect, anything to him.
Yeah.
29:26
And I think one of the other things is for as a point of encouragement is that you're either you're not getting what you want if you're not where you want to be right if because you're either doing the wrong things.
Or you're doing the right things, but you don't do it enough.
Or you're doing the right things and you haven't done it a long enough, and so you have to figure out which.
29:45
And that's where it's nice to have mentors and people who are ahead of you who can, who can spot it and be like, okay, You're just doing the wrong things, right, straight up.
Or you're doing the right thing the wrong way.
That's possible too.
But if you're doing the right thing, sometimes you just have to give time.
Time.
30:01
If you're like, man, I've been posting on social media, it's like, OK, well, how long?
It's like, well, you know, I I post like once a week and I've been posting for like 3 months.
I'm like, OK, so you've posted 12 times.
We put out 250 pieces of content a week.
You're not like, of course, you're not famous yet, you know what I mean?
30:20
But like, you have to do that first and then you will get better at it because you've done more of it.
And then you try to go to once a day and then try to go to twice a day.
And then you try to figure out what content people like and like.
There's a game to it, and.
Volume or quantity begets quality.
The more you do, the better you get.
And a lot of times people want to be good without doing the work to get good.
30:38
And so you have to suck for a long time until it's unreasonable that you don't suck.
So it's like if I did a 10,000 cold calls, would it be unreasonable that I that I that I suck it.
Would it be unreasonable for me to be good if I did 10,000 cold calls?
The answer is yes, it would be unreasonable.
And so then it's just like, great, go do that and then you'll be good if you if you did, if you worked out every you know.
30:59
If you stuck to your training program and you stuck to your diet program for two years, would it be unreasonable that you make significantly more progress than you made in the last two years?
Of course.
But people do that.
And the real thing, in my opinion, is that people have to figure out why they're not doing something, not what to do.
People hide behind.
31:14
I don't know what to do when you know exactly what to do.
And even even people were trying to lose weight, right?
It's like.
I just don't know how I'm like really.
I'm like stop eating shit and move.
Are you aware of that?
You know that that's probably what you need to do.
Fantastic.
Get directionally correct.
And so when people are early on they try and find the perfect reason or the perfect business when you have no context from which to make a decision or make a judgment and so you have no way of knowing if this is the perfect business or the perfect career path.
31:38
So the only thing you can do is taste and then iterate.
And so I try and get people to at least were younger on who asked me for advice.
I just say like get directionally correct.
So it's like Okay.
I like business.
Whoops.
I like business more than I like this.
Cool.
31:54
Then I'm going to do more stuff in this direction.
Now you're in business.
You're like, I like the creative side more than I like the sales side.
Okay.
Cool.
They start moving in that direction and then when you like, you're not gonna be like, this is the perfect product because every entrepreneur knows that the first business you start is not the last business you'll ever own.
32:12
You learn from the failures of your first business is like, this was wrong with this one.
I'm gonna try and fix that one in my next one and then you'll learn something in your next one, like right now acquisition.com.
I think it's technically like a 16th company that I've started.
Not like acquired, but like started.
So like, of course my first business ever was an online training business.
32:32
First thing I got money for lady wrote me a check, which is a lot of the viewers right now.
Yeah, Lady wrote me a check.
She just asked me for help at the gym, and I met her for lunch and I gave her tips.
And then she just gave me a check.
I didn't sell it.
She was like, here's money.
And I was like, oh, because I could make some money doing this, you know, Like, I had no idea.
So, like, you're not gonna know.
32:48
And the only way to know is to start doing it.
Because even if you listen to podcasts, you read books, you watch seminars, whatever.
The only way the information will actually make sense to you is if you've actually done it.
If you read 20 books on cold calling, you will still learn more in your first 100 cold calls than you learn from every one of the books.
33:08
Now, if you do the 100, or you do 1000 cold calls and then you read 20 books, then you'll have context to apply the information for the next call.
It's like reading about training for a year rather than getting into the gym.
As soon as you're in the gym learning how to periodize, learning how to, you know, set up the whatever it is.
Will make sense to you if you're like, OK, yeah, next time I'm on Aquatic Extension.
33:26
What was Aquatic Extension again?
You've never done one.
You have no idea.
And so people don't do anything because they think they need all of the information.
But if you have all of the information on an opportunity, you're already too late.
It's already passed.
And so you have to operate within the context of the unknown.
33:45
And so a big part of entrepreneurship is operating with incomplete information.
You make the best bet you can and you get directionally correct and then you adjust what you see me as a future for me.
What advice would you give me without putting myself in a very vulnerable situation?
34:02
Yeah, by the way, I can add the shit out of this.
But I would, so honestly, I would follow the first three questions, which is what problem are we solving?
What's the goal?
And then that, like, that's a you thing.
So it's like, what?
What is the goal?
Yeah.
If you're like, I want to be a billionaire, it's like, OK, we have to solve that differently than like I want to make. 10 million this year, I want to make 50 million this year, whatever it is, right.
34:24
I'm just making those numbers up for the audience.
Like once you knew that because the what's interesting about this too is that the goal that you set like there are just you just take different paths.
But if you're like it takes the same amount of time to build a billion dollar thing as it does to take to build a million dollar thing, like that's crazy to think about.
34:44
But it takes sometimes less time, like if you want to build a really successful restaurant.
It it might take you 10 years to get a local, you know, get the local word out, have the good word of mouth maybe open two or three locations like it takes and you're still working 80 hours a week killing yourself versus starting a a fund takes and maybe you work even less time doing that and you make 100 times the money.
35:07
So like picking the right opportunity vehicle a lot of times comes from like what problem are we solving.
So it's like I want to be a millionaire, I want to be a billionaire.
Well, once we get that, then we're just like OK underneath of that.
What are the unique skill sets we have that we can match to the opportunity vehicles available to us?
And then that comes a narrower list.
35:23
OK, well, these are the three highest likelihood things.
Third question, this is going to be a problem with opportunity one.
This is the problem with opportunity 2.
This is the problem with opportunity three, which problem do we prefer?
This one's going to be really hard with hiring lots of people.
This one's going to be really technology driven.
So you have to have, like a really good technical cofounder, or you have to understand software or whatever.
35:40
This one's really marketing heavy, so you're gonna have to make a lot of content.
Which of these three problems that are the hardest parts of this is the one that you'd prefer to tackle?
Well, I think the marketing content's the one that I'd rather tackle.
Great, That's the path.
So we got the, we got the highest leverage opportunity match with our skill set with a problem that we feel confident we can solve.
35:58
And then we just say what are our inputs, what are our outputs?
We do as many inputs as we can and we get there.
I think with my situation is I got so much opportunity in every different direction that I've retired.
It's just picking that one thing and and then just said focusing on that, right.
36:15
Even even with this podcast, right.
Is this, is this the moving forward or is this, you know, kind of distracting me from something else?
I enjoy this.
This is kind of like my this, this to me is nothing that is going to, you know, turn into Joe Rogan, Trust me.
36:33
But I do enjoy having my friends on the podcast and this is what it really is, right?
It's just me talking and getting knowledge out there to my audience, to my to the people who have followed me from.
They get all and you coming into it and also expose them to to your world, to to your to your Youtubes, to your Instagrams and stuff like that.
36:54
So there's a lot of correlation from business into into bodybuilding and and and what not because of the you want something in life, you know you just have to turn your hat back to Frank, go off for it.
You want bigger calves?
Put it in the gym.
Go for it.
37:09
Same with with with any type of business, even to being a better dad, right.
It's just putting effort into something and becoming good at it.
Because you're you're going to fail.
You're going to suck at whatever it is that you're trying to get good at until it becomes secondary for me again.
37:28
I've got a lot of these low hanging fruits that I'm that I'm doing right now and I'm enjoying that.
The the process of chasing them maybe a different if you was to see what I'm doing you probably be like okay flags.
I need a wrong glue into into this like fun no.
37:44
But considering that my my whole world and my whole life was on that shelf for 19 years I feel like this.
I don't have this new abundance of life that I'm chasing and and it's it's it's fun for me to to know be into different you know elements and and and genres I guess.
38:04
I think to answer the original thing, if I were to give my 1-2 cents on it, it would be you need to find another Moby Dick, because right now it's like you're tasting lots of little fish, but you need to find the whale.
I like that.
And I think right now, like, sure you can get some fish on the boat.
Sure, you can eat for a day.
38:19
But it's like, what's the thing that you're going to like, hunt and spend, you know, obsess over?
Because I'll tell a short anecdote.
So there was a guy who?
Who's a say a world class athlete won whatever the Olympic stage was equivalent for for him And we're talking connecting me on with me on Instagram and I got on the phone with him and I was like all right man, so what's going on?
38:44
He's like I need some help with business.
I was like, all right what's up?
And so he started talking.
He's like, Oh yeah, I got this business.
I got this business.
I got this business and I was like how?
And he said he said like 6 different business was on the phone with him and I know he makes significantly less money to me.
So I was like what is happening and?
He was like, oh, I've got like 40 something businesses.
39:00
I was like, geez, what?
And I was like, how do you.
He's like, I have an Excel sheet to keep track of them.
And I was like and he told me what his top line revenue was.
And it was not like, you know, crazy numbers.
And so he did have one brand that I knew of that I liked a lot.
And I was like, if you had a magic wand tomorrow and you got to kill all of the other ones and just grow that one brand.
39:24
How easy would your life be to triple that company?
He was like, my God, I could do that in my sleep.
And I was like, then why don't you.
And so like and after that call a year later he killed he like killed all of the businesses.
He's like, it kept me up.
I kept thinking like I should just be I should be done with these things because it's about.
39:41
So the the equation for success as I see it, or at least getting an outcome is volume times leverage equals output.
And so it's the number of activities times how much you get per activity equals how much you get, right?
And so in the beginning, most people don't do anything, so they don't have anything to multiply to get the output right.
40:01
But once you've learned how to have some level of motivation, whatever where you're working all of the time, which let's say, let's assume a certain level of success or whatever, then the next multiplier, which is still the biggest multiplier, is how much you get back for the work you put in.
So like Warren Buffett, for example, made a trade two years ago for Apple that has now made him $90 billion on one trade.
40:23
And so he had a level of effort, volume that he put in to get a skill, and he made that effort and had tremendous leverage on that thing to get this huge and massive output.
And So what a lot of people don't understand is that leverage is unlimited.
40:40
So you can get a unlimited multiplier on the effort you have if you pick the right activity.
So if you pick the right whale.
Because then if you had, you know, Flex online, the app that has, you know, 20,000 users and they all pay whatever, 20 bucks a month, then OK, well that's a $5,000,000 your business that probably if everyone was sticky and you got more affiliates and whatever, like that might be a $50 million exit business if you XY&Z, right.
41:05
If you compare that to, let's say, I'm taking a bunch of brand endorsement deals where I get little slices of affiliate revenue or something like that, like there's no asset that's being built and it's the same work to do both, but one yields you 10 * 50 times the return of the other one.
41:23
And so if you have your time, which is the only asset that we really can allocate, then you put it and you stack it on the one that has the biggest multiplier effect on the work you're putting in.
And so if you look at all the opportunities that you have on your plate that are approaching you mentor of mindset, if it doesn't have a B next to it, don't bother, right.
41:41
So if it's not gonna make you a billionaire, it's not gonna make you a billion dollars, Alex.
He's like, it's not worth your time.
And so I think if this is made for you, like if you draw a line in the sand and say, like, if it's not gonna make me X, it's not worth my time.
And then that just gives you this very clear litmus test of, like, cool, that kills 90% of my shit.
41:56
And now you've got, let's say, three things left, then it's what problem we're solving.
You know, let's play each of these out.
And then which of the problems would I prefer to solve?
And then you narrow your three to your one, and then you have your whale.
In my head, I'm actually going through this shit right now, by the way.
Yeah, it's the most important decision you can make in your entrepreneurial career.
42:14
What are you going to dedicate the next five to seven to?
Like, I think about it as in season clock.
People want to think about forever, and I think the world changes too fast.
Five years from the AI is going to take over, Who knows?
But like, I can see five years, and So what can I commit five years to?
And if five years from now I haven't hit what I want to hit, Like, I can reassess, but I can commit 60 months to one thing because Microsoft went from zero to one of the biggest companies in the world in seven years.
42:36
Like, you can do anything in five to seven.
And so that's how I see it in terms of entrepreneur seasons.
And so I figured for me as an entrepreneur, I've got maybe like eight seasons in me from beginning to end.
So it's like I got 8 stamps.
42:52
I got to pick.
I got on my ticket until I die.
It's like being really selected about which which card I'm gonna punch, because there's a hundred things we can do, but the one thing that matters most is the pick.
That is a tough thing for me because I've got a lot of picks for everyone and the more successful you are, the more picks you get.
43:12
But on the flip side, if you picked them all, you guarantee you don't get there.
That's what I want, right?
It's like you trying to be like, headed the CrossFit champ, strongman champ, and the bodybuilding champ.
You're not gonna get there.
It's impossible.
And then you ended just being like a mediocre athlete and the outcome is so far below we're getting second place in bodybuilding is if you try to do all three, you wouldn't even place.
43:32
Yeah.
But that's what it's like when you pursue multiple business endeavors at the same time I.
Wouldn't have achieved what I would have achieved if had I had multiple things going on in bodybuilding.
So that that is the again because I've been there.
I understand that analogy.
So right now, I think the me coming out of the blocks with all these things is exciting.
43:51
Yeah, but you just kind of.
Hit me with a Moby Dick across my face.
It's wet whale Dick.
That's not a crossroad.
No.
There you go.
You 2 will find a way of want to demonitization.
They love me.
They love me, don't they?
44:08
Hopefully Alex will pull me out to the YouTube jail.
But but that said and obviously recapping the whole podcast and and you know what I I want to thank you for, you know, coming on you.
And dumbing it down for a lot of my my fans made they know we went off well.
44:27
He went off on a couple of business contents.
Just cut, Just cut the dead.
No, no, no, listen, I, I, I know.
I messaged you prior to coming on the podcast and you were like, we'll talk about anything you want, you know?
And I and I was like, OK, I should have prefaced like let's just try and keep it as.
44:43
As easy and understandable as possible but then again you know I got a wide verse of of people that follow us.
So I'm glad to see and and and you know see in the comment sections what what comes of this because I do have a lot of different followers different genres of people that that are that are following me and and for different reasons.
45:01
Right.
And now we're moving into different sectors like I said that's, you know, I'm trying to find the one as you said.
It's it's great to have guests on like yourself and and you know pick your brain and see where you're at and and get the the true story of success because again a lot of people are just jumping on your platform may have not have seen or heard your you know your story right.
45:26
And I know we kind of just skimmed through a lot of the the the you know the heartaches and happenings and we've kind of gone a little bit all over the place.
I understand, my apologies.
But if there was one part in thing that you could give my viewers.
What would that be?
45:43
Once you pick, just don't stop.
That's it.
Because if you think of life as an infinite game, like the point of the game isn't to finish the game right?
Because that would mean the point of the game would be to die.
So the point of the game is to keep the game going.
And that's the difference between an infinite and a finite game.
45:58
So finite game has known players, two teams, agreed upon rules and a set outcome where it ends.
Infinite Games has known and unknown players no agreed upon rules, and the only point of the game is to keep the game going.
And so if you think about life in that way, whether it's business or health or marriage, the point isn't to win at marriage or win at business or win at health.
46:17
The point is to stay healthy.
The point is to continue your marriage.
The point is to stay in the game of business.
And so the only way you lose in business is quitting.
And so as long as you stay in the game, you have more innings.
You have unlimited innings, unlimited at bats, and so the only way you lose is stopping.
46:34
So don't stop.








0:00
Real quick wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
0:19
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The difference in a million and 100 million is character difference in 100 million and a billion in my opinion.
0:34
We'll see if it works is time.
And so once you have the base skills, then it's really becomes about who the person is.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
0:52
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
What's up, man?
How's it going good man.
I have two questions, sort of, both different topics, but the first one is more lead related.
Struggling to figure out which method is the best method to focus on so I don't feel like I'm wasting my time.
1:14
You know, doing something to try to get leads.
Where you going after the?
Three main avatars would be like tech startups, B to BB to C, SAS and then really any company that has like a custom software.
So there's three ways you can get leads right.
One is you can manually assemble the leads lists.
1:31
The 2nd way is that you can buy leads from brokers and the 3rd way is that you can scrape leads using software.
I usually will start with scraping if I can because it tends to be the cheapest and so I'll use like if you just Google tool for whatever like.
1:46
What you're referring to, Yeah, yeah.
And then I'll take the top four or five of them and I'll run my search for avatars into each of them.
And then I'll take a sample of like let's say 100 or 500 leads of each work all of them, see which ones I get the highest response rate, and then I'll double down on whatever platform got me the highest throughput.
2:03
You're saying which platform gets you the highest response rate that we were referring to, Which lead source?
Yeah.
I mean, in terms of reaching out to the actual lead itself, I reach out on everything.
That sort of ties into next thing.
So one thing I've been thinking about is you know how you talk about to lead with sort of with value offer something essentially for free.
2:19
So that's like a big thing where I'm just like not really sure how to even figure out what we could offer being that like, am I like stepping?
Is this like stuff?
No, you're good.
This, like, I go through this literal step by step process in the book of everything that you're saying.
2:35
So it's like how to figure out what you're going to give the person for free, how to structure it, how to make like here's the script to get replies, all that stuff.
So the good news is the book will solve your problem.
But the best framework that I can use for coming up with things that people will reply to is give them something free that they would normally pay for.
2:51
So rather than be like, I made this amazing thing, But if it's the same free, valuable thing that everyone else gives, then how you know how good is it?
You have to compete by being significantly better.
But if you just do something that normally other people charge for, even on a micro level, and they can ascribe real value to that, people will respond to you and then then you're operating on a you're you're in a way better frame and then you can have a much better conversation.
3:12
The other thing was more like on a personal side.
So if we could just sort of step back when you were sort of going through that you know volatility, have you had like success then big failures and come back up?
In terms of how you, like, structured your life, if you did it all so that you push, put yourself in the best position to where like you're cutting certain people out.
3:32
Maybe you're bringing certain people or that might be even resources for skill development or whatever.
In how do you go about doing that so that you're not doing things that don't really help you move forward and grow long term, big picture.
So it's a it's a really good question because the number one way to change your behaviour is to change your environment.
3:55
So if you change the conditions, you'll behave differently, right?
Like if there's a red light, you act differently than a green light.
And so that's a micro example of how we act.
Like in Baltimore, when I live there, I act differently than when I moved because I had AI had a clean slate.
Like I didn't have to talk to old friends that would treat me a certain way that then I would respond to in the way that I didn't want to.
4:13
Right.
And so first thing from a people perspective, like, I think a lot can be gained from literally just moving 30 minutes away.
Like even if you like I can't move out of, you know, I'm not going to move from Baltimore to California, OK, that's fine.
Just move to the other side of town.
Just get, just get out of the micro environment.
4:29
The second thing that'll then lead to is the people that you will frequent will change, right.
And I think that you'll have to get accustomed or be OK with the fact that you will lose a lot of friends.
And that's not a bad thing because The thing is just like if if all you have in common continues to shrink and shrink and shrink and the only thing you have left to talk about is the past, remember the good old times?
4:49
Remember that time we got so drunk at Rippy's?
You know what I mean?
Like, whatever.
Then, like they're not trying to help you create the future that you are ultimately looking for.
And it just like I will say that as I've gotten, you know, further along in that path, my time to cutting people has just shrank.
Because if I figure if I'm going to cut this person eventually, I might as well cut them now and start enjoying the benefits of of not having them in my life and having all this back.
5:12
And it's like all those times if I have somebody who just keeps inviting me to shit and then making me feel guilty, or if I go out and they're like, why aren't you drinking?
Or like, why aren't you like, oh, he's on another diet.
You know, whatever.
It's just like you're not helped.
Like just asking the question, like, how do you think what you're saying is going to help me?
And if there's like, well, I'm just giving you a hard time.
5:29
It's like, yeah, understood.
How is that going to help me?
It's not.
OK.
So like either change your behavior or I will change it for you, meaning I will just not have you in my life.
The third piece is that I remember there's this video.
I had just opened my 6th location and I was looking to open seven through 10 and I had already mapped out where I was going to be opening them for my for my gyms.
5:50
And I remember I did this Facebook Live and I was like beat up, you know, I mean like I was tired.
I was taking, I was doing 12 hours of days of sales.
So I was taking sales sales from 8:00 to 8:00 everyday and then I would still do the rest of my work before and after that and somehow trying to work out during that period.
I remember saying, what are you willing to give up?
6:06
So I made this live.
It was like, these are all the things I'm giving up now.
So like, these are things that I used to do that I'm not going to be doing anymore.
So I was like, I'm not following the Ravens anymore.
So I was a Baltimore Ravens fan.
I was like, I'm not, I'm not watching football.
I'm not looking at fantasy.
I'm not going to build a team.
I'm just on Sundays.
I need to work.
6:22
Like I can't give the three hour.
I can't do it.
So I gave up football.
I gave up Netflix.
I was like that night time where like normally I like D, you know, decompress.
I was like I don't have time for that right now.
Like I got to process payments, I got process contracts, I got filed with leads and do reminders for the next day.
And so it was changing where I was places wise being OK with the fact that I was going to have a period of a little bit more solitude because as soon as you cut things, you create room to create a vacuum.
6:48
But new people will come in who are like in this world.
And I would recommend just connecting with people online because there's so many, there's some bigger communities of people who are trying to do the same thing online versus wherever you're at locally, right?
And then the third is, it's just like, what are my behaviours?
What are the things I'm going to give up in order?
7:04
Like because you got to make room like you only have 24 hours, right?
So it's like, what are the things that aren't getting me where I want to go?
And The thing is, if you just say, I'm not going to do those positive behaviours will fill the gap.
I think for me it's comes to more maybe a family side of things or like those people I have a different way of dealing with them, their family.
7:23
But like, I don't know how to necessarily navigate that.
So two things.
First off, I have very extreme views on this, so I just take that with a grain of salt that that you will, right if we zoom all the way out, Like, I didn't choose to be born, that was forced on me.
And so like, I don't feel like I owe anyone for that right now.
7:39
That being said, I believe in fair exchange or abundant exchange, meaning like, I'm going to make everybody in my life's life better for being there, but I want them to also make my life better, right?
And so I think the first layer of this is approaching it with absolute candor, which is like, what you would tell me be like, man, my dad, you know, he just treats me like I'm a kid.
7:57
He always brings up these things, like when I was 14 years old.
And he keeps saying, oh, you know, Zeb's got a short temper.
You know, like, my dad says that he's like, you want.
You're such a short temper.
Right.
He's always tell me that.
And so you have to reset.
Like, you have to reset that.
Like, these are the rules of engagement.
8:13
Like, if you want me in your life, this is what is required for me, which is like, you cannot speak to me this way.
Like, if you know your, your big uncle grabs you by the neck and he's like, I'm looking a little nugget, you know, whatever.
Something, like, I'm not saying he's doing that, but I'm saying it as an extreme example.
Like, what would you do there?
8:29
You you're like, no.
And it creates, like, it creates a moment where they're like, oh, now they'll then probably try and shake up like, dude, I was just kidding.
It's like, it wasn't funny.
I'd be like, it's just you and me.
And I'm not laughing And it's like, whoa, that's a new tone, right?
8:46
And so, like, you have to reset boundaries, have to reset the rules of engagement.
And then The thing is, is that you have to enforce those, which means that at a certain point you have to decide that I'm going to decrease my communication cadence, I'm going to decrease my proximity to you.
I'm not going to be as I'm not going to be as accessible when you text me, it might take me a couple days to respond, right?
9:06
When you say, hey, you got a minute, I might not have a minute, right.
Like you have to earn that.
And like the fact that you are family gives you more leeway, but not infinite.
And so one of the unfortunate things about family is that we treat family worse than anyone else because we think that we can't lose them.
9:24
And so I reject that notion entirely.
I just, I just don't.
I I believe in treating everyone the same family and stranger and then if I can benefit them, awesome.
And if they can benefit me, awesome.
And then we both keep like loving our relationship because we don't feel like we're owed anything.
9:39
And so that's, that's bi directional though, because that's The thing is if you're going to play this game, in my opinion this is the way I play it, which is that you're like, listen, I don't owe you stuff, but it means I'm also not going to say you owe me anything and like we're starting there.
That's how I approach those things.
9:56
Thanks.
For taking my questions.
Appreciate you bet, Seth.
Appreciate you.
Good luck man.
Hey, Alex, how is that going?
Selena, what's going on?
How?
Do you strike the balance between offering free value to pay offers?
Like when is the perfect time to make that switch?
10:14
So you give until they ask.
Simple as that.
You give and you keep giving and you keep giving and you keep giving until eventually people are like, dude, what else do you have?
Can I get this from you?
Like dude, you've helped me so much.
Like is there.
And what happens is you'll start hearing what different people want from you and then you'll start noticing the common thread and then you can ask permission from your audience of the people that you are providing this value to and be like, hey, if I did something like this, would you guys be interested?
10:40
And then take a take a poll.
Very easy, right?
And if they say lots of them say yes, then it's like now you have permission from the audience to then say, cool, well, I'm going to go spend 3 months building this for you and I'm going to give it to you guys.
Just because you give things away for free does not mean that everything that you do is free.
10:58
We give free stuff in order to get more people interested and earn more trust so that a longer time rising we can convert more people into customers.
A purchase decision is a prediction of future value, right?
Like, I'm going to buy this thing because I believe that after I buy it, I'm going to get in excess of whatever I paid for, right?
11:17
And the best way to increase some, increase someone's conviction that they're going to get value from you in the future is to provided value to them in the present.
And so that's the that's the whole game.
And so I'll give you, I'll give you a different example.
So if I were to go up to 100 people and say, hey, buy my thing, right, I might get one person to buy it because I might have caught them on a good day and they're really struggling, Whatever, right?
11:40
If I go to the same 100 people and say, hey, can I solve one of your problems for free?
More than one person will say yes, maybe 20 people will say yes.
And then from those 20 people, when you crush it for them and then say, hey, by the way, I solved this first problem, you now have another problem that's a better problem, but it's still a problem.
11:58
And I can solve that for you too.
In exchange for money, a way higher percentage of that 20 will now take you up on the offer and then you get half of those 20 to buy your thing and you go from one sale talking to 100 people to 10 sales.
So you can 10X your conversion rate by just adding a level of trust prior to the ask.
12:16
How?
Do you come up with that idea and think about, OK, I'm going to give this for free and you have the idea, You have the idea, honestly, like, OK, I'm going to, I'm going to dive a little.
A level underneath is that you're not accustomed to the level of work that's required like real talk.
You're just not used to it and that's OK.
12:33
My level of output and my understanding of how much work capacity I have has continued to increase over time.
I've put 200 hours into the presentation that I'm going to be giving on Saturday.
Most people don't put 200 hours into their product.
It's just it's just orders of magnitude in terms of difference.
12:50
And so, like, if people saw how much time I put into the things, they wouldn't be surprised by the value they'd be like, well, that makes sense.
He spent 200 hours on actually, I'm a little embarrassed for the guy he spent.
He spent basically five weeks of work hours to make one, you know, 90 minute presentation.
And so I think that if you were to think about, like for you to actually spend legitimately, like working hours, spent 200 hours on making something really good and that doesn't mean making it longer.
13:16
It means making it better and then give that away for free.
And then what happens is that really is good.
People will then share it with other people and then you get double effect.
You get more people to take you up on the free offer and then their friends send you other people.
13:32
There's so much more work that goes into it.
I spent six hours a day for two years on this next book.
I work.
I work from six to noon every day, and then I take my meetings.
I did that every day for two years.
And now I'm releasing the book, right?
13:47
And I feel very confident that it's a good, it's a very good product, right?
And so again, I think my level of work in terms of hours is probably greater than what you're doing.
And I have a lot of stuff going on, right.
But you just have to be able to block the time and say the first four hours of my day, every day for this month are making this thing and I'm going to make you exceptional.
14:07
And The thing is, document you making it, show people how much work you're putting into it.
And then when you do have it, they're like, wow, she really did this.
She didn't just whip up APDF.
That took her a day.
I used to think that a day of like, all right, this took me a whole day.
A whole day in my mind was a long time.
14:23
And the nice thing is that the, the really valuable fruit are right in front of everyone.
It just has a very tall ladder.
So you just have to climb a lot longer than other people will to go pick the fruit.
But it's right in front of you.
You just have to spend way more time making the thing exceptional.
14:40
Which also means that all the other distractions that you're probably distracted on right now, these little side projects, this is me just guessing right now, right?
You have to cut that because what you realize is the amount of work that's required to make something exceptional precludes you from doing multiple things.
Like, you can't do multiple things well.
14:57
You can do one thing exceptionally well, and that means that you have to say no to everything else, yeah.
How do you find that exceptional thing?
Then it's not that you find it, You make it.
The more you do, the better you get, and the more you pull the thread on any of the things that you're interested in, the deeper you'll go on it, because you will get better at it by very the very fact of how much volume you're putting into it.
15:16
So whatever it is that you help people with, the one that makes you the most money right now, ignore everything else.
Ignore the other opportunities and say, like, how do I, how do I make this even easier?
Like, think about the value equation.
How do I get faster for them?
How do I make it less effort for them?
How do I increase their perception of the likelihood that they're going to succeed?
15:34
Which means that, you know what?
I've been offering one product, but I really have 3 avatars.
And so I need to just make this tiny tweak here so that this person and this person and this person will be successful.
Now, if I was going to lean in even more, I'd say just pick one of the three and then exclude the other ones.
Just master a puddle.
15:51
Just be queen of a puddle and then you can be queen of a pond, and then queen of a lake and then queen of a Bay and then queen of an ocean, right?
Like, but you got to start with the puddle because you're like half and half out between different ones.
Figuring out what's my thing that I'm really, really good at and like spend a lot of time on and perfecting that.
16:09
Don't even think the thing that you're really good at, because you might not be that good at anything right now.
And I'm not saying that as a I'm not.
That's not a rat.
I'm just saying like, that's not a dig.
I'm saying do the one that you forget about time while you're doing it and then you will become excellent because you'll be able to actually keep working like you have to solve for.
16:27
What is the thing that I can work the most like?
This amount of work is required to get where you want to go, right?
To be exceptional.
And so then what you solve for is how can I find something that I don't mind doing this much work up but this much work is required no matter what.
And if you do this much work, whether you're you're learning to be the best plumber or the best architect or the best whatever weight loss coach that like if you can do that and forget about time, you'll win.
16:53
When I started on YouTube, I told the guy that was editing my thing.
I said, listen, I'll do, I'll do three videos a week for 10 years I was like and then if we'll measure whether it worked or not, he's like I've literally never had anyone say that.
So like what now?
It's just like you have.
You need a perspective shift.
Thank you so much for the opportunity and thank you so much for the answer.
17:14
Joe, what's up man?
How are we doing?
Alex, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Awesome.
My name is Joe.
I'm in the gym space.
I'm in the brick and border gym space.
The space you move.
I know some stuff about it.
You know some.
Stuff about it.
And I'm one of those guys who read Gym launch a couple years too late.
17:32
I'm a little older, so I made all the same all the mistakes you talk and talked about when I felt like when I read the book, I felt like I was reading deja vu, I was like, Oh my God, all these things happened to me.
So my question to you is.
Me and my business partner Dan are launching a series of semi private personal training studios.
17:50
We're still in that space and we're launching one shortly.
And so using the $100 million leads book that's coming out and some of the stuff from gym launch and $100 million offers, what would you do to launch a Gym R plan every six months for the next few years?
18:08
You know, until we get a number that we're.
Happy with and we keep doing my, my preference, my my preferred model is one of two right now you're already doing one of them so I won't even get into the other one.
But I love the semi private model.
I love that like 300, four, $100 a month price .2 to three times a week.
18:26
I like going after avatars that have a little bit more money specifically because for them, you know, they're not going to not pay during the holidays, you know, I mean like for them they're not going to be like you know, breaking the bank over 300 bucks.
And the nice thing and I think this is, this is I I got this from Rick, Rick Mayo of Alloy.
18:46
That model allows you to get to about 5-6 hundred thousand a year with you know 1200 square feet, 1400 square feet like super small footprint and a single manager who's got maybe 1020% profit share, maybe like 40-50 K base and two helpers, right.
19:03
So it's a very simple lean model, 1 on 6/1 on 8 depending on how you want to do it and you all you have to do is get to 120 ish at the location and it's usually 50% margin.
I mean, I I have over time simplified and simplified the model so that there's just so little operational complexity so that you can scale and because of are you familiar with Dunbar's number.
19:26
Yeah.
So the reason I like this model is that like most micro gyms cap at 1:20 to 1:50 and it's because the systems required to purposely manufacture human connection becomes significantly more complex as you cross that barrier, right.
19:43
And so rather than create this very, very complex machine to make it run at 600, you know service based members, I'd rather just have a model that runs very profitably at 120 to 150 members.
And so lead Gen. perspective #1 is that I would do a three month pre launch #2 is that I would disproportionately spend on the launch.
20:05
So I would, I would put like 30 grand.
Into the pre sales and I would open at full capacity.
The best gym franchises know how to pre sell so that they are in the black in the first month and like every time I opened a new location like is the first location was the one that I didn't learn that I learned.
20:23
Met the lesson on my first one because I thought I was trying to get it open as fast as possible so I can make money but with everyone.
After that I tried to do pre sales as long as possible so I could make all this money and not have to pay any expenses real quick.
Guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram or something like that.
20:44
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
21:03
And so that way you can also focus too because you can just sell for three months, do nothing but work leads and and close contracts and then after that you, I'm sure you're what's your turn right now for semis.
Right now only about 5%, OK.
I mean I I would shoot for three, you know what I mean?
21:21
But five's OK.
You know, if you've got let's let's just say 5, right.
And you got 120 members, it's six members a month.
You got to replace like it's just like it.
It's so easy to replace that and just expect like if if you have and what's your price point monthly about 400, OK, so 400.
21:39
So that's an 8 KLTV, right, in terms of revenue, not profit, but like 8 KLTV.
Like you should be able to spend 500 bucks to a car customer and not even sweat on it.
And so like if you pay up to 100 bucks a lead local so that you can close 20% of those in the contracts.
I'm not saying those are good numbers.
21:56
I'm saying those are exaggeratedly bad numbers.
You'd still be fine, right?
Because even if you had to close 6 customers the month, it's 3 grand a month and adds just to maintain it's nothing now when Jim won't you talk?
About, you know, doing your six week transformation, do you still recommend that as the primary giveaway?
22:13
Because that's all the best.
I mean, the wrapper can change, you know what I mean?
Like, I always call, it's just wrapping paper on the present.
But like, we're still doing nutrition, we're still doing workouts.
So like whether I do, you know, six week, 42 days, 21 days 28 days.
You know, belly fat blast metal metal blog, reset.
22:31
Like you know slim by Halloween, you know, lean by Halloween.
You know what it is slim for Santa.
You know big booty boot cab free six week challenge 42 day detox like a fucking done them all.
Like at the end of the day like all of those are wrappers that you rotate locally just so that your ads don't fatigue.
22:47
But you want to always push it into the same sales process so that the OPS don't change.
So it's like the ad will change and then you get on the phone and you're like, hey, what made you sign up for insert name or promotion?
They're going to be like, well, I'm kind of overweight and you're like, great.
What have you done so far right, and you start going through it.
So my second question is you know with a business partner who you know we have kind of like a different person as we work really great together, 17 years of a great partnership.
23:10
How do we, how do you manage or what would you recommend?
My my preferred mode is.
Take risks.
Scale fast like we have momentum.
We're maxed out in both our other gyms.
We have a great local record, reputation and recognition.
23:25
And I'm like, let's do you know, let's do ten of these in the next like three years.
And he's like lose his mind over it, like he's more of a prove.
IT guy, in your experience, you know what's better.
You know speed or or or prove it.
23:42
You're both right.
A good partnership has a yes man and A and a no man, right?
And so, like, in my dynamic with Layla, it's like I'm yes, she's no right.
And that's basically how everything gets managed if you're up to me.
We jokes like we would have 100 businesses.
If we're up to her, we'd have none.
23:58
He says no because he's knowing how much work it is, right?
Like, if you're the promoter and the, you know, CEO, whatever you want to call it, then there's usually more like strategic works.
There's leadership stuff.
But in terms of like day-to-day, they usually bear the brunt of the work And so it costs more to them.
24:14
It's more painful.
And so I'll I'll give you my advice from what I would do having now worked with an implementer for a long time is I say what would you need to see for us to be for you to feel comfortable with us doing that?
And then she'll say, here's the checklist, If you do these things and you make sure these are the things that are that are done, we can do the next one.
24:32
And then that way we have an agreement.
And it's like and to be clear, if we do the same checklist at location three, you feel good again.
You're like, yeah, I'm good again, if we have these things and so and then you're and then you're aligned and then it's like, cool, let's just keep the party going.
That's perfect.
24:48
Yeah, that's great.
That's great advice.
Thank you so much.
I'm really excited, looking and and grateful for everything you've given after the community of strength for sure.
Appreciate it man.
Thanks, Joe Nicole.
What's up?
I don't know if you can Remember Me.
We met at Eric's.
25:04
Yeah.
Mastermind.
So.
Since then I started a podcast doing pretty well.
I made most of my money as a creator doing brand deals.
So for example I was big in in the crypto space.
The second I started my podcast I had like a six figure deal which coming to an end, I don't think it's going to be renewed.
25:26
Everyone that I, everyone that I talked to is like Nicole, you've grown on all these social pages.
Not just my personal, but like you know other brands that where I'm like curating other people's content and everyone's like it's a no fucking brainer.
Do a newsletter, I talked, I talked to Sahil Bloom for example, you know just sell lads and his and that's his his model.
25:48
But you know, then I also heard you say recently that like subscribers and followers.
Don't really mean anything.
Like they're a vanity metric and you're like the game is now click, retain reward.
What exactly does that look like?
Because I like it's like currently I have nothing to sell you, you're good it's so it's it's it's two separate applications.
26:10
So from the growth perspective, like growing the audience, getting more people to see your stuff like that.
In that world, subscribers, I mean, Tiktok has changed the game in terms of how all the algorithms work, right?
Like right now if you have 10 million subscribers on YouTube, if your next video sucks, it's not going to get views, period.
26:29
Yeah, it works.
Same thing with Instagram.
You see people with 10 million per, you know, 10 million accounts make a post and it's got 300 likes on it, right?
It's because on the flip side though, it's good for new creators because you can come on with 0 followers, make a banging video and get 10 million views, right?
And I I actually think it's a good thing for everyone because it equalizes the playing field and makes content kick like the quality of what you put out which I'm always down to compete on that.
26:53
And so, so that's from the growth perspective from building out a newsletter like one is top of funnel the newsletter subscribers, I mean that like those are customers, you know what I mean?
And so I I'm in no way against having you know a new a, a newsletter of any sort that provides value especially to a niche audience.
27:12
Because a buddy of mine has a ton of data on on subscriber stuff.
And like the ones that do the best in terms of LTV and whatnot are typically hyper niche and high value.
So usually a little bit higher price point, but very specific to like the because they're so niche they can provide an extent like a lot of value to a person versus being like super wide.
27:34
It's very hard to provide tremendous value to everyone, right.
It's kind of like Elon Musk's thing of like you can either provide a little bit of value to a lot of people or a lot of value to a few people.
And so I think if you feel like you're better at a specific niche, I I think it, I think it makes sense for you to go top of funnel is just get really good at making content and then that just converts into your subscriber network, so your your newsletter and then you sell ads to the newsletter if you want to from an endorsement perspective.
27:59
You can also have your own products if you want to, you just become a media business at that point, which is fine.
I mean, I'm, I'm a big fan of media business.
OK.
That's really helpful.
The other question that I had.
Your dynamic is so different than what we've we've seen in like traditional relationships, yet it's still worked and you guys kill it.
28:18
So what what's that dynamic like and how is it different and why do you feel like you guys thrive?
We set out solve a different problem with our relationship.
And so I think that the premise that most people come into the relationship with is different than how Leila and I approach the relationship.
28:36
And I think that's where I think Fundament, like, you know, like when you're solving a business problem, I'm sure you've probably asked this, it's like, what problem are we solving, right?
It's like the first question you're asked is like, what problem are we solving?
And so most people don't even a ask that, but B if they do ask that, they're usually trying to solve a different thing.
28:51
They're like, I want to have lots of romance and this big Hollywood love, which from everything that I know is something that is short lived and then disappears.
And then you are left with someone that you're looking at and you're like, well, shit, what do we have in common, right?
29:07
And so Leila and I had both rode that, that roller coaster multiple times before.
And we're like and we both were at a point where we're like, you know what?
And mind you, I was very, you know, dejected at the time.
When I met her, I was like, listen, I'm not trying to do anything.
I'm trying to build this.
This is what I'm doing.
And the first thirty dates we had were 30 days in a row where after our first date, which we went to frozen yogurt, the next date was not a date.
29:31
I was like, I'm going to be working from 9:00 until I go to sleep.
So if you want to work with me, you can.
And so that was what we did every single day is that I was like, I'm going to be working.
If you've got work, we can work together.
And so it ended up just being somebody that I enjoyed a lot, spending a lot of time with.
29:48
And the romance stuff, honestly, I feel like didn't really like kick in until like 2 1/2 years into our marriage.
And I think that our relationship was based on that.
Like respect was first and then we learned the love part.
It's very hard to learn respect, being hot or being physically attracted to somebody.
30:06
I feel like it's the, it's the ticket of entry.
It's not like I see a lot of successful guys go find the, the Instagram model.
I meet said Instagram model and I'm like, how do you live like this?
Like, I would, I would kill myself if I had to talk to this person every day, right.
And they're like, oh, the secret is I don't talk to them.
30:22
I'm like, that sounds horrible, right?
And so again it's like they were solving a different problem.
And so for me, my goal is always has always been #1 like where I want to go, right.
And having somebody who wants to go that way with you because I was engaged prior to Layla, right.
30:41
Wonderful girl.
But we ultimately ended up deciding to cut it off because we simply had different goals for our lives.
She was like, I want to do this and I was like, I don't want to do that.
And it was like, well what are you going to do?
And we're like maybe you're a great person and I'm a great person.
30:56
We're just not necessarily like meant to be.
And that's OK because I think on some level like we say these things like non negotiables, but then we negotiate And so it's like either it's a non negotiable or it is negotiable.
And for me it's like where I want to go is non negotiable.
So it's like I have these goals, which is where I want to go, my values, which is how I want to get there.
31:14
And then lifestyle, which is what are my interests, right.
And if I can find somebody who wants to go the same place the same way and have and likes doing the day-to-day the same way as me, then I'm good.
Like the fact that Layla was into fitness was like great.
I go to the gym too.
You go to the gym like it's not going to be weird.
You're not going to be like, oh, I don't want to, you know, like she's in the same mindset of that, right.
31:31
If I'm like, hey, I want to go invest in this workshop or something, she's not going to be like, I can't believe we're spending $10,000 on this.
It's like that that person who say that is not my partner.
And I think in terms of me being the guy telling you what, like the number one thing that attracted me about Layla was that Layla never tried to change me.
31:51
If you want to do big things, then whoever is going to come along with you has to be equally big as a person.
And I think a lot of people settle for a $45,000 employee.
I mean, and you can even it's if someone in the reverse, if I were you and someone's like, man, I'm looking for a wife and I'd be like, what are you looking for out of a wife?
32:11
Like real talk, like, not politically correct.
Like what are you actually looking for?
And so then if they're like, man, I love it, someone cooked and cleaned and and fed me and and and washed my clothes and ironed and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you're like, OK, question.
If I paid someone $45,000 a year to do that professionally, then we would our relationship pay because that that's an expense, you know what I mean?
32:33
Like that we can just write the check and like all those things are solved.
So like, now what?
Hey Andy, what's up man?
What is that Mister Alex Hermozi.
OK.
So question I have for you.
I've heard you talk a lot about investing in the S&P ME and so the S&P index like the ME 500, right?
32:51
What would you say with those skill acquisitions?
Like which skills and in what order would you suggest maybe a person to go through because that kind of ties into your skill stacking.
Is the methodical way that you think this naturally ascends to the next one.
I would think about it from the order of how you would actually make money.
So it's like, well, I have to have something to sell, right?
33:10
So you have to have some sort of base skill that you could sell if you're going to get into services or have some sort of base product, right, once you know how to do that.
So like if you're getting an e-commerce, you have to build a store, talk to manufacturers, make the thing that you're going to sell step one on the services side, it'd be like, what's the key skill that I'm going to acquire to show people how to do it.
33:28
And you can acquire that skill by like working a job, buying a certification, going through a course, going to a workshop.
Like I learned, I learned how to run Facebook ads at a workshop.
You know what I mean?
It cost me 3 grand at the other workshop.
I know how to run Facebook ads and so, and that $3000 has made me many more than $3000 over there.
33:45
It's my career.
So point being, first thing you start with the thing, right.
The second thing you're going to do is that you have to focus on promotion.
So it's going to be advertising.
And if you think about this is the order I did the books right offers is what answers the question, what do I sell and leads answers the question who do I sell it to, right.
34:02
So like once you have the thing then you got to go sell the thing and let people know about it and you have to advertise and so that is that is that would be the second big skill stack.
The third one would be conversion, which is like kind of persuasion, so sales.
And there's different ways you can do it.
So like you could learn how to build, you know, shopping pages in e-commerce that convert.
34:19
You could take phone sales, you can learn how to to pitch and make VSLS, all of those things.
And then finally, if you want to like learn, the next piece would be leadership and operations, because then you're going to have to hire people to help you out.
With the the calibre people you work with and the different levels that they're at, has there been anything that you would say maybe is the common one or two missing principles that most business owners are not doing or if it may be questions that they're not quite asking that you see like?
34:42
Sometimes if you're only going to do like the one or two things, not that they're not all one, what are they?
Yeah, so I I just did a tweet the other day.
But like the difference between, you know, 1000 and a million is skills, right?
The difference between a million and 100 million is character difference in 100 million and a billion, in my opinion.
35:00
We'll see if it works is time.
And so once you have the base skills, then it's really becomes about who the person is.
And so as you scale up, the speed of scaling often correlates with the speed of talent recruitment.
Because if you are a shitty person or shitty boss or bad leader, or can't have cast division or can't explain why this is going to benefit a lot of people, not just inside the business but also outside the business, then you're not going to get the best people.
35:25
And if you don't have the best people, you have to work overtime.
And then you never really are able to pull yourself out of the business.
And so you can measure the, you know, the size and the scalability of the company by the talent that they can attract.
Like there's a reason that Google and meta and Goldman Sachs and all of these ones pull from all the Harvard, you know, all the Ivy League schools and all that stuff.
35:44
And you know we make fun of those people, but they also make all of the money.
And so it's because they go, they have a brand and they have a huge pipeline of training that they train people on.
And people also know that when they go to that brand, Goldman Sachs, Mckinzie, whatever, that they're going to be able to go and do whatever they want afterwards.
36:01
And so like what happens is you realize that there's a 2 sided funnel, right?
So on one side you have to learn how to attract customers, but on the other side you have to learn how to attract talent.
Because if you just only know how to attract customers, that everything always breaks and you can never get over the hump and you can never scale.
36:17
Brilliant.
Brilliant.
Dude, man.
Well man, thank you for reaching back and helping all of us go forward and taking the shortcut.
How would you approach?
Creating strategies to generate leads and cultivate enduring customer relationships in this rapidly evolving enterprise B to B landscape, right.
36:38
When I say enterprise, let me clarify.
I'm speaking to Fortune 500, Global 2000 type organizations.
I'll tell you two very different things.
On one hand, I've got a buddy who sells only to Fortune 100 and he was telling me that one of the most profitable strategies was hiring people from the Fortune 100 in the departments that they're trying to get on board.
37:02
And then they hire them and they already have all the sway, all the influence, all the know, all the know how and then they can bring that account with them.
And then the majority of their revenue actually just comes from cross selling all the different markets that those people are at, right.
37:18
So it's like, OK, I had to start with you know, Google Southwest, whatever, right.
And then I, and then I'm moving on to Google Mexico, Google Latam or whatever, right.
And so those are the two biggest areas of expansion from that perspective.
In terms of the Legion, like, I don't think the Legion really changes very much.
37:36
I think more or less it's just how quickly can I involve as many stakeholders as possible and make sure that my pitch is oriented to them looking good and them having no risk in terms of their job.
It's like here's my path to you getting promoted in a raise and here's there's no downside.
37:53
Like it's all about them, you know what I mean?
But I think, I think part of it is like and I'm, I'm assuming you're a leader in the company.
I think a lot of it is really getting the Commission breath out of the sales guys and oh this is like I'm getting the tactics.
38:08
But is you know I love the the term bam fam, right.
Book a meeting from a meeting, which is that we never have anyone falling through the cracks.
Like we always know what we're doing to move the ball forward.
And I think some guys get tired or they, I don't want to say lazy, but like, they get tired and they're like, yeah, I'm waiting for a response from that.
38:26
It's like, well, when are, when are you meeting with them?
It's like, well, I'm, I'm waiting for the response.
It's like if you're not, if you're not able to push the ball forward from one meeting to the next, like that in my opinion is a loss.
Like that's it.
That's like a missed sale, even though maybe you could save it, but you can dramatically decrease the pipeline because even setting the frame with the enterprise sale of, listen, normal enterprise sales take 12 months, 18 months, six months depending on the thing that you're selling.
38:52
If you explain to the prospect, you're like listen, it actually doesn't take 12 months.
It takes 48 hours, hours of work, not time.
So if we have 48 one hour meetings to get this done, we can just take that and we can stretch it over two years or we can do it in 3-3 months.
39:11
It's really up to you.
And I think even just setting that breaks a little bit of the like this feels fast kind of language that a lot of like more corporate people will use And then making sure that the bean counters who are approving budget like hey, I'm just being raw, yeah that that that their asses are covered and that they can look good.
39:31
Yeah, for sure.
No, well it's all good feedback my friend.
So just quick follow up question then I'll let you go.
Regarding lead Gen. specific, you know the companies we can compete against, you're very familiar with McKenzie, Boston, Accenture, right.
Seems like a lot of the lead Gen. is based on content, specifically gated content.
39:48
And you know part of your value equation that I really like is you know value on the front end which is kind of difficult at the enterprise level.
Any thoughts there moving forward?
Is that you see that you know, kind of staying the same maintaining?
That I think that's 100%.
Yeah.
I mean, I think it's the same reason McKinsey, for example, puts out all those white papers and Goldman Sachs put all their industry analysis out, right.
40:08
And you opt in, you get it and then they'll follow up with you.
And I think, I mean, in my opinion, this may be an oversimplification, but I'm a simple guy.
Like, I'll, I'll get the name from anywhere in the org that that downloads the thing that's valuable for them.
And then that's where the scripting comes in of the judo of like, hey, you got this thing, what are you getting this thing for?
40:26
Well, we're working on this initiative or whatever.
It's like, well, like what's, you know, you get into, like, you get into sales.
Like, what's the objective?
What are you guys trying to do?
Cool.
Well, who else is involved?
And then you start and then you start moving your way through the org.
So I want to pull the thread from wherever I can.
I'm sorry, get the thread and then just start pulling my way.
40:43
No, that's that's great stuff, man.
I really appreciate it.
Looking forward to the new release on Saturday, man.
Thanks brother.
Appreciate your time.

Real quick, guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ass is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
I'm telling you this right now, it has everything to do.
What's going on in your head?
You have to go through the shit and you have to figure out the stuff that they aren't, figuring out every problem that you encounter instead of running away from it, which is exactly what niche hopping is, exactly what new opportunity hopping is, you have to confront the wealthiest.
0:46
People in the world see business as a game.
This podcast the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
The hope is that you.
Use the.
Lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I want to tell you a story that will hopefully break some of your beliefs and I think will be one of the reasons that you like.
1:07
If you can internalize this story, this may be the way that you could take figures or seven figures, if that is your goal.
When I started in the information marketing agency world, Leila and I were dating.
At that time I had six gyms.
1:23
That I was.
That I owned.
I had gym launch, which was a done for you sales and marketing system where we'd fly out and launch other people's gyms.
And I had a dentist agency where I would generate leads for dentists.
1:41
And I had a chiropractic agency where I generated leads for chiropractors.
And guess what?
I made no money.
And the reason I made no money is because I could not focus on anything.
And So what happened there was I developed an initial set of skills, sales and marketing, and then immediately saw this whole new world of opportunity that was in front of me.
2:05
But what I had not developed yet was the character trait to associate with the skill, which was disciplined and focused.
And because of that, my lack of character, I was not able to reap the rewards for the fruits of the skill set that I had acquired.
And So what ended up happening was probably one of the hardest year and a half's of my life.
2:25
All right, I ended up having I I sold five of the six gyms.
I just shut one of them down.
A partner stole all the money from the sale of those gyms.
I had the gym lunch that started happening, was working, and then all of a sudden we had chargebacks from one of the gyms that I shut down, which then wiped that account clean again.
2:42
All right.
The dentist that I sold.
Did not get results because I did not have a system for them put together.
I just generated leads on a sheet and just told them on calls what they needed to do, and they didn't do it, obviously.
And so I had two dentists that had paid me $10,000 each.
2:57
I had chiropractors that had paid me $10,000 and all that was left is that all of the money that I used, that I'd gotten from that was literally just to pay my bills and eat and do whatever, all right?
And the issue was that I had no focus.
As soon as I see an entrepreneur that comes into my world and they say I have a couple of companies, I immediately know that they are a nuke, that they are a nuke.
3:22
And some of you may be hearing this right now and be like, well, I have a couple of companies.
Cool, you're probably a nuke, all right.
It's very unlikely that you have the ability at this point to have multiple entities.
All right, Like, I'm, I'm telling you this right now.
And so the issue is there are 5 stages that you go through.
3:42
When you are a new.
All right.
And I'm saying this, and if this affects you, I'm purposely doing it this way because I I'm not going to help you unless unless we break some beliefs, All right.
And that's what has to happen.
And for some reason, I'll just make another sheet.
3:59
All right, here's the five stages.
You got one, you got a little up, you got a down, and then you go up higher at the end, All right.
One in the beginning is called uninformed Optimism.
That means you're optimistic about something that's going to happen.
You're excited about the opportunity that's in front of you because you see with your skill set, you imagine how much money you could make and you start doing this math in your head and you put it on excel sheet and you get excel rich and you sell yourself and you talk to your partner and you talk to your parents and you talk to your friends and all you do is get excited, right.
4:28
Your dopamine starts sprawling.
Oh my God, this is going to be amazing.
You make so much money, right?
Then what happens?
You get into it and then you go to here, right?
And right here is called.
Informs.
You now know that it's not as good as you thought because now you have more information.
4:46
You find out that just like every other niche, there's going to be issues, there's going to be constraints.
There's going to be problems, right?
Because guess what?
They all have problems.
And then you go to here.
This is called the valley of despair.
This is where you're in the thick of it.
You can't figure it out.
Or like you're figuring out there's tons of hair all over it.
5:03
And So what do you do?
You jump.
To the next niche and you start all over again and you do the dance.
You say uninformed optimism, informed pessimism, Valley of despair, and you never make it past step three-step three is where you have to go through the shit, right?
5:26
And the only way to get through the shit is to focus.
When you keep going into new niches, you never put your roots deep enough to learn the game, right?
There's a reason it's not Cairo Lodge.
You know, dental lunch and you know, PT lunch and whatever lunch, right?
5:42
There's a reason that we chose not to do that because you can have $100 million dental agency, you can have $100 million Cairo agency, you can have $100 million PT agency.
What you probably can't have is three of them.
And so you have to ask yourself, what is the reason that I think I need to do more niches?
6:03
What's the reason?
Is it because I think that's going to make me more money now?
Why?
Why would it make you more money?
Because wouldn't it be easier to just get more of the customers you already have and could demonstrate results for right?
And so the next two steps of this are now informed optimism.
6:21
Is step four.
What that means is at this point you've gone through the shit and you've figured out the solution right?
And it's starting to work and you're starting to get into a rhythm.
And then all the way up here, #5 is achievement, right?
6:36
And that is where you realize the potential of this new opportunity.
Most people never make it past here, ever.
And depending on the entrepreneur, they can continue to repeat this cycle for years, years and they cannot figure it out.
6:56
It's like the guy that you know who continues to date the same girl.
Identical.
Different chick every time.
But it's the same chick, right?
And they keep going and they keep doing the same mistake over here.
They fall in love that you're really excited and they actually realize they have the relationship and they bail, right?
7:12
And they do the same thing over and over again.
They never get to the part where they can achieve the potential of the relationship.
It's the same thing in business.
And until you learn the skill, you will never get to any figures.
I'm telling you this right now, it has everything to do.
What's going on in your head?
You have to go through the shit and you have to figure out the stuff that they aren't, figuring out every problem that you encounter instead of running away from it.
7:35
Which is exactly what niche hopping is.
Exactly what new opportunity hopping is you have to confront.
You have to face it head on and you have to figure it out, right?
If they can't sell over the phone, you have to figure it out.
You have to make a better script.
You have to make a better training.
You have to do daily calls with them.
7:52
You have to your team, train their team.
You have to think, how many ways can I solve this problem right?
If they're not making enough money, it's because you did not create a mousetrap that was valuable enough for them to extract value from.
And whose fault is that?
It's yours, right?
Hey mozanation, quick break.
8:08
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, so send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with.
Tag them in one of my or Layla's posts and I will give you.
All the love in the world, All right, so let's get back to the show.
8:27
And so just like I'm I'm putting this out there because.
The number one thing I'm seeing right now, and if any guys were on my on my presentation yesterday, the third, the third framework that I introduced was the niche duplication framework, which is how you can repeat this in as many niches as possible.
And I put that in there because I know who I'm talking to right in their minds, the inexperienced mind.
8:49
They think, Oh my God, I made $10,000 in one niche, I could do $10,000 in another niche.
Because they don't even have the belief yet that you can make $1,000,000 a month in a niche.
You can make $10 million a month in a niche.
Right.
You just have to have that belief, all right?
And so, getting to another niche, tell me what problem it solves to double your operational issues, Double the types and number of problems that you have to solve in real time.
9:12
Tell me how that's going to make your life easier.
Explain it to me Making argument to me, right.
Because if the question is I don't, you know, my my niche is super saturated.
Welcome to the fucking world, right?
It's all saturated. 100% of it saturated, right?
And the only way to win is to be better.
9:28
And the way to be better is to stick through the shit is to go through the third step where everyone bails, right?
And on the other side of that is where all of the green grass is.
The green grass is not only other niche, it's not on the other side of the fence.
It's not in the new opportunity.
It's on through going through the manure and digging down and then letting it grow.
9:47
Right.
You got to work the field.
That's how it works.
All right.
And I'm telling you this because I lived it, all right?
I had six gyms, one done for you agency.
And then I had three niches I was serving.
It was impossible.
Same guy.
All right?
Six months later, I cut everything out and just said I'm going all in on gyms.
10:05
And why did I do that?
Because my wife was like, if you don't pick something, she's like, I'm not going to be with you.
And I was like, fuck, all right?
And so maybe some of you need someone.
Maybe you don't have a maybe she has no idea.
Whatever, right?
And so hopefully this can just be a voice to you from your past, right?
10:25
Because I feel like as I'm talking to some of you guys, I just feel like I'm talking to myself, right?
And so I don't want you to make this mistake.
And some of you will keep going around this merry ground over and over and over and over again.
And you will not beat the level until you learn how to unlock the boss.
10:42
Right.
And to put him on his ass, and the way to put him on his ass is not to do more different things, is to do more of the same thing.
It's to get better.
And every entrepreneur wants something that's new, the marketplace wants new, but the business world wants better.
And that's how you win, right?
10:59
There's no shortcut.
And so you have to put in the work.
You have to run beta tests, right?
You got to say, OK, we're going to try this new script.
We're going to take four of our facilities and have them test this new script out.
You're going to make a little training for them, present it, get them to give you stats every day and focus on it.
11:14
And then what happens?
If it improves, great, roll it out to everyone.
If it doesn't improve, learn from it.
Try something else, right.
And like the reason Jim wants Drew the way it was is because every single step of the process we tested and tested and tested.
Right.
Even in this online model that we've been pushing right now, right, We have.
11:31
We've already changed and tweaked and improved each part of that process.
Like it wasn't like, all right, let's do chiropractors.
You know what?
Gyms.
Gyms aren't working, right?
Gyms aren't working.
Let's do chiropractors.
No, right.
We just stick through the shit.
And so I say this with like, a lot of love.
11:50
And I'm trying to say this because some of you guys, I feel like I could be a Big Brother too, but I want to give you like a new you sometime.
But I'm saying this with love because I need you to get through this.
I need you to get through this like creepy best in phase of new of entrepreneurship of I want to do everything.
You got to pick one.
You can win at any of them, but you can't win at all of them.
12:08
And that's, that's the reason, right?
So many of you have so much skill, right?
You guys are so good at promoting, you're so good at selling, right?
So we guys are great marketers.
You just have to use that and channel it into one channel.
Otherwise you're spread too thin and that's why you feel like you're working all day.
You're putting out fires all day and you can't move forward.
12:25
Right.
If you imagine right now, all you had to do was get one person to be successful and then all you is duplicate that one person and just clone them and do it again and do it again and do it again.
And I'll tell you, like right now we're learning on the agency side how to make you guys successful.
12:41
One of the mistakes that I made early on, like with Alan right now is that in the beginning, a lot of the messaging that I have when I talked to you guys was that Alan is a platform that you can run your agency on and make more money.
In reality, Alan is.
Alan is a platform that supports the business model that I'm telling, right.
12:57
It's more switch to my model and you will make more.
We just so happen to use out to extract the value.
It is a piece, but the model is the thing that's going to make you the money, right?
That's the game.
And so some of you are not following instructions.
13:13
You're half in, you're half out.
You're like, I want to do half the things one way and half things another way.
It's not going to work.
Right.
It's like the girl who's trying to lose weight and she's like, well, I'm going to do Quito on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and I'm going to do high card, you know, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, You can't mix shit.
Doesn't work that way, right?
13:29
Got to follow the sequence.
The guys who are doing the best are just following the play, right?
Or following the play.
Some of you guys got to select fucking egos, right?
You're not hot shit, myself included, Right.
But I'm saying like, like I don't know how like and I'm I'm just so you guys know.
Well, I'll, I'll leave there.
13:45
I'm going to reach out to a couple of you guys.
But you have to just so I want you guys to win and I don't want you to make the same mistakes I did and I want you to level up.
And the way to level up is not by doing more things, it's by doing the same thing better and it's not sexy and that's the character trait you have to develop to get to the next level.
14:03
So anyways, I hope that made sense for some of you guys and if maybe it made sense for none of you, hopefully it made sense for one of you guys.
And hopefully that's a turning point that you can say, you know what, I'm not going to do 6 niches.
I'm going to pick one and I'm going to get really good at and that's what I'm doing when it gets hard.
I'm going to stick with it because I know that every other person who's gone and tried this niche gets to this point and bails, and that's why they can't move forward.
14:24
They all do a mediocre job and then try and spread themselves too thin.
But I'm not going to do that.
I'm going to be better than them because I'm going to win and I'm going to get through this piece because what it took to get you to hear, which is learning how to sell, promote, is not the thing that's going to get you to there, which is learning to be disciplined with your focus, with your attention.








0:00
What do we really want to do?
Like, what's the actual impact?
If at the end of our lives we have something that is a shining beacon of a different way to do business, that to me is something worth fighting for.
What's on deck for today?
I am working on the book You.
0:21
Know what's going to happen when everyone sees this moment, right?
What they're going to be like?
When's the book coming out?
What would you have to say?
Oh.
Ohh are we talking?
Ohh, I don't know what.
Is it?
We can mention it.
We could just, like, insert it casually in this blog.
0:36
Yeah, that's a pretty big deal.
Honestly.
They just found out for the first time.
That's right.
I get some messages that are, like, offended.
They're like, yo, what the fuck?
Where's the like I need some leads, bro.
Give me your book.
Real quick, this is really the first time we're kind of seeing you in the morning and you're not meditating, you're not journaling.
0:58
Not doing the red lights on it.
I mean, I should normally.
I have like a three hour routine just so that I'm capable to function as a human being.
I have a long affirmation routine that I do.
There's a wall mirror over there that I just that's where I just say them to myself.
You're amazing.
1:16
You're fantastic.
People love you.
Comments don't mean anything.
Like, is it decaf?
Is it This is decaf?
All decaf, yeah.
Wow, so you drink it just cuz you like the flavor.
1:32
Actually I drink whatever Leila usually drinks cuz it's easier for me to just be like too.
If someone gets plastic surgery right of any kind, the real real is that like either say nothing or be positive about it because they can't change it.
1:51
Like you wouldn't say that to somebody who didn't have their nose changed, but the the the feature is still permanent.
I had one guy message me.
He started commenting on all my posts and he was like evil, horrible, all this shit.
And then I, like, looked in my inbox and he was like messaging.
And he was like, you don't want what's best for us.
2:08
Because if you really did, he would give us the name of your plastic surgeon.
He's like you want us all to be poor and ugly.
He was like, you just don't want us.
And then see there are days where like Layla would be not in as good of a mood and I would try and be like, hey, what can I do?
Like, let me do these things and she would still stay in a kind of a bad mood.
2:24
And so then what would happen is I would then get stern and be like, all right, do your own thing.
And what would happen is that she would then step out of it as soon as I got mean.
And so then what she taught me is that if I am mean, she will stop being in a bad mood, whatever, right?
2:42
As soon as you start having punishment and reward as as things in your in your dialect and thinking what happens afterwards.
Kids cry, parent gives them a cookie and you now teach them to cry, to get cookies.
Like it's just like so simple.
And the other piece is if you reward too long afterwards, you still teach them something but not what you intended.
3:00
A parent, for example, Fast forward has a teenager who sneaks out of the house, right?
And then they come back that in the middle of the night.
And then as soon as they walk in the door, they punish them.
And So what happens?
You punish your kid for coming home and then they're surprised the kid doesn't want to come.
3:20
Home What's your day looking like?
What's?
On the agenda leadership meeting, pipeline review book meeting and I have a biweekly with two of our teammates that I try and do with some of the non executive team.
And you do that every day you try and block up until like noon or one.
3:38
Yeah, and then Layla's been doing such a good job though that there are more days where I just have nothing on my calendar at all, which is awesome and amazing.
Why do you like having nothing on your calendar?
I just.
I just have more time to work.
Farewell.
3:56
Farewell, my love, sweet queen.
Little guy for a guy, you want a little, you want a little guy very ready to start the day.
You can see my little, my little work station.
I've got my iPad, which is where I draw my stuff.
I've got ear plugs, I've got my knicker at my work timer going.
4:16
So I actually don't use it all the time.
It's more during the week because people ping me.
I'll just set my timer for really how long I think something's going to take and then I'll hit it and I just keep it right, like in plain sight.
And that works really well.
So interesting combo is if you go headphones, ear muffs, nicotine, caffeine and like work and a timer.
4:36
I've yet to find like a better combination of productivity.
If useful, I.
Really realized I'd love to do with acquisition.com is be able to build acquisition.com to whatever a billion 10 billion leading with praise not punishment if we could really do this.
5:01
And then teach other CEOs how to do this.
That's something worthwhile of doing and it's not like anybody.
Else but.
On the same side, we have our mission, which is to make real business education available to everybody.
There's often 2 visions in a company.
There's the internal vision, which is much more relevant to team and the employees and the vendors and everyone that you touch and even the customers.
5:22
And then there's the external vision, which is like how are we are affecting the greater community that is affected by acquisition.com?
And I think that we actually really have, as we've clarified this conversation, it's been an ongoing dialogue between Leila and I have like, what do we really want to do?
5:38
Like what's the actual impact at the end of our lives?
We have something that is a shining beacon of a different way to do business that is more profitable by building something bigger and better, but do it our way, which is praise over punishment.
That to me is something worth fighting for.
It just takes more skill because when someone messes up, all you want to do is punish them.
5:57
How can I not do that and then get the desired result?
We will define somebody who is motivated by reward or reinforcement as someone who is, who utilizes all of their discretionary effort.
So if there's the level of effort that is required to not get fired and then all the effort above that is discretionary effort.
6:17
In a business that is based on punishment, people will go to the law of least effort, which is as little as they can do to not get fired.
So if you have a business that's based on that, then how do you get higher performance?
Well, look at McKinsey, look at Goldman Sachs, Look at a lot of the P/E industry.
You raise the bar.
6:33
And So what happens is you get really high Performers are the only ones who can perform in that in that place.
And they are driven by anxiety.
They're stressed out of their minds.
They drink, they do drugs, they get hooked on porn, whatever it is right to to deal with the stressors in their life, but you just move the bar.
And so the alternative is a world where everybody is working even harder than that because the law of of of least effort.
6:54
There's still people that are so talented that they can work medium and not get fired, but you lose out on all of the discretionary effort that they would be putting in if they felt that they were being reinforced in a safe place.
And so that's the kind of environment that we're trying to build.
I'm not saying we're perfect, we will mess up.
7:11
But that's that's I think something that's worth fighting for.
I.
Really think that we have a shot that like bullied embodying these.
Principles that.
Could change so many good people's lives.
So fun story.
One of our teammates went to an event and was rocking an acquisition.com trip.
7:28
Now they're not for sale, obviously, and many people came up to him asking to take pictures with him.
Invited him out for drinks, invited him out for food to portions of that he wasn't allowed to go into, but he was able to because he was wearing that shirt.
So how does that happen?
They read a book that gives them value.
7:46
They're reinforced and rewarded for that thing.
And then when they do the stuff from the book, they associate the rewards they get from that with the book, the book they associate with me.
And then they see me in all the videos and all the content with this thing.
And so eventually you remove me and you just keep the thing and you associate that thing with all these good feelings, all this reward.
8:10
And so then someone else wears the shirt and then they feel the same way towards that person simply because they have associated so many good things with that and that is branding.
And yes, let's switch the pipeline that would allow us to do that kind of vision of the 49 or 51 for new companies, just adding them straight to kind of like our top line, bottom line, that would be a huge move.
8:31
What?
Was that, what was that meeting that we were just in?
Those are pipeline review.
So it's looking at the companies at different stages in the deal process.
And you know, mind you, of people who even get to this level, 95% of deals we don't do.
It's just because we're looking for a lot of very specific things.
8:48
But it's not just necessarily like is the company valuable, but like can we add value to the company.
Fundamentally there's two schools of investing.
There's betters and builders.
So betters are like, can I find a mispriced company that I will Simply put money in at less than its intrinsic value and then hope that it will grow over time.
9:04
That's kind of like the Warren Buffett style.
Probably the vast majority of investors are that way.
And then there are builders to have like a unique set of skills in their hold code that they try and templatize those kind of like SOP's, those playbooks and just deploy them into the companies knowing that they're going to triple 5X10X the companies that they have.
9:23
Private equity is usually a combination of both those things.
I would say that we lean towards the building side of like we're not trying to be like amazing pickers.
We just try and find companies that we know our playbooks will immediately 10X and then try and work with them.
Who's Who's texting?
My wife?
9:39
Gosh, I'm pumped because in the in the new place I will be able to fit my entire wardrobe in my bedside table.
Oh yeah, we'll show Layla's entire closet and then I will pull out my 2.
Chores with beaters and shorts.
It'll be great.
Why are you so obsessed about that stuff?
9:55
Well, I will say this.
I don't know why I know that I am.
I have become more that way because it's probably been reinforced.
The more obsessive I am about, like iterating things until they're like just right, the more rewarded I get.
Trevor was saying that like, that he's alarmed by the number of people that he has worked with who do not read well.
10:15
He said we need to teach them to read.
He got a kid who was struggling to stay focused and so he came to train the kid with a bag of Skittles.
The kid would read 3 words and he would give him a skittle.
But if he read 4 words, because if his previous best was three, he would give him two Skittles.
So we reinforced him doing it every time.
10:33
He had a bigger reinforcement for when every time he hit a new record.
So if he read a full line, he would give him more.
By the end of the first session, he had them reading entire pages.
Hello.
So we're doing this whole vlog thing.
So we're capturing day in the life, the very, the high energy life of CEO who lives in a closet.
10:57
Yeah, I mean like, I don't see an issue with translating into more languages like that doesn't bother me.
And we just have more people who get the book.
Can they do Mandarin or Japanese or Portuguese?
Portuguese would be big German.
I got a lot of DM's after I showed the French one.
So that was a meeting with my book manager, who also happens to be my fatherinlaw.
11:16
So we have massively improved our relationship since the first time I stole his daughter, told her to quit everything to join me to gallivant across the country, living in motels six weeks after we met.
But yeah, he runs everything with the book, so we have a French and a Spanish version out and then looking at other languages that we want to translate it into and looking at publishing and printing firms in Germany and Italy.
11:37
So that's kind of what that that meeting was about.
We got different versions of the books as they progressed over time from different printers that I could see the the print quality.
Just so you guys know, I don't go to 1 printer, I go to a bunch of them and make sure that the book quality is good.
And if you're like, well, why are you even dealing with this rather than going on publisher?
11:55
Because publishers don't want you to give away your book free.
And so I, you know, Uncle Alex puts the bill, I'll have probably a million, I'll add it up probably like a million two into this book negative.
I mean that's why most publishing companies will front the money.
12:12
And I would have done that with this book, just so you guys know, except if I had done it with this book, it wouldn't be out until spring of 24.
Like it has to be 100% done nine months before you actually get it.
I finished this and then it.
12:28
I'm releasing it 16 weeks after it was done and that's because 12 weeks is printing.
If I wanted to just do like drop ship real time printing and then wanted everyone to wait forever, I would do it that way.
But it's also way more expensive to print that way.
And you know the books fund Mozy Media, which is really.
12:47
So you guys know, where did the dollars go from the, from my $2.99 books that I get a dollar from it goes to goes to the team.
So we can put out more stuff for you guys.
Tobias, what's up, man?
Tell me your most painful moment.
OK, what's yours?
13:02
Painful stuff.
I mean like cutting my eyeball.
That sucks.
I took sales call still.
So, yeah, there you go.
Yeah, I would just get your opinion on fixing the sales issue.
Here's what's crazy is that if the other guy gets up to 40, it double s sales.
I think that if I had a two prong approach, get a good salesman in there and then double the throughput on the webinar, I'd say like that's a 4X if we double double.
13:25
Sometimes people ask why don't you make videos like you used to?
Why?
Why the change?
Why all the editing?
The new thumbnails, All that shit?
More people see it.
I mean, it's just that we see the comments.
This actually reminds me of a story that you told me.
13:41
But like whenever a band goes from like a small town to like they go, they go bigger audience, they go more mass market.
People are like the band selling out or whatever it is.
But the reality is that like the band morphs into the thing that reaches the most people.
And so if you believe in the message that you have, then packaging it in a way that allows the most people to consume it, if you believe in what you want to get out there, as long as it doesn't dilute the the core message, which I don't think us editing more heavily and having higher producer videos does.
14:10
It just gets more people to see it.
And so here's The thing is that everyone in Mosey Nation votes with their clicks and their eyeballs about the things they find most interesting.
And so you trained me to make the content that I have.
So if y'all in general like the webcam only thing more than I would be making more of that.
14:35
But you train me with your clicks and your watches of the things that you care the most about and so we make more of those things.
So in many ways you guys control the content.
And so all the day, one home is appreciate.
Y'all and many of you guys were like at 5K, we're like dude, this guy's going to be in a million.
And it's true, we got there.
14:51
But it was just because you guys appreciate you guys sharing, commenting, send it to your friends, all that kind of stuff.
I feel really confident in saying that like in two years you will laugh at what we are putting out right now.
I know, I certainly will.
There are some things that are going to get released that are going to blow what we are doing out of the water.
15:10
We like to say we think of decades, not days, but I think you can just watch and see if if we're full of it or not.








0:00
But my probably singular message is use pain because most entrepreneurs don't need to look very far to find the pain in their lives.
Anger, shame, fear, resentment, whatever it is anxiety.
Like we have different things that have fueled us in our lives and I would rather have people just use what they have.
0:18
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So my first podcast was June of 17 and then I think in September of 20 I did my first YouTube videos and then I did that first and then I think probably one or two quarters later we started with the short video stuff on Tiktok and Instagram reels.
0:47
I picked up Twitter I think in like June of like the next year of 21 and then that's been more or less the the entire strategy.
When I say strategy, me like we just post on those platforms.
So, so from my understanding, you kind of had an evolution of just the your mindset towards building brand and building personal brand.
1:06
You know what led to that being wrong?
My 8th episode of my podcast in in 17 was Stop Branding.
That's the 8th episode.
I probably have the exact opposite perspective now and I'm wealthier now, so I'm hopefully I'm right and maybe maybe in 10 years I'll change my mind again, but I don't think I will.
1:25
Fundamentally, brand is one of the ways that you can differentiate anything.
It's really just the goodwill that you have in the audience and your ability to price above a commoditized version of whatever you offer, like that discrepancy between what a commodity sells at and what your sells at, like that is the pricing power that brand affords you.
1:46
And so with price being the single strongest lever on profits in any kind of business, having a brand becomes incredibly important if it is the strongest influencer on your ability to price.
That just fundamentally shifted how I saw it because before then it was just direct response in terms of cold reach outs like cold calls, cold emails, etcetera and direct response ads in order to get customers.
2:08
And so I was just a big advocate of like just do cold calls and run ads and you will get customers.
But the long, long play is building a brand that is worth something and then that can get transferred into any arena.
So like if I were to start a Mosey Nation credit card or I were to start Mosey Nation apparel, both of them would be successful even though they're completely independent because of the brand that's been built.
2:28
Not that I'm going to do either of those things, but I'm saying like that.
That's kind of the idea.
Well, and I mean, so obviously your ventures have evolved over the years.
I heard you mention on a podcast that the businesses that most entrepreneurs start.
Are often drastically different from the ones that they eventually find themselves in.
And you mentioned like Andy Purcella and your and yourself.
2:45
If you could briefly share just just kind of your entrepreneurial journey and your evolution, yeah, I'll do it by businesses, so that would be easier.
So first thing I did was I started an online training charity business so that people would pay, but then I would donate the money.
That was just kind of like, get my feet wet with people giving me money, even though I didn't take it personally.
3:03
Then I quit my job and asked the same people who are paying the charity if they would pay me instead so that I could, like, eat.
I was like, I'm the charity now and they were all good with it.
From there, I started my first gym.
From that gym, opened up five more from there.
I had a mentor say that this, you know, he was like, you're really good at running gyms.
3:18
You shouldn't be owning more gyms.
You should kind of teach other people how to run gyms.
And so from there, we did turnarounds for two years.
So we'd fly out to brick and mortar gyms, kind of put all of our systems in place and turn it around in 30 days.
That was kind of the, the offer.
And then from there that became really logistically painful.
You know, got eight sales guys going out to 8 different locations across the nation every single month, you know, away on the road 21 to 24 days a month, which is tough for families, etcetera.
3:41
By a stroke of luck, there's, there's a million very sad stories in between here.
But by a stroke of luck, I was supposed to launch six or eight gyms the next month and we had decided to pivot to go direct to consumer.
We're selling weight loss because we were, we were familiar with that.
And I told the gym owners, yeah, we were supposed to launch that I wasn't going to do it.
3:59
And one of the guys was like, hey, could you just show me what you're doing rather than flying out here?
And I was like, sure, how much, you know?
And I just picked a really high number.
And he said yes.
And I was like, holy cow, that was pretty cool.
And so then I told all the other guys the same thing, and they were like, how much.
And I just kept increasing the number.
4:15
And they all said he was fine.
And then I called all the gyms I did the turnarounds for and said, remember that thing I did?
Can I just license the model to you?
And they're like, yeah, that's fine.
And so that's when we got into licensing.
That was 2017.
That was like May, April, May of 2017 and then then it took off like a rocket and so then you know 5000 locations later that's where Jim launches today.
4:34
We started to sell a company in between there to sell through that distribution base.
So that was e-commerce And then we started Allen, which is a software company that worked leads for brick and mortar businesses.
That was the next year after that all selling to that same audience.
And then in 2021, in December, we sold two of those companies, so Jim launch and Prestige Labs to American Pacific Group, which private equity group out of San Francisco and we sold that for 46.2 and then we sold the software company for an undisclosed amount to St.
5:02
G Buyers.
We sold 75% of that in an all stock deal.
And so from there, we started our family office which is acquisition.com, which we started the day after we sold and now we have I think 11 portfolio companies and.
It's it.
5:18
It's fascinating to me because I mean, I mean looking back at at that journey, I know you mentioned that there's.
Several moments.
And I mean I've heard you describe some of them, some like the rock bottom moments of the people that either did not operate with integrity, the people that you would partner with the, you know, running out of money even even the way you start, you know, $100 million offers your book.
5:34
Just talking about that scenario, I mean if you could speak to some of that just in the story of of adversity, right.
That was an unrelatable recanting of events.
There were probably, I mean there were many rock bottom moments but the, you know the I would say the two most famous of them if they're if if stories can become famous was when we switched out of the brick and mortar gyms and got into the turn around business.
5:56
You know the the reason I I made that move was because I was supposed to be opening more and more locations with a new partner.
So I sold five and I opened a 6th with this kind of new model that was going to be like a launch and go model.
And so the guy that I partnered with was like hey I'm really good at operating.
You should instead of doing these turnarounds just open it, fill it and then I'll just come behind you and then every month you can open up one to two locations and own them all.
6:18
And I was like, that sounds great.
He said, you know, but I have some financial, you know, issues and my credit's not good.
So of course, you, you know, of course, you'll personally guarantee the lease and front all the money.
And I was like, of course, and I'll do the work too.
Of course.
I mean, that's any nice guy would do that.
And so, you know, everyone already knows where this goes.
6:35
Six weeks later, you know, I crushed the launch of this new gym.
And then I look at the bank account.
Bank account's empty.
And I put all the money from selling my gyms into that bank account, too, because I was young.
And I didn't understand how this worked.
All the money that I'd had from the five years or four years of building my own gyms was gone.
And so I just had this gym and I was like, dude, what the hell?
6:52
And he said, I know you've been skimming from the top of this business.
And so that was just my share.
It hadn't had never occurred to anything like that had ever occurred to me.
And so I went to a mentor and he's like, just go line by line with him through the financials, like maybe he's concerned or whatever.
And so it was, I went to him with all the financials highlighted line by line to, like, to show what every one of the expenses was.
7:09
And then we brushed it off the table before we could even look at it.
I was like, oh, OK, I just got completely scammed here.
And so yeah, I lost everything.
And so that was the first time I lost everything.
And then that was when my to be wife at the time took me to her parents house which I got to meet her parents for the first time.
7:28
Hey, here's this guy from the Internet that I just left everything for.
He's a real winner.
He has nothing to his name and we're gonna start this business together.
And so she said, hey, we should keep doing this turnarounds, even though that this one didn't work out.
The model's good.
And so she got all of her friends to quit her, quit their jobs to do this with us.
7:45
And so we were supposed to start on the 26th of December, which was 2016.
And on the 24th of December, I had done this big launch to kind of recoup money because that was how I knew how to make money.
So I did a big launch and we had like $100,000 that was supposed to come to us.
And then but for whatever reason, the money wasn't coming.
8:01
Like we're processing the credit cards and it just wasn't getting deposited.
And it had been almost like 3 weeks.
I was like, what's going on?
So Christmas Eve, I get on the phone with the payment processor and I was like, I'm not getting off the phone until you guys send me the money.
And the Long story short, they said, hey, because of that gym that you opened up and you had, you know, because I shut the gym down, that was with that guy.
8:20
And I was doing watches in other locations.
So I was running everything through a Southern California brick and mortar processor account, which I didn't know how this works.
I just figured, yeah, you just process money through the the POS since I was making up memberships that didn't exist for gyms that I wasn't AT.
And they're like, this is irregular.
8:35
We're just going to hold on to this money for six months.
And that was all of the money that I needed.
And two days later, all of her friends were supposed to quit their job and start this new launch business with me.
And so that was going to cost me $3300 a day in advertising, hotels, airfare, rental cars, per diems for food for this new launch and go model.
8:55
I had a credit card from when I had my gyms that still hadn't been cancelled by Amex for $100,000 limit on it.
And that's when I told Leila I was like, hey, I think this could go really, really terribly wrong.
And I think you would be justified in leaving me at this time.
I'm like sitting in her parents basement or you know, like I'm like you really should leave me right now.
9:13
I don't think this is going well for me.
And she said I would sleep with you on the bridge if it came to that.
And so, you know, when she said that to me, it gave me whatever confidence, you know, every guy could use.
And I started, you know, I spent $3300 a day on a credit card that And meanwhile I still didn't have a way to process money.
9:30
So we're spending 3000 + a day, you know, selling 20 to 60, you know, packages of fitness per day with all these sales guys.
And I couldn't process the money.
And so on the last day of the month, I finally got some processor to give me a $50,000 limit.
If you're doing the math here, 3300 a day does not add up to 50K.
9:48
But the good news was I could process 50 KA month, which meant that on the last day of January I process 50.
On the first day of February I process 50, I got two more running And so the 50 and 50 covered my $100,000 from the month before and then I was still back at 0 again.
And so the next month that I I made like 20 or $30,000 in profit after costs.
10:05
And so that kind of concluded the first rock bottom and then Fast forward three months, all these gyms that we're doing these launches for started telling the customers to refund and go through them instead at half the price after we would leave the location because they had the relationship with them.
But we owed the processing risk which ended up being a recurring theme.
10:22
So I lost everything again the, the little nut that I had saved up and that was when I called the gym owners to say, hey, we're going to sell direct to consumer.
I think maybe I was telling Leila I was like I think maybe I'm, I'm out on this gym thing like something's not working and I just need to switch gears.
But when I called the first guy up and I said I'm not doing it, he said I put my life savings into this gym and and I refinanced my house and I maxed it all my car, it's like I need your help.
10:44
And so push came to shove and I said fine, I'll, I'll, I'll show you how I filled Jim's up and how my whole system works.
I was like, but I'm not flying out there to save your ass if you can't sell.
And he said no, it's fine.
And so he said, well how much?
And I said $6000, which at the time is the most money I could possibly imagine someone paying me.
And he said, yes in like 5 seconds.
11:00
And I was like, holy shit.
And I just, I was dumbfounded.
And so then I just grabbed a piece of cardboard.
I was like, oh, yeah, what card do you want to use?
And then I, you know, wrote it down and processed $6000 in one transaction and had seven more calls that day and ended up doing $60,000 in a single day.
And Leila came back in from doing weight loss sales because that was going to be the new business.
11:18
And I was like, hey, I think we're still in the gym business.
I think we were just doing it wrong.
And she was like, wait, so we're back in gyms?
I was like, yeah, we're back in gyms.
And so from there, I called all the old gyms that we'd done the launches for, said, hey, remember that thing I just ripped $100,000 out of your location for?
Want me to show you how I did it and they said sure and then I sold them the thing.
11:34
So that's the slightly longer story of that with with many, many sadnesses taken out of that during that period of time.
I also got a head on collision in the DUI.
My mother was in the hospital like there's a lot of other things that were going on too, but it was it was a tough time for me.
It's it's like the ultimate pitch for entrepreneurship, you know, just just now.
11:53
And I mean, I gotta say, right?
The ultimate pitch for entrepreneurship.
Like beware, yeah.
It's like the frustrations lead to breakthroughs and it seems like, I mean every, every, every entrepreneur kind of has their own story.
But it's it's very rare if ever that I hear anybody having a story where everything always went, went up and you know and to the right it was always if screwed over there was always some rock bottom moment.
12:14
There was something was a catalyst.
I mean when you're when you're taking these hits, I mean obviously you're human as well.
I mean, it's it's easy to get discouraged.
What?
What keeps you going?
I mean, for me at the time, it was very way driven.
You know what I mean?
I didn't have like a lot of times people were very driven by like their mission or their purpose or their big vision.
12:30
And I had none of those things.
I mean, my vision was, A, don't be broke.
B, don't let my dad be right.
Really, B, more than A.
But A was the facilitator of B.
And so, yeah, just the idea of going back as a failure to Baltimore was just like, I would rather have died than done that.
And so as much pain as I was going through at the time, it was better than the alternative admitting defeat.
12:50
And so for me, that was the thing that that get me got me through it.
And I think I think for a lot of entrepreneurs, one of the they if there's if I, you know, if there's a couple of key themes in the messages that I want to put out is that like there's a lot of, there's a lot of positive jargon that's put out by, you know, social media and influencers, etcetera, like follow your passion.
13:05
But The thing is, just like when you're starting out, everything sucks.
Like everything sucks.
And I was talking to a friend of mine and you sadness comes from not knowing what to do, right.
It's a feeling of hopelessness, like you don't know what steps to take, which really just means it comes from from ignorance.
13:21
And when you're new, you don't know anything, so of course you're of course you don't know what to do.
Which leads to like very deep depression for a lot of entrepreneurs at different times in their careers.
Most guys who are starting out or or thinking there's something wrong with them because they're not passionate.
Mosa Nation real quick, if you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
13:46
And if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
But my probably singular message is use pain because most entrepreneurs don't need to look very far to find the pain in their lives.
14:04
Anger, shame, fear, resentment, whatever it is anxiety.
Like we have different things that have fueled us in our lives and I would rather have people just use what they have because I think that is in essence what entrepreneurship is about, is being resourceful not really necessarily about having resources.
And if we consider passion a resource as a requirement to be successful, I just don't think it's true.
14:23
I think you need fuel and you should use whatever fuel you have.
I think over time if you get your head above water, you'll be able to find a different fuel, but I think that away from fuel is more powerful than towards fuel.
It's not necessarily as sustainable, but in the beginning you should need to move and so a lot of ways that can get you to move.
14:44
Yeah, how how much do you believe?
I mean just I I know you mentioned this earlier, but just how much do you believe in luck plays a role in success or does it play a role in success?
I mean for example you meeting Layla, it's hard to tell the story of Alex without also the story of Layla.
But, you know, at the same time, if you'd never met, I guess you'd eventually get there.
But, you know, with with the path of probably pretty different.
15:01
I think luck is huge.
I think there are things you can do to increase the surface area of luck.
So I think luck is a massive factor.
I mean, I was born in America.
I was born as a male.
I was born to a doctor.
So I mean, like from that perspective, I already won.
So, like, yeah, do I think if I was born in Bangladesh as a girl that I would have been as successful as I am now?
15:21
Probably less likely.
A big part of who I am now is the upbringing I had.
If I live someone else's life, I might be exactly the same way they are.
And so in that way, I think it's very much luck driven.
I wonder, like when when Leo stood by you and you know, she said you sleep under a bridge.
I I have a similar relationship because my wife, you know, I I've joked.
15:38
We kind of have like a southpaw story.
When she met me.
I'm a penny stock.
I'm just starting the company.
She's successful.
She knows what she's doing.
Then we kind of roam the business together.
And I've asked her a few times like, hey, well, you know what?
What did what did you see in me then?
But I'm curious.
What What do you think?
Why do you think she stuck by you?
I think Leila is an exceptional judge of people.
15:56
I think if there's like one skill that Leila is world class at is that she just, she just sees through people.
Leila has never been wrong about a higher, about a partnership ever.
It's pretty impressive.
And so I think she saw her, she's I'm giving, I'm giving her words here.
16:14
But I mean she saw potential in me.
And she felt like if I had, if I was able to shed some of these bad partnerships and beliefs and relationships and things like that that were weighing me down, that there was something underneath that was good.
You know, a lot of ways that was kind of how both of us I think saw our relationship at the time was like we're not good yet, but I think that we could be good together.
16:32
And I mean our relationship in the first 2-3 years was not, was not like a a Hollywood movie, you know what I mean?
Like we were mostly business partners and we got married 11 months in.
But like we didn't have a wedding, we didn't have a marriage.
I mean we had a marriage, but like we didn't have a party.
We didn't have a honeymoon.
16:48
We worked the day of our of our eloping and then we worked the next day.
You know what I mean?
It just nothing happened and we just worked straight through.
But I think it's about three years in where we started to like, really recognize one another and really find our groove kind of even romantically.
So we have definitely like an atypical story from that perspective.
17:05
But it has worked out.
Yeah, yeah.
And and I heard you mentioned on on a podcast the importance of respect within a relationship, sometimes respect being even more important than affection.
I mean it's good to have both, but just to be able to respect one another.
Yeah, I think there's, if you look at, gosh, I, I wish I could quote this better, but there's like the Four Horsemen of divorce, they did, you know, sure for this like Hallmark study.
17:26
They like they have the couples bring up some subject that they argue about and they study how they argued and they could predict with like a 91% success rate who is going to be divorced in 10 years.
And there's four horsemen of like divorce.
And the one that was the highest predictor was contempt, which can seem be seen visually with an eye roll, which is both a lack of respect for the other person and also thinking you're better than them.
17:50
And so that like combination is deadly for relationships.
And I think that if you were to reverse that and think that like the other person is better than you are and have ultimate respect for them, then you might have something that could safeguard a marriage or relationship.
You know, I know that the two of you've worked together.
I I joke, my wife and I I say like, you know, we've been together but it's it's like dog years, right?
18:06
Because you know, we, you know, we wake up together, we go to the office and then we come home.
So it's just like multiplied by seven.
But like what?
What advice do you have for other couples, whether considering working together, if they're already working together, how to, how to, you know, how to keep that going?
I have to put my disclaimer that like, we've only been together seven years and I think in in decades.
18:22
So, you know, when I when we cross our first decade, I'll let everyone know.
But you know, the only encouraging thing I can say is that from a time spent together, the average marriage people spend 2 hours a day together and 45 minutes of that is high quality and the other hour and 15 minutes is watching television or eating and doing like household activities.
18:41
And so the amount of time we've spent together compared to the average relationship is we've had like a 45 or 50 year marriage comparatively in terms of hours spent.
That being said, with that large caveat, I think that the biggest thing that has worked for us is just acceptance, which is that Layla has never tried to change me and I've never really tried to change her.
19:01
And I think I get a lot of messages, which is like how do I find my Layla?
Or more specifically, how do I make my wife into Layla, which is a weird message to get because it means that you don't accept you're part of who they are.
And so people were like, how do I get my wife into business?
I was like, if she's not already in the business, she's not in the business.
19:16
Like, you're not going to make her into business.
It should be like a woman saying, like, how can I make my man taller?
It's not going to happen.
So I think, and this is going to probably be relatively controversial, but I think a lot of people lose in the draft.
So a lot of people think about, like, how do you, how do you coach a championship team?
I think a lot of teams lose in the draft.
19:33
They don't have the talent.
And so again, that's probably a little bit contrarian to, like, all marriages are savable, which maybe they are.
The question is are they ideal or are they optimal for both partners in terms of achieving their their potential.
And I think a lot of them are because I think a lot of people mature over time and probably wouldn't make the same decisions as they did, you know 20 years ago, which is one of the hardest parts about a lifelong decision in general.
19:52
And so I think that making sure that you're picking somebody who has the same long term goal as you has the same values as you.
And I think the the single greatest one is that they that if you want to grow that they want to grow because growth is also another word for change, which means that if you have two people who are changing for a long period of time.
20:09
We just better hope they'd be changing the same direction, yeah, yeah.
And it's obviously like choice of spouse or life partner or whatever.
Obviously, probably one of the most important decisions we make in our lives.
It's number one.
So, OK.
So on that note then what would you say is like two and three?
Well I I say that from measuring from subjective well-being.
20:28
So it has a .71 correlation to yours projective well-being is the strength of relationship with your significant other.
So there's nothing else that comes close to that.
So I would say from that perspective, it is a, it is the, the most important one.
And pretty much if you think about this, everything else is impermanent.
The business you start is impermanent.
You can change businesses, you can change, you can change markets, you can change where you live.
20:46
You change who you work with.
Like all of these things are changeable.
But if you are married and you believe in trying to stay with that commitment, then like you're making a permanent either a detractor or addition to your life and that person's going to interact with you probably more than anyone else and not probably.
You will be interacting with that person probably more than anyone else, especially if you work together.
21:03
And so like pick wisely, yeah, but two or three where you live, like the actual market that you're in, that's becoming less and less important.
But I think just the the circles you run in are important.
I think from a business perspective, the industries that you choose to get into have a huge influence on you.
21:19
You know if you're getting into steel mills as they were going out or you're getting into newspapers 10 years ago, probably wasn't the best call.
So didn't matter how good you were, you probably were going to win.
So those are kind of like some of the bigger marker or or macro influencers on, on how successful you'll be, but that's a little bit more of a business tangent.
And and I know you, you've worked with many, many different founders, I mean in in all sorts of different businesses, services based businesses, software, I mean the the full gamut.
21:41
Like are there any particular traits that you've seen in the in the most successful founders that kind of separate the most successful from the least successful?
Yeah, they're humble.
If you have humility, you can do a lot because if somebody's humbled and they can accept feedback and they can accept feedback, then they can change.
I mean it's very difficult to basically if someone doesn't have humility, then it means that whoever they are, day one has to be the person that they need to be a day 1000 because if they can't admit a deficit, then they can't improve.
22:06
And so humility is by far the biggest one, you know, beyond that it's they have to have drive.
They have to have some reason that they're going to do it, whether it's, you know, away from fuel or towards fuel, like they have to have some sort of drive.
There's a big study on this that I've been quoted a lot for, even though it's not my study.
It's, you know, the three most common traits that they've seen.
22:23
You know, it's not the early wake up time.
It's not.
It's not a lot of, you know, it's not the healthy eating, it's not the cold plunges or the affirmations.
But the the three common traits were that they had a superiority complex, so they believe that they can do big things, they want to chase after big goals.
The 2nd is that they have crippling insecurity and that they feel there never will be enough and that they have impulse control.
22:43
And so if you have a big goal and you have big fuel and you don't stray the path and you do it for a very long period of time, you'll probably win, yeah.
Yeah, it's almost like AI think there's a book, it's called like the Manic Edge, you know, to to a degree it it's like you almost have to be crazy in a sense.
22:59
I mean, you think about the entrepreneur, the idea of starting a business, the risk that you take on.
I mean, obviously, I mean I think Shark Tank maybe has popularized this to an extent, but when you look at the reality of it, it's not always a great proposition.
I mean, I I think now with a lot of like social media culture, it's this idea of, you know, working remotely from your laptop.
23:15
Everybody's making 40 grand a month.
I don't know why people get stuck on this number, but it just.
I I don't know that it really depicts an accurate portrayal of of of what this journey is.
Yeah.
Well I think the average, I mean I I I think the average small business owner takes home like $50,000 a year.
I mean the average small business owner makes the same as the median household income.
23:33
So you know from that sense it's one person versus a household.
So I guess in that sense they have make a little bit more money.
They also take on significantly more risk personally in order to do that.
So I I agree with you.
I think that the, I think right now it's in vogue, it's cool.
I mean it is the way to make the most money.
It's also the way to lose the most money.
23:49
It is that you know at at definition the the, the highest risk, highest reward game.
But you know, to quote Warren Buffett, I think the reason business is so risky is because people don't know what they're doing.
And that's kind of the nature of it, is that when you start, you're ignorant.
Biggest debt you pay is the tax of not knowing, right.
24:04
You're not knowing what you do.
He also says that it's it's only risky if you don't know what you're doing.
And so once you do know what you're doing, then there's not nearly as much risk in business.
But the only way to know what you're doing is to get in the game, which means you have to incur lots of risk to get in.
And then the more you play, the better you get.
The less risky it is the higher rewardest.
24:21
Yeah, yeah.
It's like in in many cases it's like the other, the solutions, making good decisions, how do you make good decisions?
Experience.
How do you gain experience, bad decisions.
And you know, and the cycle repeats.
Something you've shared before that I I thought was very interesting is just the differences between how the most successful people view time and their approach the time horizon.
24:38
If you could elaborate on that, you can pretty easily tell how successful an entrepreneur is by looking at 2 elements of time.
One is the increments of time they speak in.
So if they talk in decades, they talk in multiple decades, They talk in lifetimes, they talk in generations.
24:56
I can almost guarantee you it's gonna be a significantly more successful entrepreneur than the one who talks about next week, next month, and even next quarter.
And it's such a small thing, but it's it's pervasive.
Like you can hear it in conversation.
You can immediately know, oh, this guy's only doing this much because the only way to do really big things is to think on a much longer time horizon.
25:13
The 2nd component is how they manage the micro, which is if you look at someone's calendar and how they allocate their most scarce resource, which is time, you can see where they're going to be in six or 12 months.
So if you look at the calendar as the balance sheet of someone's time asset and how they allocate their their time budget, then you will see where they're going to get their returns.
25:38
And so we look at a founder and we look at their calendar, We can tell how the company's going.
We can usually see how we need to fix it because fundamentally, most entrepreneurs work all the hours of the day.
Most most of them do, right?
And so if they're not making the amount of money that they want to make, it's because they're doing the wrong stuff.
And that's usually the biggest issue.
25:54
And they think they need to work harder.
But they've already maxed out their hours, which means fundamentally they're wrong.
They're seeing a distorted reality.
They think this is going to work and it is not.

Mosey Nation real quick, If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
And if you like that or would like to hear more about it go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
And this is what I believe has married the best parts of agency and the best part of building an enterprise and making a valuable business and avoided the agency trap that so many people fall into, myself included.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:38
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
Over the last 20-4 months, I added 5 million people to my audience across all platforms.
0:53
And in the last 12 I added four million.
And that was all from organic content.
But believe it or not, I didn't post on any of those platforms or know much about any of it at all.
And so rather than try and learn it all myself, I went to experts.
1:08
And So what I want to break down today is how every single one of these platforms, I actually didn't start myself but started with an agency and kind of the process that I went through.
So if you are somebody who like, wants to get into content, wants to start making stuff, I will break down how I did it so you can model whatever aspects of that are useful for you.
1:26
So First off, I noticed this pattern only in retrospect.
So when I get into something I you either have to pay in time or you pay in money to get the experience right.
And so I because I have more money than time, I prefer to pay with money.
You can learn every platform on your own, it just takes more time.
1:41
But for me, I'd rather shortcut that.
And so the next problem that comes up is that you're ignorant.
So sure, I had money, but I didn't know who was good at LinkedIn or good at Tiktok or good at Instagram or good at YouTube.
I didn't know any of that stuff.
And so I just paid to get somebody who had an agency to help me out.
1:59
And the main objective of having that person was just to get the basics down.
It's like make sure that the profile is set up a certain way and make sure that I'm, I'm doing a certain cadence of posting.
And I usually would just lean on them and say, well, what are you, what are you using that works well.
And then they will tell me and I'm like, cool, that's what I'll do.
And So what happens is once I get in there, because I'm also pretty decent at advertising and start to learn that game, I start to see on my own, OK, what does seem to do better?
2:23
What topics are good, how do I present these these things, what is the audience like?
Etcetera.
And So what happened is like phase one is I get what I would consider a basic agency.
Now I don't tend to overspend on the first people because I don't know anything, so I have no context to make a judgement.
2:38
So I don't want to chill out a ton of cash, 'cause, I don't know, I might be making a bad purchase.
Once I have more context because I've spent three, six months working with them, getting on a consistent cadence, seeing what the audience likes, then I'm like, OK, I have more context now.
Now I want to learn everything.
2:54
So I go from beginner of learning the basics and doing the fundamentals to how do the top creators create on this platform?
And so usually there's different tiers of agencies.
There's the guys who just make stuff, and then there's the people who are real pros.
And the difference in cost is usually 3 to 5X.
3:10
So we're talking significantly more money.
And just contextually here, for one brand on one platform, a small one might cost 3:00-ish, maybe 5000 a month.
The more advanced ones are usually in the 15 to $30,000 a month.
So it's significantly more money, just to be clear.
3:27
But they usually work with significantly larger creators who can afford that, right?
And so I didn't have the audience at the time, but I had the money so I could shortcut my path there.
So then I work with the much better, more advanced agency, works with the top creators to learn all of the more nuanced pieces of the platform, how to package things, how to paste them, all that kind of stuff.
3:51
Once I finish that phase.
And for me finishing that phase is I start documenting what they're doing into our processes internally.
And ideally what we do is we want to start Co creating.
So they're making stuff for us and we're making stuff for us, but eventually our stuff for us starts to be as good and eventually better than the stuff that they make for us.
4:13
And it should be because I'm only one client of many to them and I'm basically renting them as fractional labour with expertise at a premium.
Eventually once your team has the same amount of expertise or more, they should be better because one, they have more time because they're going to fully allocate their time to you and secondly because they will always have more context on your brand than an agent will.
4:36
And so by combining those two things, by having more time and more context, all we have to fill is the gap of expertise.
And so once we have the expertise gap, then the in house team should be better than the advanced team and then at that point you decouple and you let them go.
And so this three-step process has been pretty much how I have attacked any new platform.
4:56
And The thing is, is that this doesn't just apply for how I attacked content When I wanted to learn paid ads, I did the exact same thing.
If I want to learn cold outbound, I do the exact same thing.
So I always want to attack whatever a new platform or method is by doing this kind of process.
And one of the caveats I have here is that agencies many times, and the whole coaching industry might hate me for this.
5:17
But agencies tend to be better a lot of times at doing the thing than the coaches are.
Because a lot of times the coaches did something a while ago, had some successes, and then they market those successes, but they don't stay up to date.
The agencies have to keep doing it.
And so they're usually way more in the in the trenches of what's working right now.
5:34
And so even though they don't like to sell education, I find that I get my best education from the experts who are actually doing it every day.
And so that's just a personal note for me.
Now on the flip side, if you're an agency and you're hearing this and you're like, well shit, what if everyone does this to me?
I think you plan for that, which is rather than on the front end being like I hope this person stays forever, instead saying, hey, let's ramp you up to Speedway faster than you could on your own.
5:56
You're going to learn all the basics, you're going to learn all the advanced stuff, and then I'm going to help you source and train the people inside your business.
So eventually you can do this on your own because that's ultimately what every business owner wants.
Now some businesses might just never want to do it, and there are definitely businesses that just never want to get into it and everyone own it and they're happy to pay it.
In that case, awesome.
6:12
But for many people, they want to have more control of that, especially if they're more brand driven, which you should be if you're trying to make money.
When I was a baby, my father used to rock me to sleep at night saying it's hard to be poor with leads banging down your door.
It's a hormozi family Jingle.
I'm just kidding.
My dad had no interest in that whatsoever.
6:29
But that being said, if you're a business owner and you're trying to get more leads and grow your business, or if you want to start a business, you need to let more people know about your stuff.
In other words, you need to advertise.
That is exactly what my next book, $100 Million Leads, is all about.
And this has been two years in the making.
6:44
I spent 2000 hours writing and editing this through 19 draftsacquisition.com/leads.
Register for the event and just to give you some context or some credibility, the stuff in this book advertising this event, we already have over 200,000 people registered.
So I feel confident when I say that this can help you.
I think we'll probably sell it at the event and the only way to get it will be to be there live.
7:02
See you then.
So what I want to do is help you decide whether or not you should use an agency and avoid what I call the agency trap.
So the first agency experience I ever had was actually really good, and I'll tell you why it was good later.
But know that I had a good enough experience that I then worked with like 10 more agencies and all of them were terrible.
7:21
And this is the exact process of what happened.
Let me read it to you.
So reading directly from $100 million leads, step one, they got me excited about all the new leads they would bring.
Step 2, I'd go through an onboarding process that felt valuable and sometimes was.
Step three, they assigned their best senior Rep to my account.
7:38
Step four, I saw some results.
Step five, they moved my senior Rep to the newest customer.
Step 6A junior Rep starts managing my account.
My results suffer.
Step seven, I complain.
Step 8, the senior Rep would come back once in a while to make me feel better.
Step 9, the results still never got back to where they were before, and I'd eventually cancel step 10.
7:56
I'd search for another agency and repeat the cycle of insanity.
Step 11 for the zillionth time, start wondering why I wasn't getting results like the first time.
So The thing is, is that agencies are actually incentivized to only do enough to keep you paying, which sucks.
And I think that's why a lot of agency models are broken.
8:14
And they're also incentivized to put their high skilled labor on the newest people who need to get sold and put their lowest skilled, lowest wage worker on the oldest ones, right, And continue to increase their margin in that way.
Now one of the big breakthroughs I had was that I realized that these people that they had as their low skilled workers that were working my account, I was like, I too could pay someone $20.00 an hour to work on my account and not pay you to do that.
8:35
And so as soon as I realized that, I was like, OK, well, if they can teach that person to do this, then all I have to learn is that little checklist that probably took them two days to give to this person so that I can do it for everybody on my team internally.
So here's how I use agencies now and how you can too.
8:51
So rather than believe the lie that I'll never have to learn the stuff because they can do it, I start every agency relationship with a purpose and a deadline to fulfill it.
OK, And because here's The thing is, is that best case scenario, they are amazing, but then they own you because they own all your revenue.
9:07
Worst case, they suck and then you just lost money.
So it's like it feels like a lose, lose.
But I do think that there's a middle path that makes an actual win win, which is what I'm going to share with you.
So rather than agree to their initial terms, which is basically pay us as long as humanly possible and we hope you pay until you die, right.
9:24
Which doesn't work for me and doesn't work for them.
All right.
Not long term.
This is exactly what I say.
So I like to open by saying this.
I want to do what you do in my business, but I don't know how.
I'd like to work with you for six months so I can learn how you do it.
9:39
Plus I'll pay extra for you to break down why you make the decisions you do and the steps you take to make them.
Then after I get a good idea of how it all works, I'll start training my team on it and once they can do it well enough, I'd like to change to a lower cost consulting agreement.
This way you can still help us if we run into problems.
Are you opposed to this when you start that way?
9:57
I like it because you're starting with very clear intentions and you're saying, hey, I I'm going to commit to six months, this is what I want from you.
And I'm also saying I'm going to continue to pay you after the engagement's over for a much higher leverage, much more profitable consulting engagement.
So that's what a lot of agencies would ultimately want.
But I'm being clear about this is my intention.
10:14
And if I need to pay a little bit more than the agency fee up front, then I'm willing to do that.
I also understand that as I start to train my team on it internally, there will be a period of time where I'm paying both them and my team, so you're paying twice.
But The thing is, is that when you do that, you're actually building the enterprise value of your business and you're building the asset that you own rather than being reliant on somebody else who eventually could if you wanted to cut you off and then you'd be dead in the water.
10:40
Or what more realistically happens is they gouge you and they continue to raise their price because they can see how much money you're making from the thing, right?
And I get why they do it, but if you're the business owner, then you can protect both of you.
You say, hey, my Lt.
VS going to be way longer than me just trying to say that I'm going to do this and eventually canceling if you actually teach me how to do this and I'm not going to expect you to save my business.
11:00
I just want to learn how you do it.
And that in my opinion is the best working relationship.
And that's how I've had, that's how I've done it for the vast majority of the agencies I've done in any recent history.
I didn't know anything about YouTube.
I didn't know anything about short form content, reels, any of that stuff.
So I'm going to break down how I got a new platform so I knew nothing about in short and long form content quick wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
11:25
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, it'll take 10 seconds or one type of the tub.
11:44
It would mean the absolute world to me and more importantly it may change the world for someone else.
Let's start with long form, so long form.
Getting into YouTube, the first step I did was I hired what I would consider like a basic level agency, so like 3 to $5000 month agency and they just got me to commit to doing 3 videos a week.
12:01
And so I was like cool, I can do that.
That's pretty much what I was doing on my podcast.
So like I'll just give them to you.
And what they did was they just trimmed it, which means you take out the oohs and ahhs and you know put put an intro and a thumbnail and a headline like that was more or less what it was.
I would say it was a basic level of help on the platform and that's what I did.
12:21
And the main objective of that first phase was just giving me the basics of how just getting me involved in the platform and forcing me to create content on a regular cadence.
Like those are the 2 objectives and those were met.
The second phase was I had now more context and I had hired people on my team to start helping me do and replicate what that agency could do.
12:44
And so we very quickly wanted more quality in terms of edits and attention, which is fine because no business owner should change their business for one client.
And so it makes sense for both me and the small agency or for you and a small agency to part ways at some point when your demands for what you want exceed their capacity, right.
13:06
And so my internal team and our bar had had raised in terms of the quality we wanted to put out in the quantity etcetera.
And so we started editing stuff internally, but we still felt, even though we were better than the basic person, that we weren't better than the top creators.
And so then we went to what I would consider a much more premium agency.
13:22
And this is, we're talking to the tune of like 20,000 a month rather than like 3 to $5000 a month to help us create better thumbnails, better intros, pick better topics, better cuts, etcetera.
And so with that new agency, we ran the same play.
Hey, we want to learn from you, We want to understand why you're picking these things.
13:40
We want to understand the decision making process etcetera.
And then by six months in we say, OK, we've understood the SOPS, we understand the process and our team can now surpass your team in its creation of content or at least match it.
And then we can get those, those cost savings in each of those scenarios.
After we exited, I'm still on fine terms with the people who were there and if we had questions we could do that and we had consulting agreements that kind of bridge those gaps at the end there.
14:03
And that's how I did, that's how I grew my YouTube using HTC in the beginning to 1st get the basics, then become more advanced and then just start ideating on our own, which is once we've earned that right.
And now I'm pretty much just trying to network with better creators than me to learn what the 10 million guys do versus the 1,000,000 guys.
14:20
So now let's approach the same same concept but on different platform.
So I didn't understand TikTok at all.
I didn't use it.
I wasn't on it, etcetera.
And I didn't understand it short form either.
And so I actually had an agency reach out to me outbound, which is not common for me to accept that.
14:37
But they said, listen, I you do no work.
So from a value perspective, the offer was we you already have enough content out there I can repurpose it and make sure it's out of it.
And I was like, OK, sure, if you want to do all the work and involve me at nothing and just make content for me, sounds good.
And so that's what they did and they started getting traction with the short videos and we're like, OK, this stuff works.
14:57
And then for me, my, the director of brand actually had a super deep history on short form content.
And so normally I would have had that second phase where I would go for that premium agency, but that individual worked at a premium agency.
15:13
And so I actually got kind of like bought the SOP's automatically and we were able to massively scale our output on short content within six or so months of working with that original agency.
And again, we're on good terms with the person in the agency.
We don't work together anymore.
But I think the important part is if you set the expectation up front, which is I want to learn from you and I want to be transparent about my intentions.
15:35
And I want to eventually bring this in house because it's my belief that my team will understand, we'll be able to allocate more time to my thing and understand my brand better.
And if they had your skills, they will be able to do more output at higher quality than you could ever do.
And that's not an insult.
That's just a reality of time to money.
You have to make a margin.
15:51
I don't I'm going to cover cost and get five times more output.
And so that's fundamentally what we did there.
And that process is how we approached LinkedIn, how we approach podcast, how we approach paid ads, how we approach new methods, all of them.
I run the same playbook and this is what I believe has married the best parts of agency and the best part of building an enterprise and making a valuable business and avoided the agency trap that so many people fall into, myself included.
16:17
The other reason I like this method is that because you bring the agency on early you get better short term results so you get faster wins for your team.
So you get momentum, which let's be real, is important.
Like if you start doing a lot of stuff and you see nothing back it kind of sucks.
And so getting short term wins is important and you get that with the agency, but rather than have the drop off where they stop caring about you as much they assign some junior reps to your account.
16:35
You then by that point your team is good enough to keep that long term momentum and keep growing.
And so that's what I think is it maximizes the best of both when you get the short term from the agency and then you get the long term from the team.
And so last point is like why even bother building an in house team, right, Because why can't I just keep the agency?
16:51
Well for all the reasons I just said that's why I don't like the agency.
But from a business perspective, I want to build enterprise value because it is the fastest way to grow my wealth is tax free compounding of enterprise value, OK, in the business.
And if a business, for example, relied on 6 agencies in order to get to make its money, that would be a less reliable business than if all of those things were in house because it's much more on your control.
17:12
If all of those agencies either cut you off, you'd be screwed or gouged you to compress your margin, you'd also be screwed.
And so this gives you it de risks a future investor from purchasing your business and many times you might be that future investor, right.
But when we think about the value of a business, it's how likely are we able to sustain and grow cash flows over an extended period of time.
17:32
And so if you're relying on other people for your cash flow, that's a very big risk and that's what we try to pay down with this cost, which in the short term does cost you more, but long term you get way more back.
Now mind you, this may not be the traditional agency model, but both businesses do benefit, right?
17:50
They get a customer they otherwise would not have gotten and we get to make money, which is sorry, we get a money making skill from the engagement, not just the lead.
So the real thing we get isn't the customers we generate while working with them, but the skill to generate customers for life on whatever platform method I learned from them.
18:08
So how do you decide if using the agencies right for you?
First off, do you have more money or more time?
If you have more money, then that's what you're going to have to do.
If you don't have any money, then you got to learn it and it's going to take time.
And you know what?
That's part of life.
Everybody starts somewhere and usually you master one platform, you get some success, you get a little bit cash flow and then you can more quickly pay to learn the other ones.
18:28
You pay down your ignorance.
That's faster, right?
If you have the money and you're willing to lose it because the agencies aren't going to give you fast wins immediately, but they'll give you faster than you could on your own, then for me it's always worth paying on that debt.
In terms of the process, I outlined my entire agency seeking process in my book, and I also have my agreement framework in here that you can use for having the conversation with them, giving the terms what things I look for specifically, but with broad brush strokes.
18:54
Talk to a lot of agencies.
I would recommend talking to the most expensive ones, even if you're not going to work with them.
You will get an idea for quality and the things that they talk about.
If someone else isn't bringing up any of those nuances, you might be like, oh, this person has way more depth in their knowledge than this person and so you'll become a more informed consumer.
19:12
Which ultimately both you and the agencies should want that because if you are an informed consumer and then you make a purchasing decision, you'll be far more likely to stick with that decision for an extended period of time rather than getting over promised some expectation from a hot sales guy.
I say hot sales guy.
I mean somebody who's selling hot, to be clear, who's over promising.
19:30
It's called selling hot over promising to get somebody to buy.
You don't want to have that be your expectation.
That's being set because then you both are set up for for failure.
Next, you want to make sure that you have a clear deadline for when you want to make that transition.
And this is good for a couple reasons.
One is because it sets expectations with them.
19:45
They can also see the LTV and you can talk in terms of that, which is like, hey, I'm committing to six months, which let's say it's, you know, $6000 a month, I'm committing to $36,000, all right.
So like, you're going to get that for me as long as you're not an idiot, right?
Cool.
But the real real is that your team also knows that you're like, hey, we're one month down, we got to get that.
20:02
We got to understand the stuff in five months.
Hey, we're two months down.
We got to understand the stuff in four months.
And so it drives you towards the outcome of getting your team up to speed faster.
So having the deadline, I think it works great for both parties.
Now you have that deadline, but what if your team's not as good as theirs by the time the deadline comes?
20:17
Well, in my opinion, you either need to change the people or they're not teaching everything that needs to happen.
Because if they're low skilled, people are doing better than your team.
Somewhat some who is a problem, either them or you, right.
And so my belief here is like you might have to look at your people, but let's assume that the people are right.
20:34
And let me just a more complex platform, whatever.
I keep going until our team matches theirs.
Once our team matches theirs, then I drop it off.
We downgraded to a consulting agreement just for insurance.
And then one or two months later, if we feel like we're not learning anything on the calls that we have from a consulting perspective, we cut it.
And we do so amicably because we set that as the expectation.








0:00
Real quick wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the words.
We can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you.
0:16
Can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me, and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
And so if you have somebody on your team who is constantly talking negative, it's difficult for them to even see anything positive, and then they end up sabotaging themselves.
0:36
But you yourself have to think, or at least for me, you have to catch your own thoughts around that stuff.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:52
I hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
One of the things that came up from my sales guys on our side for Gem Lodge was that at this current period of time, there are there more gems that are getting on the phone and he's they described it as being reluctant to confront reality.
1:13
And I wanted to make something about that which is in the book good to great or great leadership.
I think is one of those books the author talks about Jim Collins.
He talks about some of the the character traits of good leaders and he talks about one dichotomy, which are two two kind of things that you have to balance back and forth, which is maintaining almost unreasonable optimism for the future while also confronting the brutal facts of reality.
1:38
And I think that as we develop as entrepreneurs, there's just fewer and fewer things that affect us because like, I'm sure right now.
So just to give you some hope and positive feelings about yourself right now.
Can you remember what your business was like maybe five years ago and the things that you used to stress about and the things that used to bother you, keep you up at night?
1:59
It might have been a one star review on Yelp or a a client talking shit or a trainer leaving and stealing clients or things like that, right?
And now, five years later, you've just you've weathered a little bit, right?
You just, you're like your skin's a little thicker and so not to go back to the talent.
2:18
Stacking kind of module of progression for entrepreneurs, but first you acquire skills, then you acquire character traits, and then you break beliefs, right?
And that's the cycle that continues to happen at each level.
And I think this one definitely falls under kind of a combination of beliefs and character traits.
But I think your ability to maintain neutrality is based on your ability to be optimistic and think about the things that are going to happen or things that you're currently working on, things you're experimenting on, things that you're hopeful for.
2:48
And holding on to that optimism is what allows us to then get into the mud and confront the brutal reality of a situation.
Because I think the easiest example that I hear of with especially small business owners is just like not knowing how much money you have in the bank account, not wanting to look at your P&L, not wanting to look at your profit, not wanting to look at your expenses.
3:09
And that's The Dirty work, right?
And that's and not look, not wanting to look at what your sales conversion numbers are, not wanting to listen to sales recording says you're afraid of how bad your sales team might be.
Just all the things like that where it's turning over the rocks and looking at the little wormy things underneath and being like, all right, I'm going to confront this.
3:26
I don't know if you've heard this saying with like doctors.
It's like there's no bad diagnosis.
And I think that the moral of the saying is that knowing that you have cancer, for example.
It doesn't ever not really benefit you.
It just hurts emotionally.
But the sooner you find out your bad news, the better it is.
3:43
And we have to rewire our brains to start loving bad news and trying to frame them as instead of problems, as really opportunities to come up with solutions.
And I think the best entrepreneurs, at least the ones that I aspire to be like, thrive under pressure and thrive in new and unfamiliar environments.
4:01
And to be really honest with you, I think part of the reason that Leila asked me to make this is that I've actually never been more calm and I've never been happier in my.
Or I can't remember a time more recently that I've been happier than I am right now than during this whole COVID mess.
And I think it's beautiful because it forces you to just focus on the only things that matter, and everything else just becomes some extraneous, and you get to have big new challenging problems that come up.
4:24
And so you get to really flex your entrepreneurial muscles, which is fun and exciting.
For entrepreneurs, if you have employees then you should understand that they definitely aren't comfortable like you are in change.
But we are though, because we're made from this cloth and that's what got us into this business to begin with is because we love the risk, we love the change, we love to be a certain, to a certain extent we love the gamble and I think that's ultimately what business is at large thing is just betting on you and betting on your skill set and it's like a poker game with an infinite board.
4:51
Anyways, I won't get into it, but I love it.
And so all that to say.
It's maintaining the dichotomy of being persistently and almost unreasonably optimistic with the ability to confront brutal facts.
And they go hand in hand.
And so if you have somebody on your team who is constantly talking negative, it's difficult for them to even see anything positive and then they end up sabotaging themselves.
5:11
But you yourself have to think, or at least for me, you have to catch your own thoughts around that stuff.
I don't really feel like I have them that much anymore to be if I'm being really truthful with you.
Like the negative thoughts around that stuff because I just, I love the stuff that we have going on.
And I don't know if you have this, but this has been something that's been really valuable for me is a board of all of the big ideas, like the big Alex ideas of things that could just drive massive opportunity for the gyms, could drive opportunity for our business.
5:38
And so I always have these things which are new and fun and exciting for me, and I balance those.
That work that I have to do with like the meetings and the one on ones and the doing reps and it just the the boring work, right?
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
5:55
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check on my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into, and if not, keep enjoying the show.
6:13
And I think you have to have both because doing the boring work like for example, and I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to potificate on this real quick.
I started taking over the daily call again within gym launch.
So that pretty much for all of our customers they can hop on a daily call with me every single day.
And it was something that we started four years ago and it has a lot of benefits because.
6:32
I have to.
It forces me to confront reality, all right?
I have my frontline customers on the call, and if they want to unmute themselves and tell me to go fuck myself, they can do that in front of everyone.
And so it forces me to solve problems in real time and it forces me to constantly confront reality.
6:54
I think a lot of people, a lot of businesses would be would would dread talking to their customers every day in a large, wide format.
But I will tell you that it has it, in no uncertain terms, has been one of the single cornerstone activities that I practiced over the last four years.
7:10
That has been, I think, one of the secrets to our success.
Because in taking those calls, I-1 knew exactly what the needs of a gym owner are today, right now, not last week, not an hour ago right now.
Two, I know the intimate pains that they are struggling right now.
7:28
Which allows me to improve my product at such a faster rate than anyone else does.
Because I can also test things on a daily basis.
Have five guys try one thing, five guys try another report back tomorrow rather than having to go all the way down through the chain of command, communicated them all the way back up and have that whole process take a month or six weeks.
7:45
And so the reason I think that Jim Watch has been able to consistently stay on top of an industry that typically very much cycles through quote gurus, right?
And it's been because we've been able to innovate solutions at a faster rate and we've been able to distribute those innovations across our community at a faster and more effective rate, number one.
8:04
And two, we are better able to communicate with our customers, right, and prospective customers, because we understand their pains now.
Why?
Because we talk to them every single day.
And if our product doesn't work, we know if there's a process, the process that needs to change.
8:21
Like it used to be like this and now it has to be like this.
We know and we find out before the six month lag time that it would take most entrepreneurs to see a huge spike in churn that then gets them wondering.
I wonder what this is right.
It's from a tactical standpoint how to use those two things together.
8:39
The unreasonable optimism with the confrontation of of brutal facts is 1.
The unreasonable optimism.
Have your list of release.
For me that works is having the list of of big ideas that I'm working on and pushing forward and then on the flip side.
Being able to confront the brutal facts of reality, which in one term can be knowing the numbers of your business, which if you don't, obviously you should do that.
9:02
But then also understanding that you need to hop on.
You need to be with the front lines and rub bet like kiss shake hands and kiss babies.
Not because you need to value your time.
Time's worth more than that.
It's not because you the value of the Intel of what is going to come to you in terms of the needs of the customer and how much your product can improve and where the opportunities exist.
9:23
Will far outweigh the cost of time that it takes.
And it also keeps your teeth sharp so that no one can sneak up from behind you and take you without, you know, under surprise.

24 Rules of investing.
These are all structured as If Then statements.
If we learn a principle, then we can continue to use that winning principle over and over again.
The reason some of the greatest investors publish books about their principles is because they know if people make the right decisions, they get the right outcomes over a long enough time horizon.
0:15
I'm Doctor Wuzzy and I make these videos because I hope that if you have a 3 million to $100 million company, you'll ask us to invest in it and we cannot grow.
And if you can't buy it twice, don't buy it once.
And realistically, probably 3456 times when I got into investing I used to think, oh I'm going to put like 1/3 into this and they're like, dude, no, your biggest allocation might be 10%.
0:34
Oh, if you can't buy twice, don't buy it once.
If you're worried about it, you can buy insurance for it.
You can get insurance on anything.
For example, people are like I'm afraid of running out of money.
You can literally buy money for the rest of your life.
0:50
You can literally give money and they will have a guaranteed income until you die.
Called annuities.
So if you have a specific concern, just buy insurance for it and know that it's covered.
If a deal feels like a Grand Slam, get a second opinion.
Whenever I'm looking at something and something looks amazing, I automatically send it to other people.
1:05
I must not be seeing something like I need someone else's eyes on this.
It's a good easy decision making rule for yourself, for investing.
And if you don't know how you can lose money, don't do it until you do.
There's always a way to lose money in the deal and you not only want to find a way to lose money, but you want to find all the ways you can lose money in the deal, right?
1:22
We're always controlling for the unknown or the unknowable.
We want to minimize that the highest degree possible.
So if you don't know how you can lose money, don't do the deal until you do.
If it feels rushed, don't do it.
A lot of people will try and apply pressure to you.
They're trying to say like, hey, do this deal with me, hey, give me this money.
1:37
Hey, can you lend me this thing?
If someone tries to pressure you, pause.
If you feel rushed, don't do it.
If you only have one deal on the table, don't do the deal.
Always have backup deals.
Imagine you're dating and there's only one girl on the planet.
You're going to find a way to think that that girl.
1:52
And if you know your gender is reversed, flip, right?
Whatever.
You know what I'm saying?
There's only one person on the planet.
Then you're going to find a way to make that work.
And so it's kind of the same thing with deals.
If you only have one deal on the table, you're going to keep telling yourself, man, maybe this is a good deal because you have nothing else to compare it to.
You always want to have a plethora of options to choose from, and until you get those many options to choose from, you don't move forward.
2:12
Because what happens is you artificially make that girl look a lot better, or that person or that deal looks a lot better when there's nothing else to compare it to.
If you buy with the intention of selling, you're not investing, you're trading.
Investing is about very, very long time rises.
It's a whole different set of rules.
Where you get in trouble is where you're trying to apply business stuff to investing or investing stuff to business.
2:32
Like they are different skills to master.
If we don't agree, we don't do it.
This comes into play when you have a partnership.
This has saved me so many mistakes is I'm usually the yes man.
I tend to see more upside and less downside.
Most entrepreneurial people are that way because we have to be because if we actually focused on the likelihood of success, which is usually low for most entrepreneurial things, you would never get started.
2:52
It's good A to have a partner who balances that B, they actually have to balance it.
If they're just a yes man and they always bend to your will, then they're not actually providing value.
There's a reason Yin and Yang are equally weighted in the symbol.
If you don't agree, don't move forward.
Even if I have decision making authority, I still won't move forward until we agree.
3:12
As a tangent into marriage stuff, we get asked this all the time.
They're like, well you know, push comes to shove, somebody has the upper hand.
Honestly, no.
We keep talking about until we agree.
We don't make the decision until we both agree.
And it's been one of the earliest pieces of advice we've gotten, and it's been one of the ones that paid us the most evidence.
If it's complicated, pass.
3:29
If it feels above your head, it probably is.
People want to feel fancy.
They want to get in the room.
They want to do these deals.
But if you don't get it, you're going to get fucked.
If you have complete understanding of something, the risk goes down because you understand the variables.
You're barely catching on.
You might as well be gambling, which is not the way to invest.
3:45
FOMO means slow down.
So if you feel that emotion, like I'm going to miss out on something, slow down.
This is a decision making variable.
When you feel that emotion, slow down.
These are principles.
You start flexing these like muscles, If this, then that, if this, then that.
It preserves your ability to make better decisions over time.
4:01
And if you apply all of these things to all the decisions you make, you will have outsize returns over a longer time rising.
No diligence, no deal.
If you don't get the information you need to make the decision, you don't make the decision.
And I know this sounds ridiculous, but many of you do this.
You just go off the hype.
4:16
You go off an e-mail or phone call, get the information you need.
No model, no deal.
If someone doesn't send me their proposal for how something's going to grow or how something's going to improve or how they're going to add value, then there's no deal.
I don't want to hear a story of it.
I want to see the math behind it.
4:32
I want to see the projections.
And then when I look at those things, I can make the decision like, is this reasonable?
What assumptions are this based on?
Do I think those assumptions are reasonable or probable?
And what information can I bring to this decision?
What are the things I need to believe that have to be true for this to occur if someones non responsive, No deal.
4:48
Communication is one of the most important things when you're doing any kind of business in general.
And I judge someone very quickly on how meticulous they are in their responses and how quick they are to respond in general.
Now if someone says, hey, I received your e-mail, I'll get back to you in two days and then they get back to me in 2 days, that's fine.
It's about expectation setting and expectation meeting.
5:06
I expect, especially in this process where I'm just getting to know you, what you say is going to happen, it's going to happen.
It's one of the easiest way to build a reputation is do what you're going to say, say what you're going to do, and if someone's not doing that with you, don't do the deal.
If it costs Peace of Mind, don't buy it.
5:21
So if anything cost me my sleep or something that I'm worried about as a result of me making an investment or a purchasing decision, I don't buy it because the cost is too high.
If it doesn't build your reputation, don't do it.
No neutral moves your brand.
5:36
Personally, Your reputation is the one thing that you take with you forever, and you absolutely can lose it, and it can be irreparably damaged.
I'd only do it if it builds my reputation.
When we do that, we continue to reinvest in our reputation, in our personal brand, which gives us compounding returns over our entire lifespan in terms of relationships, in terms of literally financial return in all other aspects of life.
5:59
Only invest if it builds your reputation.
If it doesn't build, don't do it.
No track record, No deal.
Performance over charisma.
The best predictor of future performance is past performance.
Sure, they have a model.
Fantastic.
They're allowing us to do deal.
That's great.
6:15
They're being very responsive.
Phenomenal.
But if they have no track record, might they be successful?
Yes.
But if I invest in every deal that doesn't have track record, is that a good way to invest?
Probably not.
Like Napoleon like to say, I'd rather have lucky generals.
Someones gonna probably do their deal.
Doesn't have to be you if it's the same thing you've always done well with do more of it.
6:33
We as humans or entrepreneurs, we like having variety.
The thing is, is that a lot of investing, a lot of compounding, comes from doing more of the same thing.
So it's like, hey man, I've done 3 hard money loans and they've all been awesome.
It's like, well then you should probably consider doing a fourth rather than starting to get into crypto day trading.
What happens is you start to build your own track record and so you can start looking back over your shoulder.
6:50
Be like, OK, let's look at all the things that I've done.
These have been the things that have worked well, maybe I'm better at this stuff.
And so that's the idea.
Once you find something that you're starting to get good at, do more of it.
Because The thing is, is that your luck will improve the more you do.
Always under borrow.
Any number no matter how big it is multiplied by zero is still 0I tend to be very risk averse when it comes to debt.
7:07
Debt introduces risk into any equation.
If you are going to borrow, then under borrow.
So even though you could juice your return by getting more, remember that there is a likelihood over a long enough time rising that if you over juice on a consistent basis you will get zero always under borrow.
Then you won't make as much money, but you won't lose it.
7:25
Ask stupid questions, define terms, draw pictures, see examples.
And if you can't draw it back, you don't get it.
I start every single call when somebody's going to bring me something.
I'll be like pretend I'm a golden retriever that doesn't speak English.
Walk me through this.
There's no advantage to somebody thinking you know more than you do not.
7:41
But there is advantages to you knowing more than they think you do.
Always play the fool.
If we're not in the GP, we're not in the deal.
Once you have 1020, you know, 30 million in investable assets, Just say I want a part of the GPI, don't know what the GP is.
It's general partner, limited partner.
7:56
The people with general partners are basically the people who run the things.
They get an extra slice of the pie versus the limited partners who actually invest the money.
We only do deals where we're part of the GP because I want to make sure that we have a part of the people who are really running this thing.
If it's a bad person, it's a bad deal.
Leila has an impeccable people picker.
It's unbelievable.
8:12
My entire relation, she's never been wrong and it's why I've been wrong all the time.
I'm like this guys.
Great layas never been wrong.
Bad partners.
Doesn't matter what the paper says.
Don't do it.
There are so many reasons you should not do a deal.
You'd be saying no way more.
You should be saying yes.
No contract, no deal.
This is a really important one for me.
8:29
Got to have contracts for everything.
Contracts serve the purpose of setting clear expectation.
What happens if you lose all my shit?
What happens if you don't do what you said you're going to?
What happens if I don't do what I said I was going to do?
What happens, right.
You got to walk through that.
If you can't walk through in the beginning, you're definitely not going to walk through it when it actually happens.
And anyone who says I only do handshake deals, I don't do contracts.
8:47
Run the other way.
Not once has someone approached me that way and they not being unbelievably shady.
If there's anything you get from this video, if someone says I don't believe in contracts, be like I don't believe in dealing deals without contracts, sorry, Clear expectations.
Good.
If you're the one people are doing business with, I like to pretend like the contract doesn't exist.
9:07
You absolutely want to be clear when you're writing the contracts and the terms, but then as soon as that process is over, live as though the contract doesn't exist.
Negotiate it as though it's the only thing that matters.
Let's say I have a services relationship that's a year long.
I want to mentally think even though they've committed to a year, I'm only week to week.
They don't have to pay me next month.








0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
Hold on everyone happy happy Monday.
Hope you guys have an awesome week so far.
I know it's July 4th.
So for those of you who are Just you know, enjoying the relaxing week then by all means do that.
But this one just came to mind.
And so I'd like literally just ran over here and also how to make this video.
0:33
So I'm hoping this will game you want to play.
And the reason I wanted to tell it that is that a lot of times Tony Robbins, wrote a book called money Master, the game, and one of the observations that he made was that billionaires and the wealthiest people in the world.
See money is a game, and we as humans, a lot of times, see things as games.
0:51
And so, the reason I'm asking what game do you want to play?
Is that a lot of people don't know what game.
They're playing and I've made videos about the infinite game for the finite game that people get into, but I wanted to talk about two different games today.
One is the game of your gym or your Fitness business, whatever, right?
1:08
And then there's the second game which is the game outside the game, right?
It's the game of what's up.
Billy the game of, what are you going to do?
Once you make this business, that you're wanting to make right?
And the reason I wanted to highlight that is that for me?
One of the reasons that I didn't make as much money as I wanted to make for such a long time was because I only had the game that I was playing, which was the game of the Fitness business, was the gym.
1:35
Business was Etc.
And I had no actual reason to make more money.
So I had this desire to make more money, but I didn't have a real reason to make more money.
I don't know if that makes sense.
So if right now you're getting by and you've been getting by your whole life, you need to have a reason to make more money.
1:54
And so in a lot of times, it has to be something that's bigger than you.
Another sounds like super like Tony Robbins you whatever but like it's true and the reason that Tony Robbins says like you have to fall passionately love.
Like almost romantically in love with your customers that if you aren't then there's no more reason for you to make any more money because you're already satisfied, which is why so many people are able to persist month after month after month and barely make it in barely make it and if you look at your past and you're like holy cow like I've barely made it.
2:25
Every single month, but you always make it but just barely, it's because you had no other reason to make money.
Now, here's something that's interesting.
The people the guys who are in this is just, like fact, the people who are married who have lots of kids, make more money because they have to, because they have to write.
2:43
And so, that's the first level of the game is, like, I have to make this this make enough money because I have this, this has to happen.
And so, they think that way, but I can tell you that, after that caps out, then there's than those guys stay in that next, Lane, right?
And so the only way to unlock this and I'm being really real with you and stuff, like this may not resonate with 90% of people watching this, but if it does resonate with you, I hope you take it to heart.
3:05
The reason that Jim watches exploded in was, is phenomenally more successful than my gyms were right?
I mean, just by Revenue, like it is, is because I love gym owners and I love gym owners more than I love weight loss customers, right?
And what's really weird about this is that because of my love of gym owners, I have actually Fallen back in love with weight loss customers I know that if I can help Jim owners better serve their win-loss customers, then I can help gym owners, right?
3:31
And so, it's this realization that I've had that like most people and most guys who are at we're girls.
Most people who are in the fitness industry got into it because they had a transformation and then it was like a skill that they could use.
And then one way or another, they start doing part-time and they're like, hey maybe I'll follow my passion, I love Fitness Bob on the get into it right now, they're in the business, but a lot of them don't actually love their customers, right?
3:51
It's just like it's their business and 95% of people Well, that's their life is.
It's just the way that they pay their bills, right?
But they don't actually love their customers.
Like I know this like I'm trying to not say this in a repetitive manner but like if you can unlock this I'd had a huge island in time to talk about this at Legacy and we called it weapons-grade compassion.
4:14
But if you can have weapons great compassion and you literally think like I have to own every part of this clients life in terms of like, I have to take full responsibility for their success.
You think about things differently?
Don't look at what your competitors doing you're looking at your customer and that's it, right?
That's it.
And if someone out like, and the reason that looking, your competitors will never work is because they're not going to ever send you money, your customers will write and they're like your your competition will never be loyal to you, but your customers will.
4:42
And so like if you can fall back in love with your customers, you can find like you will find a new pool on your life.
That will that will be something that's much bigger than you right much, much bigger than you and like, I have no need for the amount of money that comes to us.
4:57
I'm being really can't like I have no need for it like I try not like the amount of money that we make is, is insane.
It really is.
And I'm saying this not in any way to brag, but I'm saying it because the only way that would be possible is if the game that I started playing was not the game of of how can I make my business make more money, but it's how many people can we serve?
5:21
How many more gems can we help?
How many more gym owners?
Can we say, how many, how many more families?
I mean, more people can be employed as a result of the systems that we have, right?
Like Because once you satisfy your initial needs, unless you have a game outside of that, there is no other game, right?
That's it.
You keep and you keep barely getting by to keep barely getting by right and then if you have a couple kids then you keep barely getting by but a little bit more because you have to you have no choice and so the the flip is to figure out how you can have no choice to serve your end customer at a way that they've never been served before.
5:52
Seth Godin says serve caviar when everyone satisfied with cheese and crackers.
Right.
That's when every industry is able to be disrupted.
Every single industry is able to be disrupted.
The only reason word by grew as fast as we did, is because we did is because this industry is ready disrupted.
But so is every industry because customers believe it or not, I've been just eating cheese and crackers because that's what everyone else does.
6:11
And everyone gets in the industry.
They look, everyone else is doing and they start doing it but no one actually starts with the customer says, like, how can I reverse engineer their experience?
How can I make, how can I make this person's life better rather than always saying like man, my customers like they try and get out of contracts or like man they can't follow a simple meal plan.
6:26
Like how can they you have to reverse me?
Like how can I make this?
Easier because you don't get better by blaming anyone, right?
And so having that level of compassion and like, I don't know what the secret is.
I don't like I love gym owners because I am a gym owner and subscribe like, y'all are my people like you are me.
6:44
Like I like I feel you, which is why I like one of the big focuses that we're going to be doing in the next six months.
For, for our people is like, okay, we've mastered acquisition.
Like, we know how to build a ftes.
That's why I've already posted things on.
Like the average about a quarter million dollars a year, average GM.
Enters our ads, a Our million dollars in Revenue working with us average.
7:01
We know the acquisition funnel, but how can I get every single gym that works with us to over deliver their customers to such a degree that like they become remarkable like that people leave and they feel compelled to remark about it.
Like we still have more than half our business, that's word of mouth and I didn't have that.
7:19
When I had my chips, my half my business was not word-of-mouth.
It was based on marketing and sales and be straight up with you was.
And and I'm only sharing this with you because like I've only discovered it Now, in this business and I'm trying to hopefully pass on a listen that like, hopefully you'll take and use for your business.
7:36
If you can unlock, how much you can care about your customer, you will win and I promise you will never think about what, however, many gyms are in the area.
I don't think about how many the gurus or any other agencies or ruptured.
I don't care.
Like, it doesn't matter.
The only way that they will win is if they out serve us period.
7:52
It's always how it.
If you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
8:11
And like I said, the only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers of possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right, so please go do that now.
Then let's get back to the show.
Alright, like here's a concept for you.
8:29
That's kind of interesting.
Soul cycle, has no EFT zero.
The average Soul cycle and they're privately owned.
The average Soul cycle is 2.4 million dollars a year in Revenue. 2.4 million and they had zero recurring.
8:47
So what do they do?
How do they do it differently?
They started with their customer and they were like, how can we make the best experience humanly possible for someone to come into my gym, right?
And even treated that way, there's two women that made a gym for themselves.
They're like what would we want to do, right?
9:03
And in that sense they love that Customer because it's them.
And so for some of you who are like man, I just don't really like someone sometimes you gets tiring, right?
It gets tiring and you have to be mentally tough which is why businesses A game for the faint of heart, right?
Like you have to be mentally tough because you have to figure out how to get that stuff out of your head and continue to focus on.
9:21
How can I love this customer better, right?
So that SoulCycle right 2.4 million no EFT.
And all they do is they say taste our Kool-Aid taste, our food, you'll come back.
Do you think if you look at your business honestly that if someone were to taste or take a drink of your Kool-Aid, that they would come back and not only that, what they would come back, but that they would tell their friends about it.
9:42
After having their Kool-Aid and being like, Oh my God, this was amazing because that was the goal for the, if you listen to the founders of SoulCycle that was their goal for their experiences that they're, like, the way that will grow is if we can get people in here and if that, if that the only thing they can think about the rest of the day and that they tell everyone when they're at lunch when they're the water cooler, when they go home is like, oh my God, I tried this committee was unbelievable.
10:02
It was, it was, it was like, Nothing I've ever done before it was remarkable, right?
If you can think of.
Now if you're like, what I'm already doing that, we're already serving a customer if you actually have that response right now, you've already lost.
Yeah, because there's always more that you can do, you can also, like, and and the, in the people who are Kings of an industry and then fall or the ones who rest on their Laurels and don't forget that everyone someone will put you out of business every single day and it's whether you want it to be you or someone else, right?
10:31
And the only way to do that is to have a game that's outside of your game of barricades.
Surviving and you have to flip that Survival game from like I have to provide for me to.
I have to provide for them then being your customers, right?
And you have to love them in a way that they won't like that.
No one else loves them, right?
10:46
Seriously.
And you have to like, get into this place of deep empathy of like how can I care for these people?
And if you do that, I promise you, I promise you that you will make more money.
Your employees will be more fulfilled.
And the crazy thing is that when you make that money, when you finally make that switch, the money will be the last thing that you care about people, talk.
11:04
Talk about this and I like they do people talk about all the time, all the big gurus are on the on their chairs and Ivory Towers talking about, you gotta love your customer but it's because there's like there's a lack of words for trying to figure out how I can how you can say that, like it's ownership, its huge ownership over their experience that will help you win and it's not even about winning.
11:24
It's just about serving and when you do serve more, you do, one more just is what it is.
So, man, I was a little bit of ramp, but that like the only way to win this game, Mmmmmm, which you shouldn't be trying to win is by not winning the game.
It's not about this game, it's about the next game.
11:39
It's about the game that pulls you and if you can't tap into that, then in some ways you don't deserve the next level.
Because you weren't serving your people the way that you should be.
You know, and that's okay.
Because the market will always reward the person who is so just being real with you.
11:59
So if you like man I'm so overwhelmed don't even know how I could think about it.
So is every other business owner so don't give that as an excuse because so what it's one of those like give he's like and and what do you do, you know?
12:15
So anyways guys, thanks for tuning in II.
Appreciate it on a Monday.
But if there's any take away from this, it's that like, if you Like you've persisted and you've stayed, you've barely scrape by every single month.
It's usually because you don't have another reason to make more money and the only reason that I think that has ever gotten someone above like a hundred grand a year because that's where most people are just comfortable, like you can get to 100 Grand a year because you satisfy all your needs with that.
12:39
Most people write node.
As you can satisfy your needs with that, but if you want to make million dollars, 10 million, 50 million, take home.
You don't do it for you.
You can like there's there's just like no selfish and maybe there is.
12:54
I don't know, I just don't understand it.
I don't.
And every person that I've talked to, who makes gobs and gobs and gobs of money, Thinks that same way, all they think about all day long.
All they obsess over is like, how can I fix this next problem?
How can I over-deliver?
How could like fixing problems is, the easiest thing is like, what?
13:10
Look at all of your customers and think, and ask.
What are you struggling the most with their?
Like, I just can't get to the gym.
Cool.
What are 10 ways you can fix that problem?
And they thing is that people, no people, no people.
No.
Like you can't fool anyone?
No one's fooled, right.
David Ogilvy said thing.
13:27
Consumer isn't mindless or the consumer isn't.
Stupid.
She's your wife, right?
Like people aren't dumb.
People know when people are legit people know when they're actually trying, right?
Like in sometimes, if you fail, when you're trying people, forgive people were like, well, well, I mean, I know where his heart was.
13:44
Right.
They said because intentions matter man.
So yeah, that was, that was my little my little rant for today.
So figure out what you need and figure out how you can tap into a much larger thing than you.
Because if it's just to satisfy your initial needs, they'll be satisfied.
14:00
Quickly.
This might be for people who are like right at barely or they're above barely surviving.
Now they're like we're comfortable, you're not going to get above comfortable unless you have something that's much bigger driving you because it takes a lot of discomfort to get to somewhere that's much bigger than that.
And the only way that you're going to get there is by having something that pulls you in a way that nothing else pulls you.
14:19
And that's usually a solvent like, Tony Robbins, gets up and like cries on stage every time, because he genuinely just wants to change.
Everyone's life who's in the room?
He does, right?
And if you've ever met Tony drive it two times, It's him like it's through and through.
14:34
That's who he is.
He literally just wants to change everyone's life.
And so he continued to pour through all these books and do all this.
If you just wanted to be comfortable, make money, who would have done that with just a normal average business?
Because most average businesses would sound process, this can make money as long as the model makes sense.
You can do it, right?
And we help with all that stuff, but like, if you want to get to that next level, like the real next level, like the real players, you have to figure out weapons, great compassion.
14:55
You have to figure out how to care more because That's the game.
So anyways, guys, have an amazing day.
Catch, you soon.
And like this one.
So other people see it.
You can't shoot it up.
She did.
All right.









0:00
You're not going to build like the massive massive fortune unless the thing you sell is good.
And So what happens is most entrepreneurship promotional promote too soon and then they have to fight this uphill battle for the rest of their existence.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:21
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Are there particular things that that you see?
I mean just even even looking, I got an entrepreneur's calendar where you're like, OK, well, that you can tell right away, OK, this is not optimized or the focus isn't in the right place.
Like what?
What types of things take out?
Well, the single commentary that every entrepreneur has to get over over time is relinquishing control.
0:44
So entrepreneurship is a continual giving up of control at all levels.
And so whatever they're doing is usually the thing that they need to be able to give up and transfer to somebody else in order to get further and further above the business and get more leverage.
And so in the beginning, you have to give up delivery or you have to give up selling or you have to give up promoting, you have to give up something or administrative tasks.
1:03
And you look at your calendar and you say which of these things is most easy to replace in the marketplace and is the cheapest one that I can replace.
And you replace the first one that gives you the most time for the least amount of money, then you're like, great.
Now I should fill my time up with the thing that makes me more money and fundamentally that is the game, is you just continue to trade up the time until you have bought all of your time back and then you can just do all the highest level Jack leverage activities and leverage just being defined as getting more for what you put in.
1:29
Yeah.
Now, now, this is a concept that I think when people hear it, they they probably will nod along.
And yet you and I both know this.
I think so many entrepreneurs struggle with it and struggle with that relinquishment of control.
No one can do it as well as they can.
No one can do it, you know, quite the way they do.
What's the answer there?
Like, how do you get somebody to the point where they actually start doing it?
1:46
Confrontation.
This is why you're poor.
Like, we can.
I mean, you can keep doing what you're doing.
It's just you're going to keep getting what you're getting.
And so the question is whether you want to keep getting what you're getting or you're willing to change something.
I mean, it's the same as somebody trying to lose weight, saying I want to keep eating the same diet, but it might look the same.
2:02
You're like, yeah, so you have a diet of time that you continue to eat or let something else eat your time every single day.
And you expect the outcome to look different.
And it's just not true.
And so I think just a very logical breakdown where someone has to, you have to confront it, you have to confront reality.
And a lot of entrepreneurs are delusional sometimes in a good way.
2:18
You know, you have to be optimistically delusional in some in the certain capacity to be an entrepreneur.
But a lot of times that delusion takes control and they believe the false statements that you just said.
Right, which is like no one can do it, like I can do it, I'm irreplaceable, etcetera, etcetera.
But like every single human on planet Earth is replaced in 100 years.
2:35
Yeah.
And the likelihood is that if you were doing it and you're also doing other things and then somebody doing full time what you're doing will be better than you are.
And I can virtually guarantee that 100 people doing full time what you're doing are going to be better than you are.
So it's a little side the side quest here.
A lot of entrepreneurs learn the wrong lessons from experiences.
2:53
So we talked about having experiences earlier, right?
And they make the lesson, etcetera.
But The thing is that most people learn the wrong lessons.
So I'll give you an example.
A small business owner hires the first salesperson.
They're like, I'm going to give up control of sales.
I'm going to give to this person, they're going to start selling.
And of course the person takes OK, because they also don't know how to hire a bandage, recruit, train sales people, because they don't have that skill set yet either.
3:10
But they bring this person on.
The person fails, right?
There's lots of lessons you can get from that.
But one lesson that's common is that sales people don't work right.
Or no sales person can sell like, I can't, right?
And so then as soon as they have that belief forever, until that belief is changed, they will not make more money.
3:28
And The thing is, is there's a lot of those salesman beliefs at every single level of entrepreneurship.
But the correct lesson is phrasing the thing that didn't work as deficiency personally, which is OK, this salesman didn't work.
I do not know how to.
3:43
And then insert the problem.
Recruit, hire, trained, manage a salesperson.
Great, that's solvable.
Let's go solve that.
And then that is the process all the way up.
But you have to admit it.
It's like a a right.
You got to admit you have a problem.
3:59
And until they do.
And that's where the humility comes in into play.
And that's what that's what plateaus many entrepreneurs.
So they cannot admit that anyone else could do better than them and most people would do a better than you.
And I think it's much better belief like everyone could do everything better than me.
It's great.
I'm not needed.
And that's the point.
You want to own the business, not have the business owned you.
4:16
It's it's it's interesting.
It's like so many entrepreneurs I meet.
I don't know if this direct correlation exists, but it seems like the more successful they are.
I mean, when you really start getting up there, eight figures, 9 figures, 10 figures beyond, it's like you start to see greater levels of humility.
And I wonder if to an extent, and this doesn't apply to everyone, but it's always striking to me how someone can still have ego.
4:34
If if they have built a business from nothing and just this is the humbling process of even building an organization.
The lessons you have to learn how you know just the the challenge that you experience the pain you know in in in in many cases that to to come out of that with ego.
But yet the ones that know all the answers have it all figured out.
4:50
Now I'm good.
I already read that book.
I already you know, I already heard that.
Like they're they're the ones that seem to be struggling the most.
I agree.
I also think that you can have situational ego.
So 'cause there are definitely some very wealthy people who are very successful, who do have egos, who are a soft mate like I I can attest to that.
5:07
There are, there are also many, many, many who are very humble in general, but I think it's also domain specific.
You know, if you can be humble, humble in business and and arrogant with women, you can be arrogant with your physique, but humble, you know what I mean?
So I think I think it's much, it's a little bit more nuanced overall.
5:23
That being said, there's totally people who are arrogant in everything they do, but I do think that it's more domain specific and even within the business, somebody might have an ego around how good they are at marketing, but not an ego around how good they are at HR, right?
And so it really comes down to how do they associate their self worth with something, however close the action is to the association they have with their identity and their worth, the harder it is to peel away from their grip.
5:49
Like a lot of entrepreneurs who are promotional or product driven entrepreneurs don't have any problem outsourcing finance.
Like, it's not like they don't have a huge thing with that, right?
But they have a huge problem if someone wants to take over product or take over promotion or whatever for the business.
And so it's because they just derive their soft worth from that.
6:04
And so that's that's why a lot of the entrepreneurship is a head game.
Yeah.
And I'm curious, I mean now with with acquisition.com and by the way, just at the time when you were launching that company and starting it, how much was the domain, by the way?
Like, was this, was this like a big, big investment just to get the domain or was it just it's 370,000?
6:24
OK, OK.
Obviously at this point it's been worth it, but what?
What was your vision for acquisition.com?
I wanted it to be the family office for, you know, Leila and I to invest our capital into businesses that we believed in with founders that we thought were awesome and products that we believed, you know, we're going to help people.
6:40
And so that's more or less what we've done.
And the whole idea was, I wonder if we can build a personal brand where people would listen to our content and say, hey, I want to work with these guys.
And So what happens is that the goal was that it would create a a somewhat of a pre filtering process for values because if you can get values alignment it's a lot, it's kind of like the marriage thing like if we have similar missions, similar values it's a lot easier to get along.
7:00
That was a theory.
I didn't know if it was going to work but it it it certainly has.
We get a lot of companies every day that that reach out to us that you know we're looking for investors to either buy you know a minority or a majority stake in the company to help them scale which is very much what we do.
So we are we are active in our portfolios.
7:16
So our that's, I mean that's where we make our money is actively growing the companies themselves and recruiting in great people to help scale the businesses.
And it it, it seems like this is kind of like a forever venture for you and in in in many ways, I mean obviously you know you'll love building businesses, but this gives you a a way to scratch that itch in in so many different industries and verticals.
7:37
And so the best businesses have a compounding vehicle built into them and most businesses don't, which is why most businesses are not the best businesses, right.
And so you can have a compounding vehicle in terms of capital as in like there's an allocation of capital that can that exists within the business.
7:54
Like every time we open up a new facility, we get 50% on our money.
And so the question is how many times can we open up new facilities?
Like that would be an example.
If we have customers, let's say if it's a national thing rather than, you know, brick and mortar locations.
If every time a customer comes to us, they bring another, you know, 1.3 customers, then we know that over time, no matter how big we get, as long as we retain the quality of our of our deliverable, we will get more and more people who will continue to come to us.
8:20
The other way to do that would be you have people who always keep selling for you.
So even if you were, let's say, let's say you sell solar, right?
It's transactional, people aren't really going to get a second roof.
But if you as the business owner know that every salesperson brings you 2 roofs a month, then your compounding is on the actual sales people themselves.
8:39
And so you go from having two people who get you two ribs a month to 8 people to and every every month you keep bringing them on and then they become a consistent production.
But the number of salespeople compounds.
And so those are the only ways to build forever businesses.
Those are the types of businesses that we are interested in is in 30 years will this thing be massive?
8:57
And if that's true, then all we have to do is wait.
Yeah, and.
And it seems that you're especially passionate about.
Great products, products that you know do a great job to almost that they they do the marketing for you and and then ultimately scaling through through customers, customers referring other customers, it's easier.
9:14
I mean so it's selfish, it's just it's a it's the lazy man's way of doing it.
It's long term lazy.
It's short term effort, but it's long term lazy.
Because think about this way, I could spend 2 years perfecting a book, right, And making it amazing and really put a pouring my heart and soul into it.
9:32
And then after that two years release it and then for the rest of time have people who buy the book tell other people about the book.
And so I spent two years.
But then from that point, going forward, customers market everything for me and everything that comes in off of the book is profit, right?
9:47
The flip side is that I spend two months writing a book that's decent but not great, and then I have to spend the rest of my life promoting it.
And then in so doing, I also get lots of people to find out that I have a mediocre book.
It just makes less sense.
But The thing is, is it just takes so much more time to front load that effort to make an exceptional product or service that most people aren't willing to do it.
10:07
And so most people's products like the real big obvious answer of why people don't make more money is they're just not that good.
And specifically from an ego perspective, they're just not as good as they think they.
Are so, so how do you, I mean is there a balance or how do you know when something is ready like essentially if you're trying to make something perfect that can you can run into procrastination?
10:29
I'm seeing this right now.
I'm working on a second book.
I didn't, you know, I didn't know anyone read the first book.
It turns out a few people read the first book.
So now I'm trying to make the second one, you know, even better, 'cause now, like, OK, people are going to read this thing I know you're working on on your next book as well.
At what point do you know?
OK, this this is ready when for me there was nothing left to do.
10:46
Like anything else that I would add or subtract to, it would make it worse.
Now that's not always the case.
You know what I mean with a like a book is a very defined, literally has bookends, right.
There's beginnings in it.
But if you have a software product for example, I sure there's more from a from a conceptual perspective as an ideal.
But like the idea is to have a consistent cadence where you're improving the product on an ongoing basis, right.
11:06
And so but The thing is just front loading that because until you have the product market fit, until you have a certain percentage of people who are or bringing their own friends to try your thing, it's still not right.
And So what ends up happening is that especially if you have a promotion driven entrepreneur so somebody really understands how to market and sell.
11:24
This is where I don't wanna say it gets dangerous.
It's just that you can make a few million dollars, $10 million being really good at marketing and sales and so you could become a multi millionaire doing that.
It's just you're not going to build like the massive massive fortune unless the thing you sell is good.
11:39
And So what happens is most entrepreneursure promotional promote too soon and then they have to fight this uphill battle for the rest of their existence.
And the and The thing is is it gets reinforced because they get better and better at marketing.
And so they market more and more and more and more at some point especially if it's like D2C.
So like you know directly into network products, you go into colder and colder audiences who are less and less likely to buy your thing.
12:01
And so your cost to acquire continues to rise overtime because also advertising costs only go one way which is up just the cost arrival.
And so you've got multiple forces that are going against you that are decreasing your profitability.
And unless you have a concurrent force or something that's going in parallel with that growth, which is your customers bring you other customers to decrease that cost of acquisition, you eventually hit a plateau where you can do lots of revenue and not a lot of profit and you can't grow from there.
12:24
And that's where sometimes you have to have hard conversations with an entrepreneur and be like this thing just isn't good enough and we need to maybe dial back a little bit.
And so like the original idea of getting your first acquisition channel going, whatever it is, is not to then scale that.
The idea is that you get enough customers in that you can get feedback, continue to improve the product and then once you get enough people referring and bringing friends, which is my litmus test for it, is good enough, then you scale it.
12:47
Now you still consistently want to make it better and better and better absolutely.
But a litmus test is am I getting referrals.
Once you have that then all of your marketing efforts from there on out are going to be enhanced and then that's what's going to allow you to out compete your competition who wasn't so long sighted and always just wanted to make the next buck.
Real quick guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
13:12
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post.
If you do that, you'll mean the world to me, and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
13:32
Speaking of competition, how do you view competition?
I mean, I just.
I remember you mentioned the story the of the gentleman that kind of screwed you over early on.
Although at this point you know I almost feel sorry for them, right.
Because if they kind of hung in and things have probably gone much better for them just to just seeing your rise.
But it it seemed like you never were vengeful about it.
13:47
You know you you always just had to move forward and I imagine just in your different businesses you've had your dealings with various competitors.
Some say you know the the steeper the climb that you know the the sharper the knives.
Like what?
What is what's your thought on competition?
So you know, one I, I love this quote.
I think the first time I heard it was from Brick War as a pastor, he said anger is like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies.
14:07
And so it just like it doesn't serve you.
There's so many times, I think many of us have had these experiences where you just obsess about being angry at someone and how could they?
How dare they?
And most of anger comes from ego.
Go back to the humility thing, which is like, I just you fundamentally think you deserve better, right?
14:23
If you don't think you deserve anything, then a lot of times it can diffuse a lot of the situations because you're like, well, in 500,000,000 years this probably won't matter.
And if you scale out wide enough, the earth doesn't look like anything but a speck of dust or even you can't even see it.
And so it just gives a little bit of perspective on like, how much does this really matter from a competition perspective?
14:41
There's an obsession with small business owners around competition.
And I would say that like most small business owners look at other small business owners and see them as competition, but like, they are not competition.
Usually both people just have shitty products, which is why they have small businesses.
And so I would say obsess over your customers, not your competition.
14:59
The competition takes care of itself.
And as an aside, it's interesting because again, this is kind of a more of a small business or perspective, but like the private equity in the, in the investment world, if they see three companies that serve a similar avatar, they just buy all three and combine them.
And so like as much as you might have a blood feud with this person, like the person who's a level up from you just sees it as three different cultures that serve the same avatar with slightly, you know, slight differences and then they merge them into a much bigger company that has, you know, obviously doesn't always go that way.
15:28
There's cultural differences, blah, blah, blah, etcetera.
But I think just seeing it like that, I've seen so many competitors who like you know wanted to kill each other.
And even even in the in the Jim Lynch world, there was a guy who was he considered himself to be a competitor of ours.
And I reached out to him and he thought that I had some like I'll intent and like now we're we're decent friends.
15:46
But he's like I always hated you and I was like, yeah, I didn't think about you.
Well it's these one way you know like obsessing over things that are happening only in the entrepreneur's mind.
And I think that that is the biggest cost of competition is the obsession over what everyone else is doing rather than taking that same obsession and applying it to your customers.
16:03
And that would make you more money.
Yeah, I've heard you say, like, I know a lot of this is a mental game.
People thinking about, well, what's somebody going to think of me?
What are they going to think of my decisions, my choices, if I do this, if I go left, if I go right.
And I think you said something along the lines of, you know, one day you're going to pass it's it's, you know, it's going to be your funeral and then, you know, there's going to be people who don't make it just because something came up that day.
16:22
Yeah, they made people want to eat, people who are arguing over who gets what.
Most of the people that you met your entire life are going to make it.
And so like, and I mean it, it's kind of like, I mean, I I made this tweet and it went really viral.
But you know, the Queen of England died, I think like eight or nine months ago now, You know, she amassed more wealth than 99.99% of the population.
16:42
She was a monarch for 70 years, which has to be a close to a record.
She did it as a female, which is even more amazing from the times that she came in to power and whatnot.
And whoever's listening to this probably hasn't thought about the Queen of England.
And she was, you know, one of the old time goods of just like success, if you want to define it that way.
16:59
We're so self-centered that we assume that everyone's going to cry when we die, but most of us won't even be remembered for six months.
And so I think we have all this irrational fear around taking bigger swings, doing the things that we want to do, making whatever dreams we have real or at least giving it a shot.
We play these these videotapes in our minds of these future scenarios where people who aren't thinking about us are saying things that they're not having thinking because they don't care about you and they think about themselves.
17:21
And so it's like no one's thinking about you, and I think getting over yourself is a really good way to be able to have more personal freedom in the choices we make and take on big risks.
Yeah.
And I want to get your take on on AII know, I know you've you've posted a bit about this.
17:37
I want to get your perspective now.
I think when you post it one time it's about ChatGPT 3 and now we're GPT 4, maybe you know we'll we'll be on to the next one soon enough.
Like how do you think?
I mean, if a lot of people listening to this podcast, they're they're running a law firm, professional service based business, Like how do you think it'll impact those types of businesses?
17:54
It will.
It will impact those businesses.
I'll just say my two cents, which is the people Who Will Win.
I mean, this isn't even my quote, but like you're not gonna get replaced by AI.
It'll get replaced by somebody who knows how to use your AI better than you.
And that's like the the short to medium term.
I mean AI is scary, man.
18:10
I think it's a big black box.
I think humans are exceptionally bad at predicting outcomes.
I mean even if you'd asked two years ago which jobs AI is gonna take first, people would have said blue collar would have been you know drivers laborers etcetera.
And it actually went all the way to top to the most creative jobs.
It went to you know video and images and design and text.
18:26
And so I think we're really bad at predicting what's going to happen from a risk adjusted basis.
You know the investment feels not worth it and I know that that's really country Orient I'll say it this way as like AI has the possibility to really amazingly improve humanity and we know that technology does not change our subjective well-being one bit.
18:44
So we're just as happy and unhappy as we were.
If anything, we're a little bit less happy with more technology.
And on the downside risk is all humans are gone.
And so the upside is we're just about as happy as we are now and the downside is we're all not here.
And so for me, if I were just to look at it from a risk adjusted basis, I probably wouldn't make that bet.
19:02
That being said, the cat is out of the bag and now we have to play the cards for belt.
And so I think for everybody who is listening, it would behoove you to spend your weekends learning how to prompt the engineer staying up to date with the new plug insurance and overlays and auto, GPT and AVAGI and all these things that are coming out.
19:18
Because if you aren't, your competitors are.
And The thing is the scale and speed of these is so robust, it will be able to compress progress that used to take years into weeks.
And so if someone has a little bit of an edge, it might be a lot of an edge really quick.
So don't sleep on it.
19:34
Yeah, Yeah.
I think it's it's it's the rate of improvement that's.
That's in in almost like the unchecked rate of improvement.
That's either the the most exciting or in in some cases, the scariest aspect of it.
And yet, like you said, I mean the cat's out of the bag at this point.
It's, you know, it's here and just learn and leverage it.
What about any other skills that you you believe like, just are valuable for people to develop?
19:54
I think having the mindset that character traits that are desirable are not actually traits, they're skills.
Because if you were to say like somebody who is honest or somebody who is persistent or someone who's loyal, you're like, what does that mean?
What means is somebody who acts in this way and under these circumstances.
And so if you can act in this way, under these circumstances, that means you can expose yourself to these circumstances to act a certain way.
20:15
And that means you can learn it.
And so traits are learnable.
You're not born with them.
You learn them, you reinforce them over time, and then you become different.
I use quotes here because you behave differently.
And so I think I'll leave with this.
Intelligence is a rate of learning.
20:35
It's a speed.
How quickly do you learn?
And then you have to define learning.
Learning is same condition, new behavior.
So if I say, hey, when I show you this red thing, I'm going to slap you and I show it, and then I slap somebody and then I show it, and then I slap them on the third time I show it to them and they duck, right?
20:51
Same condition, new behavior.
They've learned somebody who's smarter, I show it once, and on the second time I go to slap them and they duck.
So they have more intelligence.
And so, if you want to be smarter, the key is to change your behavior faster.
21:08
And so I think in that way it operationalizes knowledge.
Probably a lot of lawyers are big readers and they love, you know, the mental masturbation of, like consuming stuff.
But if your behavior does not change after you go to a workshop or a seminar, you listen to this podcast.
21:24
If your behavior doesn't change, you learned nothing, which means you are not that smart.
I love it.
I love it.
What's the day in the life like right now for you?
I mean, I I read you don't have any hobbies.
You don't golf.
Like what?
What are you up to?
Just business stuff for the most part.
21:39
I mean, you know today I was talking to a buddy of mine who works for public CEOs and I was bouncing some ideas off of him in terms of like our investment thesis and kind of our portfolio strategy.
And then I had a meeting a portfolio auto.
So it's just like looking at the some of the companies that we have and some of the issues that are coming up and kind of how we're going to resolve them and allocate resources around those.
21:59
A meeting with a book manager for the next book launch that's coming out, just making sure that our order quantities are right and then we have the right mix, you know, between you know, paperback, hardback, you know is the, is the shipping guy ready in terms of like what's expected volumes.
You know from there I have this podcast and so it's a mix back for me.
22:16
For me mostly my mornings are working on one big thing for a very long period of time.
So the book was my first six hours every day for the last two years.
That's done now.
So now it's just getting into the kind of the promotional cycle for that book and making sure it gets printed and shipped and all that kind of stuff.
Once that book launches, I'll probably be allocating all of my first six hours of the day to some other very big project.
22:35
But that's fundamentally I work on very few things for a long time.
Yeah.
And it seems at this point like if your your motivations perhaps have changed.
I don't know if you're running away from anything at at this point.
I don't know.
You're trying to prove anybody wrong.
Like what's what keeps the fire burning, what keeps you excited, what keeps you energized?
I mean, it's it seems like it's not the money you already have that.
22:52
So what?
What keeps you going?
I like it.
I think that's it.
I just like it.
It's what I look forward to doing.
I write books about business.
I draw pictures about business.
I make videos about business.
I do business all day.
I enjoy it.
It's what I enjoy doing and I just happen to be fortunate in the thing that I like, happens to be, you know, valuable to a marketplace that exchanges money.
23:13
If I liked gardening, I would be, I'd have a super duper garden.
I know, I don't know if I'd make as much money, but I would.
But that that's pretty much it.
I'll leave with this.
I had a mentor really early on in my life and I had a really good weekend, right?
And I just everything was like perfect.
That weekend.
I was telling her how how my weekend had been and she was like, I'm pretty sure the key to life is stringing as many of those days in a row as you can't.
23:34
And it just kind of stuck with me because it operationalized, improving, subjective well-being, which is like if I do the things that I like with the people that I like as many days in a row as I can, I'll probably end up OK.
And that's pretty much what I've tried to look.

Real quick wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys is that you help me spread the words.
We can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
0:19
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It would mean the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
And when you play in the big game of paid ads, expect to lose more times than you win.
But when you win double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, 1,000,000 fucking percent down on it and scale the hell out of it, 'cause that's how you make it back.
0:42
Welcome to the game where we talked about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
What I want to walk you through is kind of my three-step process for how I've scaled ads in all of our portfolio companies, companies that I've owned majority of outright or minority of.
1:05
And for a little bit of context here, between our portfolio, we spend over $150,000 a day in paid advertising and I have a lifetime return in my own personal portfolio of 36 to 1.
Meaning for every $1.00 I spend, I get $36 back.
All right, So I'm trying to help you do it.
1:21
This is how I think through it.
Phase one is that you have to track money, right?
And so the idea is that you don't spend a dollar before you know where the dollar was spent and be able to track that it came back from wherever you spent it.
As silly as the sounds, this is what the majority of people don't even do.
1:37
They don't even track their ads spent.
So even if they are doing well, they have no idea that they're doing well.
So that how could you possibly know if your ads are working right?
It's like going to the casino and making bets without knowing the odds.
It's a great way to get cleaned out right?
So you have to know your odds.
You have to track how much you're spending versus what you get back.
1:55
And if you're curious about how to do that, there are different CRMS and there are different software tools that you install.
And if you're like, I don't know how to do that, that's how you Google how to install tracking pixel name of software.
All right.
That's why we have this beautiful video World of education.
It's wonderful.
2:11
All right.
Now the cool thing is, is that most advertising platforms want you to track because they know if you track you'll spend more money and so they have lots of free trainings that are there.
Because the nice thing is it's not a very hard setup because if you look online it takes 5 minutes to set up tracking pixels the right way and you're off to the races.
But if you're afraid of computers, a welcome to the new world, but B you should know how to do this stuff, especially if you're going to be in the paid ads world.
2:32
Phase two is my favorite phase is the lose money phase.
So once you track, you're able to track your ads.
What's the next actual thing you do?
You spend money, and you're not gonna immediately make money back with any advertising, so you literally lose money.
First, I want to emotionally prepare you to lose money because that is what advertising is.
2:49
In a short enough time horizon, you lose money.
So the question is just how long it takes you to get it back.
AKA your payback period will predicate how good you are at advertising because the fast you can get it back, the more you can advertise and the more you advertise, the more people know about your stuff.
The more people know about your stuff, the more people buy it.
3:06
And so different way of thinking about this is thinking about investing in a money printing machine.
So imagine you've got this printing press and you have to go buy pieces of the machine.
It's like, OK, I got to go get ink, OK, I got to get some wheels, oh, I got to get that paper.
So and then eventually you have this money printing machine.
You're buying the mistakes until eventually you have the system down.
3:22
Once you have the machine that prints you $10.00 for every $1.00 you put into it, what's your marketing budget?
As much money as you possibly can pour into it.
And many people have made their money in real estate, made their money in stocks, made their money in crypto.
I've made my money advertising and the interesting thing from a human behavior perspective is that when you advertise, you lose more times than you win in terms of quantity.
3:41
So if I run 10 different ads, I expect to lose 9 times out of 10 before I find my winner.
And just FYI, the bigger you advertise, the more you're running 99 to just get one mega winner because most people think that their advertising can't scale.
What it really is is that mediocre advertising can't scale, but exceptional advertising can.
3:58
Often times people only run one ad, they lose, and they think that they suck.
Facebook or meta Whatever, Did a meta analysis.
Double meta of top advertisers on the platform.
The top .1% of advertisers on Facebook split test 11 times.
4:13
More ad creative like success leaves clues.
These guys just get it.
They're like, Oh well, in order for me to spend way more money, I need to make way more creative to get the right people in front of the right message.
That is the difference between the pros and the not pros.
And the key point is that you will lose more times than you win.
4:30
But when you win, you win big and you will be able to win back all that you lost.
It's the difference in a casino and advertising is that with enough skill you can become the house.
Someone will walk you through a little money.
Example, so let's say I spend 1000 bucks on 10 ads, so 100 bucks an ad, and after that I lose on nine of them.
4:47
So I lost $900 and on one ad I get $200.00 back.
So most people would look at that campaign and say, man, I made $200.00 on $1000 to spend this ad campaign blows and to a degree they'd be right.
But what they would be missing is the diamond in the rough.
5:04
Which is wait a second, this one I spent 100 made 200 on.
Can I take 10 grand and spend it on that ad and then make 20 back?
And so then it only cost me 800 to get a machine that now made me 20 on 10.
How much more can I spend in that machine?
And that's fundamentally the game is you keep putting them out there until you find the mega winner and then you juice the living shit out of it for as long as you possibly can.
5:29
And then what happens is over time it will start going down.
And this is also the the the transition that happens between mid tier advertisers and top tier advertisers, all right, So in the beginning you don't know what the fuck you're doing.
You lose most of your money.
Phase two, you start finding winners.
5:45
Every once in a while you scale the shit out of it and then what happens?
It starts going down because it gets fatigued.
It can't reach colder audiences.
And so your ROI starts compressing, right?
So then you freak out because you're like, Oh my God, my business is going to end.
I need all this cash flow in order to pay my people.
And so then you frantically go and make other ads, and then you find another winner and you scale it up.
6:03
The difference between the medium and the advanced advertisers is that they are ahead of that curve.
So even if they have a winner right now, they're already making the next generation of ads on a consistent basis so that they have winners that are cross peaking.
So you have two or three or four or five winners that are peaking at different times and then that is what evens out the business from a larger perspective.
6:25
Right now, if you make ads and you don't have a ad testing and creation cadence, meaning you're not doing it every day, every week start, you'll make more money.
I promise you.
You guys love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
6:48
You can check on my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
And if not, keep enjoying the show, which then gets you into phase three, which is the print money phase.
You'd think that the the lose money phase wouldn't have been my favorite phase print money would be.
But no, I just love suffering.
7:04
No, but the print money phase is what we're trying to get to, right?
That's the Nirvana that's we have the fully fully fledged print money and machine that we invest all the time and effort into creating.
And so fundamentally, if you're making more money back from customers, then it costs you to get them, then you are printing money.
Now the question is how much more and by when.
7:21
Those are two factors, which is what is the lifetime gross profit that I'm going to achieve from a customer and how quickly am I going to pay it back.
LTGP, which is lifetime gross profit to CAC ratio.
And when I'm looking to invest in any business, it's the first number I want to know because it is the biggest discrepancy of our like fundamentally all businesses are arbitrage between what it costs you to get a customer and how much you make on customers.
7:37
That's what it is like you have a machine that it costs you to get this person in, it costs you this much.
It's a money printing machine.
Like that's all businesses are just a black box where you spend X and you get Y.
That's what it is.
That's the game.
So if you know those two numbers really well, it's the most important ratio in the business.
And I talk about this at length inside of the book, 100 million leads.
7:54
So let's say that I make $10 in gross profit because I have a newsletter, right?
I don't have a newsletter, but if I did have one, John has a newsletter.
John makes $10 per month on his newsletter, and let's say that the average person stays for 20 months.
So that would be $200.00 is what he makes on a customer lifetime gross profit.
8:12
Let's say it cost him $50.00 to acquire that customer.
So he spends 50 and then he makes 200 / a lifetime.
But the problem is he spends 50 today and he makes $10 back and the next month he gets another $10.
The next month he gets another 10-5.
Months later he breaks even.
At month six he makes his first $10 profit.
8:30
Should he spend that money to do that deal every fucking day he should do that, but he will run out of cash and so it becomes a cash flow constraint rather than a business model constraint.
So there's different ways to solve that, right?
In terms of like, you can change, you can have upfront, you can have people prepaid a certain percentage, blah blah blah.
8:46
There's ways to tactically solve that problem.
But just in terms of determining whether your advertising is working, if you are making more money over the lifetime gross profit by more than three to one, then it costs you get them.
So for him that was 4 to one, right?
It cost him 50 bucks to make 200 then that is a that is a good scalable advertising campaign.
9:07
Now for the small business owner, you have to optimize around another metric which if you had VC backing and all this money that is pouring at you, which most of us don't have, you wouldn't have to optimize right now because they just want to blitz scale you and take you to the moon.
But most of us don't have that.
And So what you have to do is figure out a way to get your payback period down to 30 days ideally.
9:26
And the reason I pick 30 days is that 30 days is when most business owners can get interest free money.
Any business can get a credit card for some amount of money and so that means that you can get the credit card and you can spend that money.
And if you can get that money paid back in that first 30 days, then it means that you can always use someone else's money to scale your business.
9:42
What you have to cover in that first 30 days is 2 things.
One, the cost to get the person, cost to acquire, that's the money you spend in both marketing and sales to acquire the customer.
The second thing is the cost to deliver on the thing that you just sold.
Now if you want to get Super Saiyan, which is what I think we're all here to do, if you can do 2 times that, which means two times the cost to acquire and the cost to deliver of 1 customer in the 1st 30 days, Then you cover the cost of acquiring and delivering customer one.
10:07
And then you get free money to go acquire customer two and deliver on customer two.
And then that guy brings two more with him.
And then that is where you completely debottleneck the capital you have from your ability to grow acquisition.
What will happen next?
Cuz that's what I have in almost every business I own is that you have other constraints to the business.
10:25
You'll have operational constraints, you have talent constraints.
You want to have enough people, you want to have a staff, and then that opens up other doors for problems.
But once you crack that piece, I call that client finest acquisition because it's your clients financing your growth rather than outside investors.
And that's Nirvana.
When gym Launch took the entire gym market by storm.
10:44
Here's how it actually happened.
Everybody at the time was running free trials.
They're running 7 day free, 14 day free, 30 day free, whatever.
They could only spend up to X because cash flow because they had to give 30 days away for free and deliver the service and then spend the money on marketing and sales to acquire the customers.
11:02
They're negative for the 1st 30 days and then get their and get a third of those people to then roll into a membership at 99 bucks a month.
Well, it would take them three months to recoup that initial cost.
That's very tough for a small business owner, which in the gym industry on average they have 21 days of cash on hand basically impossible.
11:18
So we were able to take over that marketplace by simply changing the acquisition model.
And what we did was we had a defined end program on the front end that we charged for upfront 5 or $600.00 and our cost to acquire customer was one or $200.00.
11:34
And so we would make back the cost to acquire that customer and the next customer with the $400.00 leftover.
And so we were able to fill gyms to full capacity in a month without them having to front the money because they didn't have the money to front.
So even if they had $1000 to start, we'd make more than $1000 back in the first few days and we'd reinvest that to get even more people and then reinvest that 5000 to get another more people.
11:56
And then over and over over again until the biggest issue that Jim has always had to deal with his gyms getting to full capacity.
Because then we got to open up time slots, figure out how we can reconfigure the gym so we can get more people per session, etcetera, etcetera.
But because the people who are competing against star gyms could only spend up to $20 a lead and we could spend up to $100 a lead, we could out compete them.
12:19
And so it was just dollars and cents, even if they had better ads than us, we had a Better Business.
So in my book and at least my canonical thinking of how to scale advertising, I actually think about scaling paid ads last.
And the reason for that is because you can get your trial and error out of the way in terms of testing your product market, Fig, getting your offer right, getting your pricing right, getting your sales process right, learning what hooks and messaging works best with the people that you're talking to on the phone hand to hand before you run paid ads.
12:43
Because when you run paid ads, you're risking real money.
Before that you're just risking time.
So I'd rather you risk the thing that you have more of instead of the thing that you have less of when you're starting out.
But once you have all that stuff, you will sometimes reach a point where you want to scale faster or may be required for whatever your business model is.
And at that point you can get in the big game of paid ads where you are risking real money.
13:01
But you should have enough cash flow from your other advertising methods that you continue to use because you have kept those going so that you can support the losses that you will incur in the beginning of learning paid ads.
And when you play in the big game of paid ads, expect to lose more times than you win.
13:17
But when you win double, triple, quadruple, quintuple 1,000,000 fucking percent down on it and scale the hell out of it, 'cause that's how you make it back.
When you nail the LTGP to CAC ratio, all advertising becomes easy because you make so much money per customer.
You start building your businesses back to front, which is how we prefer to do it.
13:33
Which is, how do we provide more value to our customer than anyone else can so that we can charge more and make more profit than anyone else can, and then put mediocre advertising in front of it but still out compete everyone else because of our back end, not our front end.
The back end informs the front end, it enables the front end.
13:49
Some of the best advertisers in the world are attached to really shitty businesses because they forced to get really good at advertising.
But if they got into much better vehicles, which is a common theme I see in Mozzie Nation chasing the wrong, wrong opportunity.
If you got into a much more legit vehicle, you could spend way more and flex those skills you have in a much bigger way.
14:06
And so if you want to get in the paid ads game, it is the big boys game.
It is where you're actually putting real money in.
Like if you're doing cold outreach, you do morning outreach, You're doing, you know, affiliates, you're doing referrals, you're doing any of the other ways you can get customers.
You don't really risk a lot of money there.
You just risk time and labor from yourself or other people.
14:22
But when you get in the paid ads game, you're putting real money on the line.
You're actually getting into the game of the casino.
And so you have to be skilled.
But if you know the process, I got a track I got expect to lose.
And then once I make more money than it cost me to make it, can I enhance it and can I shorten the payback period?
You can do those things.
You'll unlock the unlimited money code and very quickly be amazed at how much you can scale.








0:00
Real quick, guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So.
If it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, it would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
How many times would you follow up with yourself?
To get yourself to do that thing or do that action or make that investment a lot and it's because you truly believe that it would solve your prospects problem and you have pure conviction that what you are selling them, the investment, the opportunity to whatever it is is 100% going to work.
0:49
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
The hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I want.
To talk to you about how to close a higher percentage of deals and how to close more deals overall.
1:12
And it's all sent around a single concept, which is the belief continuum.
And so if you think about this visual right I have right here, you've got your salesman here and you've got your prospect here, right.
And you see this bubble that I put over their head, the prospect has no bubble inside.
It's completely empty and they might have a negative bubble as well.
And then you've got the salesman who's got his belief bubble.
1:28
So many people like to think like do you believe in what you are selling, right.
The ask the question is though it's a binary answer, yes or no, I believe or I don't believe, but it would be much more accurate to say to what extent do you believe in right, because belief is not a binary question, it is a continuum.
It is how much do you believe in what you are selling?
1:46
Because if you thoroughly, 100% believe with all of your heart and mind that what you are selling is true, I guarantee you that you will sell significantly more.
And So what I want to show you is these two equations that I wrote down as simple equations for how to actually sell.
And so many people focus.
2:01
I would say a disproportionate amount of people focus on the skill of selling.
And there absolutely is a skill to sales.
You have to know exactly what to say.
You have to know how to say.
But you can shortcut that path to success by having conviction.
And the way that you have conviction is by a dramatically understanding the.
2:19
The needs of your prospects, so that when you are talking to somebody, you know exactly what their problem is, so that if your product perfectly matches their problem, you can have conviction in order to sell it.
Most sales people don't even listen to the prospect at all and simply want to deliver their pitch, which inherently means that they can't believe in the product that much because they're not even thinking about whether it solves the problem for the prospect.
2:41
Because you can't be convicted that it's going to solve the problem if you don't even know what the problem is, and so they haven't taken any time to understand the prospect.
Most sales training should be is currently focused on educating salesman around the product when it should be most of them most of the time focused on educating the salesman around the prospect and their problems, not the product.
3:03
All right.
Key understanding shift that has to happen when you're educating a sales team and or yourself?
Especially if you're entering a market that you are not the avatar, right?
One of the reasons that many successful businesses happened from somebody who suffered from a pain and then went to go solve it for themselves and then ended up solving it for other people is because they desperately and and and they so clearly understand the thoughts, needs and pains of the prospect and they know how the product solves those problems, right.
3:29
And so the first equation here is for an increasing closing percentage.
And so if it's you that's selling or if it's a sales team that's selling?
It's the skill of skill of sales multiplied by the extent to which you believe it is not.
Yes, I believe.
No, I believe this number can be 100, right?
3:47
And The thing is, is that I believe that this number of conviction can grow far higher than what skill can give you.
You can be a very skilled salesman, but let's say the skill of sales is 1 to 10, right?
I'll put this on here so everyone can see it.
Let's say if skills tails can be one to 10.
I believe that your skill of your your beliefs around conviction can be one to 100, right?
4:07
So even if your skill of sales is A2, you could have 100 belief and I guarantee you that you will close.
Because people can sense whether you believe what you were telling them is true, and they believe that what you were selling them is going to solve their problem.
Right.
4:23
And so most people, most sales teams, most sales managers do not focus enough on this bubble, which is conviction, which is this part of the equation, right.
If you think about what sales is, it's fundamentally A transference of belief.
And so how can you, how can you transfer an empty cup?
4:39
How can you transfer a cup that is only one third full into another empty cup and expect it to be over the threshold of the amount of belief that's necessary to and that's required for a prospect to make a make a purchasing decision.
Of course not.
Right.
And so we still try and get the person to say a certain thing or pause in this way or have this tonality or this emphasis in it that is important, right.
4:59
And and there's definitely a place for that.
You have to have the basis of sales in place.
But a much, much bigger lever that is often and most underutilized, unutilized at all is the conviction or the extent to which the salesman believes in what they're selling and to what extent it can help solve the prospects problems, all right.
5:18
And so that will influence the closing percentage of an individual or team.
Hey MOS Edition quick Break.
Just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright, so send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
5:33
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with.
Tag them in one of my relayless posts and I will give you all the love of the world.
Alright, so let's get back to the show.
The second piece is going to be the work ethic, right?
So a lot of people have probably seen really good closers versus really bad closers based on their closing percentage, but also total number just closed personally.
5:56
When you have somebody who has really high work ethic, then they can make up for a lower closing percentage by having more activity.
So that means that they're following up with their pipeline faster.
They're following up more times, right?
They're reaching out to people on their phone in their own time to give themselves more opportunities.
And they can compensate for a lower closing percentage by simply having more bets, right?
6:15
And so if you think about the expert salesman as having these two things together, which is you want to have a high closing percentage and you want to have lots of units sold.
Right.
And so there's three variables here.
You've got skill, you've got conviction and you've got work ethic.
But conviction counts twice because if you believe that what you are selling is genuinely going to help people, you will follow up faster.
6:33
You will follow up more religiously, You will follow up as though you were trying to help someone.
And so let me let me ask you this question as a, as a good mental thought process.
If you could go back in time, let's say you could go back in time five years and you could talk to yourself and say, hey.
I want you to put 100% of the money that we have right now, Mind you, you can't, you couldn't tell the person that is you, you're past off that you are you in the future, right?
6:57
So you you can't say anything like that.
But in this thought experiment and you went back in time and you said, hey, we've got this money in the bank account, I want you to put 100% of money into this thing called Bitcoin, right?
I want you to put 100% money into something called Amazon.
I want you to put all of that money into Tesla or whatever, right.
Something that blew up over the last five years, right.
7:15
If you were to tell yourself that, let's say.
You were talking to you and you were like, I'm good, thanks, right.
How many times would you follow up with yourself to get yourself to do that thing or do that action or make that investment a lot and it's because you truly believe that it would solve your prospects problem and you have pure conviction that what you are selling them, the investment, the opportunity to whatever it is, is 100% going to work.
7:45
Think about how you would approach that.
How many times would you follow up how, how convicted would you be when you spoke?
Would you even be focused on the skill of selling or would you be focusing on how true what you say is and if you can make that perspective shift?
And if you are a sales manager and you're trying to manage a sales team, I would implore you to focus way more of your time around the thing that counts twice in the equation of selling and creating great sales people, which is the belief to which the extent, the extent to which they believe.
8:13
What they are selling and to whom they are selling then boring with the the monotony of the skill, which don't get me wrong, it is very important to sell.
There's lots of videos that you probably heard where I talked about the skill of sales and I think when you when you rate this and you were in in a forced multiplication step, but I don't think that they are acquainted.
8:30
I don't think they are equivalent, right.
And the the proof that I have in this is that if you look at every single religious, you know, movement, you are selling something very hard to sell, which is a completely new frame of view around the world, the people who believe this.
Many times they don't train them in the skill of selling, they just get them to believe wholeheartedly in what they are selling, right?
8:50
And so if your salesman and your sales team are not drinking the kool-aid quite literally of the products that you sell or the services that you sell, then that is your problem, not whether or not they are clarifying the problem the beginning now they should, because they should be listening and they should believe.
They want to make sure that the the prospect is is going to be best certified as right.
9:07
But big picture, if you fix this, everything else will happen.
And I'll tell you this is the one last story.
Run this if you believed wholeheartedly and the the the solution that you are selling, would you not then spend lots of time honing your skill?
9:26
Probably because you would want to help more people because you believe in the thing that you were selling them, right?
You would cop like, would you not if you believe in this thing wholeheartedly.
Follow up with as many people as possible, be quick to respond because you know how much it's going to change their life probably.
And so I think that just like Simon's the next to start with why I believe that the skill of sales is fundamentally A transference of belief and we do need to start with why for sales people because it is not a question of whether or not they believe it is an it is the question of to what extent do they believe and if you can get that to 100, you will never have problem selling ever again.

If you had advice that you could give 40 year old Dave, would you tell him hey guys, on this episode that for Mosey's, I'm going to be flying down to Nashville to record a full podcast with Dave Ramsey.
I'm going to be breaking down a viral clip we posted that went crazy everywhere and we're going to be doing a full workout together and we'll wrap it up today.
0:17
Photo shoot, Enjoy.
What flavour is that?
No idea.
You never know.
It could be a secret.
There's no chocolate chips.
What's wrong with white chocolate?
Not for me.
0:33
Travel interrupts my productivity more than Layla's for me.
Like having my stuff and my setup, I tend to be more effective when I'm at home and so it's it feels like a bigger cost for me.
So I try and do it as little as I can, going out to see Dave with something that, like I've always been a big fan of his stuff and so it made a ton of sense for me to take a day to fly out, see him to everyone who doesn't fly private, I'll give you a little bit of insight.
0:56
And it's not always as cracked up as you might think because the Wi-Fi is slow as shit.
Yeah, we're cheap private jet Flyers.
We have limits.
I just like, can't, you know, get there faster.
And they just pay obscene amounts for the plane and like, it's just like I don't.
Want to pay triple the price just to have like a nice plane?
1:13
Like for us, the big thing?
Speed.
That's what we like about it.
I'm still not loaded.
Waste the fucking time, all right?
Make some goddamn content.
What?
I want to hear about Zola's paradox.
1:28
Yeah.
Zola was an ancient king in the Bible that he was considered one of the wisest men of all time.
It's his particular paradox because he made lots of bad decisions repeatedly, had uncontrolled passion for money and women, and neglected to instruct his only son who went on to ruin his Kingdom.
People give significantly better advice about their own scenarios if they don't know it's about themselves.
1:47
If you only just followed your own advice, it'd be way better than you currently are.
A practice that I started doing, which is I have a coaching session with myself.
Weird.
I have a conversation with my future self who's 85, and I ask him for advice on what I should do now.
And so 85 year old me explains to me what I already know in my deep self, but my emotional self that's, you know, running the ship forgets, but instead of like meditating to myself, I actually write it down.
2:13
You actually like if you listen to Google Doc, we'll wait for the Wi-Fi, Solomon projects my line, and then their line, and then my line again as I'm going through it.
So it's like I'm like chatting, but I'm filling out both sides of the chat, but I'm putting different hats on.
2:30
That's like me talking to me like I deal with this shit too.
I talk about thinking long and being patient, and it's because every day I'm impatient as fuck.
I'm like, why is this happening faster?
Like this should have happened two quarters ago.
Like the same things that you guys feel is on Twitter is like, I feel them too.
The Internet stop.
2:48
Oh wow.
I don't know what that's like.
I'm big on, like, what can I control?
What can I not control?
I hope that there was going to be Wi-Fi and there wasn't good Wi-Fi.
I knew I was going to basically have three hours of my life taken from me.
We ended up turning it into a recording session, which ended up doing really well from the stuff that we recorded in that time period.
3:07
So it ended up being a net positive that I didn't have Wi-Fi.
If I had had Wi-Fi, the Avante moment might not have ever been captured.
Do you want to hear about Avante?
Layla and I walk a lot and so we get stopped fairly frequently.
But this particular guy came up to me, didn't say hi, and immediately started telling me about his life and he didn't take a breath.
3:24
He was like shaking.
He's like, dude, he's like, I'm just so sick of being poor, man.
He's like, I've got a one year old, I'm working two jobs.
She's like, I just, I don't know how to get ahead.
This is a video I'm making for Avante, the young man who was working two jobs with a one year old who's struggling and said he was sick and tired of being poor and didn't know how to get out.
3:42
There are far more people who are struggling than there are people who are succeeding.
And so having content that speaks tactically to what to do when you're in that situation appeals to a much broader audience.
It wasn't surprising me that it got the response that it did, but I'm happy that I think it served a lot more people than just Avante.
4:04
All right, where's the right button here?
It's like 6 buttons here.
Someone definitely has hit that button before.
I think a lot of people beat up on Dave because of his stances on debt.
I live 100% debt free.
But also, his argument, succinctly put, is debt introduces risk.
4:24
Risk, when compounded over a lifetime, is bound to come due.
If you plan on playing the game for a very long time, you're betting on the fact that you're never going to have a bad season, and that's a hard bet to make have.
Fun Thanks.
Wish me luck.
If your plan requires luck to succeed, it's a bad plan.
4:41
Oh.
My God, people travel all over the country coming here just to say, you know, they're debt free.
That's worked it out.
So I think you're going to be right here.
That's going to be so.
Oh, good.
That's my good side.
Yeah.
Now this is usually my better side, but thank you for having me.
5:00
Honored to have you, Sir, for coming honors.
My you did a podcast with Graham Stefan and he showed you his investment portfolio.
You said something to him that massively changed the direction of how we invested.
So you know.
Rich people always enamored me, like I thought they had some kind of special sauce or something.
5:19
There aren't any secrets.
They find something that they like and that they understand and that they're good at, and they do it a lot.
Your giftings are much more in the real estate world than they are.
And analyzing stocks, if we were going to put a portfolio together of your knowledge base, it would be 80% real estate, 20% stocks, maybe probably.
5:36
It's OK if your portfolio is real estate heavy.
The reason that that little piece of advice that you gave to Graham was so meaningful for me, it was because everybody told me what they did and what had worked for them.
I talked to probably every guy that I know was who is richer than me and was like, what should I do with all this.
And the answers that I got were as different as there are people under the sun left me more confused than anything when I looked at that pie and thought, OK, well what's my knowledge base?
5:57
It's all business.
I showed that clip to Layla.
My wife and I was like, I think this is what we should do.
I think we should just stick to business and just buy businesses and grow them.
That's what we did with acquisition.com is that we're.
Put money and stuff you understand and you love.
Don't put money and stuff because it sounds fancy.
6:13
I'll bring us home because I had A and I could talk to you all day.
If you had advice that you could give 40 year old Dave, would you tell him you know now that you didn't know then?
Play incremental long ball.
Don't look for the home run.
I keep waiting for somebody to call me and for this to get easy.
6:30
One phone call and it's all over.
Oh, now I don't have to think about it anymore.
Someone else is going to do it for me.
It's all automatic.
Never going to be automatic, never going to be easy.
It's a hustle and grind.
It's a claw.
You're going to make a bazillion mistakes, make mistakes that are experiments that you survive.
You put out a hypothesis you survive the experiment to.
6:46
Live another day to have another experiment.
Put out another hypothesis, another product that fails, another idea that fails.
Our failures at Ramsey are in number and in money are way greater than our successes.
The only thing is we survive them.
A we didn't have debt, and B we never bet the farm on one horse, and so we're not looking for the singular home run.
7:03
We're looking to survive and fight another day and keep iterating.
The accumulated value of those iterations are what we call the gleaming mountain of success, which turns out as a pile of garbage and mistakes that you're just standing on rather.
And laying under it, I didn't understand brand.
7:19
I didn't get it.
Like with Jumanchi, it was just all quantitative, like it was all clicks conversions.
Like that was all I kind of cared about.
Going to the content world was kind of an experiment, like I'd done affiliates, I'd done referral programs, I'd done paid ads, I'd done cold outbound, but I'd never done content.
I'd never made it.
And then in making content, you learn about brand.
7:36
I'm not saying I understand brand, but I know more than I did.
It feels like once you start doing that, you realize that what you were doing all before was wrong.
What's going on dudes?
I was like thinking like, let me see if I can download any lessons.
If someone's making more money than me, there's always something to learn.
7:53
I would say having a conversation with with Dave, like it's just showing up.
He does 3 hours a day, every single day for 30 plus years, 3 hours a day of showing up and making content.
He's 62.
Once you have the right strategy, it's volume.
Like you just need to do more.
But I think just seeing that level of consistency over 30 years, like I'm grateful that I passed my 10 year mark, but I'm, I'm excited for the next 20.
8:14
Looks like that's very cool.
I like them talking or presenting.
I think I burn more calories.
Your brain is 25% of your calorie intake and it consumes like most of your sugar.
But Coca-Cola will kill you.
Except Warren Buffett, still murdering it, drinking regular Cherry Coke.
8:33
I like to buy the world of coke and keep IT company.
Wait for it, wait for it.
And we're not dead.
One more flight in the books of not dying.
You excited for the the photo shoot?
8:50
What is is it Saturday?
Saturday.
Oh, good.
I got to get a good pump on before I go.
They just don't zoom in on those.
Good.
All right, so we're going to do probably a super set of calves and hamstrings with Blum, owner of Raw Fitness.
9:16
I will train way harder if I'm training with a training partner.
I'll train longer, I'll do more reps, I'll do more sets.
Just someone else holding me accountable.
And one of the nice things, if you ever get the opportunity is to train with someone stronger than you.
Just like you have limiting beliefs in business, you also have limiting beliefs in in lifting.
And so when you see someone warm up with your one Rep Max, it really shifts the way you see the weight.
9:35
Got to start with, calves are the most important body part.
Calves were actually my weakest body part for a very long time and I actually had a girlfriend say why don't you train your calves?
And I've been training them for like 3 years.
So Blum and I have known each other for 11 years, 12 years.
9:51
Blum Mos was the gym owner who had a gym.
I did not have a gym.
You lived in one.
I would just basically harass everyone.
Have them let me just come around a little clipboard and just take notes on everything they were doing.
10:06
I'm like, Alex is the same Alex.
He would always be there asking questions that I had no answers to.
What's your turn?
What's your this?
And I'm like, I don't know, I'm 29 years old and I run a gym.
I don't know what you're even talking about.
I'm like, what's your onboarding process?
He's like they sign up and then they work.
10:32
So I like to go easy, hard, easy, hard by your legs, hard.
Then I'll do shoulders, then I'll do back hard, then I'll do arms.
Science.
All right, hold on.
10:57
Yeah.
So I train full body every day because I want to grow everything every day.
And I also have a irregular schedule, so I don't want to be like Monday's back day, Wednesday's like day, you know, Friday, shoulder tricep, bicep.
And then like, I missed two Fridays in a row and I haven't trained shoulders, bicep, tricep in like 3 weeks.
11:13
So I train everything every day.
Bodybuilding and business are actually really similar in that you will have uneven inputs to create an even output because perfect business would have amazing marketing, amazing sales, amazing product, amazing customer success.
But the individual might be like, I'm really good at marketing and that's all I do and that's fine.
But the business needs to be balanced.
11:29
And so I kind of think of the exercises in the same way of like I'm only going to select exercises and I'm going to order them and do the most volume on the ones that I need to work on the most so that my physique overall is more balanced.
You know, I think splitting muscles, typical Brochet you do in the gym if you just compare biceps.
11:46
All right, So that was our workout.
So we are heading to a photo shoot.
Main reason if you've ever seen any of my other random images that have been taken.
The reason I'm not wearing a hat is because when we took did the photo shoot last time, we were in transition on the logos and I didn't want to take a bunch of pictures of the old logo hat.
12:07
Now we'll have photos once again with the right logo in the hat and the the logo beater and the logo beater Essential detail cookies ordered some cookies.
Is that because no one skips dessert on the table?
No one.
Whatever.
Never, ever.
It's a fireable offense.
12:23
Oh, it's honestly, it's a core value.
We saw you take the brownie and slide it into the trash can after you were done your lunch.
Didn't take the extra bite.
What's the deal here?
I'm not accusing.
I just want to understand why.
You never know whether you're gonna need one.
12:40
Sugar.
Little sugar.
Well.
Oh, he's up.
I haven't washed my head since the gym.
It's good for your immune system.
I think what we'll do is we'll run through all the different facial expressions that we use for the thumbnails, all the different flannels.
So we'll just bash those out.
13:02
Should I, should I get a brush?
Oh, no.
You.
Yeah.
Do a quick crush.
Yeah, do a quick crush.
Quick crush.
I did that for you guys because I know a lot of you guys are like, man, you know what made me really like Mosey better?
Clearly crushed.
It's a bit of a broad post.
13:24
Wife is white.
You want to listen to feedback from the audience, but you don't want the feedback from the audience to change your brand.
Because the brand's your is your identity.
It's your reputation what makes you you.
And if you get funneled into like the algo hole of looking like exactly every other person who funnels for the algorithm, then you lose the uniqueness of what makes you you, and then you get the views.
13:50
But then the moment that your type of content no longer is in vogue and something else is like your entire brand disappears overnight.
I'm going to steal this from Garrick's thing.
It was really good.
You are your own niche.
Everyone has multiple facets.
They just don't express them.
Like, I like eating dessert.
14:05
I also look kind of jacked.
I also am into business.
I also work with my wife.
It's just like people who fuck with any of those things will fuck with my stuff.
But if it was like challenges are really important, that's all we should make.
Yeah, then I would be catering to something that's not me.
Don't.
Let me get too far.
Don't let me.
14:22
Get my shoes off.








0:00
Unless the goal is to exit the company, if you enjoy doing the thing, then it's like, OK, well then how can we get the most of you doing the thing?
Because that is the highest leverage time for you.
And then it's like, how do we clear everything else off of your calendar so that you can do the most of that.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:23
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Alex and Layla, welcome to the Bigger Pockets podcast.
Thanks for being here.
Thanks for having us on honor to be here.
So welcome back, Alex.
You know, funny quick little anecdote, I think when we interviewed you about 8 months ago.
0:39
I said I had hired one of my sales guys to to become my CEO.
And then you're like, well, I don't know if I would have done that.
And then he listened to it.
He's like, wait, man, I was like, do you really think, what do you think about that?
And I was like, he's doing great.
He's doing great.
Oh, good.
Just a small update.
0:55
Just a small update.
And Layla, I'm really happy to have you here.
Happy birthday.
Thank you so much for being here.
And I wanted to say, you know, I actually I I subscribe to your YouTube channel first.
It was a video you did about a year ago called How to Go from 0 to $1,000,000.
1:11
And it was a longer piece of content.
And I was like, OK, well, you know, like I do, I'll like, I'll watch a minute or two.
And I watch the whole thing.
And I was like, wow, this is really good.
And you had like a PowerPoint.
It was the whole thing.
And I was like, this is great.
And then a couple days later I get served up one of your videos, Alex.
1:27
And I'm like, I'm pretty sure her name was Hormozi.
But like, what are the chances?
There's another YouTuber named Horn Mosey.
This is all crazy.
So you two are the the only Youtubers that I will watch an hour long video from.
I just watched your hour long video last week and I was like wow, every minute.
1:44
Thank you.
SO good.
Good.
Content from start to finish.
Excited to talk about some of those principles.
And he's not lying, man.
I'm glad you guys are here, because this is all Rob has talked about for the last three days.
OK?
How far are they coming?
Alex, Can you believe that Lena's coming on her birthday?
We can't mess this up.
2:00
It's got to be perfect.
Really can't mess it up.
I've been rehearsing in the mirror, but it's not It's all good.
Well, I'm glad you guys are here.
Thank you, especially on your birthday.
That's very, very sweet of you.
So we appreciate it and our audience does as well.
Absolutely.
Tell us about acquisition.com.
Why are you guys passionate about this project?
2:17
Oh, fine.
OK.
Is that the signal sneak attacks?
Is this like you need a still second base?
Is that what she's Well, No.
We.
Yes, Sir.
Because if we ever go together, she she always jokes that I will be like you should go and then I like have time to think about what.
Perhaps a better answer.
So the I appreciate.
2:33
That's what we're doing.
The the trick is, you're supposed to say that's a good question, to buy yourself some time and then you get.
I do that all the time too.
I do it with you.
You don't realize it all the time.
I make you talk 1st and then I sum up what you said better than you said it and add maybe one piece that you little piece on the end, right?
Right.
No, I mean, the reason for acquisition.com, you know, interestingly, most of our businesses have come out of personal need.
2:53
And so like I, I got into, you know, I, I got in shape and then people started asking me how I got in shape.
And then I started helping people get into shape.
And then I started growing a business of helping people get in shape.
And then people who help people get in shape asked me how I got the business of people getting in shape.
3:08
And then the people who had businesses that helped other, you know, small businesses started asking me how my business was going.
You know what I mean?
It's just continued to work out that way.
And so Leland I still had at the time when we started what would then become acquisition.com.
3:25
We owned Jim Launch, Prestige Labs and Allen Allen is our software company, Prestige Labs our supplement company and Jim Launch was our gym licensing business.
And so we had, I think at the time just about 4000 people who'd gone through our licensing program and and we had the same amount of people who were selling our supplements to that same distribution base and COVID happened and so that obviously impact and the software was actually how to get is a martech solution.
3:49
So how to get leads in the door for brick and mortar businesses of any kind.
It's supposed to be for gyms originally and then other people who were like, hey man, I have a bunch of plumbers, I have a bunch of whatever's does it work for them.
And it turned out it did.
So it actually had a much bigger market than we thought it did originally.
And so middle of COVID things are tough for gyms.
4:06
I'm almost like I got to take my take my mind off this stuff and I get a sales call because we're rolling out software.
I'd read all the books.
It's like founders should take the first sales call so you can get to know the customers.
And so I still had like a Tiny Ish brand, You know what I mean?
Like I had a, a tiny fan base.
4:23
Yeah.
And so I was right on the cusp where it wouldn't, it was, it was still OK for me to to take those calls where it wouldn't be where people just like hop on to have no interest in actually the product.
And so it is this particular call guy got on and was like, I don't want anything to do with your software.
4:39
He's like, but I've read everything that you've ever put out.
I've applied all of it and I like tripled my business and I want you to partner with me to scale it and I was like, this isn't really the right time, whatever.
Anyways, he I, he, he sold me on it and I really liked him.
And he owned a photography business that's called Enchanted Fairies.
4:55
And at the time he had one studio and his drilling doing really well and he had an agency business on the side that helped photographer like he marketed photographers the same way he had it for his own studio.
And after finding out about that, I was like you know what if we just stopped this agency thing and just like scale the hell out of this chain.
5:12
And so we invested in the business and that was three years ago and that business now went from you know one single location to doing you know two and a half million a month over with their over 30 locations.
So we just own all of them and we just continue to scale that.
And so that was like the first deal we did and then.
5:29
And you own all of those as in like they're not franchise out or anything.
And so then we, we did a, it was like, oh, that went well, maybe we should do this again.
So we did another deal and then that business went from like 16 and a half million in top line to 50 million in top line the next year.
And I was like, OK, that worked well.
5:47
And then we did another deal, another deal.
And so by the end of that, that year we'd done I think three or four, I can't remember what it was, 3 or 4 deals, 3 deals.
And I was like, you know, I think and we were going back and forth on selling gym launch because it was COVID, it wasn't like the ideal time to sell a gym company.
But the flip side was like interest rates were zero.
6:05
And so there's tons of money in the market.
So it's like, OK, this is a great macro time to sell, but a really bad micro time for the business to sell.
And but Leila and I committed a few years earlier that we would sell the business if we felt like we no longer loved the business anymore.
And we'd both been in fitness for 10 years and we were ready to just, I didn't want to be the gym guy anymore.
6:24
And so and the fact that these other deals had gone well, like I wonder what how different like life would be if like those first deal or two didn't work out, we probably wouldn't have sold, but they did work out.
And so the day after we sold which was December 24th of 2021, we started acquisition.com the next day.
6:43
And so then we had because we had you know we're probably taking 40 million in distributions up to that point.
And then we also had our sale money which was 46 and we started our family office which is acquisition.com and so we buy and scale businesses.
That's really cool.
6:58
So, Leila, I know you're the CEO of acquisition.com.
What exactly is the type of workplace that you're trying to build there?
I'm trying to and it's really we you know, because we're we're a small business I think, but you know technically the team reports to me.
But I mean we work on everything together.
7:15
Really what we want to build is in terms of the type of place, you know, you like, you look at like traditional private equity.
It's a very punishing environment.
I think like it's run by fear.
They're pretty much like it's the golden handcuffs, which is like.
All right.
I'm going to get my two years at, I won't say their names, but like, these top firms and then I'm out, right?
7:32
Because it's so unsustainable.
And so, you know, when we looked at doing what we're going to do, I was like, you know, the only thing is, like, I just don't want to build a place that actually treats people like that.
You know, I want to build a place where we don't just build companies, we also build people.
Because you know, really behind the philosophy of acquisition.com, there's really there's strategy and there's all the strategy that we deploy into the businesses in terms of how we're going to grow these things.
7:57
But who grows those is the people that are in their businesses and who directs the people on how to grow those functions and the businesses overall is our team.
And so, you know, really the philosophy behind it is if we can build a place where we don't just achieve success of becoming, you know, a firm that does 10 billion by, you know, turning people out by paying them so much money that they feel like they can't leave, but by actually fostering.
8:25
An environment where people are constantly learning and developing and we're encouraging them.
And I think that there's a lot of talk against this and anytime that it's like kind of risen in the management philosophies, it's so hard to apply and to understand that people just reject it.
8:43
And so my goal is to just.
Build acquisition to 10 billion and then have people ask how we did it and then tell them that we did it this way.
And you don't have to be mean to people and pay people exorbitant amounts of money because it's such a terrible job.
You can engineer an environment where people like the business wins, the people win and our partners win.
9:01
And that's really what it is.
I think that the founder of Whole Foods, he talks about that all the time.
John Mackey, I think that's how you say the last time.
I always say it wrong.
But he talks about creating a win, win, win, and not even a win, win, win, but like a win, win, win, win, win.
It's like a win for the community, a win for the environment, a win for the employees, a win for the business, a win for the, you know, business financials, a win for the customers.
9:23
And we just take that approach at acquisition.com.
It's like if it's not going to make a win for every single person that it touches, then we can't do it.
And so the business itself exists to be an example of a win, win, win, you know, win for our portfolio companies, a win for acquisition.com, a win for our employees.
9:40
And you know, it just makes it more enjoyable too, because I think, like, I I can't imagine going and being the CEO of a company where I felt like people didn't want to be there, like that just sounds awful to me.
I wouldn't want to be there.
So, you know, I think what we want to create is a place where people actually like working, and I think we're doing it.
10:00
Yeah.
So I mean, it seems like acquisition.com, when you're working with these companies, you're effectively helping them scale, you're helping them build out their systems, their teams.
Is your company set up from an operational standpoint the same way you set up the companies?
Like do you have operators or is every employee@acquisition.com meant to be like a super sniper operator that can be inserted, inserted into any business?
10:22
It's a good question.
So we essentially have a set up where you know, there's the executive team@acquisition.com which services you know the internal things that we need to have done at acquisition.com and then we have what we call like pods.
And so there's one portfolio operator with a team of what we call subject matter experts say you know managing Director of people, Managing Director of Customer success, Managing Director of sales, Managing Director of Marketing and they as a pod can service a certain amount of businesses, they can do the value creation for those businesses in our portfolio.
10:56
And then you duplicate that and you know as of right now we're focused on like a, you know, more like professional services and a brick and mortar chains that's probably like the two.
Niches that we're focused on, if we decide to branch out into SAS, then we would build that same structure but with people who have background in SAS.
11:12
So that's how acquisition.com is structured and then we bring in outside expertise and consultants as needed for like special projects.
And the way that we've built this is that a company comes in and you know if let's say a company's doing 10 million top line and three million bottom line, so probably like 30 or so employees somewhere in there.
11:31
What we would then do is we will identify what department usually needs to go from zero to 1.
It's usually just non existent And then we will go and actively head hunt and recruit some of the best people from businesses that are maybe you know two or three times the size of that business and put them into the business.
And then our subject matter expert will deploy our playbooks with that person.
11:50
So that way we can create the most enterprise value at the port Co at the portfolio company level, not at the whole Co level.
And for us it's like each of these you know, SME's that we call subject matter experts.
You know if they were sitting on the balance sheet of any of the portfolio companies, it would definitely you know, hurt the the P&L.
12:06
But because we can fractionalize that and a lot of high skilled labor doesn't require tons of time, it just requires Deepak.
It takes 10 years to learn you know where to hit the machine, that whole thing.
And so it's like we can we can consolidate that cost at Holdco.
So the actual profit is I'm going to say inflated, but just way better at the portfolio.
12:25
Yeah, exactly.
Because we can, we can consolidate all this brain power and then copy and paste things the way we already know it's working and we can take learnings across the portfolio.
And so we're like, hey, you know this, this sales set up is working really well in these three companies.
We just got a new portfolio company and let's let's deploy that here, right or like hey, this new media platform is doing really, really well.
12:44
Let's deploy that playbook in the rest of them.
So we just we can learn way faster and deploy way faster.
A lot of companies, a lot of personalities mixing, right?
So when you're looking at some of the companies that you're acquiring, if a company is coming in with like a sour work culture.
Can that be fixed or that's something that might cause you to, like, walk away from a deal?
13:02
I think that the, given the size companies that we're investing in, you know, these companies are typically like right, just a little too small for private equity.
And so, you know, when they're coming in, they have a sour work culture, not because of bad practices, but because of no practices they just truly don't have.
13:23
Any standards in place, any systems in place to ensure that they can have a good culture.
So it's like we're starting from Ground Zero now.
I think what's harder is when businesses get bigger and they have systems in place that promote a bad culture.
Right.
I think that when they're small, it's just kind of like you're just accidentally creating a culture because you have nothing in place.
13:41
When you get bigger, you have put things in place and still have a bad culture because they're the wrong things.
That's harder to turn around.
That's called a turn around.
We don't, we don't necessarily do that.
I think we've done it with one business and it's it's honestly a lot harder and it requires a different kind of skill to put the systems in place to promote a good culture because they kind of just have like whatever naturally occurs, right.
14:01
Yeah, it's like a hodgepodge.
You know, that's that's something that we're good at doing, but it does take time.
It does not happen overnight.
The culture is the piece that takes the longest.
And honestly, it's like still what I'm trying to crack because you can change all the people around the founder, but the founder themselves, if they do not change, like it's just really hard to change that.
14:21
Yeah, David, I mean you you have a big team of like at the the David Green team.
Is there a lot that you have to do to insert like what you see the the culture being or is that really something that you put more like on the operator level at your company?
No, I haven't been able to get an operator to do that very well.
14:38
That's like why I'm stuck.
So that's really where I failed over the last four years, over and over and over was taking myself out, putting a person in.
They understand the organizational chart.
They understand the processes.
They understand.
What's happening, as long as the money, the revenue, the deals flow in, they can keep the whole thing going.
14:56
There's a change in the economy, interest rates go up, something changes the flow.
That was nice.
And they, they don't know how to go and like lead the people into a new realm and then I will have to step back in.
But now it's like.
I'm out of shape because I've been at the gym at six months.
15:13
So it takes me a long time to like re acclimate myself to what's happening, figure out who are the pieces that are working, who are the pieces that have been slacking when no one was looking.
You get the whole thing running again.
And then that business over there is having the same problem.
And like I've just been bouncing around for the last several years because of exactly what you guys are describing.
15:31
It's that leader, the one that can inspire the culture.
And that's really what makes the business work, is what people come to the one brokerage of the David Greene team because they hear me talk on the podcast and they're like, I want his standards.
I want that guy's work ethic.
I want that guy's eyes on my deal.
I want to feel the way he makes me feel when he talks about real estate.
15:48
And then when you put a person in your org chart to do a job, but they don't inspire that same level of confidence in the customer, the conversions become a whole lot harder.
So it's what they're describing like is building the culture of leaders that all kind of adhere to the same standard.
The subject matter experts are really the ones holding that line.
16:05
It sounds like you're saying that are keeping everyone operating or is that not the role that they're playing?
They hold the standard of what good looks like in each function.
I think that the portfolio operators who's like the leader of those subject matter experts is the one that more so is distilling that cultural piece.
16:24
And so I think we're very, I I've definitely developed a philosophy around that which is you know you know hiring people who are either have our values or are so open minded that they can.
You know, flux into our values.
That's what's been missing to your question, exactly what you're saying we.
16:45
Just personal opinion.
There's always like, I always look at it like either we're going to be really good at hiring this person or like what we did at gym launch was like really good at building.
Because, like, if you are used to investing in people, then it's like maybe you just bring someone in to be your successor and over a span of two years they watch you, they're there with you at everything, and you just keep them by your side And then.
17:06
Years in somebody with like very little experience can do it.
That is what I've tried.
I just picked the wrong person.
So they got a little taste of what it's like to be David Greene's guy and their ego being insane, right?
Or they got a little taste of all this money and they're like, oh great, I don't have to work 70 hours a week to make it work anymore.
17:22
Now I can cut back to 30 and enjoy my life.
And they're taking their foot off the accelerator before you've hit like escape velocity would be the way to look at it.
And I can admit that's I think when we actually did the first interview with you, I'd this is the hardest part for me.
Is to be the guy who is like, I was a police officer before this.
17:37
I'm very familiar with enforcing a standard or a law.
Then you step into the podcast basin, you're not a you're like a magnet of like, hey, you guys can do this.
And I have not done well bouncing between those two roles.
A lot of the people that we'll find come to me from the podcast and now I'm like crushing their soul when I'm like.
17:54
You have to step it up.
And I, or if I if they're not from the podcast, they don't understand the ethos that people have from the bigger pockets realm.
You guys are nodding like you understand the struggle I'm having here, but I can admit I'm not good at it.
It's a skill in itself.
Yes, Mosa Nation, real quick, if you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
18:21
And if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
So between the both of you, is there a difference between the way y'all wake up, Like is one of you really focusing on the internal operation of the company versus the external side of it?
18:42
Yeah, I mean, it did.
Everything that Layla talked about earlier in terms of like getting a win for acquisition.com, getting a win for our internal team and getting a win for portfolio companies is what I would consider kind of like the internal mission of acquisition.com.
The external mission is very much the stuff that we put out there, which is like to make real business knowledge accessible to everyone.
19:00
And so it is like if we can make the entire marketplace better, then we are net positive to the marketplace.
We can hopefully teach skills that then allow people to work at companies and you know, quit the jobs they don't like to, you know, take jobs they do like and maybe even take jobs at acquisition.com or our portfolio companies.
19:18
But yes, Layla is absolutely internal facing, I am external facing.
Our days are almost polar opposites in terms of how we, how we work, what we work on, how they're structured.
The hold code is small is is not because it's a holding company.
It's not like we have a a gazillion people there.
19:34
We probably have 20 something, it's not big And so it still functions like a small business in that way.
In that Leila and I will, you know talk about big strategic decisions, but for the most part we try not to change the strategy that much, but you got to give time, time.
Sure.
Well, in episode 649, we spoke with you about scaling from zero to 100,000 dollars, $100,000 to 3 million and 3 million to 30 million.
19:57
And so I want to sort of talk about setting up some of the operational framework when you're in those phases.
I started a company recently, it's called STR COSEC and I feel like the partners and I, we are all visionaries.
And so we're at this point now where you know from a funnel marketing standpoint, we've got the leads, we've got a very warm set of emails.
20:16
We've had a lot of good conversions.
We've actually done really, really great for the two months that we've been operating.
But for me, I'm trying to understand who do I hire next?
What is the ROI of that person?
Because it seems like I need someone that is somewhat of an operator, but I also feel like I need someone to actually run the marketing and the follow up to actually convert some of those leads.
20:36
You know, I think we probably have similar ways of looking at this which is in the beginning.
The first thing is that when your business is small is that.
The reality is you need everything, right?
You don't have a head of marketing, You don't have a head of sales.
You don't have a have a head of CS.
It's like it's all just like open wound.
20:54
But the question is like, which artery, if clogged, prevents the most blood loss?
That's the way I look at it, right?
And so it's like, OK, where do we get the highest ROI if we put a person there?
And I think that often what a lot of people want to do is they want to get out of pain themselves.
21:12
And so in the beginning, you do see a lot of people who have a skill in terms of, say, it's sales or say it's client acquisition and then they think, well, gosh, this is taking up all my time, I need to hire somebody.
However, the question is, can the business bear you stepping back, bring someone in who's going to be 30% less effective at first, right, Say that salesperson you're closing at 80%, they come in and they close at 50%.
21:32
It's like, well, can the business actually even support that?
And in the beginning, the answer is usually no.
So the question is where are we going to get the highest ROI if we bring somebody in, which is like what is the biggest constraint right now?
Not saying it feels bad to me, right, because I think like often we're so often in pain that we're like, I want someone to come and take the sound off my plate.
21:50
But like what's the biggest constraint on the business?
And so I would look at it from that perspective in terms of like what is not happening that if it were happening, the business would be 10X better or what is happening?
That needs to stop happening to make the business 10 times better.
22:07
That makes sense.
Yeah, because the company is very profitable for for where we are.
We can certainly sustain hiring somebody.
And from a marketing standpoint, I think the the stubborn thing for me that I always feel like is I'm good at marketing my stuff and it's very hard for me to relinquish that control.
22:22
So it almost feels like perhaps I can't walk away from that business quite yet, but maybe if I put more of a a project manager, someone that's kind of pushing the daily agenda in line, that would sort of complement my skill set a little bit.
Can I throw this out there?
Is there a reason that you want to step away from the marketing, not particularly just time and you know I have other businesses that I'm also, I'm marketing a lot, right?
22:48
You know I have four or five different companies that I market.
So that that's the tough part for me.
Because you you probably don't think you're not going to stop marketing, right?
So it's like I feel like a lot of times.
Like, just as business owners, entrepreneurs in general, we do a lot of things based on, like shoulds that someone else has told us at some point in our career.
23:03
And then it's like could have been a whisper, could have been at lunch at, you know, five years ago.
And you're just like, oh, this is fact.
And you like, operate the rest of time until someone's like, hey, I don't know if that's true, but like you look at Dave Ramsey, you know, they're doing 300 million a year.
He still does his podcast every day.
And so I think it's just like unless the goal is to exit the company.
23:22
If you enjoy doing the thing then it's like OK, well then how can we get the most of you doing the thing because that is the highest leverage you know time for you and then it's like how do we clear everything else off of your calendar so that you can do the most of that Anyways that's just like if we're looking at OK we're we're a big leverage points you know in the business and it's it's just it's just kind of funny because a lot of times we're like man I got to get out of sales and you're like well you're an amazing sales manager and right now you're doing.
23:46
I don't know, 600,000 a month maybe that's not that might not be the time right now.
Like we might need to think about what are the other things on your time and take everything else off and then keep that and then we'll have even more resources because we'll be twice as big to then go get a killer who we can hire, who has an amazing track record at a company that's twice as big, who who you know, who knows this type of sale, etcetera, etcetera.
24:08
That makes sense for me.
I mean, I feel like because, yeah, I just, I would like to just show up in market.
And so because I'm doing a little bit of the operational side back and forth, I feel like I can't really ever do the marketing side good and I can't do the operational side good.
And so, yeah, it's just always very painful to to hire.
24:23
Is it always painful to hire?
Well, one thing I would say is also I just I think that at different levels in the business, I think like a product manager is like that's everyone's go to when they're not really sure what role.
So that's actually one that I think like vague roles like a project manager is actually where I see, like usually what it means is that we're missing a roll over here, A roll over here, and then somebody right here is weak and we fill it in with like a project manager.
24:46
Yeah, drunk drawer.
So I would just be be be weary in terms of hiring is a skill in itself.
So it's just like.
Like, dude, I'm awful at real estate.
Sorry, like for now.
Yeah, Right now, yes.
Yeah.
25:02
Terrible.
Awful.
Like as good as business that that's how bad I am at real estate.
The opposite.
But it's because I've never, I've never applied my skill set.
It's not like I think I'm dumb and can't learn it.
It's that I've never taken the time.
And I think that, you know, I was forced to learn how to hire.
25:17
Well because in gym launch we grew so quickly and I had to hire so many people so quickly.
I learned all these lessons that I think take.
Honestly, a lot of people, decades to learn.
Yeah.
You know, I've hired thousands of people at this point, and that's just not something most people of my age have done.
And I think that it was in a compressed period of time, which then I think even cemented the learning even more.
25:37
And so it is a skill.
I you know, I think that if somebody's not good at hiring, sometimes it is best that you defer to a recruiting firm and watch what they do learn from them.
Because I think a lot of times we we we think we know what good looks like and we think that hiring is just like a thing you do to get people.
But it is a complete we have there are complete hiring departments, there are multiple different roles that help people hire.
25:57
I mean it's an entire process of its own.
So just like there is client acquisition, there is talent acquisition and I think that Alex is very good at client acquisition and I am very good at talent acquisition and they're honestly it's just flipping client acquisition all the things you do for that you do to acquire talent.
26:15
It's just that.
Most businesses, in fact 80% of businesses do not match their external strategy with an internal strategy.
And so that's why talent acquisition doesn't exist in most businesses.
And most people say, well, my business is too small for that and I'm like, well, how do you think your business gets big like by having that?
26:31
And so I think that it if it's treated as a skill of its own and one that is imperative to the growth of the business, then I think people would.
See and and I guess that's what I strive to do is like to show people the importance of it.
There's a lot of stats to back the importance of the people that we bring on, how we bring them on, the culture that we have as a team.
26:54
But it's still, I think it's starting to become more relevant.
When I even when I started making content, I think, you know, 2 1/2 years ago, I felt like I was like.
Speaking something that nobody talked about, You know what I mean?
Yeah.
It's all to discuss is it's almost like a Oh yeah, you have to be able to hire people.
It's an afterthought, yes.
27:10
It's something super interesting is that for every strategy, for every 3 strategies that a company commits to saying like, this is our strategy that we're going to do for this year one, here's year two, here's year three 2/3 of strategies fail, not because the strategy is wrong, but due to execution.
27:28
And when they say, well, what makes the difference in companies that are able to actually execute these, because that means that only 33% of strategies that we say we're going to do actually happen.
Well, there are some companies that are able to execute 78% of strategies.
What makes up the delta is what people.
27:44
And I guess McKinsey defines this as the soft stuff, which is talent acquisition, culture and people.
And so it's like, you know, I feel like I'm like, I'm saying all the stuff to people like Layla's about the fluff.
I'm like, Oh my gosh, this is not the fluff.
This will make you so much more money.
You will grow your business so much bigger.
Yeah.
28:00
There's people that analyze the economy, what the government's doing, and they figure out what the overall environment looks like.
There's people that analyze an individual real estate investment and look at what's the income stream, what are the expenses.
There's people that analyze businesses.
There's people that analyze stock opportunities there.
28:15
It's all some form of risk allocation.
Like how do we know where this is going to work?
We've talked to so many people today and the biggest hurdle in all of their growth was hiring.
And yet you don't put that same effort into the analysis of humans, which are the one thing you can't scale without once you get to that limit.
28:32
Like where where I kind of AM.
If you were to think about it like you're really good at marketing and and you probably have sales teams, you've probably taken a lot of sales calls in your life and you take 1000 sales calls or 2000 sales calls and then you think about that from the context of hiring.
It's like a lot of entrepreneurs have had like 30 interviews.
28:50
That they've actually tried to make a judgement.
Be like, man, I suck at this.
It's like, well, it's reasonable that you suck at it.
You've only done it 30 times, you know what I mean?
I tell people all the time, if they're like, you know, Leila, I don't think I need a sales manager.
And I'm like, do me a favor, I just want you to interview 10 and then tell me if you need one.
29:06
Because they don't even know what a sales manager or their business should be doing.
Yeah, one of the other issues in the beginning is it's just ignorance, not stupidity.
It's just that a lot of entrepreneurs really on don't know what good looks like.
And so like kind of like with the operator, it's like I just don't like you probably know what a good salesperson looks like you you like, like you've probably hired enough of them because it's a role.
29:25
I mean, just from what it sounds like in your business, it's like, well, how many good operators have you ever hired?
And so it's just it's kind of like such a good point, right.
So you have, there's no, there's no ideal scene to like look at.
You're like, I think I'm going to roll the dice again.
Right, like that.
I remember when I was trying to hire agents that could close my clients, I would just.
29:41
I tried.
I failed.
I tried.
I failed.
They couldn't close it.
I hired 1 Johnny and he could do it.
And I was like, that's what it looks for.
And then they all came after, right?
Like there's something about mentorship maybe where you're following someone else and you see what they're doing, that you get this pattern in your mind of what that's a great point that you just made and I haven't hired.
29:58
I called a leader, but it's an operator.
Like what you're saying?
The person that can run?
And and we've placed operators in what, 2/3 of the portfolio.
More almost all of them except for like.
So you have a pattern in your mind of what that.
Looks like, yeah.
30:14
So yeah, I get basically I guess it is all of them.
We've we've taken an operator and put them in because usually the entrepreneur is the one who starts who gets the fire going and gets to a certain point and they don't, they don't like a lot of these things.
And what I'd say probably one of the bigger mistakes and this is one that we've made earlier on was hiring hiring the project manager and calling them COO or calling them Director of operations.
30:36
Right.
And what it really is, is somebody who.
You're like, oh, they're really detoriented.
They love Asana and they love, like, checking boxes.
And it's like that's actually not what an operator looks like.
Well, I think that's why I said project manager, because it feels like going straight to operator or COO is too big of a role for where we're at.
30:53
I'm probably not, but you know, funny story, my COO that I was telling you about.
We're thinking about hiring his wife as a project manager, so if he listens to this, he's going to be hurt again.
But don't.
Do it a different, a different way of describing it maybe would just be and this is I guess I'm I'm describing this as me watching what Layla has done in all the in all the companies because like I'm pretty good at acquisition and that's kind of been my hat for a long time.
31:17
But when I met Layla.
I think I was doing 2:00-ish million bucks a year and just total revenue, not making really any profit.
But when she came in my life, she had a totally different perspective on how to just treat people and how to actually run a business.
And it was not all the detail stuff and the excel sheets and things like that that I thought it was going to be.
31:35
It was just leadership.
It was like your catalyst.
It was leadership and that was The thing is, just like when we're looking at operators, we're like, is this a leader?
Like, does this person inspire me?
Do I?
Do I admire them?
Well, other people in the team admire them.
Will like, will they be You talk about setting standards.
31:51
It's like, well, if everyone on the team doesn't admire the character of this person.
And then emulate it then.
Exactly.
And so that's where you get like more and more nuanced on oh we can you know we can pick this and it's been really cool because our our director of people like it's funny we we have probably have all these marketing stats and acquisition stats.
32:08
You're like you know your your Cpl. your Cpl. like all these different stats but the same level of rigor can be applied to talent.
So it's like if I said, hey, what's your time to fill a lot of people would be like.
It's like what's your average time to fill?
And they're like I have no idea.
It's like OK, well what's your employees are And they're like I have no idea what, what's the two sided fit?
32:24
And there's like, what is that right?
And like 2 sided fit is 90 days later the manager and the employee rate rate themselves on a scale from 1:00 to 10:00 and say how, how much of how how much of a perfect fit is this?
Right.
And if one person says zero and one person says 10, then you're a zero, right?
And if both people say zero, then it's a -10 and if both people say 10 then it's a 10.
32:44
And so like right now our two sided fit is 8.7.
So that means that on average, both people are saying 8.7 on both sides of that equation 90 days later.
Not just like you probably hired somebody.
Like it's the first week, they're killing it, they're awesome.
And then, you know, I have this conversation over and over again, I'm like, hey, how's that marketing person?
33:01
They're like, oh, they suck.
Kind of like it's like I thought like 2 weeks ago, right?
It's just like you got to give it time to breathe, but having the archetype.
And then understanding the process and truly looking at it as acquisition like talent acquisition where it's like I'm going to draw a parallel.
So you've got lead Gen. on the customer side and then you've got application generation and then you've got lead nurture on the on the customer side and then you've got application nurture right.
33:23
And then you've got sales on the customer side and you've got interviewing right and then you've got you know whatever the the offer is and you also have the offer that you're going to give them.
And then on the then you have onboarding for a customer, you have onboarding for employees.
And then you have retention and ascension for customers and you have retention and ascension for employees.
33:38
And so the entire customer life cycle is actually mirror images.
We use different words for it, but if we don't have.
Patterns the same.
Because it's people.
Yeah, right.
But you got me thinking.
Very few people learn sales because they start off as AW2 worker.
Someone, if someone brings the house cat, it's tuna, it doesn't learn how to hunt.
33:55
A handful of people can figure out how to hunt if they're hungry enough, right?
But then of the sales people, how many of them actually make it to the tier like you're saying, of being able to fill who could actually replace me?
Like, that's kind of, that's usually where I try to take off and then I fail when I come back down and I've been bouncing up and down.
It's just rare to have a human that can get that skill set because they don't stick with it like you guys did.
34:14
So.
If you could just clone yourself and make a whole bunch more Layla's like the business world would be, that 'd be nice, yes?
That whole podcast called Find Your Find Your Layla to entrepreneurs like Find Your Layla.
That's it.

The fact that you don't know if it's going to work is exactly what makes it worth doing.
It's why entrepreneurship isn't for the faint of heart.
You have to embrace uncertainty.
What makes entrepreneurship isn't the work itself.
It's actually just not knowing if the work will work.
We're afraid of wasted effort, but if it makes you better than no, effort is wasted.
0:19
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
This is my most brutally honest advice to my younger self.
0:38
You can beat 99% of people simply by continuing to work without needing your immediate reward.
This bit is advice to my younger self on how I work harder.
You're going to lose sleep.
You'll doubt whether it'll work.
You'll stress to make ends meet.
You won't finish your To Do List.
You'll wonder if you made the right call and have no way to know for years.
0:54
But that's what hard feels like.
The other great reason for working harder is that the harder you work, the more you realize what you used to think was.
Hard work isn't even close to what you're capable of.
Because if you want to know what the most dangerous money making combo in the world, it's work ethic and time.
Because once you realize just how much more work it takes to get from good to great, you realize you can only be great at a few things and you're forced to ignore the rest.
1:15
The amount of work it takes to be good negates the ability to be great at more than one or two things, because there's just only so much time.
It just takes work.
Shit, loads and shit.
Loads of work.
And every time I dress it up or cut a corner, I get brutally reminded by life that the work just needs doing.
So yes, this is your friendly reminder that it's okay to work on weekends.
1:33
I used to think that if I worked on something for a day, it was a lot.
I was like, dude, I worked on this for a whole day.
That was like a huge amount of work.
And I would say that to someone to show them how hard I worked.
And then it became like, I worked on this for a week and then a month.
And I would say now that I can work on the same project for a year or two years.
1:49
And that's what, like to the books, has been huge projects for me.
My quickest shorthand on the shift in work is that I started counting in hundreds, hundreds of minutes, hundreds of hours, hundreds of days towards a specific goal.
If you count in hundreds, it just automatically forces you to do significantly larger amount of effort.
2:04
Just sheer volume of work.
I think one of my favorite parables about work is that there was an art class.
They split the class into two groups and one group.
They said make the absolute best pot and turn in one pot and the other group they said make as many pots as you possibly can.
At the end of the semester, the team that had to make as many pots as only possible not only made more pots, but also ended up making better pots than the one that spent all of their time trying to make one.
2:27
I think a lot of people need that permission to have a lot of shitty first drafts in order to start working harder on anything, But that's not how I operate because for me, I would rather spend a lot more time in my first draft so I don't have to make so many more edits.
If you do it the right way, you realize how many hours you're going to have to put into something.
2:44
And usually most people that I feel like haven't done that level of effort confront the work and then they get scared about it.
I have to find a different way.
This can't actually be how people do this.
That is how you do it.
The work just needs doing and no one's going to do it for you.
I started with a normal hourly job and I think a lot of people do.
2:59
A lot of early job thoughts or lessons are that when you show go up to work you are working because you're getting paid to be there.
When you start working for yourself, you're not getting paid to be there.
You're only getting paid on what you do.
I've gone on vacations with other entrepreneurs.
They're like, man, we had a crazy work day.
I was like I was with you homie, like that was not a work.
3:16
These are off days for me.
Like these aren't like real work day because work occurred.
It to me is not a work day unless I have a clear output for what I have done or move forward.
Work didn't happen.
The longer you can delay when you need to be rewarded for the work that you do, the greater the outcome is.
3:32
It's kind of like a plane taking off.
The longer the runway, the bigger the plane.
And so a lot of people can barely even get a bottle rocket off the ground because they have such a short attention span and such a need for immediate reward.
And if you feel like you're behind where you should be by now, if you feel like you're losing, if you're not sure it's going to work, there's nothing wrong with you.
3:51
That is entrepreneurship.
You're on the right path.
You're doing the right things.
You're seeing the milestones along the way.
But the milestones aren't parades.
It's uncertainty.
It's sleepless nice.
It's not knowing if you can make payroll.
It's not even being sure that the five years you put into this idea is actually going to turn into something that you'll get credit for eventually.
4:10
The biggest shift that I had internally during those harder times was that I am the put of my work.
All of this effort is to create who I want to become.
I get to use that as my reward every day, rather than the approval of strangers.
Sitting in uncertainty is the feeling of entrepreneurship.
You're not doing it wrong.
4:25
Like that's what it feels like.
It's kind of this weird dichotomy of feeling like you never have enough time, but then you also have all the time in the world.
The biggest reason that a lot of entrepreneurs don't succeed is because they're in a rush.
The rush is what creates poor decisions, and so they consistently hop from thing to thing to thing because they think this thing will get them there faster.
4:42
By hopping consistently, they guarantee that they'll never get there.
And I think we have a culture that rewards speed because everybody wants things fast and easy in $100 offers the book.
I talk about value.
You have a dream outcome and then you have basically everything that discounts or multiplies it.
A discount would be risk associated with it.
4:58
I want this thing, but I want it to be guaranteed.
I want it to be easy and I want it to be fast.
And entrepreneurship is literally the opposite of that.
The dream outcomes there, but it is not guaranteed incredibly hard and takes forever.
The problem is that it's so compelling to sell people on that and there's so many more ad dollars that go into.
5:15
It's fast, it's easy and it's guaranteed that.
It's really tough to shift the landscape of the language around entrepreneurship because there's just so much money to be made by making that promise.
The concept of the the billionaire who, like, starts back over and they're like, could he do it again?
It's like, well, of course the problem with the show is, is that they give you 90 days.
5:33
The premise is wrong and I get why they do it is because they have to cater to people who think that way, which is most people Can you build $1,000,000 business in 90 days?
But it's like, but he could build a much bigger business in two years and that billionaire would probably never build the business that he builds on the show.
So it actually reinforces the wrong perspective from a brand foundation perspective.
5:51
It's how can I build a reputation over a long period of time, not necessarily with the intent to transact, but simply to build a reputation associating myself with these positive things.
That takes time for one, lots of people to find out about you.
And two, for a lot of people to develop a strong affinity and make multiple associations with you so that it's stronger.
6:09
The classic example of that is somebody who makes content for five years and then it launches a product and the products immediately a billion dollar thing.
Not that they made a billion dollars in a year, it's that they spent five years letting the roots go down for the bamboo tree and then eventually it shoots up, right.
On the other hand, you've got kind of product based foundation software.
You might take a long time to code and like write a huge code base that could go after some big problem.
6:27
It could be regulatory stuff because if you want to get into like banking for example, there's lots of barriers to entry.
Even if you're starting an e-commerce brand, you would be talking to different manufacturers, You'd be going through prototypes, you'd be trying things out, you'd be testing it in beta groups to get feedback, and then you'd probably have some sort of capital investment to capitalize your first inventory run.
6:43
All of those things are the foundations.
The reason I like service business for people who are starting out is that you don't have to do either of those things.
But if you had one or two or both of those things, then you can create something bigger, faster, on a longer time horizon.
It's actually the classic example of how long do you sharpen the axe.
7:00
If someone is doing a business that they have no leverage because they built no foundation, they basically just take whatever axe is given to them and they just start hacking away at the tree.
Except in the game of business, the tree might be a mile wide and the axe that you have could be a lightsaber if you spend enough.
I'm sharpening it.
7:15
Even if it took one guy a year of going from dull axe to lightsaber, he would still catch up at year 2 and then from year 2 to 10 doesn't even get close to the other guy.
But the problem is that everybody listens to everyone else who's judging them on their time rise.
And like, you quit your job on a employee time rise and your family is like, have you started making money yet?
7:33
And you're like it's been 2 weeks.
They're like, well yeah, this is when you would normally get a paycheck.
You're measuring stick has to change when you get into a different game.
Sometimes the fastest way to get to $1,000,000 a year isn't the fastest way to get to $10 million a year.
And to the same degree.
The fastest way to get to 10 isn't the fastest way to go to 100.
If we're measuring effort in terms of stress and hours per day, running a local restaurant takes the same amount of work as building an application.
7:55
That could be a billion dollar application, and it might take you a few years for a restaurant to build a reputation in the area, get locals coming in, hire and train good talent like it takes a lot of work to do all that stuff.
And to the same degree, hiring really good development engineers and creating a prototype like the actual work and stress is almost identical.
8:11
It's almost like you have three slot machines that you're going up to and they all cost the same cost, but one of them has a billion dollar payout, one has a $10 million payout and one is $100,000 payout and everyone just lines up for the $100,000 payout.
Third variable, if we're going to like make this in terms of dimensions, the next one is how long are we measuring the payout for the slot machine.
8:29
We assume that slot machines payout immediately, but if one slot machine pays out now, one pays out in a year and one pays out in five years, what if the odds were the same, but you only got one coin, Which one would you do?
People say they would do the billion dollar one, but based on their behavior, they're just standing at the at the the the fast token machine, not being able to break it.
8:48
The fact that you don't know if it's going to work is exactly what makes it worth doing.
It's why entrepreneurship isn't for the faint of heart.
You have to embrace uncertainty.
What makes entrepreneurship isn't the work itself, it's actually just not knowing if the work will work.
We're afraid of wasted effort.
9:03
But if it makes you better, then no effort is wasted.
As long as you can make that connection, you're not going to burnout.
You're just doing what it takes.
The biggest metal lesson of my entire life was when I lost everything the first time I had sold all the gyms, and then that was my nest egg for my five years of work, even though it was not as much as I had hoped, but it was still something.
9:20
And then I put that all into the next thing and then lost it all.
But after losing it all, I was able to immediately go out and make 100,000 the next month with nothing maxing out a credit card to do it.
That moment was I was like, oh, like I thought that the gyms were the thing that I had built, but it was my skills.
9:35
It's the thing that I had built.
I consider skills income insurance.
You just know that you will be able to make money.
People want to invest in the stock market because they want to have a retirement.
If you invest in skills, that is your retirement because you will always be able to trade them for money.
And whether the money is in bitcoins, seashells or dollars, you'll always be able to trade something of value.
9:53
This is going to piss off the exact same people that we think it's going to piss off.
You don't need a weekend like the concept is barely 100 years old.
It's a modern invention, right?
What you really need is work that you don't need a weekend from.
And instead of thinking about work life balances like a seven day work week, think about work life balances like on like a seven-year time horizon.
10:09
And so like there are seasons of work and there are seasons of less work.
My goal would always be that I just never have something I want to retire from.
In some ways you could say I retired from owning gyms for a while, but I haven't retired from work.
I don't think anyone who wants to live a long life should retire from work.
All the people that I know who are really old, they pretty much die when they stop working.
10:25
I've seen the people who stay alive the longest have reasons to stay alive and work is a good one.
The problem is that everyone's idea, like the masses who are listening to this, their idea of what work is, is not what I'm talking about.
Theirs is like the soul sucking work at a job you hate for a boss that doesn't appreciate you, for a company that doesn't do good in the world.
I completely understand why you would not be motivated to do that and you would want to get away from that as soon as possible.
10:46
You'd be amazed at how much faster you can get to your goals when you don't go backwards 104 days a year.
Contrary to what the mediocre masses will tell you, weekends can also be for work.
We had a contractor once who said I quit my job so that I wouldn't have to work weekends and he was upset that he had worked a weekend.
11:01
You do not have an accurate estimation of reality if you think that starting a business is going to mean that the first business you ever start, you're not going to work weekends right now.
If I started a business, I could take weekends if I wanted to, but I think that's because there's a level of skill you have to get to to get there.
A buddy of mine was talk to me about how he had an employee who was asking for like 6 weeks of paid vacation.
11:19
They had like, not a lot of experiences.
Like, I need this time.
He's like, well, I tell you what he's like, what if I give you 110 days a year off paid?
Would that work?
They were like, yeah.
And he's like, cool.
That's weekends and federal holidays.
If you just don't go backwards on weekends, you can move ahead so much faster.
11:35
If you go out drinking or you do your cheat days on the weekend, then you can undo all of the work that you're doing in the rest of the days of the year and be neutral or even negative at the end of the year, depending on how bad off track you go during those 104 days.
From a business perspective, you might get inquiries over the weekend.
11:52
If you don't work your leads over the weekend, you started a deficit.
You might lose those sales if you generate income during the week and then you don't on weekends.
It's 104 days a year that you're not generating income out of 365.
You're also going into a deficit that you have to then make up for in the first two days.
So let's say that the two day negative has to get offset by two days of positive.
12:09
Then you're really only been working three days.
Now you compare that to somebody who's either not losing steam on the weekends or actually getting ahead on the weekends.
That person isn't moving ahead like twice as fast.
They're moving ahead like 7 times as fast.
And so I think that's the piece that a lot of people are missing, is the look at somebody who's further ahead.
Be like, well, this person works like this.
12:25
It's like, well, if you work the same amount as them, they're actually going to keep getting further ahead.
So you have to work as much as them to match.
Probably a little bit more because they're more skilled at working than you are, and then even more to get ahead.
Success is the only revenge.
As you expand, they shrink into irrelevance as you get louder.
12:42
No one can hear them.
You don't beat them.
You cast a shadow so big no one can see them to begin with.
Because at the end of the day, there's no greater waste of time than justifying your actions to people who have a life that you don't want.
And there's no amount of pain you can inflict on a hater that will be more painful than their own life.
12:59
Last part was from Layla, like, there is no retaliation, There's no retribution, There's no actual revenge.
So I have beaten a lot of business people in the field, people that I saw as competitors, like where it was very clear we're going head to You're just like, oh, there is a tipping point at some point where you start to gain an advantage, you start to separate from them.
13:26
And then that further, you know, they go down that vicious cycle because you are their hater, their mind or their competition.
The biggest mistake of my career I made because of a competitor.
That mistake cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million actual money.
Not like like, oh, this is an opportunity that I did like I actually lost like $25 million on this.
13:42
And I just swore to myself that I would never let somebody else dictate my behavior.
Winners focus on winning.
Losers focus on winners.
So the same thing goes with competitors.
Winners focus on customers.
Competitors focus on winners.
They're always trying to copy you, but because they're trying to copy you, they're not looking at their customers, still looking at you.
13:59
And so they're completely distracted.
They're not looking at the data source that matters most.
First off, if anyone ever copies you, you're already won because they need you.
You don't need them.
You should be afraid when people stop copying you because it means that you've got nothing.
And so I see people copying what I'm doing as a positive sign that I'm on the right path rather than a distraction that merits all of my attention getting redirected to trying to destroy someone.
14:19
If you walk like downtown in any city, well that building is a $400 million building and that building is $400 million.
That's how much money a billionaire has.
Everything else that's there is still up for grabs.
There's so much out there, it's super hard to comprehend.
When we had 5000 plus gyms and gym launch, I think we had 45 gyms in Atlanta, they would be like, well, there's another gym down the street and I'm like there's also 1500 gyms in Atlanta.
14:41
So the 45 that are all gym launch gyms are just going to do better than the other 1400 and 55.
The pie is so much bigger than people think it is.
If you feel like you are the output of your life, at the end of your life, who you are is the thing that is the thing that you became, then competition is good for you.
Like if you look back at that, that person, would you want that person to have no challenges?
14:59
Like if you were at the end of your life and you looked back, would you be like, I'm glad I overcame no adversity.
I'm glad no one ever put me to the test.
I'm glad I never got to see what I was truly capable of.
I'm glad I never had to risk it all when the chips were down.
You would never say that.
We just don't like going through it in the short term, but we do want the outcome of it.
15:15
If you just accept that that's the price tag for the person you want to be, then you just pay it willingly.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
15:33
You can check on my YouTube channel, It's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
And if not, keep enjoying the show.
I have two simple lenses for friendship.
Number one, do they generally root for you when you win #2?
Do they make you better?
Finding people who do even one of those two things is rare.
15:49
Both is even rarer, which is why they get the highest title of friend.
One of the highest ROI traits in life that you can make is all the fake friends that you have for one real friend that has your back, even when it all seems lost.
Bonus points if it's your spouse.
The rare people in your life who root for you to hit your goals are more valuable than the goals themselves.
16:07
Consider yourself lucky if you find even one human who believes in you more than you do.
And never let them go.
When you start out, people are happy for you that you're doing something, but I this is going to be really fucked up.
But I actually think that people are happy that you quit your job because it counts you out of the race because the likelihood that you win is so low.
16:23
And so they're happy because you're actually taking a step back.
You literally take a step back in income, take a step back in status because you're not doing as well.
Like I went from a white collar job to being a personal trainer.
Like it was a big step back.
So any of my peer group were like, Oh yeah, so good that you're doing that.
If I had immediately jumped and started a tech startup and raised $100 million, they probably immediately wouldn't have been happy for me.
16:42
I think the reason that you get that underdog rooting in the beginning is because you actually take a step down in status, and so their relative standing actually increases.
So they encourage you.
But then as you come up, your success reminds some of the dreams that they didn't pursue to begin with.
It also reminds them that you started with probably the same resources.
16:57
And that's why it's so hard to go home for a lot of people.
Because everyone who you grew up with in middle school and high school, you become a glaring example of what they could have done but didn't.
It's what you make them think about themselves.
Astonishingly, more people know what they should do than claim to know what they should do.
There's usually a voice on some level.
17:13
Acting is a hypothetical punishment they haven't actually experienced yet.
We're taking an action that they haven't done yet because we fear this hypothetical punishment.
We don't take the real action.
A lot of people just stay stuck there.
There was one specific voice that I was like really afraid of for selling gym launch because I thought 46,000,000 wasn't enough that that person would be impressed.
And then when I thought about was like, this person is going to prevent me from like this person's opinion.
17:32
I was like, what do I care do his own life?
What if he does sell his company for more money than me?
Does that mean I sucked?
No, It just means that like I decided to do something, he decided to do something.
I'm only ascribing value to this person's been because I know who they are.
There's 100,000 times more people who I don't know were beating me than the ones that I do.
So why would I listen to this one person?
17:48
Unless someone is ahead of you, take their hate as envy and then disregard.
Envy is when you want something that someone else has.
Jealousy is when you fear losing something that you have.
So if you've got your girl and some guy comes up, you get jealous.
If someone has a girl that you wish you had, you experience envy.
18:05
So envy is about something you don't have, jealousy about fear of losing something you do.
If people are further behind you, then they're envious of you.
If someone's ahead of you, then they're afraid that you're going to take what they have.
Mind you.
In either of those scenarios, it doesn't matter.
I see hate as feedback, nothing more, nothing less.
And I think feedback is worth taking into consideration and what level of validity there is.
18:24
So if someone says, hey, you copied my entire business and you've never met them, but you know that that's not true.
I had this guy come up to me, saw me on the street randomly.
He was like, hey man, I need to apologize to you.
For what?
I've, like, really, really hated you for a long time.
Why?
Like because you stole the closer framework from me.
18:41
And I was like, dude, I know the fuck you are.
He was like, let's be honest, like, what's the likelihood that we both came up with the same acronym?
And I was like, hi, do you take an acronym?
That's for a closer?
And then you fit the words.
I actually went back.
I found my first document that had closer on it, and I screenshotted the date and it was before he had started selling.
18:56
He squashed it and I was like, you're copying me, motherfucker.
I said it joking because I don't give a shit that hates feedback.
If I'm getting data from the environment, it's data.
It's not good or bad.
It just is.
If everybody ahead of you is afraid that you're going to beat them, that's probably decent data.
If everybody behind you is obvious of where you're at, that's probably decent data to know.
If people are all trying to sue you at the same time for something, then maybe there's something there that you shouldn't have done that you did.
19:18
It's the second layer of judgment is the one that everyone gets in trouble with.
This thing happened.
Now I'm going to ascribe meaning to it.
What does the hate mean?
Mean anything.
It's just feedback.
And then you take the data and do whatever you want with it.
Sadness comes from a lack of options, which is why it feels like hopelessness.
Anxiety comes from many options but a lack of priorities, which is why it feels like paralysis.
19:36
Looking everywhere but moving nowhere.
Solve sadness with knowledge and anxiety with a decision.
Understanding this changed my life.
Let's say somebody gets really depressed because they get laid off.
Why are they sad?
Because they have a perceived lack of options.
If I have five job offers on my table, am I sad that I got laid off because my job offers are better than the one I just left?
19:52
No.
Now, if I had a hundred options on the table, I might have anxiety.
I have too many options and I don't know which one to do.
It's a perceived lack of option.
With sadness, you don't know to because you don't know anything to do with anxiety, you don't know which to do.
Disappointment is when an expectation was on map, you neither change your expectations or change reality.
The stoic frame for that is that you imagine all the things that go worse.
20:09
I mean, there's a lot of frames, but that's one of them.
The other one is that you imagine that that thing happens 1000 times in a row.
What would you feel in 1000 time?
Probably nothing.
Why?
Because you'd already adjusted your expectations and if you already adjusted your expectations then you can adjust them.
Buddhist monks fundamentally basically do that.
They just change nothing externally and only change internally.
Which is fine.
20:24
But to a certain degree, like I want to benefit humanity and I don't know how beneficial that is.
And to be fair, me saying that I want to do that also creates an expectation to myself which I could be let down for.
So like I do create a possibility that I am let down by saying I want to help people.
If I don't help them then I would be disappointed.
You can shoot big as long as you don't make missing mean that you suck.
20:42
I think that being has been the best goal for me to pursue, because it's the one that's 100% under my control.
If I have something that is disappointing that occurs, what type of version do I want to be in this instance?
And then what would that man do?
And as closely as I can map my actual behavior to that person's, the more joy I will experience because I'm present in doing the things that I think I should be doing and I can still give myself kudos for how well I handled a shitty situation and then end up deriving joy from something that otherwise might have been bad.
21:06
I remember seeing this quote once.
I was like, if you follow your own advice, you'd already be way further than you currently are.
And I thought about that and I was like, yeah, I don't think I need to follow anyone else's advice.
I think I should be doing the things I already know I should be doing.
Then you just have like kind of the emotional component of feeling like you want to maybe release something or whatever.
And me being able to talk to my future version of myself in a dialogue format allows me to get grace from a future version of self and also get approval from a future version of self.
21:30
So somebody that I esteem higher than myself is future May, who's hopefully better and his judgement on my current situation and his advice, It tends to be really good advice.
The best advice I've gotten has been from future May owns afraid of failing.
They're afraid of what other people will think of them when they fail.
21:46
But if they're afraid of that, imagine what those other people think of you when you're not even trying.
Well, the reality is they're not at all.
If they don't have what you want, don't listen to what they say.
Having what you want is a really easy evidence point.
That's high likelihood, basically.
It decreases the risk of whatever advice they're providing.
22:02
That's not a perfect frame because there are amazing Olympic coaches that never won the goal.
The fastest way to move forward in life is listen to people who can give you advice that can get you there faster.
So not having to suffer and experience and waste all that time and back step to learn the lesson to move forward.
And so the faster you can avoid those lessons and just keep moving forward, the faster you move.
22:21
But the problem is we don't know who to trust.
And so So I have made 7 levels of how I weigh advice that have served me well, but at the lowest level, #7 comments on social media, which is basically comments from strangers who don't know me and don't have what I want.
Number six, people giving their two cents who do know me but don't have what I want. #5 Someone who knows me and know someone who went to where I'm trying to go. #4 someone who's been there. #3 someone who took someone else there.
22:47
Number two, someone who took someone just like me to exactly where I want to go.
And #1, someone who has been there there took someone else there just like me multiple times.
Do I trust somebody who's taking someone else there because I am the someone else more than someone who's only taking themselves there?
Because if someone's taking someone else there, then I could slot in and there's a likely they could do it again.
23:04
If they've only taken themselves there and not taken anyone else there, then they might not be a very good teacher, which happens all the time.
Michael Jordan has an insane record.
Playing basketball has a very poor record owning a basketball team.
I'm big on give, give, give until they ask, right?
And especially if you're starting out, the best thing to do is give away stuff for free for multiple reasons.
23:23
One, because you probably suck because you haven't done it yet and it's a gift.
If someone allows you to work for them because you have a chance at providing value.
And from there you can leverage that into testimonials, referrals, and potentially even a paying customer.
They might.
If you continue to provide this value for free, eventually say, hey, I've got too many people I'm providing for free.
23:40
I have too much demand on my time at price of free and I can go to 20% of the price that I want to go to.
And if everyone says yes and you of demand, then you go to 40% of the price and then sixty and then a hundred and then 500%, right?
You keep going.
But what happens is a lot of people will shortchange that.
And so I get DMS every day of people saying, hey, I want to give you value in exchange for and it's just stop, Don't tell me what value you want to give me and what you want to trade that value for.
24:04
And usually it's them actually massively undervaluing my time, as though them making it free to me is somehow more valuable than me paying for something.
Like I have tons of money, I don't have tons of time.
And so it's my much scarcer resource.
And this kid was like, yeah, I have a lot of advice that I think I can give you on social media.
And I click over his profile, he's got 100 followers and he said I'll do it in exchange for a testimonial.
24:24
And it was just like it was so blind to reality.
First off, you have no evidence that you're good.
Second off, it's delusion.
And so the way to do it right is to go above and beyond, do a ton of work, and then just give it to the person not in exchange for or an expectation of, but just give it to that person.
24:39
And then guess what will happen?
Nothing.
Because most times if someone's way ahead of you, they might not want it or might not need it.
But you make your best approximate guess of what they might need.
Do your best shot at it.
There's probably three things that can happen.
One, most likely nothing happens.
They don't respond to you.
They don't care.
The second option is that they see how hard you worked on something.
And even though they don't need that thing, everyone one level up needs people who work hard on things.
24:59
And then so you still prove how hard you work by how good the thing that you give is.
And so they might have an opportunity for you, not even in the in the main thing, but on something else.
And then the third and probably the least likely but probably the one you want the most, is that they say, wow, that's amazing.
I would love for you to do that.
Now to be fair, most of the people on my team came from doing that.
25:16
You roll the dice and people roll the dice one time with their time and say, I did this work for this one guy and he didn't immediately hire me an on retainer, but did you do it for 100 people?
If you give tremendous value to 100 people, you'll be able to make more income than most jobs in America by providing A tremendous amount of value to 100 business owners.
25:35
One of them or five of them will respond back and say, yes, I would like more work from you or I can offer you a job.
I was afraid to charge people money, but I did want them to, like, be invested.
And so I started a nonprofit called the Free Training Project, where I said if they donated $500,000 to the charity of their choice, I would train them for 12 weeks.
25:50
That's how I got my first customers.
But then after the 12 weeks, some of them were like, I still want to keep training with you.
And I was like, hey, I'm the charity now.
I am poor.
Please help me.
That's literally at literally the end of the 12 weeks, I was like, I think I want to do this full time because I did it while I still have my job.
And then I was like, I think I want to do this full time.
I hope you guys are OK with this.
I like if you could pay me instead.
26:07
I just kind of like everyone did.
No one had any problems with it.








0:00
No one's ever done it, and I'm going to be the first if you can at least just believe that if someone has done it, it is therefore possible and therefore I can't do it too if I do the same things.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:20
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I want to make this kind of short for you because it's I had two or three things happen or the last handful of days that just seem to be this repeated thing.
0:39
And it reminded me that a lot of people struggle with this, which is they believe that they are inherently bad at things because they are not good at them.
And I think that that is an incredibly dangerous belief set to have.
And So what I want to do is kind of break that belief set down to hopefully break it for you.
1:00
So I think one of the most valuable beliefs because, you know, in terms of building on success, in my opinion, first you need to develop skills.
Then you need to develop character traits to make sure that you do those skills.
And then you have to make sure that your beliefs are correct, that you can open up the world.
Right.
The beliefs are kind of imbued throughout the entire process because if you don't believe you're going to acquire skill, you never will, right.
1:20
If you don't believe you're going to have a character trait, you never will.
And so I was having a conversation with a, a friend of mine who's looking to, you know, switch career paths.
She's trying to figure out she wasn't making as much money she wanted to make.
And the issue that she was dealing with, she's like, she just doesn't have a valuable enough skill set.
1:38
Right.
And she's like, I want to make this much money.
And I was like, well, you're never going to do that doing what you're doing, right.
And I was like, have you considered learning how to sell, right.
I mean because if you sell, you have a far, you know, if you still have the desire for security.
But if you know how to sell, you can pretty much write your own paycheck if you know where to look.
And she was like, I'm, I'm not, I'm not good at sales.
1:56
I'm not a salesperson.
And I was like, well, how many hours of sales training have you gone through?
She was like, you know, none.
And I was like, well, then why would it be reasonable for you to be good at sales, right.
Like that doesn't that doesn't make any sense.
Of course you're not sales like you haven't done it right.
Well like it's so it's the same thing like well, I'm not a very marketing type person was like well how many courses have you gone through?
2:15
How many hours a day do you spend studying marketing?
Well, you know none.
Well, then why is it reasonable that you're like why would it it's it would be unreasonable for you to be good at the skill given the amount of investment you've made, right.
And so it's this, it's this recurring thing that I've seen over and over and over again.
2:32
And it also it presents itself in different ways.
Like I, you know, I'll speak at some event or something and I'll start getting into very basic math about business, just business math, like you know how how much does it cost to acquire a customer, how much, what's the lifetime value, things like that.
And I can see people starting to freak out because they're like I'm not good at math and I have to lean back and or lean, you know, pressure onto that belief because one that's a belief that will literally never serve you.
2:56
It's like saying like I hate employees.
It's like, well, good luck owning a business that you want to grow to any appreciable scale.
But with the math example, most you can massively succeed in business knowing only not even algebra, just basic multiplication, subtraction, division.
3:13
If you just know how to do that, that's all you need to do.
And just about everyone knows how to do those things and at the very least has a calculator who can do multiplication, division at addition and subtraction.
That's it.
That's all you literally need.
And The thing is, is that people mistake that they are bad at math when in reality they do not understand the concepts that create the math, right?
3:37
Cost per acquisition, right?
OK, that's a math statement just expressed in words.
And so everyone gets tripped up and then they say I'm bad at math when in reality they just don't understand the term.
And by doing that, they inherently limit themselves from learning because they have this checkbox in their head that as soon as it gets difficult, they say, ah, I'm bad at this, I am bad at this.
3:59
I identify with being poor at this thing and therefore will never succeed at this thing.
That's your requirement for being successful.
And so I think that for me, one of the cornerstone beliefs that has helped me a tremendous amount, I just want to share it with you, is that if someone can, therefore I can.
4:22
And sure is that does that necessarily mean that you're going to, you know, go to go to Mars, like no one's ever done that before?
I think that's a next level belief.
No one's ever done it.
And I'm going to be the first right.
But I think if you can at least just believe that if someone has done it, it is therefore possible.
4:37
And therefore I can't do it too if I do the same things.
And the nice thing about actions is that they are agnostic to your level of deservingness and skill.
What I mean by that is if you spend an hour a day practicing sales over a year, you will likely be in the top 10%, five percent, 2% of people.
4:59
Because most people do nothing.
Most people do absolutely nothing except for deal with their emotions on a regular basis and procrastinate and give themselves reason for why they are not successful besides the obvious one, which is that it is not reasonable that they would be successful given the amount of time and effort they've put in to achieving.
5:20
Real quick wise.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their.
Employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review.
5:38
And share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take 10 seconds or one type of the sub.
That means the absolute world to me and more importantly it may change the world for someone else.
And so the only reason for this is because I had that conversation.
5:54
I spoke at the Mastermind where the girl talked about not understanding the math and just there's just so many repeated, you know, events like this or it's like can you ask yourself with reason, would it be reasonable for me to be good at this skill given the investment I've made?
6:09
And as an antithesis to that example, I've got an 18 year old kid who lives across the street from and I sort of, you know, semi mentor him.
He's a good kid.
He works super hard, lot of hustle.
And The thing is, is he's too young to know that he can't do things yet.
What that does is it makes him incredibly dangerous because he hasn't been slapped in the face by the world yet And so he believes that he can accomplish anything.
6:31
He has no reason to think otherwise.
And so I've been actively trying to speak that into him and now he's wholesaling real estate right now.
He's 18 years old.
Right.
I love this.
Right.
And how did he do it?
He watched YouTube videos for free, right?
And then he picked up cold calling because I was like, this is a book you need to read for cold calling.
6:49
And so he just started cold calling based on what the YouTube videos said off of a free list that he found on the Internet.
And he closed his first deal as 18 year old.
And so does he have an inherent skill?
No.
But what I did was I prepared him mentally by saying like, you're going to suck at this for a very, very long time and eventually after doing it so many times, it will be unreasonable for you to suck.
7:10
And at that point, you will be good, right?
And so I think if we can all approach the skills that we feel like we're deficient in with that kind of concept of, of course I am going to suck.
It would not be reasonable for me to be good.
Well, if I do these actions, it would over time be unreasonable for me to be bad at these things.
7:27
And I think by doing that you unlock a different ability to learn and by extension grow.
And so anyways, I hope you find this valuable.
It's just it's a belief set that I find repeated especially in people who are smaller business owners were getting started, etcetera.
7:44
And it drives me nuts because it's just saying that you can't do something before you've even started.
And that's why people it's been so long in the beginner stages because they inherently dispel away their ability to learn and get better.
You can say well I'm not good at that, well obviously you're not good at that.
8:00
You have not done it.
And so anyways I hope you find this valuable.
I hope you you share it or tag an employee who you feel like you needs to invest in a skill and is afraid of it, or somebody who is bad at drawing and just to bring this home.
I've said this before, but I'll say it again.
8:16
Many of you or I hear regularly that people consider me to be good at math.
Until I was 23, I thought I was horrible at math.
Like I just like, I need you to understand this.
Like, I believe I was horrible at math.
And So what I did was I stopped allowing myself to use a calculator and said I had to do all the math in my head.
8:39
And what ended up happening is I got a lot of stuff wrong for a long time.
But over time I started to get better at math because I did everything in my head.
I spend every day not using a calculator for almost every calculation I make so that I can get better.
And now it seems really cool because I can do a lot of math in my head pretty quickly, but I like, I can't.
8:59
Like I was bad.
Like I I literally cheated my entire way through high school in math class just to get by.
I told myself I was bad at math on like the SAT and the GMAT.
Those are the sections I was most afraid of, right?
And I studied so much harder on the math for the GMAT and I ended up doing, you know, hitting 99th percentile on it.
9:20
But I didn't.
But that was because I did 16 phone books of problems over four months.
I spent 4 hours a day for four months.
I was like, I will do so much work that would be unreasonable for me to not be good at this.
And so I say that just because, like, I feel like so many of us just limit ourselves and you just like, have to try.
9:40
And so anyways, love you all, I'll get an amazing day.
I hope that if there's something that you want to acquire from a skill standpoint that you will allow yourself to be reasonably bad until a point where it would be unreasonable for you to be at, given the amount of time and effort you've put into it.








0:00
I want to tell you about the most powerful sales tactic that I have learned.
I never learned it from a book.
I actually learned it by accident and it will be included in the 100 Miller sales book when it comes out.
And so you heard it here first, but it's a concept that you can do as a salesperson to gain trust.
And I stumbled into this.
I ended up selling 100% of people after I made this one switch in how I sold and I was able to teach it to people who had never sold before and they were able to close 8090% of people who are coming in the door.
0:24
Mind you, this is a retail environment selling physical products.
So rewind the clock.
I was selling supplement at my gym and the way that we would sell supplements is that we'd sell some sort of service package and then we do a nutrition orientation.
When it came for nutrition orientation, we'd actually set them up with their meal plans and then we'd make recommendations for products.
0:40
Now normally I would sell pretty well, but still I always wanted to sell more and get better.
We'd killed this launch for like a new challenge or something and we had 100 new customers are supposed to come in and I ran out one of the key products.
I had ladies come in the first half of the day and able to get the products.
And then some of their friends who signed up with them came in the second-half of the day and were like, hey, my friend Sandy told me that I need XY and Z and I was like, oh, we don't have Z anymore.
1:04
And it was like really awkward.
And I was like, shit, A lady came in and so rather than me try and skirt around this clear item that was on the list that I didn't have, I said, hey, by the way, you can get this one for cheaper down the street at Costco.
So, like, you don't need to get this one for me.
1:20
Like, this one's a little better, but I think it'll get the job done.
You can get this one after you've done the program.
And they're like, oh, thanks.
Like, that was cool.
After I made that one cross out, I was like, but you do want this and this from us.
And they're like, OK, cool.
As soon as I made that switch from saying, hey, you don't need to buy this one, you can get that from over there.
1:36
Everyone bought what I recommended afterwards.
And I was like, whoa.
And so then I leaned into that and was like, I wonder if I could do more of that so I could sell even more on the backside.
So then I had two products that I was like, hey, you can get this and this over here, get this brand.
1:52
It should be at this price.
You can go get it.
It'll save you 10 or 20 bucks.
And they were like, wow, even better.
And then I remember I looked at my list, and there was a lady there, and it was like a mass gainer.
And she obviously wasn't trying to gain mass.
And so I was like, you're not trying to gain mass.
Sorry.
And she's like, no, I was like, you can just cross that out.
Go ahead.
You don't even worry about that.
And so I gave her a recommendation of two things that you could get for cheaper.
2:09
And then I said, you don't need to worry about this.
And then when I said, hey, like, I need you to take two of these in the morning next to this, take three of these.
Take them next to this.
Put this in your car.
So you always have it with you.
I closed everyone.
What that gave birth to was something that I used to call sacrificial lambs but now called ghost products because it sounds better.
But I ended up overtime.
2:25
Not even the products that I had on there that I was recommending out because they were so powerful as a sales tool for me to gain trust from the other person.
This is an incredibly, incredibly powerful tactic.
And like all persuasion, the difference between manipulation and help is intention.
2:44
And so if you want to help someone, you are manipulating them, but you're just doing it in a positive intent now.
And if you change someone's behavior and you have negative intent, you are manipulating them.
If you believe in the stuff that you sell, you can create an environment where someone will trust you faster by giving them a reason to trust you.
And so that means that you acted in their self-interest rather than your own so that they can feel like you're not trying to take advantage of them.
3:05
Now if you know that they need this stuff, but they don't yet know that they need this stuff, then you can make a concession using a ghost product or using a sacrificial lamb so that you can gain the trust faster.
And so if you feel uncomfortable about not having the product on your menu, then you feel free to carry a product and never sell it if you feel like it.
3:21
But I realized quickly that I was never selling it and I was always giving those ones away.
And so if you're going to use this tactic, my recommendation is to make the products that you send across the street to be the ones that are the lowest margin product.
Gain the trust by giving away the low margin stuff and then keep the high margin stuff for yourself so that people trust you and then they buy that stuff.
3:41
And so if you're in an environment where you sell multiple products, this has been the most effective way that I've learned to sell.
What you want to do is give someone a vision of what their life's going to be like when they're experiencing the benefits.
And so you want to explain to them exactly how to take take it before you make the ass.
3:58
What we would do is say, hey, this one is going to help you do benefit.
Benefit.
The way that I need you to take it, need you to take it is that you're going to take two of these in the morning.
Then I ask a question and I'm like, what do you do every day, no matter what in the morning?
Do you wake up and smoke a cigarette?
4:13
Do you drink a cup of coffee?
Do you take a shower, like brush your teeth?
Like what's something you do every morning?
And then they say, well, I brush my teeth every morning.
I'm like, cool.
So I don't want you to put this in your cupboard because you'll forget about it.
I want you to put it next to your toothbrush so we don't have to make a new habit.
And they're like oh what I want you to do piece of tape, put A2 on it.
4:29
I want you to take two of them.
We're going to put an extra toothbrush.
Got it.
That's number one.
I would go through that with each of the products that I have and I would say OK, you can have all these, you're good to go.
Did you just want to use the cards you have on file?
Now they don't have to take their wallet out.
They don't have to make another purchase decision.
They just have to say yes, it's a one click upsell that is a combination of a prescriptive clothes and having ghost products to set up trust.
4:50
You're also being a good coach by showing them how they're going to make this happen in the roller.
Now this is obviously a consumption based product.
Any product that you want someone to use, they have to use it at a certain point.
And so we want to figure out ways to associate the usage of the of the product with something they're already doing.
5:06
Getting someone to make a new habit is incredibly difficult.
Getting someone to break a habit is incredibly difficult.
And so we just want to piggyback on habits they already have.
And so that makes you both a better salesperson and better coach, like overall if you're trying to help someone.
And so that kind of selling process that set clothes, gain the trust, make the prescription, works unbelievably well and then if for some reason the point person is like, well, how much does this cost?
5:25
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Then you could say, well, are you on a budget?
And if they're like, I'm on a budget, that's like, OK, then would you like me to order these in order of importance and the things that I think you absolutely need to have versus things that will just get you more benefits, faster.
What I would then do is take off one and say this would be the lowest one I've removed.
5:41
Does this work for you?
And if they're like, I can't do that, be like really getting into the bare bones here.
I'd be like, I could take this one out.
But like, this is what I want you to add to your diet to replace this thing.
You don't want to show that what you took out isn't important because then it looks like you're so it doesn't matter.
So, like, these are increased, but you're going to or broccoli now.
5:57
All right.
So you OK with that?
You know what?
I'll just get the thing.
OK, cool.
Now it's back in.
Hopefully when you're selling something, you're trying to solve a problem.
If they don't buy the thing, then you reintroduce the problem that you were solving.
So it's like, hey, I don't want you have to eat a pound of broccoli, which is why I had this.
They're trusting me to make the prescription because that's why they're paying you for expertise.
6:13
And then you can pause and say, well, are there things that are your old identity that you're going to stop doing as a result of doing this program?
Are you going to go out less?
You're going to drink less?
Are you going to smoke less?
Are you going to whatever, less.
I'm like, cool.
Well, how much of that do you do?
Cool.
We just found some money.
Don't worry about it.
Let's associate with these new activities, new identity.
6:30
If this sounds really smooth, I've done this a lot of times.
You'll get used to it.
And I think one of the best gifts you can have is trying to tack yourself into an existing sales process of a big business.
So if you work at a business that sells lots of low ticket stuff like think car washes, massage, think nails, think hair stuff where they just see lots of people every day at low tickets.
6:50
See if you can work with a business owner and incorporate some sort of inject yourself into their sales process so that you can get Rep after Rep after Rep and it will teach you more about the skill of selling and dealing with people than any course ever will.
And it will equip you for whatever you want to sell for the rest of your life.
7:06
One of the best things I ever did was do tons and tons of transactions at low tickets so that when I got to selling higher ticket, more expensive stuff, I was like, Oh my God, this is a breeze.
If you sold services, let's say you sold web design services and you had like a laundry list of stuff, you could say, hey, we, this is like, we can do this, but it's not necessarily our core capability and it would probably cost you more if we did it because we'd have to allocate more resources.
7:26
So there's guys in the Philippines that will do it for you.
I've got a connection I can I can talk to you to about after this call.
And if you really want to be sneaky about it.
If you're the owner, it's harder if you're a salesperson.
Owners tell your salespeople this.
You can have it seem like they're leaning on their side of the table to be like, hey man, like, you don't need to worry about this.
7:44
Like just I'll hook you up with a number of a guy.
And then the salesperson becomes incredibly trusted.
It becomes like they're on that side of the table.
But what the person doesn't know is that they're trying to sell the other stuff.
At the end of the day, the goal is the salesperson is to move to their side of the table.
If you start the conversation across the table, the goal is to end shoulder to shoulder so that you're both looking at the decision together with the same information to make the best decision for the person.

The biggest mistake that entrepreneurs will make at that point is that they then look at the greener grass on the other side of the fence and say, man, wholesaling is actually the thing.
I shouldn't be doing flipping.
I should be doing wholesaling.
And then what they think is they see they have uninformed optimism, right?
So they go into it being like, this is going to be amazing.
0:16
And then right after that, they get, you know, six months in and they're like I now have, informed pessimism about this opportunity.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:34
So if you're you have husbands and wives, you've got work husbands and work wives for y'all actually ends up being the same.
Dave is my work husband, as much as he doesn't want to admit it.
And I'm I'm curious, you know, like I am actually at a point.
My wife does not work at the moment.
0:50
She really does want to work.
She doesn't necessarily.
She's not super passionate about real estate, but she wants to be a part of the business, right?
What are your thoughts on, you know, involving your spouse and your work?
I mean, I feel like Y'all can probably speak to this.
Nose goes oh, got them.
I think it was different for us because when we met we both were incredibly like voraciously focused on our careers slash businesses.
1:19
And it just so happened that they were in the same industry and we had similar views on what that looked like and like what we want our futures to look like.
I I have a lot of people that come to me and say like how can I get my wife like interested in in the business.
1:35
And I don't really have an answer because it's like I it wasn't like that.
It was like.
You know what I mean?
You liked it, right?
I liked it on my own.
And then I met.
Alex Does.
It sound like he's saying, how do I get this employee that doesn't really want to be in this role to like the role?
Is that the same?
Yeah, it's like, you know, if she herself has voiced interest, then I think that you make it easy for her to acquire knowledge about it.
1:57
But I think that people have to autonomously like.
If someone's really actually interested, then they'll be like, can I come to work with you?
Can I shadow your calls?
Can I do all they start taking things from you.
They start.
I can do that.
I can do that.
I.
Can insert themselves.
And so just like anybody else would.
I don't look at it like, oh, it's your wife.
I look at it like it's a person.
2:13
If they have interest, then they'll find those ways to do it and they'll be very eager.
I think that a lot of people have a great marriage and then say, well, could we also do this together?
I don't know.
You know, I think that there's so many things that we learned in the beginning and that, you know, our natural skills that fit together eliminated a lot of friction, but there was still friction.
2:41
You know, I think in the beginning of working together, even though we had similar mission values, complementary skill sets, like still learning to work together was a skill of its own.
And it's an ongoing thing that we have to continue to learn and get better AT.
And I feel like.
I feel like every year I'm like, gosh, we've gotten so much better because it just continues to like it's it's not you're never finished, right.
3:01
We and I'm sorry, go ahead.
No, no, no.
And so I think, you know, we had a very, a different kind of scenario.
I think that there's a lot of people who want to enter that.
But I mean like it's kind of like I said earlier, like you, you pay the toll, like there's a toll that's paid, which is a learning curve.
3:16
And I think it it's not a matter of, like, weeks or months.
It's it's years of learning how to work with your spouse.
You know, I was just going to say that I think we actually fell in business love before we fell into, like, romantic love.
And I've I've said this publicly before, but, like, I think Leila and I both loved each other the day we got married.
But I feel like, I, like, felt more in love with her the more we did business together because business was, like, our first date was only about business.
3:38
And it was 4 hours long.
I didn't even ask her about anything else because she was like, oh, I'm like, oh, you see this stuff?
And she's like, oh, yeah, I heard about these Facebook ads.
This is years ago.
Right.
And I was like, oh, yeah, I'm running those.
She's like, what?
You know?
I mean like that was the whole like, that was 4 hours, right?
And at the end of the day I I pitched her on working for me.
I was like hey this might not work out but you should totally work for.
3:55
Me.
Did you still have the hangover?
It's like the first time I drank in like 2 years.
No, I felt OK that day.
And and and at this at this time, she had a book of business already.
So like, she knew how to hunt, she knew how to kill.
She had a full client roster as a personal trainer and I was a gym owner.
Just a few steps, you know, like a few career steps ahead.
4:12
I was also older than her and so.
It seems divinely inspired that you guys got married.
I'm sitting here listening to talk, thinking like you couldn't have created in a lab, better partner for each other.
I yeah, I I think that it was.
It's very much like when people say like how do you win the game?
4:29
It's like you win in the draft.
So what?
I had two questions.
One is, do you feel like you fell for her as a business partner before a romantic partner because your love language is?
Business, making money, success.
You've mentioned that before, right?
Which led me to the next question.
4:44
I was thinking is we typically do it the other way, where we want romantic sparks, we want butterflies, and we're like, I'll make all the practical stuff work, but I really want to be attracted.
You took the opposite approach, and from what we see now, it looks like the romantic stuff happened.
Still like you.
You didn't have to just wander through life until you found that person that exploded with passion.
5:04
Do you think that's good advice for people in general that are trying to figure out who to marry?
I will say that it has worked exceedingly well for us.
And so I think Leila and I talk about this just on our own time a lot, where like all the relationships that we had before this kind of were those, you know, crazy chemistry, all that stuff.
And in the beginning of Leila and I's relationship, like literally on a second date, she was like, I just feel like you're like a friend type of guy.
5:25
Friends, a second date and.
I he hadn't kissed me and I was like, what the hell?
Yeah.
Was that your way of trying to tell him he needed to do something different?
I love it.
OK.
And then I just gave, like the most sickening belly laugh of all time.
Yeah.
And then it's never first time my entire life I'd ever been like, my entire life that any girl had been like, you seem like a friend.
5:44
Classic.
I have.
Never been friends.
Ever.
You know, you told me you're like, I I actually respect you.
Yeah.
And that's what it was.
You know, I was like, I just like, I was like, I enjoy talking to you.
And I was like, I don't feel like I have to, like, pretend to wait for you to stop talking so that I can try and talk about something that I find more interesting.
6:00
And so it's not like, OK, your turn now to talk about your day.
I was like, I just want nothing to do with that.
Like, it just killed me inside.
And so I just liked hanging.
And I think we hung out every day after the first date and we didn't go on any dates for like a month.
6:15
And until finally Leo was like, you have not taken me anywhere, but we spent all day.
I was like, I'm going to be working here if you want to meet me there.
And then she would just work next to me.
And that was what we did after, like, the first date.
And then I was like, I'm going to start this thing called gym launch.
And she was like, OK, I was like, she quit, You quit your job, joint do my thing, you know, And still like, she didn't.
6:34
And then I did the thing and came back and I was like, look, it worked.
And then she was like.
I've heard me mention the moment that you were like, that's a girl for me.
I don't remember the details of the story, but had something to do with her going overseas or out of town to go crush a gym that you had just started and you.
Hammered the getting the sign up.
She basically filled it with lifeblood so that it could exist.
6:51
And that was when, like it clicked for you.
Like there was something different.
Did the romantic part change at that point?
Do you remember?
It didn't it didn't change at that point.
You just but I had like this.
It made too much of too much sense.
It's the right word.
But it was like I she had basically like eternally earned my respect at that point.
7:09
Like, I already respected her.
But, like, when she had gotten into that really tough spot or I was in that really tough spot.
And basically, you know, at any other point, I would have expect it would have been reasonable for any other person just like walk away because we split up and she went and so she had quit her job to join me to do this thing.
7:27
Six months later, I'm like, I don't know if I can do this.
I'm so overwhelmed.
I've got 9 businesses.
None of them are making money.
You know, I've got some of you stole from me.
I had all this stuff that's going wrong.
I just had a DUI.
My mother's in the hospital.
I'm, I'm just like, I have nothing left.
And so she's like, well, I'm going to go to the launch that we're supposed to do.
7:42
And then she broke every record.
She still has the all time record for the biggest launch and it was like she stood tall.
Yes, when shit was tough and I think that's where I was like, well, wherever I want to go, I'm going to need someone like that.
I think that's where all my best friends came from, Those moments when you don't feel strong, you feel vulnerable.
8:02
You know you need somebody and they show up for you.
Like it creates a bond that that is deeper than just an attraction that can come and can go.
She made 100 grand in in 24 days.
At a time when you needed it.
Every dollar.
Any other time, right?
Every dollar of it.
Do you ever go to bed at night and just think like how awesome you are at that moment?
8:20
This is because.
Of you like it was like the night inning.
Yeah, you have.
A mirror.
You have a mirror on the.
Ceiling 2 outs, you know two strikes, 9th inning, bottom of the ninth and you hit the home run that led to the New York Yankees becoming the biggest brand.
But to to I was just going to full circle it, which is just like a lot of people are going through the the the dating side of this or they're in the marriage that there's two different seasons on this.
8:41
Like if you were on the dating side.
I do not give advice because I think so much of like there's so much individual variation that goes into relationships and whatnot.
We can only comment on the fact that like, this was a very different dynamic for both of us and it just so happened to have worked out.
And all I can share is that like if you think about something all day long every day, then it is very helpful to have someone else who also thinks about the exact.
9:04
Language all day long like, right?
Like not many people could have figured out how to how to hit your love language there.
Yeah, it just talks to me about business all day.
What about from your side?
Like what advice would you give to guys that are trying to figure out how do I get a girl in my life that can also work with me?
How do I figure out if we're partners?
9:21
I think the first piece of advice that I would give is like what I'm so grateful for with our relationship is that we've never compared it to anyone else's.
And I think that even people comparing their relationship to ours, you're going to lose because you can't be Alex and Layla.
And I think what we've never subscribed to is like any traditional relationship norms, rules, Is this OK?
9:42
Is that OK?
Is is this bad?
Is this good?
One day, night per week, we literally will say we're like put.
In a calendar.
We we don't care if it's good or bad.
We like it and it works for us.
And so I think everyone has to find that in their relationship and I wish everyone can could just release judgement of their relationship and if you like it and it works for both of you, then keep doing it.
10:01
I don't care what that looks like.
I don't think anyone else does.
But I think that we're so busy comparing ourselves and.
Looking at, you know, people only see us on social media and I, I do think that we're pretty transparent.
But at the same time, it's like, you know, no one relationship looks the same and so it's just hard to, you just have to stop judging yourself for whatever you do have.
10:19
If it's working for you, yeah, maybe it works better in other places that ours doesn't, you know what I mean?
You're just seeing one side.
You're like, hear us on this podcast, You're like, man, wouldn't that be nice?
But maybe, maybe you have something else that that that we don't have, you know what I mean?
Like.
We just don't know.
It doesn't exist.
Yeah, And we're good with that.
Yeah, works for us though.
10:37
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
10:57
So if it was a review, if it was a post.
If you do that, you'll mean the world to me, and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Before we wrap up today, I did want to ask, you know, you mentioned Dave Ramsey a little bit earlier.
Did you recently have like a light bulb moment in how you invest your money?
11:13
Well, I saw a podcast that he did with Graham.
Stefan how remember what it was.
But Graham had him look at his investment portfolio and he was asking Dave to just analyze it.
And before Dave looked at it, he was like, well, what I can tell you is having talked to all the billionaires that I know, they all tend to do one thing that they like and they're good at and they just do a lot of it.
11:35
And so he asked the follow up question to Graham.
He said, OK, if this, if this pie chart, this circle where your total knowledge and experience and resources and connections, what percentage of it would be like stock market stuff, what percentage of it would be real estate, what percentage of it would be business etcetera.
And he's like well, shoot, I probably say 85% of my knowledge is about real estate.
11:53
And when he looked at the circle, 85% of his assets were real estate.
And he's like, well then I think this is a perfect distribution for you.
And that one bit was what ultimately gave me.
It felt like gave me permission to do what we kind of wanted to do, but didn't feel like it was right.
12:08
Because to the point about we're talking about relationships.
You know, I had spoken to all the guys that I knew who had, you know, who were at 500, a billion and and and up who were ahead of me.
And I was like, what should I do with this money?
Like how should I invest it?
Like all this stuff.
And literally every single person had an entirely different strategy.
And so I was like maybe I should get hard money lending, maybe I should get into you know like fix and flip stuff, maybe I should just buy apartment buildings, maybe it maybe we should do business, invest.
12:30
But wait, are we doing business?
What won't we just start another business?
You know, like I was going through all this stuff and I just didn't know what to do.
But when I thought about that I was like we like business and we're good at business and so let's just if I were to draw that circle, it would be 100% business.
And so our circle of assets though high risk from the outside when you're buying companies that are in 2 to 5 million in profit a year, which is usually around the, the size that that we come in, those are from a investor class asset considered risky, you know, risky, risky investments.
13:03
But you know to to quote Warren Buffett, it's only risky if you don't know what you're doing, right.
And a lot of times I'm sure there's realist, I mean to be fair, there's always, there's always bodies, you know what I mean?
But if at least if you know which closets are going to have the bodies, then you're like, oh, I know there's going to be bodies there And you don't get, I mean sure, we still get surprised every once in a while, but you have fewer surprises and the damage that you suffer from the surprises continues to go down and down.
13:24
And so you can get outsized returns because you have an information advantage.
And so that's that was the the piece that Dave gave us.
And then that's why acquisition not we're like well what are we really good at, really good at scaling brick and mortar, really good at scaling services both consumer service, professional services and it's like that's what we're going to buy.
13:39
Man, I I watch you do that.
I'm just looking at this whiteboard in front of me that you actually have the market very missed opportunity she had to illustrate it.
That's great advice though, because everybody else is looking for what they're doing wrong.
What's the secret?
Oh, I'm do, I'm making money this way.
But it could be better if it was over here and they're bouncing around and no one asked the question.
13:57
You said what are you good at and what are you happy doing?
You can make money in that and like it's going to be a much lighter lift when when that's what you're doing.
And if I can tack on to that, like let's say you've been doing something for like 3 years and you're making some money at it, right?
In my opinion, the biggest mistake that entrepreneurs will make at that point is that they then look at the greener grass on the other side of the fence and say, man, wholesaling is actually the thing.
14:19
I shouldn't be doing flipping, I should be doing wholesaling.
And So what they do is they, and that's actually even a little bit too close.
They, you know, they say crypto trading or whatever, right, something a little bit more out outside of the loop.
And then what they think is they see they have uninformed optimism.
So they go into it being like, this is going to be amazing.
14:34
And then right after that, they get, you know, six months in and they're like, I now have informed pessimism about this opportunity.
And then they go into the value to spare.
And that's usually where they're at it.
You're 3:00-ish, right?
But The thing is, is like the next part of that loop is informed optimism.
Is it like okay?
14:51
I remember the things that I used that I that got me into this.
And those things are true.
But there are these other things that you also have to account for.
And then you get to the the 5th step, which is just like mastery, achievement of the goal, whatever it is.
And so most people just do step 123 over and over again.
They've uninformed optimism, informed pessimism, valley of despair switch.
15:09
Uninformed optimism, informed pessimism in for pessimism, Valley of despair switch.
And so like The thing is, is that when you're at year 3, the gains that you get from year three to year four are greater in terms of absolute return then the gains that you get from year zero to year one.
15:25
Now you'll learn more in the first year than you do in every any other year.
But the time that you get the outsize return is year 10:50 is your 14 to 15.
And that's where like when you're if you're thinking about like business value, it's way easier to take a business that's doing 20 million a year and take it to 25,000,000 a year than take company from zero to 5 million.
15:43
But in terms of absolute of like, which one of these is going to make you wealthier?
The 20 to 25, as boring as it might be, is going to make you way wealthier than going from zero to 5.
And so, like a lot of people start over when they really just need to push further, yeah.
I love that.
So yeah, you're always going to be asking if the grass is greener, so we're shit on the other side.
16:01
You always.
Want to know what does Tasty Wheat taste like?
I'll call back this from The Matrix, yeah.
I know that's good.
You don't have to explain your.
Joke.
It's a good joke.
Everything in my movie.
Was.
'Cause I was like.
You don't know if I get your the matrix.
I've been sitting on that one for 50 minutes.
There will be an opportunity for Tasty Wheat.
16:18
Well, awesome.
Well, before we wrap up, can you tell us a little bit about your new book coming out?
Yeah.
A little preview, yeah, yeah, for sure.
So the first book, $100 million offers has sold just under 500,000 copies with no advertising.
Thank you.
Pretty pumped about that, just word of mouth, which has been cool.
16:35
And that book answered the question, what do I sell?
Right?
It's like, what do I sell to anyone, right?
And that's usually when someone gets into the entrepreneur journey, that's what they're trying to figure out.
The next thing is like, OK, I know what I'm going to sell, but who do I sell it to?
You need leads, right?
And so that was the reason I put offers before I put leads, even though the I I wrote all of these like this book and that book actually at the same time.
16:54
But I was like, I have to put offers out first.
And so leads shows how to get.
I'm going to, I'm going to rewind if I said, hey, what is a lead, right.
People are like, oh, I know what a lead is.
We talk about leads all the time.
But I had a friend of mine who's not at all in business and very smart be like, what's a lead?
17:12
And I was like, you know, like, like some like a name and A and a phone number.
And he was like, so is an Instagram follower a lead?
And I was like, well, right, I I get, I mean, yeah, I guess that, that that is also a lead.
He's like, what about a YouTube subscriber?
17:28
And I was like, well, I guess that's not, that's not really a lead.
He's like, why not?
And that discussion became like the the, the, the pillar that leads was built off of, which is a lead is a person you can contact, period.
That's what it is.
But then when you realize that that's the definition of a lead, you realize you don't actually want leads.
17:45
You want engage leads.
You want someone who's shown interest in the stuff you sell, who you can also contact.
And getting someone from a lead to an engage lead, you create something to make them make take that switch.
And then from there, it's like, OK, if I know how to get people to engage, what do I do to do that?
It's like, well, you have to advertise.
And so there's there's four ways that any one person can advertise and there's four ways that you can get other people to advertise on your behalf.
18:05
So there's only eight ways that you can get other people to know about your stuff.
And so fortunately, we've actually built, we've we've done over 8 figures in sales in each of these eight types, obviously in some of them more than that.
But and so I feel really confident that I know how to build referral systems that generate real amounts of traction, know how to build affiliate systems that build real amounts of traction, know how to run paid ads, know how to make content.
18:28
I know how to do cold outbound, right.
And like I know how to run an agency to do these things on our behalf.
I know how to get employees to do these actions on our behalf.
And so these are all the different ways that you can get other people to know about your stuff.
And if you just know one of them, you can make good money.
18:43
If you know how to do a couple of them, you can pretty much just write your own check.
And that for me, bridges the gap for especially the newer entrepreneurs who are coming in or the more experienced entrepreneurs who are like, OK, I'm at a million a month, I'm going to tell me 10 million a month.
Like, what does that look like?
And so the book starts chronologically with like you have nothing.
19:01
And then the end of the book basically paints the pictures of how do I have $100 million plus lead machine and just step by step how to build it.
And so it took two years, 2000 hours of writing time.
So six hours a day for two years.
It's the first six hours of my day every day to write the book.
19:19
I'm incredibly proud of it and I do think it'll be bigger than offers.
My last question for you guys.
We've been asking everybody this today.
My social media handle is David Devine, 24.
I've been getting roasted by all these marketers that say it's boring and nobody likes it.
Your guys are professional opinions.
19:35
How terrible is it and can I just keep it?
We're wondering if he should drop the 24.
Someone suggested earlier maybe that he adds A7, so it's David Greene 24/7.
Thoughts.
You won't hurt my feelings.
Oh, no, I think it's just on brand.
Yeah, I think if if you've been writing it this long, it's funny.
19:53
Yes, that might be just be part of the brand I.
We're laughing with you, bro.
Yeah.
I don't know if you can get your handle at this point because trust me, I've tried to get mine.
They're like, yeah, for 300 grand.
Yeah, I'm like someone.
Told me hostage my URL for 20 grand and I was.
Like no, no, I have the website.
20:10
But if I switch it now, I got to go like and try to get the all the new stuff right.
And I am kind of a straight shooter.
I'm not really known for being this big marketing scheme.
So it's so you guys are saying David not a moron because I think it's.
Kind of quirky if you keep the 24, oh.
Yeah, that's a good thing.
It's kind.
Of funny, it's kind.
20:25
Of cute.
It's all right, OK, yeah, I suggested.
Thy David Greene.
That's been shot down in every room we're in.
So thy David or the I?
Don't trust the event given right now.
Well then there's also like the real David Greene.
But I said you should do the realist.
The realist or the real?
I'll just give a a funny anecdote on this.
20:42
So I I used to, I used to poo poo everything brand related and was like it's just quant, right.
It's just conversion and all that stuff.
And so our supplement company I called Prestige Labs and I did it out of jokingness, out of Prestige worldwide.
Which was?
Right.
And it was because my whole point was that like, the name doesn't matter.
20:59
Xerox is made-up.
You know what I mean?
Like we ascribe meaning to it after the fact and so.
You know I I.
Don't think it.
Matters like one bit.
Acme supplements.
Or yeah, I don't think it matters.
One bit star restaurant from Michelin Tires.
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah, awesome.
If you want to find David on the socials, David Green, 24, or possibly thy David Green, we'll see.
21:18
We'll see where we land.
With that you can find me at Raw, Built over on Threads, Instagram, YouTube, Zynga.
Myspace.
Vine.
Vine.
That's.
Oh, wow.
Nice.
I'm tired now, unfortunately.
Well, thank you guys.
21:33
Thank.
You guys for having us.
Thanks for.
Coming out, awesome interview and thanks for sharing so much for your personal lives as well.
I mean, obviously people like to hear the business stuff, but I think there are a lot of human beings that are hearing this and thinking, oh, I'm not crazy.
I don't have to do what other people are doing.
I can look for a partner that fits into my life from a practical element before we run off and try to get into a honeymoon.
21:53
And I don't have to swipe 7000 people on Tinder to find the one that hopefully ends up working out.
There's a better.
Chase that beautiful butterfly.

The process of entrepreneurship, if you think from a big picture perspective, it's always just buying back your time, right, so that you can level up the amount of time that you're spending on high leverage activities.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:18
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition dot com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy to walk you through the 1st 5 hires that you need to bring on in your company as you are growing and as a fundamental framework to think through this.
0:37
You want to think about, especially for the first five, that they are really just helping you do more and so think of them as extensions of yourself.
Over time, we're going to transition from that philosophy to really building a team in departments.
But each of the five will more or less correspond to being an extension of you and doing the repeated tasks that are time consuming but do not necessarily add as much value, some of the more strategic pieces of each of the roles.
1:00
All right.
So the first of these things in terms of the order and sequence that you're going to be hiring them in, it's going to be in the reverse order of the value that's being delivered and or what you can get in the marketplace in terms of dollars per hour.
And so the more valuable the skill, the more it will cost.
And so you want to replace the skills that cost the least amount of money for you, right?
1:18
Should make sense.
And so typically one of the first two hires and this can happen in any order, is going to be one person who's going to be more of an administrative help to you because as you start a business, especially in the beginning, there's lots of administrative work that needs to be done.
It must be done, but it's not necessarily the high value work that's going to move the business forward, but it must be done.
1:36
And so number one will typically be someone in that type of role.
The second hire will typically be somebody in the customer success or customer support role.
All right.
And you're still likely going to be heavily involved in the success or delivery of the product or service that you have.
But this person is going to help take away some of the repeated tasks that you are doing that are not necessarily value additive, but must be done.
1:58
All right.
So this is like handling returns, talking to customers about repeated tasks, you know, switching out billing stuff.
And again, you'll see that there's some crossover between this administrative role and the help with delivery because in the beginning, that's where a lot of your time is going to start occurring.
Note that you're still probably marketing.
2:14
You're still probably selling because that's what you need to do at this point in the game.
All right.
The third piece will likely be the first sales person, all right.
And that's because and again, this will depend based on how good you are at sales, right.
So like if sales is not necessarily your strong suit, then you might take this earlier, right?
2:32
If it is a strong suit of yours, you're going to take it a little bit later because your dollars per hour in that role continues to grow.
And so I don't want you to take these as hard and fast rules.
These are just general rules of thumb that the, the, the corresponding framework that you need to be thinking this through is how much value am I making per dollar start per hour and then how much would it cost me to replace that dollar per hour.
2:53
So it's like if I do not generate a lot of dollars per hour and it doesn't cost a lot of money, then that will be the first thing.
Now, if I'm generating a lot of money and I can replace it for a medium amount of money, then it's like, well, I'm, it's, it's the net difference, right.
And that's what we're looking at in terms of how we're replacing each of these roles, right.
3:09
And so right off the bat, you're going to have some sort of administrative help, then you're going to have some sort of customer support help, then you're going to probably hire some sort of sales role right from there.
Now kind of depends a little bit on the role.
You'll probably have someone who starts assisting you with the promotion or marketing of your business.
3:25
So this is often times somebody who's doing setting or doing prospecting for you or if you generate customers by self content, this is probably somebody who's being a videographer of some sort or or helping you create the content in some way.
Some of the the more laborious parts that are not as value additive that would be kind of that fourth looking higher.
3:43
And again that can flip with the sales role.
So like if for example, you're a killer salesman, then you might have somebody who's prospecting and doing some of the intro calls for you so that the majority of your time is spent just closing, which is the higher value task.
So hopefully this common theme is working out and making sense to you 'cause it's like the number one question I get or one of among the top questions I get is like what order should I hire people in when I'm starting my business, right.
4:05
The next one is.
And again, all of these rules can be, some of these things can be fractional right in the beginning.
So you'll probably have some sort of fractional bookkeeper which is really filling the gap for the finance hall.
So they're just doing basic level of accounting for you to get, so you just know how much money you're making at that time.
They can help you take control of your expenses etcetera.
4:22
Over time that rule will probably come in house, but much a little bit later, right.
So like before you had $100,000 a month you really, you probably don't have a ton that's going on.
So just having a fraction bookkeeper is sufficient.
Same thing with a, you know somebody who's helping you with your taxes, somebody who's helping you with legal stuff like you'll have a lawyer but it's not going to be in house, right.
4:42
And so as you're moving up this value ladder in terms of the the value per hour and the cost per hour that you can get this, the process of entrepreneurship.
If you think from a big picture perspective, it's always just buying back your time, right, so that you can level up the amount of time that you're spending on high leverage activities.
4:59
Now here's a key point.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
5:15
You can check on my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into, and if not, keep enjoying the show.
I see this happen all the time.
I'll see how entrepreneurs replace all of their time and then they don't do anything with that added time to add more value.
And so in that case, your profit margins will go down because you are not continuing to add and do the things that generate the income right now.
5:38
As you progress, each of these roles become more solidified and these people, ideally in a perfect world, actually can ascend up and then have teams underneath of them.
The person who was helping you originally now has a team of people helping them.
The administrative person originally you might have to ascend them into a Director of Operations who's who's really pushing each of the tasks and projects forth.
5:59
They end up being a mini project manager for you.
If done properly, right, the salesperson might become a sales director or a sales manager who's actually leading in training a series of of sales people.
Now, I will tell you that a lot of times people have the difficulty of going from an individual contributor at a high level to a manager.
6:16
It's one of the hardest transitions in business and it's commonly messed up by most people.
All right.
And so one of the things that comes with experience in entrepreneurship is you recognize the people who have the talent to do the thing that is required later.
So you can hire those people earlier on.
Now you can't take, you know, a CEO, all of a billion dollar company and put them in as your operator.
6:34
One, because they probably, you can probably afford it.
And two, they're probably not that interested in the opportunity yet unless you have funding or some sort of vehicle that you can acquire that talent earlier.
And so as a final concept that I want to introduce to you is that whenever you are starting a business, you are incurring debt, all right.
6:52
And this is something that I'm now very, very convinced of.
And so you are incurring lots of types of debt.
You are incurring life debt.
You are incurring management debt.
You are incurring financial debt.
You're encouraging technological debt, right.
So that a technological debt, which by the way is probably the the the if you had another next full time hire, it's usually a tech person who's helping you manage the CRM, build out sites and kind of make all the things that you want to have happen or know should be happening in the background actually happen in the real world.
7:18
They're helping manage passwords onboard new new people in terms of getting them logins, all that kind of jazz, right.
And so in terms of the debt that you're incurring, if you don't have a good CRM that's in place, you will incur that debt and then you'll have to pay it back with interest later when the company's bigger.
If you don't have a good bookkeeper in place, you'll have your finances will be a mess.
7:36
And as you scale, you'll have to fix and pay back that debt later.
If you have not the best people or the values are not there, then you're encouraging management debt, which means you'll have cultural debt, which means you'll have to pay that back later.
And so the idea in terms of moving quickly in the game of entrepreneurship is recognizing which debt I want to incur in what order.
7:55
And so I used to poo poo.
The idea of investors and and and venture capital and things like that, who gave people money to start because I was like that's not real entrepreneurship.
And I think as I've, you know, weathered or aged in the game, I don't see it that way anymore.
I just see it as just fundamentally an advantage is that they're choosing financial debt to incur fewer other debts, incur fewer operational debt, incur less talent, debt management, debt, CRM debt.
8:21
Like you might have to have a bigger CRM that's better for you so that you can scale and have it having to switch platforms, which is common, but it would cost more money upfront.
And so if you're bootstrapped, you might not be willing or able to do that.
But if you have funding or you have money that you're willing to invest in the business upfront, then sometimes you can do that.
8:36
And so one of the things that is difficult with people who grow bigger companies faster is that they skip through the earlier stages because they know how to do it.
And so it's the reason that each of the companies that we've had subsequently have grown bigger, faster, stronger in the companies that preceded them because we are willing to incur less of the other types of debt rather than financial debt because we have the finances right.
8:58
And so we can skip steps in the growth process that would normally off rail 1/4's worth of growth by implementing a new CRM or offload 1/4.
You know or set me back another quarter because I have to fix my financials or set me back another you know year because I have a whole bunch of management team in place for inexperienced and I need to get more been there done that's on the team and fewer I'll learn as I go, right.
9:19
And so as we're thinking through this and you're hiring your team, the two major frameworks that I'd like you to take away with this is number one, you're hiring in reverse order of value that you are providing and cost to the marketplace that you can use to replace it.
And so typically you will one get customer support 2 some sort of administrative role 3.
9:38
Some sort of sales or set of role 4.
Some sort of marketing assist 5, some sort of fractional bookkeeper and and or 1/6 which would be your IT person or tech person that is usually the beginning of the core team.
And then a Christmas trees downs, you'll have five people hanging off of each of these, not necessarily 5 IT people but hopefully you can understand especially on the the marketing, the sales and on the delivery.
9:59
Those are the teams that tend to grow as the companies grow and the you know IT and and finance departments and HR departments which end up getting built over time.
There's a ratio that is a higher ratio, as in you need fewer of them per amount of customers or employees that you have in the company, right?
10:16
And so as you scale, that is framework #1.
And then framework #2 is be mindful of the type of debt that you are incurring and make sure it is the type of debt that you would prefer to incur if you have the choice.

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.

On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
So not unhappy Monday.
0:31
I am still very much on our Barcelona vacation.
I will tell you the story of that at another time but I got a couple messages and people like hey give me a video and some people didn't know that we were on vacation so people didn't.
But while I was on our Vedic mini vacation while we were away, I wrote down some things that I wanted to like some some content ideas that kind of came to me while we were gone and one of them came from Um, parking spaces, which sounds kind of silly but I'll I'll dive in.
1:03
So, What what your parking space tells you about, how good of a business owner, you are and the culture of your team and it's a really simple litmus test for seeing how you feel about your customers and how well your team is received how you feel about your customers and it's a pretty simple test.
1:22
So it works like this.
If right now, when you go to your gym you take the front parking space because when you get there it's usually dark and you can get whatever space you want and you take the closest one to the front door and then your Rainer is take the next two parking spaces.
It shows that you're not thinking about what your customers are going to have to do later.
1:41
And so, and especially in a place that I mean, I know a lot of you guys have parking issues because most micro Jim do have parking issues and have issues with the city that they constantly have to fight on.
So the thing is that if you and I mind you, I say this because I did it like I did this like everything that I'm telling you where I'm like, man, don't do that.
1:59
It's because I did it for a long time and it was because at the time I didn't really care that much about Mike.
There's I was really just like one in prove that I was like the boss and I parked over I wanted because I was the boss and it's my gym and whatever, right?
But it was a story that I was telling myself and it was stupid because it was losing me money and it also was setting.
2:16
The wrong example for my team.
If I didn't park there and I parked in the farthest place possible and said, hey all of the best basis should be reserved for our customers.
It sets a tone of how you want to have customer service and how your team is going to respond to the people who are coming in the door.
If like the first thing they do, when they get to your business is think about where their parking think about how they're purposely putting the customer first.
2:39
Even before they get into the door, it Prime's them for being exceptional, customer customer service from the time.
They closed the door to the time, they get back to their car and they remember the fact that they serve others first and so I would implore you that if you right now don't have.
2:55
So if right now you take that first base or maybe you don't but your trainers do then have the conversation.
I'm having with you right now which is like why like what are we in business to do, we're here to serve Well, do you think that other people deserve to have like, do you think people who are in a rush who are on their way to work, should have to hunt for a parking space or travel more to get to our store?
3:15
Of course?
Not, right.
This is actually something that's really common in retail and some people don't know this.
But like, in retail like you always Park like across the street or as far away as possible because they understand that the speed of the transaction is so important and because people will literally turn around if they see that, the parking is an issue that's in retail.
3:32
Now, with Jim's, it's a little bit different but The thing is that it starts creating these tiny micro traumas like Disney says, for every every tragic moment you need 39, magic moments and one or two or three mornings where they're struggling to find a parking space.
To get into your gym, is a mini tragic moment.
3:49
And so you want to not want to minimize those things.
Especially the things that you have control over like a freaking parking space.
And so if you and the two or three train, you know, the three parking spaces that are going to be taking of the seven.
That was given to you by the landlord because you're in a warehouse, don't use Supporting yourself.
4:06
Go find places that are really hard to find.
Give yourself some, get your steps up.
Wake up 5 minutes early and give those spots to your clients so that as you walk into the gym, you're primed to think about how you're going to serve your customers.
And then your trainers are going to be primed and then it begins with that.
4:21
It's the Small Things, the pastor, who picks up the Pebbles on the sidewalk that sets the tone for the rest of the organization and then everyone starts picking up.
So it's like the Broken Window Theory with with crime is like, if you can fix the broken windows and people stop doing In crime, if you if you if you start with where you park, then the next things of like, hey how are we going to treat the bathrooms?
4:41
How we're going to say hello to people are going to greet them within 10 seconds?
Like all the things, the fundamentals of like are going to smile.
That actually takes to have a business are going to be things that will fall into place.
So anyways guys, I hope you guys are having an amazing week.
I would take a look at that in terms of how your trainers are, where their parking, and then ask them why.
5:00
And then maybe even hopefully own up to it, if you're not doing That right now because I can tell you think about it for yourself that you just try to get more steps in and that's how I always would how I use do that now.
But yeah, guys, I miss you and I have a whole bunch of like, little notes that I'm going to be dropping.
5:18
That one is like, kind of a tactical one from a cultural standpoint and I think that it will be useful for you.
So I'll select dudes.
Freddy druvan 8ml, everyone, lots of love and yeah, sheet of like for all the homies.
All right.
Oh,

Every level of entrepreneurship is a new way of learning how to give up control because you cannot want both freedom and control.
Think about it, if you control everything, then it means everything requires you, which means you are not free.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
0:16
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I want to talk to you about why the rich get richer and the real reason behind it is probably not what you think.
0:38
And this was requested by my my Instagram following.
I didn't ask me anything and my my YouTube producer was like, hey man, I think one of the biggest things that's shifted since I've been working with you is just like your concepts on Time horizon.
And So what I wanted to do is kind of share some of the thoughts and frameworks that have worked well for me and apply them in three or four different kind of scenarios.
1:00
And so right off the bat, I think from a money perspective, the idea that you might have heard of is rich people sell, wealthy people hold, and more specifically, wealthy people buy and build.
And the difference is that when you sell, you inherently shrink or you're kind of switching through an inefficient vehicle because you get taxed on a sale, right?
1:18
And so you have to switch your equity for another version of something, right, that you can make money on, whereas when you buy and build, you can consistently expand.
And so most of the people who I know who are wealthier just continue to accumulate net worth equity, etcetera, rather than selling.
1:34
Now, like I said, I mean, the only time that you really want to sell is if you think the party is over or you no longer have interest in the thing.
And that's kind of a separate thing.
But purely from a financial perspective, it makes more sense to consistently buy and build.
And so I wanted to hit a couple of quick quotes before I dive in that have been meaningful for me in terms of framing this perspective, First off is in terms of games.
1:56
So I prefer to play games where if I wait, I win.
And so I think it's a useful perspective in thinking about what things we pursue and how we pursue them.
And so there are two types of games.
They're infinite and finite games.
And the games that are worth playing in life, in my opinion, like health, wealth, relationships, marriage, etcetera, are all infinite games.
2:15
And so this is the basic difference.
And where people get in trouble is when they start playing infinite games with a finite perspective.
And so finite games are games where you have known players agreed upon rules and outcomes, where you have a clear winner and loser, right?
And so the point of the game, and this is important of a finite game, is to win.
2:31
And so if you have a baseball team, you have nine players on both sides.
There's rules that are agreed upon and if at the end of the game, the person with the most runs wins, right?
And so that is a finite game.
An infinite game is a game where you have known and unknown players, no agreed upon rules.
2:48
And the point of the game is to keep the game going, all right, which means that the point is to continue to play.
And so I think when a lot of people lose, and this also applies to warfare, right?
So a classic example Sonic's Simonsonette gave was how when the US went to Vietnam, we were playing a finite game where we were trying to win the war, whereas the Vietnamese were simply trying to survive and continue to play.
3:10
And the infinite perspective will always beat out a finite perspective because it's a subset.
And so in general, and this is 1/3 quote is he who has the longest time horizon wins.
And so the nice thing is that we can adopt this perspective in business and essentially I don't want to say guarantee victory, but guarantee not losing, which in many cases by default becomes a win.
3:34
And so I think that for myself adopting this perspective, I don't think I'm going to sell another company.
Again, like in terms of big picture, I didn't start some of my earlier companies with the same perspectives I have now.
And I think that that's part of like levelling up in the game.
And so my hope is that I can share some of those perspectives with you so that you don't necessarily have to make the same mistakes.
3:54
And so the first kind of place I want to apply this concept of the infinite versus the finite is the strategy of business.
And so I wrote down a couple points here that have been conclusions that I've made that I think will be meaningful for you.
So the first is that the point of marketing, if you have a more infinite perspective is to get people to buy so that we can figure out how to make the product amazing, right.
4:17
If people aren't buying again and again or telling friends about us or our products, then we will literally have to market our way through brute force and expand again through brute force of selling, selling, selling.
But the moment we stop that process, our business will tank.
And so if we have a infinite perspective of like the point of the game is to keep the game going, then we are willing to trade off the short term growth for ego and status in order to learn how to improve the products and services that we have such that we get them to a point from a little bit of marketing and selling so that we can make a sale to get a customer rather than get making a customer to get a sale.
4:54
All right.
I'll say that again, the point in the beginning especially is to make a sale to get a customer, which is a long term relationship with somebody who buys again and again rather than getting a customer to make a sale, which would happen like one time, right?
And so it's a flip in perspective in terms of how we approach the game of business overall.
5:13
And if we have an infinite perspective of like we're going to keep playing this game over and over again, then we no longer have this rush.
And one of my other favorite sayings is mistakes, make a rush, mistakes love a rush decision and people make tons of mistakes in business purely because they arbitrarily cut their time rising.
5:29
I have to hit this monthly goal.
I have to hit this weekly goal.
I have to hit this quarterly goal rather than.
And if I just did this one thing right over the next year or two, then it would make it virtually impossible for me to fail or that this business would not grow.
Because businesses in general continue to grow in both income and value over time, with the exception of the times where they don't, in which case they usually drop to 0 or close to it.
5:51
And so it's better to take the time to get it right and not be in a rush and then have all the wind behind you because you've taken that time.
And here's the beautiful thing is that most people will never do this, which gives you this massive strategic advantage because most people think in finite terms.
And so I'll give you a different example from a, a marketing perspective.
6:11
So when you're selling a customer, right, the short term finite thing is like I need to get them to say yes because I need this money, right versus what am I saying yes to by selling them right.
It's just a different way to frame the conversation in terms of like, is this really what I want?
6:26
And then from an audience perspective, in the short term, you see lots of guys build tiny little bits of audience and then immediately try and liquidate or monetize their audience rather than thinking like what will happen if I just continue to provide goodwill for 10 years.
And one of the perspectives that I've learned about goodwill is that one goodwill compounds faster than revenue or money because you fundamentally fix the value equation in your favour because your price is 0.
6:51
And so everything that you deliver from a value perspective is above and beyond that.
Now I would say there's no monetary price, but the price of content or consumption of content is time and attention.
And so provided you are a better source of value for their time and attention, they will continue to buy with their time and attention from you again and again.
7:11
And that will actually compound faster.
People recommend your stuff, people will tell other people about you, and then your influence will grow faster.
Now, if they feel like you're withdrawing from that goodwill bucket where you're depositing value too quickly, then their return goes down on their time and they'll be less likely to spend.
7:27
You become less viral from an audience building perspective.
And so one of the the pieces that I like about this perspective is that it means that you give, give, give comma, give, give, give comma, get.
And so it's a little bit different from what the way I kind of earlier understood it, which was like always having a cadence between giving and asking, which I think is a transactional way of seeing it, which is not necessarily bad.
7:49
But in terms of a longer term perspective, I think you shortchange yourself because if you can assume, let's say that when you give, give, give, ask, you get let's say 10% of the people from your audience to buy something, that's cool.
But then the growth kind of slows down, right, And you have to rebuild it again and then ask again, right, because you have withdrawn from your goodwill bucket.
8:11
But imagine this, let's say that you're every time you give, you grow by whatever, 10%, right, give, give, give and ask versus give, give, give.
And now you're getting 10% on this bigger nut, give, give, give.
And let's say 1% of people just give you back.
8:28
You just get.
You don't even have to ask.
You just get in response and like, imagine what it looks like to be the rock or what it looks like to be Conor McGregor or what it looks like to have massive amounts of influence.
At a certain point.
There's so much influence and there's so much of an audience that is behind you that things just start getting thrown at you and you don't need to ask at all.
8:48
And so at least this has been our perspective that I've shifted in terms of like how to think about marketing overall.
It's also by the way why I think most of the biggest brands out there grand rather than doing direct response.
And I think that that's a shift that happens with a lot of direct response marketers over time is we think short in the beginning everything's direct response and then over time we continue to extend our time horizon between giving and getting.
9:11
And the longer we can separate how long we give before we get, the bigger the advantage comes to us compared to our competition, All right.
And so that's just a couple of perspectives that I think about from a business perspective.
And strategy is like, I want to set a strategy where if I wait, I win.
9:27
And what happens is if you can extend your time rise and you can decrease your downside risk to virtually 0 because you know that if you do this thing long enough, you will eventually win.
And so those are games that like you can never lose money from an investment perspective in terms of shifting simply how you see your time.
9:44
Which is also why Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger say, you know, if you just thought I was only going to buy 20 companies for the rest of my life, you would think about it differently.
And that's fundamentally the the big, the big shift that happens, I think between the rich and the wealthy.
And So what I want to do is apply the same concept towards employees now.
10:00
So in the beginning, you know, you think about I just need to have or put a butt in a seat, right.
I have this fire, I need to put it out versus thinking a little bit longer time horizon, which is man, this is going to take a lot of time to train this person.
I'm going to have to on board them and if I think that they're not going to be a long term fit, then they might leave.
10:18
Now.
I don't want to take this out of context.
There are times in a business's growth where you're going to have people who are better suited for that season.
That's not necessarily what I'm saying.
It's much more so along the values that this person is going to bring and live through in the company.
10:33
Is that going to reinforce our culture or is it going to detract from it?
Hey, MOS Edition quick break.
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, So send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with.
10:50
Tag them in one of my or Layla's posts and I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And so this is kind of the long term perspective is I'm willing to wait a longer period of time in discomfort in order to interview 25 people rather than five to get the right person.
11:09
And this is one of the frames that's helped me with, with hiring talent, which is I have to have this person and if I don't feel like I have that that feeling with someone, I don't hire them anymore.
I used to say like I think this person's good enough, like I think they can maybe do the job.
11:25
Whereas now it's like I've recognized that I'm like if I don't know, I know.
And that's been very, very fruitful for me in terms of finding talent and and and levelling up the people within the business.
And so this is a different one that I will share with you that has been just unbelievably valuable, which is most business owners especially in that 3 to $5,000,000 range.
11:47
And if you're below that, this will probably apply to you is that the business that you have or all businesses in general are a subset of the amount of cumulated knowledge in the entire employee base and you being an owner or operator, you're still an employee of the business, right.
And so that means that everything that is done in the business is a subset of one brain.
12:08
If you know how to do everyone elses job better than them or you trained every person in the positions that you have and if you're like shoot, that's me, that's OK.
There's a transition that ends up happening, which is what I'm sharing with you.
All right, So because you taught everyone and you know how to do everyone's job better, it actually still means that only one brain is responsible for all this growth.
12:25
And at some point, depending on the size of the brain and the skill of the brain, you're going to get capped, right?
And this isn't an ego thing.
It's more like you will eventually get capped.
Remember long term time rise it.
And so if I know that, then I know that the only way to truly scale the business is to have more brains contributing to the overall potential of the business, right?
12:43
And so that means that I truly have to bring in people who are A smarter than me and B better than me at certain things.
Like, if you can actually do everyone's job better than them, you should be frightened, right?
And on some level people are like, well, if I don't know how to do the job, then it means that I am exposed.
13:01
And the answer is yes, you are.
But every level of entrepreneurship is a new way of learning how to give up control, because you cannot have you cannot want both freedom and control.
Think about it.
If you control everything, then it means everything requires you, which means you are not free.
13:18
Interesting, right?
And so if you want to have a business that quote runs without you, then it means it does not need you, which means that it needs other people, which means that you have relinquished control to those people.
So just a different thought in terms of like how to frame employees and why it's so important to be more patient in the interviewing process.
13:35
Think longer in terms of this is, do I want to continue to deal with this person for the next decade rather than the next day, right.
And the business will always grow to the cumulate knowledge of everyone else in the business.
And if it's just you who knows how to do everything, then it's only limited by one brain, right.
13:51
And so the final shift I want to make here in in this little conversation is actually there's two more, one is relationships and this and the last one I'll do is health.
But I I want to talk about relationships briefly.
So if we're thinking about mates, right, like the actual people that we want to date, I think that what served me well during the the dating period that I had and I see a lot of guys and girls make the mistake of settling with someone as good enough for now.
14:18
And the analogy that I like to bring this to is like, you move into a new house and you're like, oh, I got to get furniture.
You know what?
Let's just go grab a, you know, a $50 couch off Craigslist.
We'll put it in, we'll put it in, and we'll get a nice one later.
And then five years later, you still have the same damn couch, right.
And so a lot of times there are these couches, which are people in our lives.
14:36
We're like, they're good enough for now.
And then you realize you built your life with this person that you don't even you never even thought was that good to begin with.
And you simply rationalize their existence as like they're there for now when they end up being there for a very long time, because it's much more difficult to remove something than it is to add it.
So we need to be usually much slower on the adding and much faster on the removal, which is the concept of, you know, higher fast, sorry, higher, higher, slow fire fast, right.
15:00
And so from a dating perspective, am I dating this person's out of convenience because I am unwilling to be lonely in the short term or because I think I'm going to marry them?
And I will tell you that it was very useful for me is that when I was in my dating, you know, phase of life, I went on a lot of first dates and I just was very quickly like, am I going to marry this person?
15:19
Do I think I could marry this person?
And I would really only go on as many dates as was necessary to rule out the person as no, I don't think I would marry them.
Which also gives kind of birth to some of the ideas around like sleeping around and things like that, which is like, well, you know, if I don't think I'm going to marry this person, then what am I gaining from this and is it fruitful for me in the long term?
15:39
And so a lot of times we're making the same trades between four things.
And so I like this little illustration.
I made it a tweet that got a lot of shares.
And so fear is short term pain, Regret is long term pain, Comfort is short term gain, Fulfilment is long term gain.
16:00
And so the idea is we want to trade fear for fulfilment, we want to trade the short term pain for the long term gain rather than trading to get comfort right.
And so as I think through that perspective and I think it applies to business, it applies to relationships, it applies to a lot of things.
And I think if you can make that simple shift in terms of the relationships you have, both friends and mates, it will serve you in the long run.
16:22
Like how many friends do you have in your life that are like there?
They don't really add anything.
And what scares me is that if I extrapolate that relationship over the next 10 years, I ask myself, who am I going to be with this constant influence in my life?
Will I be better or worse?
And so a lot of times I think in order to prune the tree, sorry, in order for the tree to grow, we have to prune it, which means we have to cut off the branches.
16:42
And I think the the longer I play the game, the less tolerant I become of things that detract and are not really aligned with the long term and the more willing I am to suffer in the short term for the long term game.
And so the last thing that I want to quickly hit on is is health, because obviously I was in the space for a long time and I get a lot of questions about it.
17:04
And so I I think my perspective has shifted a lot over time around this, cause I've done it for almost 20 years now.
If you can't eat this way for a decade, there's no point in doing it for a day.
And so if you can just approach diets and workout with that same perspective, like you will get the greatest returns from compounding inconsistency over time.
17:25
And so it's much more like, what is the 5% that I can do every day that will, that I can do forever?
And simply sticking to that, if you have to cut out dessert, for example, or if you don't like drinking, whatever, I don't necessarily condone that.
But I'm just saying like if you're like, I love this, then cool.
17:41
Like if you have to cut the things out that make that make you enjoy life, then it's by definition not a sustainable strategy for you.
And so there's no point in even starting it because you will set yourself up to fail, right.
And so an interesting perspective on this that you know has developed over time for me is that like if you work out, you know, 90 minutes, five days a week, you will end up giving up like 1520% of your actual living hours in terms of like waking hours or productive hours.
18:12
Probably a little less than that actually.
But you get the idea, right?
If you're awake 16 hours a day, then that would be whatever.
So whatever the 10% of your life, right?
Am I going to get a a life extension of that same amount?
Not necessarily from that amount of time.
18:28
You might even just break even on it.
And so if you're doing it for life extension, meh, there are better ways to do it, which would be walking 10,000 steps, taking a baby aspirin and not smoking.
Like if you do those three things, you'll get all of the benefits of life extension.
But it's just a question of like why am I doing this to begin with?
18:44
Is it because I want to look a certain way, Which is fine and totally OK, but simply having the perspective of I'm doing this because I can do this forever.
And I think that it will allow you to cut out a lot of these short term BS because like think about this.
And I used to use this in selling conversations when I was selling weight loss back in the day, which was if you look back on your life and you were in shape for six months, three times in your entire life, who cares, right?
19:11
And so the goal is to have a strategy that will allow you to continue to do it for good.
And if the strategy in the short term is something that you can barely sustain, then there's really no point in doing it in the long term.
And I will also share something with you, which is like the people who look the best, if that is your goal, like doing it.
19:30
And if you don't like doing it, it's far better to just find something you do enjoy doing, even if it's not ideal for body composition.
So it's like, if you just like doing cardio, cool.
It's not ideal for body composition, but if you like doing it, it's better than doing nothing, right?
And that goes for, you know, if you like climbing better than weightlifting, cool.
19:47
You know what I mean?
Like, keep doing that.
Can you do it forever?
Probably not.
But like, you can do it for a very, very long season.
And so I think if if you just reframe the perspective on all of these things back to the original statements I had, which is like, if I can't do it for a decade, there's really not a point of doing it for a day.
If I don't think I would see my this person in my life in a decade, there's really not a point to seeing them for a day.
20:07
And if I'm thinking about this from a business strategy perspective, will I, if I do these actions, will it increase or expand me in a decade or will it?
Cut me down.
And so I think that if you can approach those things and that was the reason that the YouTube producer brought this up, he's like, dude, the first thing you said was, all right, well, let's see if we can, you know, grow this thing over the next 5 or 10 years.
20:30
And he's like, literally no one has ever said that.
And I find that interesting and silly because, like, it takes a long time to get good at something.
And so why would I put such a short, arbitrary timeline of what I have to grow in 90 days or I'm out?
It's just not realistic.
And I'm I'd rather play games where if I wait, I win.








0:00
There's a lot of things that can go wrong in launching something like this.
You have half a million people, so you can look in a skyscraper, look all the way around Baltimore, and be like more than everyone I can see with my eyes is registered for this event.
I've been prepping for the presentation for two weeks, all day, every day.
0:20
I will not be the person who did not prepare and I will do that work out of respect for everyone else's attention.
Offers was a meta example, meaning the book and the course and everything.
It was was purposely intended to be an offer so good people would feel stupid saying no.
The book itself was an example of the concept of the book.
0:35
So $100 leads is different in that I want the example for the book not to be around the offer, but around how we promote the book about how we got leads.
Which is why in this event was so important to use all the different advertising methods to promote the book.
Like I could have just made a post to my audience about the book and sold plenty of copies and not needed to do warm outreach or do affiliates or do pay dads.
0:56
What's the point of this meeting?
What problem are we solving?
The most expensive cost in almost all companies is meetings.
That was supposed to be an hour long meeting and we got off in 28 minutes.
What problem are we solving?
The 2nd is who's required to solve it?
If we know what the decision is, then it's like I'm not needed.
So yeah, it'll be on Shopify.
Reason we did it on Shopify was because there's a bunch of issues with Amazon launching, but the main one was that they wouldn't accept the amount of books that we thought we would sell.
1:18
Amazon limits any new book, usually to 5000 or 10,000 hardbacks, and we had a pretty strong suspicion that we were going to sell a lot more than that.
So for that reason, we basically fronted all the money, did all the prints because we're self published.
So we're housing it, we're shipping it, we're housing it.
I don't like anyone owning my stuff.
1:34
And so whenever you publish a book, you actually sell the rights to your content, kind of like musicians where they sell their music to a label.
Same concept for me to like give you guys like a free chapter for the fact that offers was $1.99 cents.
Those are all things that a normal publisher wouldn't want me to do because that's where they would make their money.
I want every person there to watch this presentation and be like I need to fucking work harder.
1:53
Like if that's like the deepest take away on this whole thing, then like I can die pretty happy.
I mean, most people spend their entire lives not being able to like, influence 500,000 people.
And so like, it's not lost on me straight.
To the cookies.
Huh.
My birthday.
2:09
Fuck it.
Yeah.
Good morning.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Trevor is probably the closest thing to her brother to me.
Honestly, we Co wrote the books I I get a disproportionate amount of credit, but Trevor has definitely been the one that has helped me beat up every single idea.
He's been integrally involved in my life for a long time now and I hope we can grow old and crotchy together.
2:28
Welcome everyone to my book launch event.
I'm so pumped to have you guys here.
I promise.
I have spent a very long time time to compress kind of like a stand up routine.
A stand up routine that's 60 minutes has taken nine months to perfect.
Like each 32nd bit that strung together created an hour.
2:45
And so it's kind of the same way with this presentation is that like it's gazillions of hours compressed into that and that's why hopefully the value per second will just be like incredibly high.
My first presentations, it was just like a few words and then I would talk at the slide over time and then I started adding more like bullets and texts to slide and then I watched this presentation actually changed my life.
3:04
It's a 15 minute Ted talk.
It was called Death by PowerPoint.
It actually, like, forever, changed how I made presentations, which is like one idea per slide.
But then I got from the marketing and sales world to pair the idea with a visual.
Yeah, I just want it to work.
That's all I want for my birthday.
3:19
Is that all the tech works?
That's it.
I just want the links to work.
I want the page to work.
I want the processing to work.
There's a huge amount of like Aussies and New Zealanders who are staying up as like entrepreneur parties.
3:35
So cool.
Yeah I know.
So I've got a bunch of guys who have like you know, 1002 thousand person communities that are pumping each other up for the event.
See what we got going on pre set up for tomorrow.
Check this out.
3:51
This is the 360.
Wow.
When I drop the offer people will probably lose their minds.
I'll have stacked it for like 17 minutes.
I just want to show the reaction.
So the stack is a direct sales tactic that has been proven so many times across so many industries that it is effective.
4:10
The goal for this presentation was to be remembered.
And so if I wanted someone to have an emotional experience going through this, then I have to subvert the audience.
In a way.
I think that the stack accomplished that.
Basically making a movie.
Yeah, basically Zack Snyder.
4:27
All right, well rock'n'roll.
What are the things that can go wrong right now?
Let me go wrong is what we can't control.
Okay.
Yeah.
Just like zoom in general.
Correct tomorrow.
4:45
Is a big day.
Yeah, tomorrow's a big day.
Today is my birthday.
Honestly, I'm just excited for you guys to tear into it.
It's not even the event.
I'm excited for the post that happened one day 2 day, three days, four days later.
After people have consumed, you know, read the book cover to cover and read it a second time and started going through the course and listening to the audiobook.
5:01
That's what I'm more excited about.
But tomorrow is the first step to that and I'll see you then.
How many check in?
We have people over 100,000 in check in and currently on the feed Six 6049.
I'm ready.
5:19
Nigeria, Bulgaria, Philly, Pakistan.
Super cool.
They're coming in international, baby around the world.
Just melts and melts.
Just puddles.
We want to zero, so the nose strip said be one of zero.
5:39
For the last however many months, our team has used one of one content as kind of our concept, which is the only way to say things that only you can say and show things only you can show.
Then, as the team started to find out all the things that we're going to be releasing and giving away and doing what no one else would do, the team said in the chat, like, dude, this isn't even one of one, this is one of zero.
5:58
What are you doing that no one would do?
And I think that raises the bar a lot more.
I'm scared by that bar, but I I like that bar as an ideal to strive to work.
We're at 10 minutes.
You ready?
Going to be a ride?
Twists and turns on this roller coaster.
6:15
Layla's so worried.
She's like, wait, you changed something?
And I was like, Oh yeah, yeah, I'm excited to see the reactions because there's going to be 15 minutes of of suspense where they're like, is he going to sell something right now?
The good news is I have done this before.
A lot of times.
A lot of times I know how much work I put into it.
6:33
When you're in front of the crowd, the only person's confidence who matters is yours.
There are men of talent and men of preparation.
I prefer to be the latter.
So little did I know that as soon as I stepped on stage like 3 massive tech issues break behind the scenes based on the sheer volume of clicks that were going at the same time to the same page.
6:52
Let's get some leads.
Is everything running smooth and?
No one was moved by.
I think a lot of people have any issues with a low price.
It's relative when the links aren't working.
We had 562,000 link clicks in a matter of like 60 seconds.
7:11
Whenever you have something like that, it's going to put stress on systems that it's very hard to test for.
You can run simulators, which we had and we still had more people than the infrastructure could handle.
I'd send them to YouTube.
So 140,000 people or so were not able to get in.
The team pivoted on the fly and provided the YouTube link, and we had another 40 or 50,000 people who made it over on that side.
7:31
People can talk on their mics in the zoom room.
Yeah, that's what I've been telling you.
The second thing was that there were some zoom rooms, that the master zoom thing wasn't set up the right way so that they they could like unmute themselves rather than like webinar presenter format.
Now we ended up quickly fixing that.
The YouTube live stream ended up being 3 minutes delayed and those were very 3 important minutes during the the entire launch event.
7:55
And so we were able to save 40,000 ish people on YouTube.
But during that first five or so minutes, there was a lot of hustle and bustle trying to figure out what we're going to do to house literally a city of people.
So you're.
Going to get lead mag and mastery, you're going to get the first five client framework.
You'll get the most immediate content method to build a brand you want.
You can get the cold outreach playbook.
8:11
You're going to get the pay dad's playbook.
You're going to have the referral playbook and you're going to get the affiliate playbook and the 0 to $100 million scaling road map from someone who's actually been there.
Build a value 1276.
I could see the comments the whole time and I say this with absolute confidence.
I will bet that you cannot see that.
8:26
I can see the comments in how I was presenting.
How much is double your lead flow worth?
An extra 10,000 a year An extra 50,000 a year?
An extra 100,000 a year?
Extra $1,000,000 a year.
I knew that everyone would turn on me for a brief moment.
All I could think is like this is going exactly how I want it.
8:44
I'm not going to ask for 12,076, even though it'd be totally reasonable and a bargain.
I'm not going to ask for $4997.00.
I'm not even going to ask for $2997.00.
I'm going to give you access to everything we talked about today for a single payment of taking the extra 4 seconds, 5 seconds when the world is watching, I wanted to sit in it and just hold and just like kind of enjoy the moment.
9:12
A single payment of I know what they don't know, and I believe that that's how some of the best sales presentations are supposed to be.
I went from villain to hero in 10 seconds.
It's free.
Love you guys.
9:38
We're already almost halfway out of home.
OK, good.
Oh, thank you.
Thanks sweetie.
Thanks.
You did play with that.
Thanks brother.
Appreciate it there.
There was some dark days in the middle of the the stack.
There, you got to touch the bottom of the pool.
9:54
That's what makes it memorable.
Despite all the heat that I was getting, I knew the rubber band was going to snap back the moment they saw the truth.
They just had to wait.
Roller coaster ride you don't even know you have?
No.
Idea like I was so nauseous.
I was.
I think I am going to throw up.
10:11
I think that more people, they trust us now to continue to keep our promises in a world that breaks them.
And more people believe us when we say we are a long term focused because we didn't take the $50 million payday, right.
There was one comment was actually my favorite comment on all the ones that I that I saw.
10:28
You could have made bank, but you chose to make history and I thought that was like that was the fucking point.
Like in a statement that was the point.
Good job.
That was just only two years of our lives.
Just about 100,000 books sold the first day, so Offers that sold just under 500,000 copies over 2 years to sell 100,000 in a day was pretty cool to sell 20% of offers that sold big shoes to fill.
10:52
But I actually think that leads will sell more copies than offers does, and I think that's because more people perceive they have the problem of not having leads than not having an offer.
The aftermath.
We're not even done the first week as I'm recording this, but my name was trending on all of Twitter.
The Leads audiobook is 7 on all of Amazon.
11:08
We went from 50 to 26 on all podcasts.
We're number one in entrepreneurship.
We're #2 in business.
Like, I'm actually, like, emotional about it.
Something that has never been done before.
I actually truly believe that what he just did with this launch is going to just have shock waves.
11:29
Do you agree with people that are saying?
That you changed the industry.
If we're defining change the industry, as many people were act differently in terms of how they do business afterwards, then I would say yes, not everyone, but certainly some people will.
The people who have longer time horizons who want to build bigger, more lasting businesses.
11:46
For sure a brand is based on the associations that people make.
I knew that having a massive historic event and having the thing still be more valuable than everyone else's and free was something that I wanted to associate myself with.
But if you measure on a one year time horizon and it will never make sense, this is cool.
12:06
This is very cool.
I just want to say thank you guys so much for coming out.
It means the world to me.
It's one of those like very small things that Trevor and I spent two years writing this book.
I just want to say thank you.
It means lots of us.
At the end of the day, I will die and on a long enough time horizon I will be forgotten.
12:26
And the only thing that I can say that helped, that might be eternal is skills and education that I can pass on to other people.
Trevor used to tell me when I was going through kind of like harder times with the edits because it was very tough to edit this book and write this book.
He said there's a 17 year old who's going to sleep with this book under his pillow to get out of his situation.
12:43
You owe it to him.
And that's what was kind of like the continuously reinforcing mental frame that I had to that would pull me through it.

And so a lot of people will do anything for the algorithm, but like, if it's not on brand, for me, if it's not something I'm an expert in, I'm not going to talk about it.
That's my one piece of advice for him who's like, get starting to get into the game of content is like just talk about stuff you know about.
Just don't pretend to be someone you're not.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:24
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What happened with the Crocs?
Yeah.
So you introduced us to whatever some guy at Crocs.
Yes.
Stan, you know, then sent us all these cool designs for some Aquas knock on Crocs, which would have been dope.
And I would have totally wrapped him.
And it was like, yeah, we'll do some sort of collab thing.
0:41
Like right when we were ready to move forward, I was like, cool, like, send me whatever link I can promote and like, let's do this.
Like, I didn't even really, like care about like, money splits or anything.
I just, like, thought it'd be dope if everybody had some.
And then he was like, well, just tell us how many you want and here's the bill.
And I was like and it wasn't even that they were priced at normal Crocs.
1:00
They were priced at twice with the normal.
It was like 80 bucks to us to have the Crocs.
And I was like there's some massive misunderstanding.
I was like so many people, if there was like an acquisition, I come croc would would Rep these like for sure.
I like 10s of thousands of people who like, did the thing like I'd get this one or whatever.
1:19
And so because I was a prima Donna, I was like, no, I'm not wearing Crocs again.
And so after that I stopped working.
Crocs we're.
Not done here I I'm going to help sort this stuff.
So the story here is at my thing last year at my event you were in Crocs and you were just like dude, I'm ready to take it to the next level.
1:34
I'm super motivated promoter.
I was like dude, I happen to know when they're VP of Digital there and no we we are going to rectify this and I just want to see it happen.
It's not like he's going to pay me or anything.
So that's that's a good place to start And you know it's interesting enough Dan, he actually has a holding company and what I wanted to bring up was.
1:52
This I was at an investor conference a couple months ago called a capital conference and every year there's like rage.
I think the the year before it's like all about the hedge funds.
This year it's about hold codes, right, Everyone's hold code interesting as if it's really easy to start a holding company, right.
And and then it's like, no, there's a lot that goes into it.
2:10
I mean, you have a portfolio of businesses, right?
And.
Maybe we can spend some time talking about how difficult it actually is to not only be creating content, which we'll talk about in a second, but running a holding company.
It's it's not just, oh, I'm gonna hire operator and that's it, right?
It's like much easier said than done.
Yeah.
2:27
Well, to to dial in on the the Holdco side, I mean we have it's tough if we if we try to pull apart media from the actual people.
But like I think we have like just just under 30 people who work at Holdco, which is like a lot of people for a holding company.
2:43
But we're really hands on in terms of how we like add value to companies.
So I think there's there's kind of two models at least that I'm, you know, aware of or at least that we considered.
One is the completely decentralized model, the Berkshire Hathaway model, which is delegation of the point of abdication, right.
Like just like don't call me unless everything's burning and then still don't call me.
3:03
And that's one model, but part of the reason that we have basically the complete opposite model is that the deal flow that we have usually wants our help to grow.
So we're definitely growth partners more than we are.
Let's buy at a good price and hold it and just try and you know arbitrage the, the value that we can get from the business and then reallocate capital at the holding company.
3:22
And so for us, we're looking at is this company in our deal box, do we really like the founders?
Cause a lot of times if you're buying a company, you kick the founders out and then you put it in an operator that you trust etcetera.
So like we have a lot of which actually makes it harder for us to do this 'cause there's so many reasons that we won't do a deal, like we don't like the founders, they don't have a big enough vision.
3:42
We don't think the product's good enough long term, which means like we won't redo pre product market fit.
That's one of our big like that's why 3,000,000.
If anyone's curious like why 3 million in top line is kind of the minimum and for it's 3 million ish, but at least a million in Ibada because unless you're there like usually it's you're still figuring stuff out like we want to have at least a basic product.
4:03
Market done something.
Yeah.
There's something that's here, right.
And so we won't redo that.
And then we want it to be in a couple areas.
For us, it's usually consumer services or business services which is either brick and mortar chains or national services like mortgage sales or something, right.
4:22
And those are places where if we can see like an easy like 5X or something like that, that's usually what we will want to pick up.
So if there's like a bunch of like it's kind of funny like the double edged sword of you want a good business.
But my my head of biz Dev said he's like we want you to be very specifically incompetent as in like incompetent in all the ways that we are excellent.
4:43
And so it's like if someone's like, Oh yeah, our sales process is horrible or like man, we can't get enough demand, Jen.
But we have like a huge LTV and we're really sticky on the back end.
Like those are companies that we can come in and just murder.
Yeah, I mean we just, we just bought a 32 location teeth whitening chain and I was so excited about this.
5:03
And then we went to the facility and the experience was fine in terms of the product.
But the sales process that I went through was like I was like giddy.
I was like Oh my God, there's so many things that we can do to improve this.
And so we just rolled out our first level and we 5X to LTV in one roll out.
5:21
And so this is 32 locations and I was like great, like we just created $50 million in enterprise value like let's just roll the this out over the next 12 months to all 32 and I was like and that will be AW for the year.
You know what I mean?
Like one of the hardest parts about what we have is that you have this desire to have activity, right.
5:39
It's like we have all 'cause right now we get 3000 companies a month that apply.
So it's it's continue to grow but we don't we don't necessarily make more money by doing more deals.
And so it's way more about fine and like the the hard part is sticking with the plan and not getting like eyes bigger than your stomach.
And so anyways that's that's been the the biggest challenge for us is like just being very selective about the deals that we know are the best deals for us, not necessarily just good deals.
6:02
And you talk about the Deal Box, which is Warren Buffett's like you you you wait to swing, right.
So what, what do you think it is for your Deal Box?
You kind of mentioned a couple things.
Yeah.
So right now and I think that over time we'll probably expand it as we bring in other like like X operators, somebody you know, someone's scaled exited business for like 100 million plus in like software or something.
6:19
Then I'd be like we'll do just come into my deal flow and we'll make a deal that makes sense for both of you don't have to spend three years building out this massive deal machine.
I'll just partner with you on it and then we'll you know kick off at a different pod.
But for right now, our stuff has been focused on services, just cause like that's the world we just know really well.
6:36
Got it.
And that this kind of starts to go into content a little bit because you're you've been very prolific in the last two years with with levelling up your content.
Did that teeth whitening company, did that come through your content or where did it come from?
So walk me through how that works, because actually I was having lunch and my friend has a pet holding company.
6:54
He's like, I want to ask like how?
Because he just produced content, right?
He's like how how much does that content actually help with deal flow?
So what happened with that story?
All of our deal flow comes from content.
So yes, it does help.
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty like someone will watch a number of pieces.
They'll listen to a bunch of podcasts.
7:10
They'll buy the book, they'll read the book, They go through the course and you know, they'll have spent 100 hours with me virtually before they decide to take the first action, which I like, because then it a lot of times they'll fix a lot of the low hanging fruit, which is kind of nice, 'cause then you don't have to like have a thing that has all these issues.
And so they'll apply our, you know, head of business that well.
7:27
Well, there's multiple screenings.
We have an automated screening that weeds out like probably like 90% just 'cause they're not big enough or they're in a space or they're international, etcetera.
And then once that we have somebody who immediately reaches out to just qualify that this data is accurate which again that's like another wave.
7:44
And then from the qualifying stage we have somebody who then does a way more in depth business case and basically writes up a full like one page write up per business.
And then the ones that that person thinks are big enough and in our deal box then get passed on to Managing director of business Development.
8:00
And so then he takes the the deal from that point until close, which is usually like several more conversations, which he usually weeds out most of them.
We usually do about two LO is a month is what that results in for us, I think.
Just for those people listening, it's it's hard once you're in it, like you understand how hard it is, right?
8:19
But when you look at your team, it actually is a team of bad asses.
It's like a SWAT team, right?
And so you have people that have actually been there, done that.
You've talked about your CFO before, you said it's 30 people.
Who else are kind of the, the key players on that hold code team, 'cause I don't want people to think this is easy.
Oh yeah, everything's easy if you don't do a good job.
8:37
So it's like, so for us we look at it by function.
So it's like we have somebody who's an SO we call them SME, so subject matter experts, so subject matter expert for IT, for finance, for HR and recruiting for.
8:54
We have two different marketing SME's.
One that's more on like the tech side, like Martech and like media buying and like funnel optimization stuff, CRO.
And then the other one is more like truly like the art side of like the words, the copy like video sales letters, ads that kind of side and then we have a director of sales and we have a director of customer success.
9:16
And so each of those people has years of experience building and scaling multiple teams to bigger than most of the companies that are coming to us and now have you know experience doing their function and scaling it within each of our portfolio companies.
And we've just it's just a very long process of step by step codifying every play in the playbook.
9:34
And I think that it's kind of like the the Bruce Lee of like in the in the beginning everything's simple and then you have like a zillion you know punches and kicks and then it comes back to just like don't get hit.
And I think that right now we're we're getting better and better at like OK, we crushed this playbook really well.
9:50
We crushed this playbook really well.
And so right now we've got like a three playbook that it's like we can 10X like services companies.
And so I'm just trying to see like, OK, there's twenty other things that we do really well, but like what are those like easy, just massive levers that we can crank on.
10:07
And then I think that's where I want to just like I might even say, let's get even more efficient at just do it pulling these four levers immediately 10X ING the business and then saying like, OK, so do we want to exit or do we want to like double down again or do a dividend recap or something like that and then reinvest for another 10, I think.
When we're hanging out like a like a year ago it was service plus other businesses and I think now you guys are honing it in even more and like that's what business is right?
10:28
You just hone in more and more and more you get 'cause then you get even more efficiencies at Holdco and then you can get more.
And then it's even easier at the holding company to create value than the the the portfolio companies 'cause they're doing the same.
Like if you're switching from shit like let's say an e-commerce, like the pet thing, right?
10:45
So like, let's say I had one of his companies, which would not be my jailbox and I'm we're optimizing A Shopify page for chewing toys for dogs.
And then like the next call is about the brick and mortar teeth whitening chain.
It's like it's such a jarring switch of like perspectives that you don't get a lot of like a creative, you know, benefit between both of those calls.
11:05
Whereas if you have brick and mortar teeth whitening and the next will have brick and mortar photography and then the next call is brick and mortar gym chain and all of them are selling sessions and appointments.
It's like OK, like run this play.
Yeah, you.
So you had to talk recently.
11:20
And and I want to go into this a little more because back in the day, at least for me, it was like I had this senior living business.
There's this education, there's this ass thing.
There's this, there's this, there's this, right?
And for you, you had a like 9 different businesses or whatever, right?
I mean, just how bad was it when that was when I was actually happy?
11:38
Because I don't think people really understand.
How important focus is until they get punched in the gut?
But it's like how do you prevent that?
So I think the, the big difference is, 'cause people are like, Alex, you talk about focus now, but you have 13 portfolio companies.
But like I have one holding company and if you were to reframe it as like I own a marketing agency and I have 13 clients, it feels that way except I own them, you know what I mean?
12:00
But there's a full CEO and leadership team that run each of the companies and we have our leadership team that runs that.
And so, like, I own the holding company and that's my work, you know what I mean?
But where I've made the huge mistake when I was earlier on is like I have one company that makes money, I'll start another.
12:17
And so then you end up becoming CEO of three companies and it's a nightmare.
And so that's the part like it's weird because I feel like I only, I mean I don't want to speak this over myself but like I was only really able to understand how to do multiple things once I sold gym launch because then I I think it was the first time I was really above the business and then at that point I was like OK, so the the above the business is the one thing, the portfolio is the one thing and then that's when you're like your value prop as a as a holdco.
12:47
It is a bit like the holding company is a business in and of itself.
And I think that's the big like Epiphany that I had is like it is a business and then you get really specific, you niche down just like you do in, in any other business on what specific type of quote customers even though they're not customers you serve.
Can you talk about working so there's above the business in the business, you know on the business, right.
13:06
What's what?
What's the difference with above in the businesses like I'm taking sales calls.
I think on the businesses like I'm in leadership positions, I'm managing, I'm leading, I'm casting the vision, I'm inspiring the the team and then above the businesses the is you you look at many businesses and they are all almost like product lines or clients.
13:27
As I was saying earlier that you, you, you don't sit anywhere on the org chart for these businesses and that's probably the easiest litmus test is like do you have a direct report from the company and I have zero.
Yeah, for any of the companies, yeah.
It's funny.
So Neil sometimes will call me in the middle of the day and he'll be like, what are you doing?
13:47
I'm like, I'm working on stuff.
He's like, I'm bored.
Yeah, it's just like, right, But that's it's not like that.
But he he He works really hard.
But.
I I think the other other good comparison here is the the difference between like a parallel entrepreneur and a serial entrepreneur.
14:02
Because a serial entrepreneur actually waits to the next level.
A parallel starts multiple things, but then to your point, how are you supposed to compete?
Yeah, I mean the focus, the the one person who's going all in on one thing, it's always, in my opinion, going to make the most money.
And if you look at the wealthiest 50 people in the world, they all went all in on one thing.
14:20
And you know, and there's a couple private equity investors who are at that that top now.
But I would make the argument that there they were, they got into the business of private equity and that was their one thing.
Even though they bought and sold companies, it functioned the same way as having a marketing agency, except the unit size was bigger with more zeros.
14:39
Do you think when you had the nine different companies, was it 9?
OK, when you had the 9A?
It felt frantic, right?
But did you feel like you were really close to losing it all every day?
Yeah, it was horrible.
It was like the IT was so stressful because I mean, I had, I had nine companies worth of employees.
14:55
I didn't, I just didn't understand how operate.
I didn't understand how leadership worked.
I just don't understand management.
I didn't have one on ones.
I didn't have a communication cadence and I was the rainmaker for all the businesses.
Like it was so ridiculous.
When I think about it now, like it's so obviously stupid, but you just don't know when you're ignorant.
15:11
Before we move on from here, what do you say to all the people now that want to start a whole?
They're just like, I'm gonna go buy businesses, 'cause that's what cool people do, and I'm gonna go hire an operator.
You have any words for those people?
Right now, buying businesses is like in vogue.
I don't really know why it got in vogue, but my best guess is that we have so many people retiring right now that there's just a huge supply spike.
15:33
And then a lot of people who'd never made their money buying businesses, selling courses on how to buy businesses.
Because The thing is is, and this is kind of for the audience, it's like if you make your money buying businesses and you're really good at it, you don't need to sell a course.
Like the best people at buying businesses buy businesses and hold them and invest.
15:51
Like I think Naval said, like the best investors don't sell courses on investing.
You know what I mean?
Because like, if you're really good at it, you don't need to.
And I just, I like, I kind of stick by that.
And so it is kind of shitty.
And there's a lot of marketing dollars that are going behind that and a lot of content being made because it's like sexy.
16:08
And the idea of buying a business for no money down that makes 500,000 a year, which is absolutely possible.
You totally can't do that.
But the thing that they miss is that I can buy a business for $0.00 down that makes 500 or $1,000,000 a year and know how to run it.
If you've never run a business, and even if you do somehow magically pull off that deal, you're still screwed because you have no idea how to run a business and so it's like you still lack the skills even though you can close the sale.
16:34
Like I could sell, I could sell that I could build a skyscraper, and if I somehow managed to BS my way through the negotiations and close the contract, I still have to build a skyscraper.
And if you've never built a building before, or even a house very tough, and the likelihood that you then lose your ass on because like you're not, you'll get the business that does $1,000,000 in profit per year for $0.00 down, but not for $0.00.
16:56
And that's the piece that I think a lot of people it's like it's not free like you have a liability or you have a debt if you some sort of seller financing, creative financing, whatever it's like, but now you owe this person.
And that's the marketing piece, right.
I think we get the, it's the headlines at the end of the day I want to talk about the the content piece.
17:13
So I I was hanging out.
I I was.
Speaking of real estate mastermind, a couple weeks ago, basically this guy owns 1.5 billion in real estate in Arizona.
And then in the middle of the pandemic, he's like, I'm just going to do YouTube for fun, right?
Because he couldn't go anywhere.
So he grew to like 400K or so and then but his content is like top notch, right?
17:29
It's like he understands it.
Yeah, it's like this guy's deep, you can tell, right?
Tax advantages, whatever.
And but then, Ken, Ken McElroy, yeah, so you should.
Definitely talk super smart and but then you look at other people who are getting millions and millions of views a month on YouTube and are talking about all these different businesses, but then they know the YouTube game, but they don't have depth when it comes to business, right.
17:51
So I I see it as a trade off at the end of the day, but you're actually playing, you're actually able to play both right and so.
They were talking to me.
They're just like, OK, what's the point of even creating content?
I'll just, I'll just go buy more business.
Actually, this was last week, one of my friends was, was went to be like, Eric, I don't need to create content.
18:07
I'll just go buy their businesses.
And then I posted that to Twitter X the next day.
And Layla was like, so Layla was like, Oh no, but you create leverages where we get our deal flow from and you said all your deal flow comes from that, right.
So I guess I'm sure we have the same as you know we have a network and things like that come through.
18:25
But I don't, I can't.
I don't think we've done a deal that's not come through our deal flow.
And of the 3000 that come through each month, what percent actually make it?
Oh, tiny, right.
We do 2.
LO is a month.
And that's not to dissuade people.
It's mostly 'cause we just have a lot of people who don't have qualified businesses.
18:40
Just to be clear, like if you have a qualified business, hit me up.
But we just have a tremendous amount that are doing less than a million in profit.
And they're like, I'll give you 5% Alex, man.
So tempting, so.
OK, if for example the.
I mean, let's just use a fake example.
18:58
Someone has a bunch of locations they're doing 1,000,000 EBITDA.
We well let me just read one first and minimum is 1,000,000 just to be clear.
So like art, like ideally for me, like, I love that like three ish, 4:00-ish, you know what I mean?
Like that's where like you're right about to hit that.
19:13
So we can just like boom 20 and then it's like.
And you're you're aligning with them.
It's like, hey, if we want to hold forever, you're like, hey, like, if I like you maybe, right?
Yeah, I'm good on either way, 'cause like we don't, we don't need the liquidity.
Yeah, I'm happy to let it compound tax free.
So, like, I'm good either side either way.
And I'll just rephrase over here, 'cause I think when we we hung out a year ago, it's.
19:32
You talked about how you're maybe moving more towards instead of minority investments into majority.
How are you thinking about it now?
Yeah we're 100% in that In that camp are and I it's, you know it's almost like it's almost like finding your price when you're selling a service except in the deal world.
19:50
And this is one thing that like if you really wanna get into this world, like it is such a long game.
Because if you think about like product market fit, you have the same concept that happens at like a holding company when you're investing, you have like deal fit.
And so it's like what's my offer?
But not to a customer, but to A to an entrepreneur, to a founder, to somebody who's trying to go their business.
20:10
And so it takes way longer to to have enough qualified candidates to even make the offer.
And then it takes 90 days to even see if you can close the offer.
And then from closing the offer, it takes another year or two to see if it was actually like worked out.
So like your feedback cycles are so long.
20:27
That it's it's very painful as somebody who is an excellent whatever you want to call me who's used to being able to like hey let's try this out and in 30 days have it both spun up tested and have data like in 30 days we might be able to like talk to a couple watch runners that we think are interesting.
And so anyhow we have moved towards bigger and bigger chunks of companies.
20:49
Right now we target 49% with most of the deals.
We just, we just did a majority deal two months ago.
And so we're now doing both minority and majority and our minority slugs are bigger because it's the same thing where it's like it's the same work for us at 20% as it is at 51 in in some cases.
21:07
Weirdly enough it's almost less work at majority because I have fewer emotions to manage on the founder side because it's like, listen, I'm the one who's taking all the risk on now and so this is what we're gonna do rather than saying hey man, I think this is what we should do.
21:24
What do you think?
And so I have way my speed of implementation on majority companies is so much faster and like what I would like to do in the and This is why it takes years to do this.
But like over the next two or three years I'd love to show the difference between our minority holdings and our majority holdings of how much more profitable and how much faster we grew them to then make an even more compelling case of like I don't necessarily want to fully exit founders.
21:45
That's not my intention.
It's more like we have done this before.
Like please like let me love you like let me let me just do what we already know how to do many times.
And that like I remember I had a conversation with one of our founders.
This is one of the companies we actually ended up buying majority of.
We had like 6 phone calls to talk about a price change that I wanted to implement and we implemented the price change and we doubled profit and it was big company already.
22:10
We doubled profit in 30 days and and like we increased the price and increased close rates like we call that a wonderful, a wonderful thing because they were mispriced.
Like like we we did a bunch of research.
We saw the competitors in the marketplace where we were like we're not even going high.
I was like we're just going up to market which is I mean I love those opportunities, they're not always there but like but it if it had been a majority holding, it would have just been an e-mail.
22:34
I mean like this what it needs to change to let the team know Here's here are the you know, bullet points to talk to the sales director and he would just let him go.
Do you think before, so when you had the 20% or so, like I think we're talking about this already, it's like they weren't, not that they weren't taking this seriously.
I mean maybe you just didn't have.
22:50
It was more of a consultative relationship.
And to be fair, like it's not like we wield authority.
Like I'm, I'm not really an authoritative person.
From that perspective.
Like it's always soft influence.
We've never taken a vote in any company ever.
Like what?
23:05
Because it's funny because during the deal process we're like, well, how many who gets voted?
I'm like, dude, we will literally never look at this contract again.
Like I pride myself on the fact we've never taken a contract out after a deal.
But it still feels a little different.
Like no matter what anyone says, like if you if you buy majority, it just feels different.
23:22
It's like, here's the plan, let me know if you have questions about it or like what do you think?
And I want feedback more.
I want feedback.
I don't want to sell someone on it, you know what I mean?
And I think that's the that's.
Going to collaborate?
Yeah, exactly.
And so now we rewind back to the content again.
23:38
So how, how do you think your content strategy has changed in the last 12 months?
Because I I can from afar, I can see some of the adjustments.
Caleb's not here today, right?
Yeah, I know the team's bigger now.
I mean, how big is the media team now?
Nine.
23:54
Yeah, it's nine.
And then we have some vendors.
So probably if you included their teams, probably like 15 or 16 somewhere in there.
I mean, I think the big thing is just like we try and focus on content that only we can make.
That's the, that's the big single throughput line.
If someone else can make this piece of content, I don't want to make it.
24:11
And so that's why we try and we, you know, we call them, you know, one of zero stories which is like something no one else can do.
And so like no one can talk about like how they bought a teeth Whiting chain and then like implemented a new sales process.
And then 5X, no one can say that because that's such like no one did that.
24:28
I did that.
And so someone might be like here's how Coca-Cola, here's a breakdown of Coca Cola's business model.
But like I'm not going to do that because someone else can do that.
But this is the stuff that I can do.
So it's more, it's going to be more capturing out what we're literally doing because I think the more people saw what we actually do in companies, one, it would get even better deal flow for us.
24:48
But also it's more unique than I think what most people do.
So that's kind of like us trying to play more to our strengths, which is like our day-to-day is our strength.
And we almost diverted from our strength to create content to just like learn this game.
But as our infrastructure gets bigger and better, we're leaning more and more.
25:03
So we we we just bought a big headquarters here in Vegas and so we're going to be centralizing the whole media team.
That'll be our big media headquarters.
And so we've got the gym.
In there too, right?
You have a whole floor, and so there's gonna be a ton of new content.
We're gonna be pushing out, 'cause it's funny, 'cause, like, right now people will probably be like, you've made it.
25:21
You're at like, the pinnacle of content.
I'm like, dude, we literally haven't even started.
Like, the amount of stuff that we're planning on doing for like 2024 is bananas.
Can't wait.
It's gonna be, it's gonna be like we will be pushing out a lot of content and it will be really good 'cause you said one thing earlier but I I love this statement but it's like the second throughput would be like too good to fail because that buddy of yours can.
25:44
It's like you don't have to know the algorithm in my opinion Like if if it if the piece is good enough, you don't have to nail the thumb.
You don't have to nail the headline.
If people start watching it and they're like this is so good, they will share it.
They will keep watching it and they will come back and watch the next time.
25:59
Because what happens is like if you think about the human behavior side of it.
If you just watch, if you over deliver like crazy on one video, the next time you post a video that person will click it and they don't even look at the thumb, They don't look at the headline.
They're just like oh Alex or Eric made another video.
26:15
It must be good because all the other videos are good, and I think it's more important to have fewer good pieces than more mediocre pieces.
Dude, so here's where I'm coming from, looking at Ken's during the pandemic, he had videos that would get a couple 100,000 and that's when you know you're doing pretty well with each video.
26:30
Neil, same deal.
He had a couple 100,000.
Some videos will get a million views or so.
And then same deal for me, a couple 100, this is like four or five years ago and my thesis here is that you have to be in the good graces of YouTube and you have to be, you cannot stop, right?
And because those guys, Neil stopped, Ken stopped, I stopped.
26:48
We're in this box right now where I look at Neil's, I'm like, dude, your views are the same shit from the last couple years ago, but you're only getting like 5-10 K views, right?
So there's I think there's this like this this penalty box almost.
I think it's it's in my opinion all social media has switched to the TikTok, TikTok ification of of social media.
27:06
I, you know, I actually think it's good because what it does is it like subscribers mean nothing.
Followers on Instagram mean nothing.
They're literally just a vanity metric now And so the only thing that matters is click, retain, reward, that's it like that like and it doesn't matter what the platform is, they're all the same is like did you get them to click, did you get them to watch and did you get them to come back?
27:31
That's it.
And so the algorithm like it also by doing that though, it makes it, there's never been a better time to start because in the earlier days when it was subscriber based, it was basically an e-mail list.
Like you build a subscriber base and then they push out your stuff subscribers, but they don't do that anymore at all.
27:47
And now it's just like they do look like audiences based on what they predict someone will like your thing or not.
And so you could be a brand new account and have your first video do 10 million on the first upload ever, which I think in some ways is like a great equalizer and it makes the content king, Mosey Nation real quick.
28:06
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
And if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
28:25
And so actually going to the shorts for a second, you're a team of 16 people.
What percent of your work?
With you and your team goes that you think into shorts versus the long form stuff.
I mean my shorts for me is like almost no work.
That's that's all the team, OK, that's all them.
28:41
So they're cutting.
Up your long form stuff, that's almost the majority but we did direct to camera stuff early to kind of like kick start things but it is I haven't, I can't remember the last direct to camera shoot we did because.
Direct camera versus it's it's a very, it's a different setup, different so like.
No more direct to camera because not that I'm against it, it's just that they've got enough other stuff and I prefer the other stuff because I think it's more like organic usability per minute of footage is highest, whereas if like we do a vlog day, they're going to get three or four shorts from a full day, but they got to go through like 8 hours of content.
29:12
Whereas if I do like 2 hours of direct camera, we have like 100 shorts.
It's a lot, yeah.
Yeah.
And So what about from this, this?
You pull like what?
Like 2015 shorts you would know?
Yeah, all depends.
Like, say 10101020 shorts?
29:28
OK.
Yeah, really 10.
So you go for two.
Hours or something like that.
OK, got it.
And your spend a year ago was like I think like 120 grand a month.
Like what do you think that looks like now?
It's probably double OK.
So 240 and are you getting paid on on Adsense any of this?
29:44
Yeah, yeah, OK.
I mean, not enough to make it back.
It doesn't.
Equal it out.
OK, it doesn't equal it out, but it's.
OK.
The deal flow is good.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, with like media's just like a loss leader.
If you want to consider from that perspective, we lose money on media, which is funny 'cause people were like he makes money on his $2.00 book, which by the way Amazon takes, you get paid like $0.30 on a book that's $2.00.
30:02
But anyways, that just goes to fund the loot the the money losing media team.
And I'd say that with absolute love, you know what I mean?
But but that's, that's, I mean all marketing loses money until it makes you money.
Like, you know, long.
Game and rewinding back to the deal stuff for a second.
30:18
So of the 24 Lois that you do, that comes from content by the way, so it does make money.
How many of those that actually go through?
1/2 OK, got it.
So 12 go through.
OK.
Pretty high conversion rate, but it's also good qualification.
Yeah.
But I think we've just continued to get narrower and narrower and I wouldn't be surprised.
30:34
Well, our deal flow keeps going up.
So if we might actually have the same number of deals done on five times the amount of deal flow, yeah, because we're just getting better and better at picking, yeah.
One more thing before we go back to content.
What is the craziest thing someone has offered you?
30:50
Cuz here's the thing, right?
I do believe there is.
The brand equity that you have gets you good deal in terms like the agencies that come to be like yeah we do four or five million a year, we'll we'll give you 20%.
It's like what?
Like great.
So like what is the craziest thing someone's offered, like their newborn?
Like anything like that.
Honestly, the people who, who, who, who who make the craziest offers usually don't have anything of value to offer, you know what I mean?
31:10
But I would say almost all the all the deals that we do have favorable terms.
You know what I mean?
In terms of both price and just like just terms in general, like we keep, we try to keep our contracts as simple as humanly possible.
I put this big emphasis on the legal team to make it plain English contracts.
31:26
And like my lawyer, like had a heart attack when I was like I want a fifth grader to be able to read this contract.
Because the biggest issue that that happens in the deal process for anyone who's ever done a deal is that their lawyer starts talking to your lawyer and then they just keep having these conversations and translating back and forth.
31:42
And then you have all these miscommunications.
And then it's like, yeah, yeah.
And the and the only person who wins there is the lawyer.
And so we've we've taken a little bit of a different approach of like let's keep our conversation as primary and then we together tell the attorneys what we want them to to do.
And that way like the any any negotiating happens between US And that way 'cause like I remember there was a deal we were working on and their you know attorney who it wasn't even an M&A attorney by the way if you are gonna sell your company or have somebody invest like have an M&A attorney anyways, it's like no, he's a family friend.
32:14
I'm like doesn't mean he doesn't work.
So he was like we need this non compete to be you know, 24 months and a 50 mile radius around the brick and mortar locations.
They asked for this.
Yeah.
And I was like, so the lawyers are talking for like 2 weeks about this.
And I finally, I called the founder up and I was like, are you planning on starting another chain?
32:32
I was like, you still own majority of this business.
Do you plan on competing with your own business?
He was like, no.
And I was like, cool.
Then as long as you own majority of the business, you don't compete with your business.
And he was like, yeah, that's fine.
It's like, great.
Glad we had this talk.
You know what I mean?
But, like, that was probably like $10,000 in in lawyer fees that went back and forth.
32:49
That was settled by two entrepreneurs in 2 minutes.
Yep.
Just obvious stuff, you know what I mean?
But like, that kind of thing is the stuff that like, hangnails, you know what I mean?
Like on deals.
Yeah.
So now we rewind back to content.
Sorry for jumping all over the place, but the so when you're thinking about the ideation piece, right.
33:10
So is that like?
Are you separating that into another day?
Is that like on the same day?
And then how are you thinking about like, the hooks, the stories, all that type of stuff?
The team brings everything, OK, so the team brings everything from like, because they'll watch this podcast and then they'll be like, dude, that story was interesting.
33:26
Can we do a thing on that?
And then because like basically the team is inherently curious.
People who like my content and so like to use some Gary terms like they fuck with my content and so the stuff that they want to know more about we we go into more depth on.
33:42
And so I haven't been asked to come up with topics in a really long time.
But I'll tell you how I would come up with topics 'cause this is how I was doing it when it was just me starting out is that I just like to use time as my as my like anchor for this.
So I go far past which is like what are the what are the life changing experiences or conversation that I've had that have shaped the way of my worldview.
34:02
And so those are stories that I will tell because I think they're impactful and people get value from them.
Then I have recent past which is like let me look at my calendar over the last week and just look at all the meetings I had and I just like I would have my phone up and be like OK, so I was talking to one of our profile companies who's trying to make a change on pricing.
34:22
And so this is what we were considering.
You know what I mean?
I'm just, I just literally go through what my life was.
I have present which is whenever something comes up in the moment, I always have a way to like brain dump it.
And so for me, Twitter or X is kind of my brain dump whenever I threads.
Yeah, or well, might they they repost stuff, but Twitter is my is my home home base for that.
34:42
And so they'll also come with the tweets that they thought were like interesting to make more content about.
And then you've got like manufactured, which is stuff that doesn't exist at all.
What's an example?
Like I lived on $100 in for 30 days.
34:59
Like here's what happened.
Like as an example, I that wouldn't be one that I would make, but like 'cause somebody else could make that, but stuff like that and then and then like case studies and vlogs.
So those are kind of like the buckets that that that we think through.
35:15
But most of you'll notice it's just like real stuff.
So we don't have to come up with like what would people find interesting Like well this is what I did and if they find it interesting, awesome and.
What's like the micro there?
Is it like one day at a time they just dump a bunch of topics on you?
Well, when we do recording because we record like twice a month and.
35:33
This is what how How much in a day?
How It's a full day, so it's it's two full days a month is when we do the recording.
Once we get the headquarters it'll probably be smaller chunks more frequently but for right now it's just like 1/8 hour day twice a month but they'll have like full like 6 page pre productions for every video of like these are these are these are the themes either these are the the four or five stories that we think are that we've pulled from your other pieces that we think would tie well together around this topic.
36:03
I talked to the team to get stats on some of these companies for this case study.
So like the media team now will talk to our subject matter experts at Holco to get like, hey, what?
What was new this week?
Did you guys do any implementations or whatever?
And then they'll take that and then repackage it, and then that'll become content.
36:19
Dude, I I mean, this is a sidebar here, but like, I know even with Caleb and might might just sense in general, like, you like to be friends with your staff, right?
And.
Which I think is good.
And that's how they really understand what you want and how you think as a person.
How do you indoctrinate them into your way of thinking?
36:34
Like a chief of staff would just be sitting and watching you and shadowing you for a couple months, right?
Yeah.
I think it's osmosis, OK.
I think it's just proximity and exposure and that's why that's why I'm so excited for the headquarters.
It's funny 'cause as a as a previously remote, before it was cool, you know, that's how we scaled gym, launched.
36:51
Everything we had was remote, and this will be since my brick and mortar chain.
This will be the first in person stuff I've done.
But it's weird because I feel incredibly confident at how much of A game changer I think it's going to be, dude.
I I mean, here's where I'm at, right?
And and maybe my staff might crucify me for saying this if they find it, but.
37:08
I I'm an introvert and I do.
I've been working remote at tech companies for the longest time and like we were doing hybrid even before the pandemic hit like a couple years 32.
But I'm just like dude, you cannot replace like this, right?
Like it this is a relationship and it goes much further and I just think commercial I think commercial real estate is going to come back in the next 5-10 years.
37:29
So it just seems to be moving that way, because how are you supposed to?
If there's this, how can you compete?
I think you know one of the is this is kind of interesting is like if I if we had like an SOP on how to handle difficult conversations, right or bad news, whatever.
37:46
If I teach an SOP around that, people be like, OK, got it, these are the steps.
But it's incredibly different to see me get bad news and then watch what happens.
Like, it's a completely different experience and I think that is something that becomes memorable and that's what can change someone's behavior way faster.
38:02
I mean, dude, like, that in itself is a story, and people remember stories.
And so when it comes to your videos, because you're pretty good at just your memory, I think is really good.
I just forget stuff, right?
But it's like you seem to weave into stories pretty well.
Like, how much is it just second nature to you now?
38:20
How much are you thinking about your stories when you're creating content?
Yeah.
So the storytelling component was something that I really worked hard on and I have continued to work hard on for almost probably 6 years.
So when when I started gym lunch and I had to start teaching, basically when I had to start teaching, I realized that teaching was making connections between things that people understand and things that they don't.
38:43
And so that's why metaphors and analogies are so strong, 'cause they're like, OK, so energies.
So you're kind of like a car, and if you put your gas in, it's kind of like your body and the food, you know what I mean?
So it's like, I understand this, but I don't understand this, but I can apply the same principles.
And so when I realized that I used to just kind of like lecture people on like jargon, right?
39:02
Their eyes would roll over and I just didn't get the desired result.
So I had to Start learning like, so then I started reading books on how to tell stories.
And the the TLDR on like how to tell a story is just you have a character, you have an unmet desire, you have an obstacle, you have a guide who comes in with some sort of solution.
39:20
The person tries the new way it works.
And then there's an internal achievement and an external achievement, meaning like who did they become in the process and what happened on the outside?
And so like I just pretty much just try and think through that process of like desire, unmet desire, obstacle guide plan, execution result.
39:37
The fact that you can just roll that off your tongue means like it is burned into you, right?
Because I mean I I just oh, it's like sounds like the Harman circle.
Oh, is it?
Yeah.
I mean, like, the stories are the same.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
It's.
I mean it's.
For me, I just riff on it this I was kind of making fun of Neil and myself when when I look at both of our YouTube channels, I was like, you know, we suck at YouTube because we just lecture people, right?
39:59
It's like, but then we we do like, we do like a live recording.
And then I'm just sharing the story about Mr. Beast. 2 million views on TikTok, right?
Or anyway, point is, so the story is huge.
Do you think about your hooks a lot?
Yeah.
The hooks everything.
And let me just rewind to the stories real quick.
40:16
Which books did you read to get better at storytelling?
Honestly I think reading fiction and then I'm a big articles guy.
Like I don't.
I don't actually.
People would be amazed to have a few books I read.
I'm like really narrow.
I'll like binge consume a field of study and so I might read like 9 books on.
40:36
So like when we, when we started doing deals at acquisition.com, I read nine books in one month on deal making and I was like, OK, I feel like I have a better understanding of just the lever, the tools that I have available in my tool belt that I didn't know existed.
But then I haven't read one since.
40:52
And then same thing with like, you know, the storytelling in general was more reading all the different articles and stuff that were out there about storytelling so that I could understand there's a million different like story, you know, unmet desire, character, you know, whatever.
But they all more or less fall that same trajectory.
41:08
And so to answer the first thing you said, like, how much do we work on the hook?
A lot.
And if that sounds like it's in contrast to what I was saying earlier, it's not because if you have something that's amazing, it'll get shared no matter what.
But if you have something that's mediocre, if you have an amazing hook, it'll also get shared.
41:25
And so if you can create an unbelievable hook, you can still have content that's murders.
And the I'll tell you a story that isn't mine and how it related to 1.
So a buddy of mine was a big infomercial guy.
He's a little older and he did this book.
41:41
He had a book that he was selling and so he had Larry King fly out and record like a one hour book infomercial promo.
And so it was like a big deal for him, you know, getting interviewed by Larry King.
And so he had Larry King be like in your Live With Larry, like the same intro he does for all the shows.
41:57
And this guy's a very good marketer.
And so he ran the ad and he was like, this thing's going to murder.
I'm going to make so much money.
And it tanked.
He was like, what is going on?
And so then he he was like, so he started studying game footage.
He looked at his all time best dads.
He was like, all right, I'm watching this one.
He watched this one and he was like, I messed up the hook.
42:14
He's like the hook's wrong.
And so he flew Larry King back out, reset up the entire fake setup of Larry King live and re recorded the 1st 30 seconds and then pushed out the new one with the new hook $100 million in the next 12 months.
42:30
That's crazy.
We had like my story's not nearly as significant as that, but we had a video recently that was like we all were like this is a good video and it got like 5000 views or something, which is pretty small for our account.
And so the guys just cut out the 1st 3 seconds and then it was it was basically saying like, so I had this time when and then they just cut that out and just went to the when the thing happened and it went from 5000 to 900,000 is it?
42:54
Cause in analytics you just saw a big tank like drop off like like the they they hear the the 1st 3 words or five words or phrase and they're like not interested and so you have 5 seconds but it's more like 2.
Yeah, or like 2 milliseconds in a shorts.
Yeah, tiny, but it makes all the difference in the world.
43:12
So going back to your team then like is most of your content team based?
Here, I'm gonna give a really good go for it.
Sexy tactic?
Yes.
So this is something that I haven't even shared with you guys, but I just had this realization.
So.
So I had a tweet that just crushed this morning and I was thinking about this when I made it was I wanted to give a business example and then I used a the same principle in a marriage and then and then I did the generality of the principal.
43:36
But then I was like I should put the marriage one first because it's the way wider hook.
And then I did the business one and then it had the philosophical principle and then it way outperformed.
And so we would like, when we're thinking about our hooks, we'll probably go wide business principle rather than like any of the other versions of that so that we can get a, you know, wider demo.
43:59
But anyways, this just like I've called strategy.
Yeah, I just enjoy the game.
Like, I think, I think it's fun to learn this stuff.
You.
Fell in business love with Layla first before you fell in love, love.
What do you mean by that?
Well, I liked her mind first.
I mean, I pitched her on working for me the first time we met and I was like, hey, this might not work out, but like, you should totally work for me and we can make a bunch of money together.
44:20
And I just said, like plain black and white, I'll pay you twice as much as you're currently making.
So but still look at the offer independent of me.
Like, it should make sense for you.
And so obviously she said no for the 1st 30 days because I asked her every day and she said no.
But then when I did the turn around business, launched 3 gyms, came back with a big stack of money.
44:40
She was like, oh, so this works.
And I was like, yeah.
And the, I mean the first question she actually asked me after we processed all the money, 'cause I did it together at a little bit of flex.
We processed like 120 grand in like 45 minutes.
And she was like, I mean, I'm 27, she's 23.
She's like, whoa, she's like, is this legal?
44:56
Your your first couple of dates, were you guys just like working at Starbucks or something?
Yeah, just working together.
Yeah.
I mean, I didn't.
It was weird because like, I just, I just like liked hanging with her.
Like I just liked her around.
And that was like I whenever I had the choice of like me being alone and me being with Layla, I just like always wanted to be with her.
45:15
And she kind of had the same thing and so but we didn't have like, romance, chemically love until much later.
But I got her to quit her job and fly out with me within like 6 weeks and.
Even when you guys got married, you.
I think you like you weren't in love Love yet, right?
45:30
Really.
Like, at what point did you say she's gonna be one?
But I We're not in love, love yet.
I'd say that we, like, really got into, like, love, love in December of 19.
OK, so that was two years, 2 1/2 years after we got married, OK?
And that was because we made a conscious decision.
We were actually both pretty miserable, mostly 'cause we're and I was really upfront about this and we both agreed.
45:52
I said, listen, here's what here are the priorities.
I was like business and then us, we got to feed the business and the business feeds us.
That's how this works.
And in December of 19, we were both like, we had this like deep conversation where she's like, I'm just like not happy with this.
And I was like, me neither.
46:08
And so we're like, I think we, I think our premise was wrong.
And so we said, well, what if we just like made marriage the priority And then the business would flow from that.
And so that's when we flipped everything.
And it's actually been great since then.
And again, it was fine.
It wasn't like, you know, combative.
46:24
It was just, it's just much better, Yeah.
And I I think you said this before, it's love is something that you decide to work on.
It's not.
It's like a active thing.
It's not passive.
I also think there's a lot of different versions of relationships.
Like if you think about your friendships, like like your friendships with like 7 different dudes that you know you probably have, like the the relationship is different with all of them.
46:43
And so I think like, love is a really general word and we're just more limited by like our vocabulary than anything else.
Like I think Leila and I have a very different love than most people who are married and together.
But I would say that it is absolutely founded in respect.
And that, to me was probably the most unique aspect of my relationship with her was that I I just respected her and she respects me.
47:04
And I would say until that point, I probably had the more traditional relationships that were just like more lovey, dovey, more chemically, more romance, etcetera.
But The thing is, like, I'm a really extreme person.
And so if someone doesn't like what I like, like they're not gonna see me very much.
And if they do, and if they are that way, anytime I do something, it's gonna feel like I'm doing them a favor.
47:27
And that that tally board of like who's doing who a favor is, would get way out of whack really fast.
And then I'll start resenting them because I'm like, I want to do this other thing.
And it's not that I don't love you, I just want to work and that's what I want to do.
And so the fact that she just like the biggest thing that made me really love Layla was just that she has never tried to change me.
47:47
Like she just, it was pure acceptance on this is Alex like, I'm not going to get him to dress a certain way.
I'm not going to get him to behave a certain way.
Talks like, I'm not going to ask him nothing.
She just was like, you do, you and I will do me next to you, and as long as we agree on where we're going, we'll get there and have a good time, Neil told me.
48:08
This Neil told me this actually it's like I was like so why did you decide that his wife is the one, right.
Michelle and he's like she just let me be me and and like he, you know we've dated right.
I've I've seen, you know, people come and go, but.
And then now you know, he's, he's hounding me about kids all the time, right?
48:25
He's like, you gotta get married to have kids, right?
He's lecturing everyone.
Last week I might think he's lecturing Syed the WordPress king, and he's like, you need to have more kids, blah, blah, blah.
Well, where I'm going with this is, do you think kids will be on the horizon for you?
I mean, I think it's that will change things.
48:41
I think it's possible.
I mean, Leila's still young, Like, I mean, we have time.
I mean, you're still young.
Yeah.
I mean, right.
Yeah, I'm still.
But like, I'm not the limiter, You know what I mean?
For, for youth in terms of appropriation.
But yeah, I mean, she's still young.
And if we work, cool either way.
48:57
So if it happened like if she got pregnant tomorrow, like we'd have the kid, Yeah.
I mean, this is like, this is all like conjecture at the end of the day because like, you guys adapted your marriage a little and then it might adapt to the next level.
It's all levels, right?
Yeah, I'm not.
I'm not worried about it.
I I think I would, I would like to have kids at some point, kind of like when people who don't, who are employed and they're like, I'd like to start a business someday.
49:17
Yeah, it's it's an easy thing to say, you know, like sounds great, but I'm sure it would be very different.
All right.
We're gonna go back to content and then I got a bunch of bunch of stuff to to double down on here.
So the going back to the structure of your content team like a were they based mostly and then who are kind of the key players there?
49:36
We're all US based, OK?
And most of them are West Coast because we're on the West Coast.
So I think right now, 100%, Nope.
We have one person on the East Coast.
Everybody else is either Southern California or Vegas.
Yep.
So what what I found is.
49:53
A The reason I'm asking that is because when I when I see it as fail on content, it's because we've gone cheap and rely too much on offshore and it's like, dude, where's the strategy?
Like grammatical mistakes, they're picking the wrong areas for the hooks, right?
So you're nodding your head over there like wrong areas for the hooks, just bad part.
50:09
Like there is no story and it's like no wonder everything's falling flat.
And you look at the metrics right and you're nodding your head, Seems like it's happened to you, I mean early.
But I think the the big thing that everyone messes up with the content and even even the quote going cheap is said like they have to understand brand.
50:25
And that was, I mean that's been my big epiphany after post gym launch was I didn't understand brand when I had gym launch.
Like I understand I don't want to say I understand brand, but I have a much better idea of it now.
And like like my team right now has so much footage and they could clip a bunch of moments during the vlog days and make me look bad and get a zillion views.
50:48
Like, we could do that, but that doesn't help me.
And so a lot of people will do anything for the algorithm they become algo whores is what we call it, which is just like this is really hot right now.
We should make that stuff.
But like, I'm not going to like if it's not, if it's not on brand, for me, if it's not something I'm an expert in, I'm not going to talk about it.
51:07
And that's, I think that's, that's my one piece of advice for him because he's like get starting to get into the game of content is like just talk about stuff you know about, like don't worry, like just don't pretend to be someone you're not.
Like if you if you're only good at sewing, then just talk about sewing.
Don't start making content about how people should invest their money.
51:24
Like, just talk about sewing.
Let me ask you this, when you produce content now, those full days now, are you very much looking forward to and are you enjoying it When you're creating your content?
It really all depends on how much I've slept the night before.
Like it's actually like the biggest factor.
It's just like how much have I slept the night before?
51:41
Like we had a recording day recently and I I I basically didn't sleep at all the two nights before.
And so like that was like I had to use willpower.
But most times I don't have to use willpower.
I can just, I can just rock'n'roll.
Yeah.
And so you feel like for the most part, when you, let's assume you had a good night of sleep, you feel like you're creating the content that you want to create.
51:58
I think it's always an evolving process.
I mean, I think it's more like a pendulum.
I mean, I think, like it's more a dichotomy to be managed than a problem to be solved.
And so there's like stuff that I super, super fuck with exclusively.
And then there's stuff that the audience absolutely loves and the algorithm loves.
And so we just try and find that middle ground and if anything we're probably right off center of like if Alex doesn't like it, he's not going to keep doing it.
52:21
So but like I'm looking at this on like a 20 year time horizon.
And so you know we had a video that that we that was ready for this week that we were supposed to post and then we I saw it and I was like I don't want to post it and so we didn't have a YouTube video go out this week and I Will Survive.
52:38
I like it.
And so.
The now I'm just trying to think for the team's perspective like all the hard work on like the edits, the jump cuts, the thumbnails and all that.
How much effort are you putting into that now?
Because like I actually that that one talk that you did recently I saw the I saw the headline change like three times in the span of a couple hours.
52:59
So what's going into all the testing right now?
Yeah, it's right off the bat.
So our our head of YouTube, I mean we'll still do a good job.
We'll still split tests like we would for an ad.
You know we'll try different headlines for different thumbnails cause at the end of the day like the mission is to get real business education accessible to everyone and that means we have to meet people where they're at, which is why I have to tie in more stories and I don't just like review Excel sheets on on YouTube screen shares, you know what I mean?
53:22
Cause like that's not going to help anyone.
It's in fact it'll help basically no one And so we have to make it accessible which is part of the reason of vlog is is like that is is a it's a form of consumption that a lot of people can do And so we were going to be doing more of that because more people can consume it and benefit from it.
53:40
We will play the game just like anyone else does but as but The thing is is like they will send me thumbnails and headlines and I'll be like that's not that's not true or I don't like how this makes the person that we're talking about the video sound.
I think it was like, I'll give you an example, we had a, we had an affiliate video that went out basically explaining how you can use affiliates to promote a business.
54:03
And I was talking about it within the context of the book.
That's like my next book that's coming out.
And I think one of the headlines will test that was sent to me was something like how I got or how I convinced.
Yeah, I think it was how I convinced 12,000 people to promote my book.
And I was like, if I'm an affiliate and I see that headline, I was like that doesn't make me feel good.
54:22
And so I was.
So I was talking to you.
I was like we have to think about, we have to think about it from every angle.
So there's, there's the Alex Brand angle.
Does this reinforce or dilute the values that we have in the position that we want to associate ourselves with?
Then we have the the audience like who's actually watching this?
54:39
Does this make them feel more aligned with that, that ultimate mission does Does this leave them better than they were and they then they started and then it's also who's the subject of the content, right?
Like, I could make content that makes me look fine and the audience would enjoy, but it's me bashing somebody that's not going to be that's.
54:56
I'm never going to do that because I would never, I would never do that.
If we don't have a win, win, win, then it's not right and we will keep doing it until we have a win, win, win, got.
It.
I love that.
And that that aligns with your values.
The unimpeachable character.
Yeah.
I'm never gonna.
I'm never gonna throw shit.
I'll criticize generally and I will pray specifically.
55:12
Warren Buffett Yeah, all this.
So you have Mosey Media right now.
You've got the vlog, you've got this, the new studio coming, and then this this podcast.
I mean, you've got two full days that you record already, I imagine.
I imagine this has to start getting annoying at some point.
55:29
For you, you're doing a ton of pods, but it makes sense, 'cause you're on the book tour right now.
So I only do podcasts with people that I feel like doing podcasts with.
So if I like, So this is actually, this might be kind of interesting.
I will only do so.
This is for anybody who's trying to get me on a podcast.
I will do podcasts if I think the person who's doing the interviewing has good questions.
55:48
So I did one recently with somebody who had no like a very small audience but I saw or the team had seen that he like did a ton of research on every person would watch like 50 hours of content to ask like really good in depth questions not like, so tell me your origin story It's.
56:05
Danny, right?
Yeah, Danny was.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And so, yeah, Danny did a great job.
And so I'm like and he's doing it absolutely the right way, which is like do the work and you can and you can bat outside of your outside of your league if you do the work.
But the flip side is like I've I've, if somebody's got like, they've been doing a podcast, they've got 500 episodes.
56:24
They've never taken off.
And the first question that they ask in every video is like, so tell me about yourself.
No thank you.
I'm just not interested.
Like my audience already has 50 podcasts they can watch of me saying the exact same story.
And so I would like to There's an element of of there's their audience and I can do the TLDR on that like in 2 minutes, which I can understand.
56:45
But I'd prefer them just provide the context for me.
So we can actually like Rip and Roar.
But that's the.
I don't like, I I enjoy the good conversations.
The hard part is just how many do you have and which ones do you pick?
Because like right now I think we get like 10 requests a day for podcasts.
Yeah, it's a lot.
57:01
And I feel bad because I want to, I want to say yes, but mathematically it can't.
It's not even like a reschedule.
It's just like it's just a no.
And so it really comes down to the quality of the interview and if we can do it in person, I feel like the the in person podcasts outperform the Zoom podcasts.
57:22
It's literally just like all of the in persons and then like all of the zooms.
So like, the best Zoom podcast is probably like about as good as like, the worst in person podcast dude.
I mean.
I enjoy these right?
Cuz these are much longer.
I think if we did this on Zoom, it would probably be like an hour or so and you get tired.
57:38
I don't know why.
I feel like I'm way more.
I'm like way I feel like I tire out faster.
I'd like less interested.
I don't know, just.
Staring on a screen?
Yeah, maybe, Yeah.
I wanted to start to dovetail this into the book, but just.
I'm curious, you started to compound on all the channels, right?
57:54
Twitter, LinkedIn, everything.
How are you compounding?
Are you like, your numbers guide to like you're tracking the month over month growth?
Like how are you looking on those?
I see the compounding as a consequence of what we're doing rather than the goal.
What do you?
Mean by that?
Yeah.
So like, we're human and we love having things that we can measure.
58:10
And the more ways you measure, the more we can win.
So I can appreciate that, but like we're big on if we have a piece of content that we're like this is going to really help someone and even if it's not super wide and we know it's not going to get, it's not going to perform, we'll we'll we'll push it for sure.
And so it's I think it's really been all about the too good to fail.
58:29
It's like as long as we make sure that what we were putting out is high quality and that I am proud to have it out there.
It's kind of like the rest will take care of itself.
Like we will do our jobs, we will do a good job, we will do all of the basics, and we will do it every time.
And if we do that on a long enough time horizon, we will get the result we want.
58:46
Yeah.
Makes sense?







0:00
So right now your business does not have your CEO and you say that you are passive in it.
I would probably challenge you on that and say that's not true, right?
The company has to be able to grow and innovate without you.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:21
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
I'm gonna talk to you about how to structure the business in order to sell it and why you should do that independent of whether or not you're planning on selling it in the future.
0:39
So if you have a business right now and you're trying to scale it, you're trying to grow it, there's usually one of two outcomes, right?
Either this is something that you're super passionate about or this is an opportunity that you're passionate about because of the, you know, upside potential of making lots of money.
There's tons of people who are really, you know, build software companies that aren't like super passionate about, like data management, but they're really good at it and they think there's an opportunity to make money.
0:58
Doesn't really matter to me.
Whatever way you do it is fine.
But what happens is over the trajectory of the careers of the entrepreneur.
You know, we develop in skill sets.
We level, level up, you know, first.
We're doing that.
We're managing that.
We're leading that.
We're casting the vision and you move your way up in the company as the company grows underneath of you as you scale, right.
The thing is, is that at some point, you know I think the entrepreneurial journey is always trying to find the most leverage for our skills, like what's the best vehicle for the skills that we have to capitalize on the opportunity to marketplace, right.
1:24
And that's the entire market, not just within the, the context of your business, but if you were building the company at some point.
And this I think the one of the hardest transitions that I've had to go through and it took me a very long time to do this was transitioning from CEO to owner.
And you've heard me talk about this before, but I'm going to say it again because I think it's so important, independent of whether I planned on keeping the businesses or selling the businesses, learning how to structure the business so that it could sell someday was one of the most valuable things that I've done as an entrepreneur.
1:51
And I remember when I started out as like, I'm never going to sell this company.
I'm never going to sell this company.
Like I'm going to keep these things for life.
And that may or may not be true.
But as I've gotten older, I will tell you this, I do like having optionality and by doing by structuring the company in such a way that I could sell it, which I'm going to get to what's what Some of those things are in a second.
2:09
It actually enabled me to have more freedom, which was the ultimate goal of the business.
And so the biggest hardship that I've probably forced on myself was starting another business while I had a business, which is probably one of the questions I get most frequently from entrepreneurs, was like, well, you say I should be focusing on stuff, but you have all these businesses and the answer is yes.
2:26
And part of that is because I made mistakes and I'm hopefully hoping that you don't have to make the same ones that I did coming up, which is I was CEO of one company and then started a second company because I wasn't doing anything in my first company or wasn't going to plan on doing anything in my second company.
I was like I can be CEO of both terrible mistake and I it.
2:42
It cost me dearly in time and stress and all the other things that go along with that.
But being CEO is a full time role And so unless you are truly the owner of a company and not the CEO, then that company still needs you and it means it's a not sellable or sellable for much less because it's still dependent on you as the owner.
3:02
And I remember I used to poo poo this when I was, you know, earlier on in starting my career I was like when people, I would hear gurus say like and maybe it's because I didn't know how to do it, but they were like, you know, if a business can't run without you, it's not a real business.
Well, I don't think it's not a real business.
I think that you are not an owner if it cannot run without you or you're an owner, but you're also ACEO of the company.
3:22
And so for me, understanding the difference between CEO and owner was really important because I didn't even have any examples of that, right.
It was only when I started looking at the investor or the wealth world that I understand the difference between those two things.
And so as a as an easy example, like if you look at Warren Buffett, he doesn't run sees candy, he owns sees candies, right.
3:40
He doesn't run GEICO.
He owns GEICO and he doesn't own, you know, Ben Bridges, Jewelers or whatever.
It is like he owns it.
He doesn't run it.
And so if you think about that within the context of, you know, your businesses, it's like, is there a way that this business could not only maintain but also grow without my involvement whatsoever so that I could function the same way I do in the stock market as somebody who's in it, who owns equity in this company that it grows without me.
4:06
Now let me explain how my role works now because I have been able to structure my my life so that I actually treat all portfolio companies the same.
So despite the fact that I have 100% ownership in three of them and I have you know, minority stakes in the other five, I still structure my engagements with them the same way.
4:24
So I'm still meeting quarterly with those, those companies and their leadership teams and I have you know, meetings as needed with them throughout.
And one of the important pieces is that I am nose in, hands out.
And so you can write that one down like Neho and I got that from a mentor of mine nose in, hands out.
4:41
Which means that when we have a meeting or we have a, you know a long talk or we want to talk about something strategic.
I don't walk away from the meeting with with with homework.
I don't walk away with to do's all right.
And that is a purposeful effort by design because if I had to walk away with to do's from all these companies, then I would I would never be able to get anything done right.
4:58
And so I go into there as a strategic advisor.
I'm there to offer my experience, but I'm not there to lead the meeting.
I'm there to bounce ideas off of quick wise.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the word so we can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
5:23
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review by taking 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
That means the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
And the way to make that transition is that you have to build it without intention.
5:42
So as I've now built businesses later in my career compared to earlier in my career, my earlier businesses, I built in dependency on myself because I had those interpersonal needs and I also didn't know any better.
And so this is one of the downsides of having a personality based brand compared to a business that's faceless, that's really just a brand in and of itself that's outside of the entrepreneurial owner who started it, right?
6:01
Sees candies is not about Warren Buffett, GEICO is not about Warren Buffett.
They have a gecko, right, and that's the, the mascot.
And so as I've transitioned through this, I can tell you that now finally I would say I'm in a position where I actually am an owner and it's awesome, it's great.
These companies pump out cash flow and I can allocate that cash flow accordingly and and you know buy percentage of other companies I can get in real estate, all these other things.
6:22
But it comes from literally being able to do that which means that I either have to bring someone up to operate as CEO.
So right now your business does not have a CEO and you say that you are passive in it.
I would probably challenge you on that and say that's not true, right.
The company has to be able to grow and innovate without you.
6:41
If it can do that then it passes my test of ownership, right.
And so I, I, I like to have a certain amount of involvement which I just said like quarterly and you know, touch points and things like that.
But beyond those things, the business must be able to operate and grow on its own.
6:56
And a test that I have is that in a six month period after I leave and I put someone else in charge, does the company grow during that period of time, not only maintain but grow in both toppling and profit unless there was, you know, some reason they wanted to make some sort of capital investment or whatever.
But for the most part, you know, you can use your own common sense there.
7:13
But that is my litmus test is 6 months.
So if I put someone new in and I give them six months, does the company grow without my involvement switching to this communication cadence.
And I think one of the hardest and most significant things that you can do to really remove yourself from that is if you have any sort of central communication for the company.
7:31
So if you have Slack or Asana or someplace that you that you are, you know integrally involved, you see everything.
If you can remove yourself from that.
If you can get off of the company Slack, if you can get off of the company Asana, so that no one can have contact with you and you can start a separate communication center, which is what we have done with our portfolio is that we just have one Slack that has all of the executives from each of those portfolio companies.
7:53
So they are the only ones who have direct access to us and their teams have access to them directly.
And that is how we can have far more leverage with the skill sets that we have given the opportunity to the marketplace.
And so the important point here that I want to make is that independent of whether you plan on selling or you plan on keeping your company structuring your company so that you can sell, it will ultimately give you the freedom that you want.
8:14
And this was something that I did not do early on in my career.
And it's taken me years, I mean now over a decade to get to this point.
And I can tell you, I don't think I'll ever build another company again the way I used to.
And I think part of that comes with skill sets, part of that comes with beliefs.
Part of that is character traits that you develop over time.
8:29
But hopefully we can fast track that, which is why I'm making these for you.
So I hope to find that valuable if it was for you.
I'm trying to help entrepreneurs who are trying to scale their companies and just kind of show you the lessons that I've learned along the way.
The, the key point is ownership is the goal, not CEO ship.
8:46
And if we can act as owners, I think we make better long term decisions.
You are far less stressed about the short term nuances in the business because you have a much more long term outlook.
And ultimately I think it actually better serves the business in the long run in terms of the value that it creates for its customers.
9:02
So and honestly the the value that the business creates for you in your life, which I think most of us wanted freedom and it takes a long time to get here.

The ocean between good work and great work is vast.
It's 5 * 10 times the work to go from something good to something great, which is why you have to be really selective about the few things you choose to do that are worth doing, and in being worth doing, worth doing well.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:23
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk, and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy 13 lessons I learned after graduating college from the real world that I wish I had learned earlier.
0:39
The 1st is that you make better decisions and you learn more by assuming that you're Dumber than everyone else.
And the reason this was something that took me a long time to learn is that when I was in college, it was all about showing how smart you were.
It was about talking more in the group meetings.
It's about raising your hand more in the classroom and proving how smart you were in every way that you possibly could.
1:01
And so I took that and started translating in the real world.
And I realized that I didn't learn very much because I was the one talking all the time.
And it only took a few times of me getting introduced to somebody, because I wish I could just tell you it was once, but it wasn't.
Or I get interested to someone, Someone would introduce us, and I would basically spend the whole time blabbering on about how great I was and how much I knew, only to find out later that this person was way above me in business and whatever things that I was pursuing at the time.
1:29
And then I felt tons of shame and embarrassment about how stupid I was for doing that.
And so I had to shift the way that I talked to new people and the way that I entered rooms.
And I'll be real.
I still talked probably too much, but at least being aware of that lesson as early as I as it could.
1:45
I wish I had learned it earlier.
But fundamentally, you can't learn if you're talking obvious this is it.
And so if you're trying to learn, then not talking is the first requisite for doing that.
And if you want to make better decisions, then you need to learn.
And so if you talk less and listen more, which is why this is somewhat of a platitude, it's easy to understand and hard to do.
2:06
And tactically, when you were in situations when you're meeting new people, this was a big epiphany I had was that I got introduced once to somebody and I was walking peripherally after I'd left.
And somebody else went up to them and was like, do you know who that guy is?
2:25
And in that moment, I realized that my positioning was now sky high because I didn't have to be the one to say it.
And so the idea that I realized was, how can I get other people to edify me?
Because what I had to allow people to do was to make the same mistake that I used to make, which is that someone young, someone inexperienced, someone less aware, whatever, would come up and then start posturing themselves and blathering on about everything that they're doing.
2:49
And me.
I might be way ahead of them, but I would listen and see if there's anything interesting.
And so on that conversation, I learned more than they did.
I learned what type of person they are.
I learned where they're at with their career.
If they had anything interesting that would be worth, you know, following up with, they learned nothing.
3:07
They felt good about themselves and then later would feel bad about themselves when that other person went over and told them.
And so I was like, of these two scenarios, which would I rather do?
Would I rather have someone have a conversation with me and then not know who I was and then never know who I was but be able to learn?
3:25
Because that's the that's the worst case scenario, right?
Or would I rather blather on, learn nothing, and either either I am above them and then they're like, well fuck that guy he brags, or I'm below them and I'm the moron.
So those are the only two alternatives in the scenario where you blather on about yourself and try and position and try and sound smart.
3:45
So I stopped doing that because the scenarios of me not saying as much and listening more, I got.
I learned more and if the person found out who I was later, I was positioned and if they never did, I still just learned.
So those are the upsides and downsides versus both, and that shifted my behavior.
4:03
So that was lesson #1.
Lesson #2 was that the hardest respect to earn is one's own.
And So what I realized, and this was something that was really hard for me, is that I had a pretty bad reputation in the very beginning of my college career and all of my high school career.
And it was because I drank too much.
I was irresponsible.
I had slept around a lot.
4:19
And it just ultimately, I wasn't representing the type person that I wanted to be.
And so I felt ashamed of the behaviors that I did, but I didn't change them, right.
And so it was only through a conversation I had with my father where I said, how do I change my reputation?
How do I get these people to stop saying this stuff?
And I thought there was some, like, PR marketing angle that I could take, that I could control the narrative.
4:40
And he said, why don't you stop being a piece of shit?
And he said that in his own, you know, in his own words.
And I was like, that can't be it.
I'll figure out a way.
But only, you know, as when parents talk to kids, they're listening, but they're not listening.
That really stuck with me.
And I started thinking about it.
And so I said, like, well, if I wanted to be somebody who was respectable, what would I do?
4:58
And so then I tried to start acting in that way, to be someone whose respect my own I would earn.
And so when I started doing that, nothing changed externally.
People still treated me like I was a piece of shit, and they were probably right.
But my behavior began to change.
And then, slowly, so did my reputation.
5:15
But it started with me trying to respect myself 1st, and then others begin to respect me as a result.
And so that was a huge shift that happened for me that I wish I had learned earlier.
If you want to control people, think.
Control what they say.
This is the third lesson I learned, and this is more of a business slash marketing lesson.
5:32
But if you want to talk about products and services, you have to equip people with the words to describe what you have, because otherwise you're asking them to solve the problem of how to describe your business.
And if right now you can't even figure out how you're going to describe your business and you own the darn thing, how do you expect them to do it in a half second when they're telling their friend?
5:49
And so this is really about giving equipping people with simple language so they can communicate what you do.
So for example at acquisition.com like this happens all the time stuff, so I just want to be really real with you.
The mission when I started the business was to document and share the best practice of building world class companies.
I have now realized that most people don't know what that means and so I have now and we probably will shift the language to to make real business education available to everyone.
6:12
They functionally mean the same thing.
But giving people the words to describe it in a way that they understand allows me to give them words that they can explain to somebody else.
It's like, what's out, you know, what's that guy Alex Rosie do?
Or what's, what's acquisition.com.
It's like, oh, they're just trying to make real business education for everybody.
Like, it's easy to remember, but document, share the best practice, build a world, a class company.
6:29
It's too hard.
Like, what's best practices?
What's documenting?
Like there's all these things that people don't conceptualize that sound like sound bites and words but people can't describe.
And so when I stopped trying to sound smart and try to get my prospects to feel smart is when things change.
And I've seen that that pattern happened over and over and over again, which when I came out of college, all I did was want to sound smart rather than have my prospects and the people I was listening to feel smart.
6:52
Number 4, you get more out of reading one book that's great five times than out of reading 5 mediocre books.
And so I don't read many books.
And what I mean by that is I buy lots of books, I skim most of them and quickly realize that it's not worth reading.
7:08
And so then I tossed them aside because just because someone wrote a book doesn't mean you need to finish.
It has nothing to do with you.
It means that they didn't organize it well.
So there you go.
But every once in a while you do get a book.
And I have found that books that are older in general tend to be better because the reason the person wrote it was a different intention.
They wrote it because they wanted to transmit knowledge to the next generation.
7:25
Whereas the people who write books now are either writing for money, writing for notoriety, or writing them to sell other shit, right?
And that's the vast majority of books.
So if you find books where the author is actually writing because they want to convey knowledge to the next generation, those tend to be better books in my experience, because the intent is to actually teach, not to persuade.
7:42
No slight difference.
So when you do find those gems, I have realized that if I read something once end to end, I still don't know it yet.
And so I will read a book 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 times until I can teach the book when I feel like it is worth learning.
8:00
And then once I have like squeezed the book for everything that it has to the point where I can convey the message to somebody else.
Like I can teach the concepts of the book, which is something that I've done many times.
I'll actually make a presentation on the book so that I can wrap my own frameworks around how I can remember it.
That's where a lot of these frameworks come from, is because it's me trying to make sense of the world in a way that I can remember, because otherwise I read stuff and then I would just discard them.
8:20
And it's it's just like a waste of time where if you if your behavior doesn't change as a result of reading a book and it means you've learned nothing, which means it was a waste of time.
And many people who read books are just wasting their time because their behavior doesn't change.
And so I consolidate.
Once I find something that's good, I plug everything I possibly can into it and suck the juice out of it so that I can change my behavior as a result, which comes from the frameworks and how I think about it.
8:43
So I read one thing that's very good many times rather than trying to brag about the fact that I read a book a week because I'm like, what was the book last week?
Not that good that it wasn't worth rereading, right?
That's how my thinking had changed when I was younger.
It was all about like, how many books can you read?
It was like a contest.
It's like a pissing contest.
Instead, it's like, how deeply do you understand the knowledge of the book?
9:00
Because if you just did how to make friends and influence people and you put it into your DNA, you would be successful, right?
There's many.
There's a handful of books that if you just did them for the rest of your life, you would win.
And so rather than read another book that's on the airport bookshelf that was just well marketed, that's a crap product from a ghost writer.
9:16
Instead of that, you can just read the few, The other times classics written by the author to convey a message to the Next Generation #5 is that most champions do not have something that you do not.
They lack something that you have.
And so it's a different thought process because if all of us have the exact same hours per day, it means that they're allocating their time differently.
9:34
And many times they eliminate things that you are still doing.
They have sacrificed more, they've given up things that you have continued to have on your tree as branches that are distracting from growing up, right.
And so many times champions, when I look at the the people who are further ahead of me, they're even more ruthless with their time.
9:51
They even have lower tolerance for friends, family, people around them that are not at the bar that they hold themselves to.
And for me, going through college or, you know, when I was younger, I always thought it was about adding to your plate, saying yes to everything, saying yes to opportunity, say yes, say yes, yes.
10:07
When all I did was I just completely got distracted and spread super thin.
And So what most champions have is singular focus and they're willing to say no to everything else.
And that for me took me too long to learn. 6 is that goodwill compounds faster than money.
10:24
And the reason for that is like, if you actually think about what goodwill is, it's that you have positive sentiment and you have a degree of influence over a person's behavior.
That's what goodwill is.
And so if one person has goodwill with you and then shares your stuff with somebody else, and you create goodwill in that next person, you can double your goodwill or 10X your goodwill in a matter of 12 weeks. 10X ING your money in a matter of 12 weeks is very, very unlikely.
10:50
And so goodwill, because it's based on audiences and humans, can compound significantly faster than money can.
And when I realized that that goodwill could be translated into money if I so desired at a future date, then I realized.
And rather than focusing on the money that I'm trying to make today, why don't I focus on the compounding vehicle that compounds at a much faster rate than money does.
11:08
That compounds tax free, by the way.
Building the audience is tax free.
And then when you choose to have the conversion event, you can do that at your own choosing.
But if you focus on the audience, you focus on the goodwill, that will grow significantly faster than any kind of monetary move.
But you can still translate that later into money when you want.
11:24
That was a big epiphany for me.
I thought it was all about the money when I was coming up. 7 is that you're going to die, and two weeks after you die, most people have forgotten about you, and six months after you die, no one will talk about you.
And if they're not caring enough, then, then it certainly doesn't matter what they think about your life now.
11:43
Because if that's the most significant event that's going to happen in your life, which is that you stop living, then how much credibility or weight should we give to other people's opinions on what we should do with our lives?
In my opinion, very little.
And so unless the person has a vested interest in seeing you succeed comma and the context to provide the advice most of the times it's just worth ignoring.
12:05
Because they're trying to live their own life and they're projecting their own beliefs and experiences on you.
And you spent all this time trying to improve your own view of reality to the beliefs that you've you've shed and shifted that they have not.
And So what they believe to be true is what they're casting on to you.
And if you don't like the life they have and I don't think it's worth listening to 8.
12:24
Extraordinary accomplishments come from doing ordinary things for extraordinary periods of time.
This is just me speaking about me.
But when I was younger my actions showed that I was more impatient.
I always was willing to sacrifice what I had today to get the quick buck.
I, you know, I was always, I was shifty like that because I just thought that that was how it worked.
12:42
I thought there was some shortcut I didn't know about.
And I would see the guys on stages being like this is what we do.
We do the basics.
We do a lot of it.
I was like, they're just trying to hold the secrets back.
And I'm here to tell you that that is not true.
Like, I wish I could go and shake my college self and be like, if you do one thing for a very long period of time, you will get very good at it and it will compound onto itself.
13:02
And maybe I would listen to me if, I mean if future self showed up in my living room now, I would totally listen to him.
But you know what I mean.
And so I can't do that.
So the next best thing I can do is try and shake you by the collar and say that if you like, the thing that makes the action extraordinary is the commitment to it, not the nature of the action itself.
13:20
Working out and doing reps is not extraordinary.
If you saw one set of a workout for me at the gym, you wouldn't think, oh, this guy is amazing.
It's the fact that you do it for 20 straight years that what is what compounds on itself.
If you listen to one guy make one phone call, you listen to one Major League Baseball player, one at bat, Nothing about that is extraordinary.
13:40
It's the dedication to doing it over and over and over and over again, despite feeling like there's better opportunities, despite people approaching you with new and exciting things.
But saying that you're committed to the original vision you had and that reality has not changed in such a way that you believe that your need to believes are no longer true.
13:56
You said I believe that XY and Z is true, and as long as that remains to be true, that I will continue on this path for an extraordinary period of time and that not the action itself, but your commitment to the action is what makes someone extraordinary, not the thing itself.
None.
If it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.
This is a really great small saying that like I, I, I shortcutted so much stuff when I was younger.
14:20
I just wanted to, like get it done, get it done, get it done rather than doing it well.
And there's kind of two ways you can take the saying, which is why I like it so much, is that if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.
Because many times I was doing things that were not worth doing and so I didn't have the time to do things well.
14:36
Because I was doing so many things that were not worth doing.
And so the first criteria is what problem are we solving?
What am I hoping to accomplish?
Is this worth doing at all?
Because if it is worth doing, then I have to understand that to do it comma right, to do it well, it's going to take this much time.
14:54
Now given that, is it still worth doing?
And if it passes that test of a being worth doing in the long haul, and because it is worth doing, worth doing, well, then it gives us this lens through rich to see the activities we do so that we can prioritize the things that will make us the most money or get us closer to the goals we have.
15:11
Right.
And so for me, I spent so much of my energy.
Fun fact, when you're younger, you have more energy than when you're older.
So whatever your energy is now, it's literally the highest it's ever going to be from this point going forward.
Kind of kind of crazy to think about.
And so younger me had more energy than me does now.
I make way more money than younger me did.
It's because I do fewer things and I do different things than I did then and now.
15:33
If I write a book, I'll take a year on writing the book because if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.
Because I understand that taking one year today will mean that that book might sit and sell and distribute itself to millions of people over the next 50 years or 100 years or after I'm dead compared to me just putting words on a page that are pretty good and then shipping it.
15:53
And I think the vast majority of people don't get the difference between good and great.
The ocean between good work and great work is vast.
It's 5 * 10 times the work to go from something good to something great, and I did not get that.
Which is why you have to be really selective about the few things you choose to do that are worth doing, and in being worth doing, worth doing.
16:14
Well, real quick, guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
16:30
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do, that would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur. 10.
Be willing to negotiate everything except for your values.
16:47
And so there were so many things when I was coming up that like that, you know, in college, even right after colleges jobs.
Like I always just took things at face value.
So prices, terms, relationships, everything I took at face value.
17:03
So whatever someone presented, I said yes or no to.
Right.
Very straightforward.
I have now realized that virtually everything is negotiable, right?
Because people present with basically their best bad guess and they're hoping that someone takes them by the hand and says, you know, that makes no sense.
17:19
What if we did it this way?
What problem are you solving?
What problem am I solving?
And then having the ability to clearly communicate someone ask the right questions to get someone else's true desires and wants.
And then knowing what your own true desires and wants and what you're willing to give up allows you to make better deals.
And so I used to think of negotiating as a 0 sum game, and it's not at all.
17:38
You can find a way where both parties get better than they were before, which is the entire point, right?
Like that is how negotiating works if you're doing it well.
And so I didn't understand that.
I thought everything was an armrest, so I thought everything was like this for that tit for tat, like no give.
And I also thought really short about it.
17:54
I was like I was trying to get one over.
I was ruthless with vendors, you know what I mean?
Just like all of that kind of stuff as like, I swung the other direction.
So first I didn't negotiate anything and then I found out you could negotiate and then tried to get everyone to give me their last last penny.
But then I realized that this long term doesn't create good relationships and they will not be loyal to you at all, which long term has a more negative impact than giving them the extra 10% and having an amicable relationship, right?
18:19
And so I found kind of like my middle ground of you want to negotiate everything except for your values.
Because The thing is, if you really think about it, I negotiated everything in that second example including my values because I was doing business in a way that was contrary to the values that I wanted to espouse to wanted to to embody, right.
18:38
And so now in like because the deals we do with acquisitions not come, for example like I could probably ask for significantly more than I do.
And I've had many times where people like I want to give you this and I'm like I don't want that because I don't think you know what that means.
And so this is what I think is fair today and in 10 years.
18:55
And so it's balancing both your need today, your need in 10 years and their need today and their need in 10 years.
And you have those four points and you try and find the closest point given your reality and you can explain that this is how you're thinking through it with them.
19:10
And I think they will appreciate all four data points on the map to come to the best solution for today and tomorrow, 11.
Humility.
This is a big one because I want to.
I want to be a different voice on this because I've heard all over the Internet recently people saying humility is stupid.
19:26
If you looked up what the word means, you wouldn't want to be it because if you look it up on Google it says thinking less of oneself.
All right, This is why looking and defining terms is important, because if you look at Merriam Webster for example, its lack of pride or arrogance, I don't think people would say you wouldn't want that.
I was like, no, I think I think people are OK not being prideful or arrogant, I think that's OK, but even more so.
19:46
And the definition that I have taken on is actually the exact opposite of that, which is it is not decreasing your regard for self, but increasing your regard for others.
That's from Clayton Christensen, who was a Harvard professor goat of a human.
I thought that posturing when I was younger was the thing that would get people to like me.
20:04
But what I realized later was that you gain status by giving more to the group than you get.
And so this is especially true for guys.
It's probably true for girls, but I can't speak to that.
But in a group, especially an all male group, if you want to gain status the way you do it is by sacrificing more for the group than everyone else does.
20:22
If you want to gain status in a company, you give more to the company than anyone else does more than the company gives you back.
Because what do they do?
They reward that behavior.
The group rewards the person who gives to the group.
It's how it works.
The people who take from the group and only want to get status, they only go in to get status from the group end up getting banished by the group and batted down because everyone wants to keep that person out because they don't serve anyone else.
20:45
And so it was only by realizing that I had to give my life in order to get it.
I had to give status.
I had to serve because when you serve someone, you're giving them status.
You're increasing your regard for others.
When I gave status, I got it back.
When I gave respect first I would get respect back rather than demanding respect at the onset, because then they wanted to disrespect me to level where I was at.
21:09
Whereas if I raised them up, they would raise Mia.
And it was understanding that group dynamic, which is what made me president of the fraternity that I was in.
It made like all of these things started compounding when I realized that truth is that humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking more about other people and increasing your regard for their needs.
21:28
And if you do that, I promise you, you will have all the status you want. 12 The happy man has 1000 wishes.
The sad man has one.
This is a little bit more of a heartfelt one for me, because when I was younger, I was definitely angrier, probably darker in general.
21:44
And a lot of that came because I had expectations that were fictitious, real or otherwise, from other people in my mind that existed, who were constantly judging the behaviors and actions I was doing every day and were telling me that I was not enough.
And so in some ways that created and reinforced behaviors that I still continue this day in terms of the actions I take, but the way that I feel and think about them has shifted.
22:07
And so when you are sad, you want to not be sad.
That's the main focus.
You want to feel better.
And many times people will take the short term way of getting out of that, which is alcohol, drugs, etcetera, because in the moment they can feel better.
22:22
They just want to feel better.
And I remember I had a coach who said that to me, she said everyone just wants to feel better.
And so when I think about things that I used to think people were wronging me right and I'll get all angry and I spit myself out, I use a different frame now, which is they just wanted to feel better, do you think?
22:39
It had nothing to do with me and they just wanted to feel better about themselves.
And that's given me a lot of peace about many of the things that used to anger me.
And so I think that, at least for me, being able to quiet the hundreds of non existent voices in my head that were constantly judging the activities that I was doing and labeling them good or bad or good enough or not good enough, etcetera, took up a tremendous amount of my attention.
23:02
And because of that, all of my focus was on feeling better.
And so I couldn't actually have any energy leftover to do stuff because all I was focused on was feeling better and all I was spending all my day was in my head trying to not feel like shit right and doing both short and long term things to do that.
23:18
And so it was only when I came up with the mantra, which I have said before, but fuck happiness.
Which sounds ironic, because I said the person with 1000 who who's happy as 1000 wishes.
But in choosing not to admit the deficiency between my current state and the future state of what I desire to be, I was able to accept where I was.
23:37
And then the deficiency of not being good enough, not being happy enough, disintegrated in my mind.
And then I was able to focus on just doing things.
And then when I started doing things, I started making progress.
When I started making progress, I started looking back and feeling proud of how far I'd come, because it wasn't about the many voices outside.
23:55
It was about the only one that mattered.
And so that shift is what I think genuinely from a spiritual standpoint, is the thing that was able to give me the strength to do some of the things we have done.
I'm not saying that we've done is amazing.
We'll hopefully live a long time, do epic shit.
But I wouldn't have been able to ever start on this path because I was paralyzed for years, because I was paralyzed about what I thought other people were to think about me, only to realize that they weren't thinking about me at all. 13 Failure leads to learning.
24:24
Learning leads to success.
Success leads to complacency.
Complacency leads to failure.
And so a lot of times I remember you thinking that like there was a destination.
But I think the actual entrepreneurial cycle is it's it's I'm already giving it away.
It's not a destination.
It's not linear.
24:39
It's cyclical.
And so that's why I talk about entrepreneurship in terms of seasons, because there are cycles where you learn a lot, right?
And I used to say this a lot where I'd say either the business is growing or I am.
So either I have learned lessons and I am applying those lessons, the business and the business is growing, or the business is not growing and has problems.
24:57
And now I am the one receiving the lessons from the business.
And until I learn the lesson that I'm supposed to learn, the business will cease to grow until I have learned this lesson, until I beat this boss at this level.
Right.
And the difference between video games in real life is that sometimes in order to beat that boss, you're not, you're not doing it in 10 minutes.
25:13
It might take you 10 years.
And that's there's an entrepreneurship and a video game, and so recognizing that you were not above the cycle, but that that cycle is inevitable because you have failure, learning, success, complacency.
The goal is, if you can identify that, how quickly can you get back to learning success, learning success, and try and skip the complacency step altogether.
25:34
It still happens to a degree, but if you can recognize that, at least at least for me, seeing when it's when I can start feeling the feelings and it's rearing its head.
I'm aware of it and it allows me to speed through it faster and to the same degree.
I stopped labeling things as good or bad because if I'm failing it means I'm about to go through learning and I see learning as good.
25:51
And on the flip side, if I'm succeeding, I succeeding is good and so either way they lead to my success.
And framing it that way took a lot of the judgement and the label and the depression around not achievement away from me.
And also when things are good, it allowed me to not be so high on my supply because I knew that whenever things were good, everything is good, is followed by something that is not as good.
26:15
And so you always have regression to the mean, right?
You have regression to the mean.
And so things are amazing that it means they can only go down from here.
If things are terrible, it means it can only go up.
And so having that thought process, at least to recognize patterns over and over again that happened in my entrepreneurial career have given me a lot more peace about the journey.
Overall, 14 is that I would pay any amount of money to make obvious truths real for me.
26:36
And I remember when I was when I was starting out, I It's so funny.
I went to Bally's gym right after I graduated college and the membership there was $29.00 a month.
And I remember I almost spit out my gum when they told me it was $29.00 a month because I thought it was so expensive.
26:53
It was so crazy that someone would dare ask for money.
I I expected to be able to be left.
I was like fitness is a right, like I was such a piece of shit.
And so there is a reality that no one can see right now, true reality, and no one can see it because we are shaped by the many things that we've been told throughout our lives, and many of those things were not true.
27:17
And so much of the path of entrepreneurship, in my opinion, is shedding these these false truths so that you can see the world more clearly.
If you see these business people who are super far ahead and all of a sudden it's like they can lose it and then they can get it all back in and things seem so seamless for them.
27:32
It's because they have a more accurate view of reality than you do.
And so imagine trying to hit a hit a target with a blindfold on.
You're just going to keep missing and keep missing and keep missing.
Now imagine there's a guy next to you who's got a blindfold on too, but it's clear and he's just nailing it.
27:49
You're like, what the hell?
I'm doing the same thing with my wrist.
I've got all this technique down.
It's simply because he sees the target and he sees all the environment around it more clearly than you do.
And for me, the whole concept of ignorance tax and ignorance debt has been one that I've taken with me for life.
28:07
And I actually heard this.
A speaker said this on stage and he was actually using it as a close for the audience.
But it's like I just thought it just it changed my life.
So I'll probably add that to the other video.
He said how much is not making $1,000,000 a year costing you?
He's like, well if you make $50,000 a year right now, said it cost you $950,000 a year to not know how to make $1,000,000.
28:30
And I thought about that and I was like, shit.
So right now the concept of paying down the ignorance tax, paying down the debt service that we are all paying to reality, right?
We are paying a debt service to a false reality in order to get the real one.
28:46
And so for me, I will pay any amount of money to speed that process up, to see the world more clearly in a way that is true.
And if the views that I have do not serve me and someone else is further ahead of me in the game, then they are better at the game of business than me in some way.
29:02
And in that way I can learn of them.
Doesn't matter what they're doing.
Some people were like, oh, this guy's unethical, this guy's, you can learn from everyone.
If they're making more money than you, you can learn from them.
And so taking that and taking my ego hat off, right, Taking my ego hat off and saying like, I'm the student here, This guy's better in some way.
29:21
What does he believe to be true about the world?
I don't.
Or what do I believe to be true that isn't.
And simply trying to observe to see those realities is something that I will always pay for.
And so that's why I pay.
I mean, I made a video about conversations that have changed my life.
29:37
Eight of the 10 conversations that I that I did to change my life, I paid for eight of the 10.
So I know that there's plenty of really successful business people who just, you know, they network and they do whatever.
I didn't do that.
I paid for access to everything because I didn't know and I didn't know anybody who did know.
29:54
And so just observing them and having them speak into my lives.
And it wasn't always direct, sometimes just indirect.
You're just watching what someone's doing and saying they're doing something different than me.
I don't believe that what they're doing makes sense, but they're making more and more money than me.
So maybe they're right and I'm wrong and consistently trying to speed up that process.
30:11
Because right now I know if I went back in time just with the views of the world that I have compared to what I had, then, I could recreate what I have now in two years.
And so thinking about my future self, if it could take me 30 years to learn the lesson, because I'm going to learn the lesson either way.
30:28
I'm either going to pay in time or going to pay in money.
I'd rather pay in money and drag my future closer to the present, because then I get to get to that future and drag another future to the present and shortcut it.
And so I will always pay any money for an obvious truth to be really real for me, because for me it wasn't obvious.








0:00
These are 17 conversations, maybe millions, in my 20s.
Number one, I was going back and forth between quitting my job and starting a gym or starting my entrepreneurial journey.
Another early mentor, he sat me down and said, man, I've been listening to you waffle for months now, he said.
At some point you're not going to know anymore, you just have to jump.
0:16
He said it in a way that made me feel like a Pansy.
I realized I didn't need more information.
I'd already done all of the research.
I just needed to decide.
The definition of decision comes from the Latin D cadera, which basically means to cut off or kill off.
Question was, which future was I deciding to kill off?
Was it the future that I was in currently that I didn't like anymore?
0:32
Or is it the future that I had the potential to accomplish the dreams that I had by not deciding I was actively killing off the future that had my dreams and then I needed to choose which one I wanted to kill #2 Very beginning of entrepreneurial journey.
I didn't know how to sell anything and a mentor just said, do you want to know the secret to sales?
I leaned in.
I was like, yes, please, I like had my notepad out and he said the secret to sales is making an offer so good people feel stupid saying no.
0:52
And that obviously became the subtitle of my $100 million offers book.
I kept thinking that I had to learn how to like, learn how to manipulate going through sales scripts and rapport and shirts.
Some of those skills are useful to have when it's so much easier to just find things that people really want.
Chick-fil-A doesn't need to sell you on chicken sandwiches, they just have amazing chicken sandwiches and people go buy them.
1:09
And that forever changed how I created new products, created new services was I started with how do I get the most people to say yes?
And then worked backwards #3 My next mentors was a $10 billion COO.
He always said you got to go slow to go fast.
He kept repeating it to me over and over and over again.
You only unlock the compounding, which later on grows significantly faster than the erratic activity of small thing here, small thing here, new thing here, new thing here, then just doing the same thing for an extended period of time.
1:34
And So what feels slow in the micro looks fast in the macro when you look at the trajectory over a long period of time.
But what looks really fast in the micro is usually really slow in the macro because people can never get that compounding start harnessing because they're always starting back over at Ground Zero.
Whenever you change something, the one cost is guaranteed is that change will have to get paid for, and what isn't guaranteed is that it's going to work.
1:53
You know you have this fixed cost, which is how you should see it is that whenever you change something you have to pay a price #4.
The next lesson I learned was in level of effort.
One of my early mentors told me about Flyers.
I thought I needed to go put a lot of Flyers out to get business, put out 300 Flyers.
So I called the mentor back up and I was like, hey, this didn't work.
And he's like, you know, what was your test size?
2:08
What do you mean by test size?
And I just put out 300 total.
He just laughed. 300 like, you're not going to do anything with 300.
He's like, we test with 5000, then we do 5000 a day after that, 5000 a day, 150,000 Flyers a month.
I might have been doing the right thing all along, but I was just doing far too little of it.
And at that point, I decided that whenever someone gave me advice, I wouldn't let the volume of activity to be the reason it failed.
2:26
But I just hadn't done enough of them or hadn't done them long enough.
I see so many small, younger entrepreneurs who do something for too short, too little time, not enough volume, that they might have been doing the right thing, They just didn't wait long enough or they didn't do enough of it. #5 I was at actually a mastermind, and I saw a guy get up and he seemed so disorganized And he said, yeah, you know, we're making three or $400,000 a month.
2:46
It's like we've been stuck here for a few years.
Leila and I were actually together at this point.
We both looked at each other and we're like, if this guy can do it, we can do it.
It was one of those moments that beliefs are broken because what you find out is that they are made of the same thing as you rather than right off.
This guy.
Such an idiot.
This.
Despite him being an idiot, he's still more successful than me.
3:02
Imagine if I used my work ethic and my intelligence.
And when I shifted my perspective from that way, I was able to start using other people's successes to fuel me rather than to make me feel bad.
It switched from wanting to cast stones at people to being inspired by them and thinking if they can do it, so can I.
Within six months of seeing that conversation happen, we were already doing a million a month.
3:19
There were six at a different event.
I went up and I spoke and I told my whole plans of how I wanted to build this national gym chain be America's next gym, The guy who ran the Masterm said.
You know what, Alex?
I don't think he should do that at all.
I was crushed and he said I think you have a level 10 skill set and a level 2 opportunity, one of those simultaneously incredibly encouraging things and incredibly heartbreaking things.
3:37
So it was a very like emotional moment for me.
He was both encouraging me to say that I could have been doing more and this person from the outside put a bar up that was significantly higher than what I was shooting for.
And that stretched my horizon for what I was capable of.
And I think getting around people who can do that for you is one of the most valuable things you could possibly have in your life.
3:54
What he didn't say was a Level 2 opportunity as he was defining it, an opportunity that has low leverage.
There wasn't a very compounding vehicle for capital.
The fact that I was successful in what most consider a shitty opportunity he saw as the skill sets that would create a much bigger win later.
If you are in a lower level opportunity, I wouldn't say be upset about it.
4:11
I'd say you're learning with extra resistance against you.
You're getting stronger now and then when you go onto the moon where gravity is lighter, you just not get out of the park #7.
It was a private event.
It was 10 people.
Everyone was doing 8 figures or more a year and I got invited.
The guy came up to me and this guy had done $27 million in a single day.
Holy shit, this guy's made more in a day than I made my entire life, he said.
4:29
That pitch in life don't come very often.
When it gets easy is when you need to go hard.
Otherwise, there's someone who's 10 times bigger than you, who's going to take everything you have and not even think twice about it.
That was literally fueled by that one conversation.
If you're like, wait, how are you doing 3 or 400,000 a month taking over three?
I'd like no employees.
And I was making it all myself.
4:44
You do have one of those opportunities that comes up in your life when things start working really well.
That's when a lot of people ease off the gas.
That's when they go easy.
When it gets easy is when you go hard because you don't have that many fat pitches in a lifetime.
You might get two or three and you just got to crack the shit out of it when it comes and expect that you're going to sacrifice some short term for some long term later #8, the same event, a different guy came up to me, he said you're skin like you're like doubling every month with this current thing.
5:08
Like why do you want to start a supplement business?
What if you just spent three times as much on marketing and didn't start a supplement business?
I didn't start the supplement business.
I actually delayed it for 18 months.
In the next three months, we tripled the ad spend and went from 400 to seven, 8780 to 1,000,000, from 1,000,000 to 2 million just the next six months because of that piece of advice.
5:26
And I think the underlying part of that advice is that when something is going well, oftentimes entrepreneurs think, great, I won, how can I get another win, but the real win is just doing 10 times more of that thing.
The hardest part is getting product market fit.
It's getting people to want to buy the thing.
Once you have that, you don't need to innovate that anymore.
5:42
All your innovation has to go through how can we do more?
Volume #9, The next lesson was from a guy who had a Big e-commerce brand.
So he was doing like 30 million a year at the time.
And I was like, Oh my God, this guy is God.
He gave this huge presentation that was like 2 hours long.
He said, So pick a percentage, whatever it is, 10 percent, 20% of your marketing spend and put that towards new ideas.
6:00
Expect to lose it.
But when you're losing it, you're gaining the lesson, you're gaining the experience.
And what happens is like, you know, four out of five times where crazy ideas fail, he's like, but one out of five, they crush and become the leading edge innovation that pushes us to the next level.
I immediately took a number and I wrote down what my new learning budget was going to be and it gave me permission to spend money without return immediately.
6:18
You think, big picture.
He just extended my time horizon for a return.
And so rather than saying I have to make my money back immediately within 30 days of me spending this, I said if I extend my horizon over my lifetime, if I spend this money, I will learn and be better and I will learn faster than somebody who doesn't.
I just gave myself a budget to say it is acceptable to lose this.
6:36
And then I committed to that.
And that was a huge pivot point for how we were able to scale and try new things.
And I look forward to spending on my learning budget every month.
And it just gave me permission to be creative, knowing that it would be OK to fail #10.
The next one I got from a pastor between Leila and I, he gave us a single piece of marriage advice that we have taken today.
6:54
We have used countless times in our lives, both in our marriage, personally and professionally in the business, he said.
If you don't agree, don't move forward.
It was such a simple piece of advice because we have always made our decisions together and if we don't agree, we slow down.
A lot of times we impose this false sense of urgency on ourselves.
When there's almost nothing that is urgent, like unless you're going to die, which is the only real urgency, then a lot of times taking an extra second to think, OK, is there something we're missing?
7:17
Is there a frame that we're not seeing If we don't agree, the first question we always ask is what information are you using?
Oftentimes one of us will have data that the other person doesn't because we have the same values and same mission.
We do ultimately come to the same decision That has saved me so many mistakes, #11 I went to a big half a billion dollar mastermind, said there was like 10 of us there and the total sales of everyone in the room was about half a billion dollars.
7:37
But I was still among the smaller ones.
I think we were doing 30 or $40 million a year at the time and plenty of guys there were at 100, you know, 200, etcetera.
What do they have?
Are they smarter?
Are they working hard?
Are they sacrificing more?
Like they had a bigger total addressable market, They had a bigger Tam.
They were going after just a much wider audience.
So you start small.
7:53
So the richest are in the niches, but at a certain point you do need to open up the aperture.
So like Facebook started with college, right?
That was the niche.
And then slowly spend it over time.
I had to open up my eyes and say, you know what, maybe I can go broader in some way, #12 This was one of the first billionaires that I ever met, had been stuck at 30 to 40 million for like 3 years.
8:09
So there was a lot of learning that I was trying to do in this period to break through that wall.
I was telling him all these things that I was doing to try and grow my business and he just laughed.
He said it's not about you, it's about everybody else.
And what he meant by that wasn't like me versus customers or anything like that.
He was like, all you've been telling me is what you're going to do.
You need to have a stable of stallions.
8:27
You need to give people a slice of the pie and let them get rich, too.
And up to that point, I had hoarded everything.
I was like, you know what got me from $100 million top line to $500 million top line?
Doing less and getting really smart people to help me out and giving them a big slice.
It's about talent.
It's about people.
8:42
You have to get other people who can make decisions on your behalf, and you feel not only that they were as good as your decisions, but even better because at the beginning you're Jack of all trades, master of none.
But you need to have mastery in every department of the business in order for it to scale.
And you can either see that as I have to learn everything or the faster way, which is I can go buy it through other people who've already given 10 years.
9:01
Or if I can get 10 people who've all spent 20 years in their respective departments, I basically have 200 years of experience.
And if every person in the organization has learned everything from you, then it's only one brain in one lifetime.
That is the limit of the organization.
That thing is what got us past the 30 to 40 million.
9:17
That was a huge breakthrough #13.
The next conversation I had was really the one that pushed me over the edge.
I have a famous friend.
I was at his house and we were sitting at the kitchen table and I said, don't you get tired of all these weirdos, like messaging you stuff and like sending you threats and like three people a week stopping by your house, like trying to climb your fence.
9:33
Like, isn't that like not fun?
He said.
If that's the price I have to pay to make the impact I want to have, then I would pay it every day of the week for whatever reason.
It just like, stabbed me in the heart and it made me feel like if I want to spread a message, if I want to help more people, that there's a cost to it.
Having now been a little bit the other side and having more recognition and whatnot, is that fame has pros and cons.
9:51
There are cons, but I believe that there are more pros than cons.
Are there things that are inconvenient now?
Absolutely.
You get stopped every time you go out to dinner.
Like, you get disrupted.
It's harder to be like private and public.
If you have a bad day, you can't do it because someone says hi and it's the one time they're going to see you.
There are things that are cons, but the pros outweigh the cons.
You get amazing people who will come and want to work with you.
10:08
You get amazing teammates who otherwise would never know you exist to.
You'll also have the same mission, have the same values and it creates significantly more alignment and real world value in terms of economic value, how much money you make by having people inbound coming towards you.
I used to talk shit about people make consoles like just, you know, do cold outreach and run ads like don't talk to me.
10:26
But now having been on the other side of it, I can tell you that it was mistaken #14 big influencer.
I said, hey, you're way further ahead of me, like, how do I just shortcut this thing?
And so he said, hey, you start making content on every platform.
So I did that.
And then I came back six months later and I said, hey, look, we went from zero to, you know, 200,000 people in our audience in six months.
And the progress.
10:42
But I was like, what's your blueprint?
What's the, what's the model?
Give me the flow chart.
He said, dude, we don't have a flow chart.
Anybody trying to tell you that is trying to sell you a system.
You just need to do so much more volume than you currently are.
And he said just pull up your Instagram and pull up my Instagram.
So I pulled it up, pulled his up.
He had posted five times.
I had posted once.
He's like, pull up your LinkedIn, pull up my LinkedIn.
10:58
He had posted seven times.
I had posted once, platform by platform.
He kept pulling one up and he was embarrassing me with the amount of content he was putting out compared to me.
So in the next six months, I put 10 times the content out and we grew 10 times faster.
The interesting lesson I learned from this is that there are principles that are ubiquitous.
11:14
The more work you do, the more you get.
So the boring work applies to everything in business, whether it's relationships, whether it's cold calling, whether it's making content.
The more you do, the more you get #15.
The next one was about investing.
I was actually a pretty big Pansy when it came to investing, and this was the breakthrough.
I had all this money and people were like, I've got this real estate deal, I've got this crypto thing.
11:33
When you have lots of money, well, it was not a problem, but I didn't have was like set of rules or parameters.
And you have to make those.
Otherwise you get too much decision fatigue.
You waste too much time doing diligence on deals, reading, having multiple phone calls, having lawyers come in and then deciding not to do it.
This one conversation I had changed my life.
He was telling somebody who had a lot of real estate experience.
11:49
If you were to put a circle on this table, what percentage of your brain knows real estate?
And he was like, I guess 85%.
OK, what percentage of your brain knows stocks and stuff?
He's like, oh, 10 or 15%.
He's like, that is your new capital allocation parameter. 85% of your net worth should be in real estate, 15% should be in stocks.
12:07
And it was so simple for me.
I know business and So what do I invest in now?
Only businesses only risk.
If you don't know what you're doing, I can write a 5 or $10 million check and be fine if I know if it's a business because I understand, I know what pitfalls are going to come up.
Like I get it.
Sticking with that just forever made my life simpler because now when deals come to us, I'm like, that's just not in my wheel and I can just immediately say that.
12:25
So the amount of time and effort and lawyer calls and conversations that that saved me has paid so many dividends and now are investing doing significantly better because it's what I know and I feel comfortable with it and I can move way faster #16 Leverage behind a product.
Naval has said you only sell because you know how to market, you only market because you don't know how to build a product.
12:41
An exceptional product is a quadratic relationship with your audience, marketing or good sales as a linear relationship.
If you make an exceptional product something that's so unbelievable that people cannot help themselves but tell other people about it, one person buys the product and they tell 22, tell 4/4, tell 8.
12:56
How do I do that?
You work on it and you keep working on it, and you don't make new products until the first one's right.
And if you're like, that might take years.
That's why good shit takes time when it really offers.
That book continues to sell more copies every month with zero advertising dollars.
Actually, less work in the long run to build a better thing than it is to build a shitty thing and then have to spend the rest of your time marketing and selling it.
13:19
You want to have leverage in every aspect of your business and the product is the strongest. 1, #17.
The last one I learned from Uncle Warren, the power of brand.
Brand was always this amorphous thing that I thought was complete.
BSI was like, you can't quantify brand, blah blah blah.
But the thing can quantify brand and that is what I learned from Uncle Warren, he said.
The amount that you can charge above the commoditized version of your product, the delta there is the power of brand.
13:38
If you have a T-shirt that can sell for $20 normally and can sell for $100.00 with your brand on it, all of that pricing power goes to bottom line, which is why Warren Buffett invests in brands.
It's one of the strongest ways to retain pricing power.
The brand itself becomes a huge compounding vehicle because the audience and the awareness around the brand compounds.








0:00
Work does expand to the amount of time that you allow it, but I deem work done when there is nothing else that I can do to make it better, that there's nothing else that I know of that I can make this better, right?
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:22
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
As you're talking, I just for whatever reason, I just started thinking about.
Your Twitter workflow, which I think is probably the most interesting to you because you're you're writing.
Yeah, the only one that I'm directly posting.
You taking a poop while you're doing it?
0:38
Or like what do you no actually.
Where do these thoughts come from?
So there are two two places.
One is I wake up with them.
So I usually wake up with like 3 or 4 tweets in my head and I won't usually even get out of bed until I put them in.
That is nuts.
And so yeah, so like you'll see all like a lot of my tweets are front loaded for the day because.
0:55
But they're super refined too.
I think Twitter Low key is the single greatest tool for learning how to write.
Yeah, because it forces you to have word concision and you get immediate feedback.
And so you like, we mean the hits feel so good, like just the feedback on the language.
1:11
You know what I mean?
You get to learn really quickly and it's based on your words.
So I think they're like, there are two things that have improved my writing more than anything.
Hemingway, the app, and Twitter like the two things that have improved my writing the most.
Use Hemingway to tweet No, no, no.
But like when I wrote, like when I write the book, yeah, that has helped me and Twitter got it.
1:29
But you said so from the 2nd place that I do it is when things come up naturally during the day.
And so I'll say something on a meeting and literally the team would be like, that's a tweet and then I'll just fire it off.
But there's no there's no cadence, there's no ghost writers.
1:45
There's no like.
You'll also see two days in a row where I won't tweet at all.
So like, it's just whatever.
And some days I'll tweet like 11 times.
Yeah, like, it's just if I'm in the zone.
Makes sense, yeah.
I think there's a lot of wisdom there.
I think there's a lot of beauty in the written word and if you can articulate yourself that way, then it's like your next level.
Well dude, I had a guy a really a really successful tech entrepreneur, so he'd had two Unicorn exits.
2:07
So like really successful.
Hit me up on Twitter and we hopped on a Zoom call and he was like, dude, so what's your Twitter strategy?
Are you like, in one of these engagement groups?
And I was like, no.
And he's like, oh dude, I won't tell anybody.
Like just like what's the like, what's the, what's the playbook?
And I was like, I tweet shit as I think of it.
2:24
Yeah, yeah.
He just like, he asked like three or four times.
Like, he just wouldn't believe it.
I'm like, that's what it is.
And and you'll notice because the tweets are usually like, themed because it's just like top of mind.
So if I'm feeling, because usually I'm tweeting to myself and that's what people don't get, like my tweets are me trying to bang myself in the head and be like, dude, like be fucking patient or like, relax, Like, you know, whatever it is or like, you don't need to care about this person's opinion.
2:51
And so, like, they're so violent because I'm in the moment of discomfort and I write that to myself to get over the moment and move on with my day.
Dude that's so it's like what we'll talk about in in you, your 80 year old self mentoring you.
But it's it's it's weird how we use it in our own, like you use it to beat yourself.
3:07
Beat yourself up or no, No, sorry.
I use it to beat myself up sometimes, right?
You're talking to yourself just to like it's like reminders for yourself, right?
And Gary is like to motivate people, right?
So it's just interesting.
But okay.
So how does now the first book that you released, $100 million offers you sold what?
3:24
How many copies?
I think it's about 500. 1500 That's a lot, right?
Like what I saw like 12,000 positive five star reviews or something that's across 16. 16,000, OK.
I just saw it.
That's why.
Yeah.
No advertising, right?
This, this, by the way.
Let me just read one for a second.
The guy that got on a zoom call with you, he wouldn't believe it.
3:41
It's like when your shit's so good, you don't need to game the system that is already the game.
Too good to fail.
That's what I'm like.
That's the line.
Like too good to fail.
I had AI, had a roommate of mine who said that I was like, what?
Cuz this is way back when I had my gyms and I only had one gyms like way back in the day and he had an online business.
3:58
So it was like way early decade ago, right?
And I was like, so what's your strategy for?
And he was like he was doing like blogging SEO stuff back then.
And he said that statement to me and he was like, I don't do anything else.
He's like, I just make sure that my articles are so exceptional that people share them.
4:15
And he would spend two weeks on one article, but then they would crush and get shared all over the place.
And now he has a business probably worth like 60-70 million now.
Wow.
And we were just like roommates in a house.
Like, just right.
Yeah, that's awesome.
OK, so back to the book.
So you did the first one.
What did you?
4:30
I mean, it's a labor of love first.
Anybody that's written a book before, you know it's a labor of love and plus use you like 10X20X just to make sure it's damn good.
First book was amazing, right?
What made you so quickly want to go to the next one and what are you looking to get out of it?
Man writing books is like such not a good use of time as much.
4:55
Like it's it's it's like it's something it's it's honestly like a guilty pleasure.
Like I it takes too much of my time and I enjoy it cause a lot of people don't know this about my background.
But like I was the vice as vice editor of the of the newspaper.
I was the editor in chief of the literary magazine.
5:10
I got a writing scholarship going into college.
Like, I've been writing a long time and I enjoy writing.
And so this is the only thing that I get to.
Mary, my 2 loves were like, I love writing and I love business.
And so it's like, it's my, like, chief form of expression.
That's why Twitter's kind of like a microcosm of that.
But the point of $100 million leads was to answer one question, and the 1st $100 million offers answered the question, what do I sell?
5:34
Leads answers the question, who do I sell it to?
And so most people, once they have something to sell, they're like, OK, now what?
And this book pretty much walks you through how to get your I mean, basically this book can get most people to a few $1,000,000 a year.
That I mean, that's it.
5:51
And so I see this, like, the books are my absolute long game because the amount of guys that I see every single day, that stopped me.
Like when we're walking who are like, dude, I'm 21, I've got my thing, I'm doing, you know, 70 grand a month and you're on my vision board.
As soon as I cross $1,000,000 for profit, like, I'm hitting you up.
6:09
And so, like, there are so many of those guys right now who are like incubating that I know in three years, five years, 10 years are going to hit that.
And I just want to be the first person they call and that's it.
And they're like, that's a long, it's my longest game.
Like the the books are my abs, which is why I spend so much time on them.
6:25
Because if they're not going to be good enough to still be referred to and sold in a decade, there's no point in me writing it today.
Like what would I the book lunch money.
Like it cost me more money to put the event on That I'm probably going to make from the book.
You know what I mean?
And the media team.
6:42
My my losing money media team.
No, you guys are you guys are awesome.
Writing a book to make money off a book is possibly the worst monetization vehicle of all time.
It's a physical product.
You have a 16 week lead time.
You have to manage inventory accounts.
6:58
You make no money on it.
You have to sell it on a platform that takes 80% of the money or you have to go to a publisher that also takes 80% of the money.
Like there's no winning from a money like the percentage of like the offers is top top 100 Audible books still on Amazon two years later and top 1000 physical books.
7:19
There's there's like 60, there's I think 60 million titles, there's six or 60 million.
That's a big difference obviously, but a lot of books on Amazon.
And so it's a point 0001 percent book.
And like, it doesn't.
I mean it makes money, but like it makes less than any of My Portfolio companies to give like a reference of scale.
7:40
Yeah.
I mean, you're not retiring from, right?
No, I mean, if I spend no money, you know what I mean?
Like any of the companies we have, makes more money in the book.
Right.
Yeah, makes sense.
I mean, but it's still, it's like it lives on forever and that's cool.
And I think that's it.
That's like the like, if I were to die tomorrow, the thing I'd be most proud of is the books.
7:57
Because I knew that that would be the thing that would outlive me the longest.
Yeah, which is interesting.
We'll come back to the book in a second, but I think you talked about how you don't believe in the concept of of legacy, right?
Kinda.
Is your legacy in the formal sense?
Yeah.
I don't believe in individual legacy.
Yeah, I do.
8:13
Yeah.
So, like, I don't believe in your name being passed on for thousands of generations.
I mean, like, to prove the point, do you know what your great, great, great grandfather's name was?
Probably not.
Right.
And so like, that's not even that many generations back.
And so to have like the ego and the thinking that like you're some like your progeny are and even if you somehow became king of the world and you did have that, they wouldn't know who you were.
8:34
You would just be like another historical figure that they could then trace their bloodline back to.
And then if you do the math on how related you are to them, like if you go, you know, .5 to the 8th, I mean you're you're not related.
You're just another human.
And in that to that degree then it then relation generalizes to all of humanity and then you just become a humanitarian.
8:52
In which case, I am pro legacy from that perspective.
And I think that the ultimate legacy is education because all of us here are sitting here in a house full of inventions that other people that we don't know invented and made our lives better.
And that I think is like the ultimate legacy for humanity is that we just fall and someone picks up the baton where we left off and carries it.
9:12
But like, I think the ultimate wasted life is 1, where you learn lessons and pass it on to no one and force someone to quite truly reinvent the wheel, you know?
And the Vol has.
So the book he recommends the most is the.
I think it's the beginning of Infinity or something like that.
Yeah, David Deutsch or whatever.
So this dude and it's like a super dense read, but like, I haven't completed it.
9:31
But this guy's like, you know what is wealth?
And wealth is knowledge.
To your point, you just said it's education, right?
Like that is the thing that continues to compound beyond you and me.
It lasts beyond money.
And like that is what should matter.
Like how do we make people wealthy?
9:46
We educate them.
And if you think about the the reverse of that too, if you had a lot of money and you gave it to someone, how would you guarantee that they lose the money?
You have them completely uneducated and completely ignorant.
And so there's a there's, I think it's Sanskrit, it's a super old like ISM, but it says if you have a bad son, there's no point in saving money.
10:07
If you have a good son, there's no point in saving money, because if you have the good son, he'll take care of himself.
If you have a bad son, he's going to squander everything you have.
Which basically means that at no point does it ever matter what you accumulate because either you passed on education, in which case they never needed you to begin with, or you pass on no education and they're going to lose everything you had.
10:24
That's so good.
But I this is the thing you look at all the the the wealthy people, they can't help themselves.
They have to give it to your kids.
And we don't have kids yet, right?
But I suspect if we have kids, right?
It's just like you probably end up giving it to the kids, right?
Well, I think I really like thinking of like, I mean and I'll probably be different when I have children, but I don't know how different people would be surprised if like if I wanted to create a human that had certain character traits, I would then think, OK, what are the, what are the experiences someone has to go through to have that happen?
10:55
And I would try and reverse engineer as many of those as I could.
And like having Uber wealth throughout your entire life and having a guaranteed ease of of eating and living and whatever is a great way to guarantee, not guarantee, is a great way to increase the likelihood that someone does not turn out good.
11:11
And so I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life after they're twenty with a bunch of people I didn't like.
And so I would rather have them suffer to become the types of people that I'd want to spend the rest of my life with.
I'm with you, man.
It's, I mean let's let's rewind to our childhoods real quick because we for me tiger mom, right.
11:29
It's it's difficult.
You're never good enough, right.
And so I think similar kind of story for you.
Do you want to talk about maybe how your childhood shaped you into who you are?
Because I feel like there's part of you that's really compassionate, but then there's the other side that's really tough on yourself and something that's tough on other people, too.
Yeah.
Well, as a quick side note on this, I think because I've had this question in different forms on a couple podcasts about like the struggle growing up, etcetera and how that creates success now.
11:54
But I really think it's people suffer during childhood.
Some people are successful and some people aren't.
Like there's just as many people or not even way more people who have terrible childhoods and then don't do anything out of it.
And so I don't to to point back to a terrible childhood and say not that I had a terrible childhood but like to tough times and say that that is why I'm here.
12:17
The why is really difficult.
And I don't think anyone can answer the question.
I just know that I do these things because I've been reinforced for doing them.
And so that's like, the only rule or law of humanity that I see is that you either rewarded or punishment punished for doing the things that you've done.
And you either avoid things you've been punished for in the past and you keep doing things you're rewarded for.
12:34
And so, like, I keep working harder and harder on things because my minimum standard continues to rise.
Because the more I raise that minimum standard, the better the things that I have are, and the more reinforced I am for working hard on the things that I work on.
Which brings me to a quote over here.
Most people keep fighting the same boss, but the boss is being able to stick with it.
12:50
Yeah, And you had to learn that the hard way, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here, I'll give you another one.
Over here, I'll give you your your Mosey.
Is that a thing?
Mosey isms.
To do something epic, you have to convince yourself to do the same thing for a long period of time without telling yourself that you're smarter than you are.
This talk that you did, I think the talk I'm paraphrasing here was how your this will change how you think about money or something like that, right?
13:13
But this talk was really about focus at the end of the day and you went to Yogurtland and decided that you had to redo your talk and focus the talk on focus.
What happened there?
Yeah.
And all these guys who were coming up to so I so I got so I was supposed to speak at this event and I'd already finished the the presentation.
13:31
And part of the reason that I don't speak very much is because on stages one, I don't like how people use my face to promote cuz again associations I don't want.
But also because it means to just give this to everybody else.
Like a lot of people will promote with my face and then people will buy whatever the person who's at the event is selling.
13:49
And I have no association or anything and I have no way to I don't have the time to do the due diligence of figuring the person out.
So like if I speak somewhere, it's not because I'm endorsing the person.
But that being said, I went to the Yogurtland and like eight or nine people were in the area for the next day.
14:05
And they sat around us and I spent like 60 minutes talking to all these guys.
And it became really clear that all of them were distracted.
They were all doing multiple things trying to like they they, they subscribe to the single fallacy that I think is #1 in new entrepreneurs, which is the I'll see which one works fallacy.
14:24
And the reality is that any of them could work, but the only one that will work is the one that you work on.
And so you have to commit to one of them because it's just it's arrogant to think that you going 25% in on four things is because you are competing in a real marketplace against somebody else that's in that space.
14:43
And to think that you're 25% is going to do anything against someone's 100%, it's just arrogant.
And so and one of the definitions of commitment that I like a lot is the elimination of alternatives.
And so if you want to be committed to something, then you have to eliminate alternatives and some people use, you know, dicadere, which is the Latin root of decide which just means to kill off, which is like what are we killing off.
15:04
And I think it's kind of like pruning a tree.
And when I realized that it's like you there's only so much nutrients in the soil.
There are only so many minutes in the day, so much literal attention and folks that you can allocate.
And if anyone's ever worked on one project for a long period of time, you realize that you start peeling back layers and getting a depths of understanding that you can never get.
15:23
When you're on the surface level looking at multiple things.
You're barely being reactive and setting out fires.
You can never make progress and like drive and I think that like this is a Warren Buffett quote to to give the the GOAT his, his due, he said The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.
15:42
And I think that that's, it's just taking me a very long time to learn that and I continue to repeat it in my tweets because it's still just as hard for me now as it was then.
It's because The thing is, is that the opportunities I have to say no to now are things that I would have given my left nut for, you know, a decade ago.
15:59
And so it's it's just, it's continue like the bars continue to rise on what I have to say no to and it's hard the whole way through.
And one of the big unlocks for me has been judging myself based on my actions and not my feelings.
Meaning I can feel impatient but still do the patient thing.
16:16
So I might still want this to go faster and be upset that it's not going faster.
As long as they don't act on that impulse, I can still be a patient person.
And so to the same degree with focus, I might be interested and love jamming with the guys on, like, what if we did this?
What if we did that?
What if we did that?
16:32
But as long as I don't say, all right, buy the URL, let's get the bank out set up, let's go.
As long as I don't do that, then like we're still focused on the one thing that matters most.
It must be tough because it's you're you're trying to educate people on the pain that you've been through, right?
16:48
Again, being punched in the gut.
Nine things right.
But still, like, I I don't know about you, but in in my early 20s, I remember they have focus, focus.
I would read, you know, Warren Buffett, Steve, not Steve, just Warren Buffett.
You know Bill Gates.
Yeah.
The one thing is focus, right?
Like, you know, and but it's like, no, no, no.
17:04
But like I'm better.
I'm smarter than that, right, that you have that quote in here.
It's like thinking that you're smarter than you are.
So I feel like it's as much as we try to teach people, sometimes it's like they just need to get punched themselves.
I think there's the difference between knowing that and knowing how.
17:20
So like going through an experience unfortunately teaches you in a different way than knowing that something happens.
Or like I know, I know, I know that this works this way.
But if I said like I know how a business works, but it's like, but you, you know what to do, but you've never done it.
17:36
And so until you've actually done it, you think you know what to do until you go through it.
And so I think that's like that experience or knowledge, which is honestly, I think the base of the content, what makes the difference between Ken Mcelroy's and hopefully our content, which is like people can see a depth of understanding that comes from experience.
Like one of my favorite quotes from LH Hardwick is no man within experience is ever at the mercy of a man with an opinion, right?
17:57
And until someone's done it, all they have is an opinion.
And if you have done it, they are irrelevant.
Like someone's like, well, it doesn't work that way.
Like have you done it?
And they're like, no.
And I'm like your opinion does not matter.
Dude, I I just remember 2-3 years ago one of the guys that that was leading my marketing team, he's like, so we'd have this engagement tool called 15-5 and you could just, here's how the week went, you know, here's what I'm learning right now.
18:24
And every week it's like watching Hermozi videos, watching Hermozi videos.
And this is when you had, this is when you were just like maybe 20,000 subscribers or whatever, right.
But it was because of the depth of the content that you have where.
It was just so and then I started watching it and it's like, then it's like all the thumbnails on YouTube started, the recommendations started becoming you.
18:42
I was like, holy shit.
And that's how you started to compound, right?
Cuz it's good stuff.
Yeah.
I appreciate it.
Yeah.
It's.
I think it's being really honest with yourself about we have the investor's circle of confidence, right.
I think there's a content circle of competence that you have to know.
19:00
If it's not in this circle, I shouldn't talk about it.
And that's not because of brand, and that's not because of any of the fancy stuff.
It's just because you don't know it.
And like anything that you have to add that's outside of the circle of competence will often be a generalization that you heard from someone else, right?
19:15
And if it's a generalization for someone else, then that's their opinion and not yours.
And so we want first principles, first experience, type content.
And so n = 1, right?
Or one of zero content as we say.
And that's the litmus test.
It's like is it in that is it is it something we know from experience And I I had this video I think the the, the long that I had right before this was my explanation of how to get to 10,000,000 + a month and I talked about I was like and I think this is how we get to 100 million a month.
19:44
I don't know that because I haven't been there yet but I'm this is my current plan of how to get there and somebody commented something.
I can't remember what it was but it's something like well you have no idea.
I can, I can coach you on it like whatever.
But The thing is is like it.
I will only talk about retrospect.
20:01
Like I will only talk about things that I have done because I can speak confidently on them.
And if someone says Jim launch wasn't a company, it doesn't bother me because it's it's like saying like you didn't have oatmeal for breakfast.
I'm like, I mean, I did so OK.
And that's that's what in my opinion has allowed me to not suffer from the the many inevitable, you know, comments, whatever you get from the the the masses of people who don't know you.
20:27
Because if someone says, hey, Alex, you're short, I know that's not true.
And so it doesn't, it doesn't hit me.
The only ones that hurt are the ones that you feel like have an element of truth.
And so if there's an element of truth, that means that I probably stepped out of my circle of competence.
And I think getting stung outside of my circle has really taught me, at least for me, to stay in my world of like, these are the few things that I know, and that is what I'll talk about.
20:51
You know, interestingly enough, Speaking of circle of competence, I think there's also circle of competence when it comes to constant creation.
Like, you should stick to the format that you understand initially before expanding out, right?
And so I really enjoy this, but maybe I'm not the best at, you know, telling long form stories or something like that, right?
21:09
So I think it's like.
Really, do whatever works for you.
Play your cards.
Yeah, Yeah.
So going back to the book, you got this big launch strategy happening right now.
It's like the Super Bowl.
Like what?
What can you tell us about that?
What's going on?
How much you spent?
Yeah, let's go tons about it.
So $100 million offers the first book.
21:28
The goal with every book was to be a meta book.
Meaning I wanted to use the book to demonstrate the ideas in the book as proof that the ideas worked.
And so $100 million offers how to make offers so good people feel stupid.
Saying no was supposed to in and of itself be an offer so good people feel stupid saying no.
21:45
And so I made the book $2.00 on Kindle and I added in a course that most people would sell for one to $5000 on top of it and made it for free on my site.
Not behind an opt in wall, just made it for free for everyone with downloads and everything.
22:02
And the idea was if it is good enough, people will share it.
And that's more or less what ended up happening.
And so with $100 million leads, the meta concept is not about the offer.
The meta concept within leads is advertising and how to get leads, right.
22:18
And so the 24 months that I did post the offers book was all towards the leads book.
And so the last 24 months was, well, if I'm going to talk about how to build an audience, then I have to build an audience.
If I'm going to talk about how to run paid ads, I have to, I have to run paid ads.
And we'll talk about having affiliates.
I have to have affiliates.
22:34
And so there's 8 methods of advertising that I talk about in the book and I use all eight specifically to promote the book to prove that all 8 methods work.
And so when we go live at the event, I will break down here was our affiliate strategy.
22:50
This is how many affiliates we had.
This is how many of you were here from affiliates.
This is how this is our paid, paid ad strategy.
These are the scripts I use, which is directly from this page.
This is the landing page I use, which is directly from this page and it got this many of you guys here.
I got this much content, which is how many we put out over this period of time.
23:08
This is the resulting impressions, this is how many of you are here from that.
And so I wanted to just give proof that these concept worked 10 years ago and they work today and they'll work in 100 years because people won't change, the platforms will, but the principles remain the same.
So I mean, you're basically showing, hey, like.
I'm showing you this in the book and I'm meta.
23:25
This is how it works, right?
But by the way, for the affiliates, what?
What are you getting out of this?
I mean, it's a $2.00 book like well, what's in it for them?
Yeah, and actually the the Kindle on this one is $10 because the point was not to be an offer, the point was to be a leads thing.
Got it right.
23:40
And the next book will be a meta concept on that.
So every book will have its own unique thing anyways.
So with the affiliates, I think of affiliates in kind of two tiers.
Now when I make a true affiliate strategy for a business, there's usually 3.
There's usually first level, which is the base level that everybody starts at.
23:56
There's the next level, which is an activation point level, which is whatever activation point is for you in your business.
You make that the next kicker for their income or whatever the benefit is.
And then you have your like top producer level.
And so those are usually the best three.
And we paid a gazillion dollars to consultants who just only set up affiliate structures.
24:12
And that's what they use.
They're like always three.
These are the three.
And there you go.
There's a nugget for you.
Let me save you 100 grand.
That's how you set up affiliate setups with this book.
I have two levels.
If you don't have a massive audience, bring 10 friends.
That's it.
24:27
So bring 1010 people from your company, bring your family, bring your cousins, whatever it is, bring 10 people.
And I'll give you 2 chapters that I'm not releasing with the book.
OK.
So that's the, that's the benefit for that level, For the top level, there's going to be people who have audiences, right, who have e-mail lists, have subscribers, etcetera.
24:45
And so for them, I wanted to be more competitive.
And so for them at the top ten, I'm going to do an AMA, live with their audience, with them and they can ask whatever they want.
And the reason I've chose that specific benefit for them was that if I said, hey, I'm giving a Lamborghini or I'm giving a car to the top ten people, right?
25:03
If they go to their audience and say, hey, attend this thing so I can win this car, that's them extracting goodwill from the audience.
And I don't want them to do that for me.
And so I was like, how can I also use the concepts that I preach for them?
And so I made it an AMA so that their audience clicking their affiliate link benefits their audience.
25:24
Because if I click Johnny's link and we win, then we get the time to do the AMA.
And so he doesn't Johnny, or whoever the affiliate is, doesn't extract goodwill for or withdraw goodwill from their audience by by promoting my thing.
And so that way I wanted it to be an easy thing for people to promote.
25:42
So it would just be a net benefit.
So it didn't have to like work another promotion calendar or be like like how what kind of split am I?
Because there's no financial incentive for the for this and I also did that because operationally got it, you know 12 thousand 1090 nines is a pain and so it was easier to do it that way.
Interesting.
25:58
These people are willing to promote too, because of all the goodwill that you've built up.
And I think that's really interesting, important for people to understand and probably brand association.
Yeah, Like, if for sure like real time.
Like that was the thing that I I'm still consistently learning and impressed by how branding works.
26:15
Yeah, But yeah, I think that was also an element of it.
So and the AM as that you're doing, you're doing basically 10 separate M and as the AM as 10 separate ones.
So it's totally like their audience.
Yeah.
And so, yeah, that's and I don't do a lot of these by percentage of requests.
26:32
And so for many of them this is like the only shot that they'll probably have to to do that.
And so I wanted to make it cool and awesome.
Got it.
How many hours do you think you put into this launch?
How much do you think you've spent so far?
I spent 1,000,000 bucks in cash on the event so far, probably more honestly.
26:50
Anyway, yeah, it's been probably more.
And then so right now we have like 405 or 10,000 people registered for the event, which is pretty nuts.
It's like 7 NFL stadiums.
Dude, I imagine attended attendance rate has to be pretty high too.
27:06
I hope so.
Well, you know I this is the first time you know that we've done anything like this big.
So yeah, we spent, spent that much money.
And then from a time perspective this has been, if you include the writing of the book, I mean it's I've got 2000 hours into this.
So if we don't include writing the book, the presentation that I'm giving I've spent.
27:27
I've probably put 200 hours into it.
Wow.
OK, so I I will do the work.
And so I made the presentation and this.
And now I feel like I have the process down.
So I will share this with you.
So I'm a big fan of outworking yourself.
27:44
Doubt, right?
Like you, you're never nervous if you're fully prepared.
And so I don't want to be nervous for this thing.
And if anything, I just want to be excited about it, which I am.
But the way I approached it was I made the first version of the presentation and then I presented it and I recorded it.
28:02
And then I watched the recording with the deck up and I pause it when every time there's a mess up and I fix the deck and I play, fix, play, fix, play fix.
And then once I have the new fixed one, I go top to bottom in my head.
And then I go top to bottom, record it out loud, pause, fix, pause, fix, pause, fix.
28:18
And so right now I do that.
I do one full cycle of that every day.
And I started preparing for that three weeks out.
I don't know if people are, maybe they are seeing this, but from my observation here is that you just mentioned I will do the work and I think one of your other quotes was like the work needs doing right but then and then you tie it in with really not even a 10X effort.
28:40
But to me it seems like 100 X effort just people aren't willing to go that far, right?
But what's interesting is that, like if you work 100 times harder, you can sometimes get like a million times the payout.
And so like the the top end of work still has disproportionate payouts.
And so I don't even, I don't even like there are diminishing returns.
28:58
But there's a point where you actually get like outsize returns for the effort.
Because like if you think about it from like a Olympic racing perspective, like if I work, you know, 10 times more than everybody else does, but I get gold and the next guy gets silver, The difference between gold and silver and running is everything, even though it's the 10th of a second.
29:14
And so from an absolute perspective, there's diminishing returns.
But from a relative perspective, I think you have exponential returns from being the best, from being number.
The difference between #1 and #2 can be, you know, like Uber and Lyft, like the difference is 10 X the size.
And so I I have now been reinforced enough times of how much more work is required to do something excellent that now I understand it.
29:36
And I think the one thing that has continued to level up over time for me, and this is also for the audience, is that like you don't even know how much you can work.
Like you think you know how much you can work until you, like, really, really work.
And like with this presentation, I was like I will not be the reason this is not good.
29:54
What do you think changed your perspective?
Like flipped you into working 100 X harder.
I think just my standards have gone up.
Like I looked at the first presentation I ever gave and it's like it's embarrassing everyone.
It's truly embarrassing.
I think it has like 19 slides with like 4 bullets on each slide.
30:10
And I'm being.
I remember thinking, man, I spend a lot of time on this and a lot of time to me back then was like I spent a day on it, like a full day, like 8 hours.
That's still.
Me right now.
Yeah.
And.
And I think that a little moniker that I have is just counting hundreds.
30:27
It's like, how many hundreds of hours did you spend on something 'cause like when you start counting in hundreds, like the the depth of understanding of something goes to such a such a large degree.
And it's like if I were to tell someone to edit a video, right?
Like a short clip.
And I said, hey, edit this clip in 30 minutes, right.
30:44
And give it back to me.
And I was like, and they give it back to me.
I'm like, OK, I'm not gonna edit it yet.
If I give you another 30 minutes, could you make it better?
And they're usually like, I could make it better another 30.
So I give it back to him, like, give it back to me another 30.
So gives back to me another 30.
And I say, OK, if I give you 2 more hours, do you think you'd make it better?
31:00
There's a point to this.
Yep.
He's like, yeah, I think I'd make it better.
Comes back to me.
I say, OK, what if I gave you two weeks?
Like, well, then I would totally approach it differently.
I'd probably restructure the whole thing like because the the amount of time sure work does expand to the amount of time that you allow it.
31:17
But I deem work done when there's nothing else that I can do to make it better, that there's nothing else that I know of that I can make this better.
And that was the point that I got back with the book.
Like I did 19 drafts, I did 4 full rewrites.
31:33
And the last version that has gone out when I I, you know, read it front to back so many Times Now.
Like there I was like, I can't take anything else out and I can't add anything to it and I can't make anything clear.
And I've written this whole thing in a third grade reading level and I've added 106 hand drawn images into this.
There's nothing else I can do.
31:49
And if it does not succeed, that's fine, but it will not be for lack of effort.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
32:08
You can check on my YouTube channel, It's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
And if not, keep enjoying the show.
Let.
Me ask you this, then, what would be considered success for this book launch?
It'll be successful the moment I step on stage.
I genuinely believe this.
32:25
Like truly I'll have one by the time that it happens, because I I know what I feel like when I walk on stage and I have done everything in my power.
Everything.
Not some of the things or most of the things, but there is nothing else that I can conceive of to make this better.
32:41
And then at that point, if any, like, then the chips will fall where they are and I will control the controllables.
And so that's that has that has helped me get through like some of the the anxieties and things like that that happened earlier on in my career around these types of things.
But the whole like the reason I have the outwork yourself doubt like give yourself a stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are.
33:01
Like if I say that I will I will do my job then I will not make.
I will make sure that I have done everything in my power, which also means, and this is the underlying thing is that it means I can't do a lot of stuff.
And that's the that's the real cost of excellence is all the things that you wanna try that you can't do because excellence has a huge price tag associated with it, which is how much time you have to put into one thing.
33:24
Totally.
And you actually gave this example when it comes to writing a world class book there.
Yeah, I think the analogy you shared was like, there's the difference between like a 7.5 star and a 9.5 star book or whatever it is.
It's like 100 X more work.
Yeah, right.
What was the analogy?
33:39
Yeah, I mean it's exactly that.
Like to go from a, you know from A5 to A7 is like twice the work.
To go from A7 to a nine is like 100 times the work.
It's so much more work.
It's an asymptote when it comes to work and excellence, power loss.
But, but the difference like, but the difference between a nine and a half book and a 9.9 book on Amazon is the difference between you having one book that you can retire on for the rest of your life.
34:04
Like the offers book in sales I think does around 300,000 a month, which is crazy as a book, yeah.
As a book, that's your take, right?
Huh.
That's your take.
No, that's not my take.
That's sales, that's revenue, right.
Then Amazon has his has his way with it.
It takes the vast majority of it.
34:20
But point being is like for the vast majority, I think it is about 1,000,000 bucks a year net.
But for the vast majority of people like that, I think is actually kind of encouraging is like, you can put an unbelievable amount of work into one thing and make it so good that it will pay you for the rest of your life.
34:37
Like you don't.
Like you could work a job, you could have a career, you could do all these things.
But like if you build one amazing product that people will consistently buy and tell their friends about, you don't have to work again.
And I think they're like understanding that I've now applied and honestly the offers book was the first, probably the biggest real life example I had where I could control every variable.
34:56
Like in a business you can't control every variable.
But in and even in like a tech product, I'm not the coder or whatever.
Like I was like, I can code every page of this.
I did the drawings, I did the audible, I wrote the words, I designed the cover like everything.
And so I can make sure that it's excellent from my perspective and then hopefully the the audience will agree.
35:15
I love it.
And and that acquisition.com/leads, is that going to be an Evergreen page or is it going to disappear at some point?
Oh, I mean, it'll always reroute to probably something about the books.
So yeah, acquisition.com/leads.
Got it.
Let me ask you this.
I think for $100 million offers, that book is very Lindy.
35:32
And what I mean by that for the audience is that, you know, it's that like how to win friends and influence people.
It's been around for over 100 years.
It's going to be around for another 100 years.
I think your book is written that way.
For that one, I think leads might be a little more difficult because you might be talking about no, no, you've written that Lindy dude.
That's why it was so hard.
There you go.
35:47
Think about, I mean like I had to the so.
So to give context, Leads has been probably 10 times the work of offers like, and it was because I had to rewrite it so many times and and and thinking about what topics I was going to get into and what topics I wasn't going to get into.
36:04
And then how at what level do I chunk up or chunk down from tactics around advertising.
Right.
So explaining the concepts like I call it the Core 4.
But there's only four things you can do to let other people know about your stuff.
You can mess up people one-on-one who you know so it's warm reach outs.
36:21
You can mess up people one-on-one who you don't know that's cold reach outs.
You can post one to many to people who know you, which is posting content, and you can post one to many people who don't know you, which is running paid ads.
That's it.
That's all you can do.
There's nothing else.
And if you're not doing those things, then people will find out about your stuff.
36:38
And so the platforms change, the principles remain the same.
And so that was the but I had to cover platforms, media formats, placements, targeting, cold emails, cold calls, DMS.
There were so many things that I had to cover in one book.
36:55
I will probably never fight off so much again in terms of narrowing the scope of the book.
But now that I did for this, it really the the problem set that this book answers is literally just one step in the funnel, which is a lead is a person that you can contact.
37:13
That is the definition of as I define an engage.
Lead is a person you can contact who has shown interest in the stuff you sell.
And the entire point of this book is to get someone from a person you can contact to get them engaged.
Got it?
That is it.
That is the whole problem of the entire book.
And then like and that's it and it self destructs.
37:31
It's self destructs.
You got offers, you got leads.
Can you talk about the next one?
It's.
I'll share the name yet, Yeah, but.
But it's green.
It's.
Green.
All right, you got It'll be a green book.
Purple, purple.
Wait, blue.
Purple green.
Purple blue.
Purple blue.
OK, got it, got it, got it.
Just for the audience to know it's.
37:47
Typically when you write a book, it's usually five to seven drafts, right?
And when I, my editor, first told me that it's like, come on, I'll be done in one draft, right?
No, it's seven on my end.
You did 19.
That's that's way more.
It sounds like you rewrote a couple of times too. 4/4 rewrites like end to end rewrites.
That's crazy.
38:03
I I think I just give up, but it was really, it was really hard.
But the work needs doing, and I'll tell you what my editor said when I would get to these points where I would just like, throw out my hands and be like, dude, I don't, I don't need to make the money.
Like, I don't like whatever, you know.
You're close to giving up a couple times.
Oh, for sure.
I mean, like, you know, everybody has bad days.
38:21
Yeah.
And he he he'd said that he gave me this visual that like just like seared into my mind.
He was like there's a 17 year old kid in Pakistan who has a goat who's gonna be sleeping with this book under his pillow.
He's like do it for him.
Wow.
And I was like, like, all right.
So we get back and we and and we, you know, I was like, dude, they can figure this part out and he's like, no, they can't.
38:40
Yeah, he's like you'll sell the book no matter what he's like, but they won't get it And then I'll so then it's like back to the drawing board.
How can I re think through this framework so that I can make it easy and then make the visual match the words and make it under third grade and all the way through was tough.
38:56
Dude, I mean, that just goes to show you too, cuz earlier you talked about your mission around the education piece, right?
And sometimes no matter how strong your mission is, you start to waver a little bit, right?
And you need heroes like your editor to come and recalibrate, yeah?
Yeah, this one's interesting.
So the guy I had lunch with today, we had been in these masterminds before and in our mid 20s or so.
39:16
It's like, yeah, tactics.
You need a dopamine hits right now.
That's good, right?
Split test.
Yeah, split test.
You know, there's this new channel over here.
You've got to talk to this person.
But then as we get older, it's like, no, no, no.
It's not about the tactics.
It's just about hiring good people, right?
Like, is there anything you want to?
39:31
I mean, I thought it'd be good to chat about with you here because after they read the books, sure, they'll pick up the strategies, the tactics.
But really wants to get a certain level.
It's like, I mean it's all about who you know.
I mean there's that the type was that book who not how.
Yep.
I mean it kind of summarizes the entire concept in the title.
39:49
You, I think you and I have had this discussion.
But like you can you can sit in on a group of entrepreneurs, listen to the discussion for 60 seconds and know how much money they make within a rough a rough estimate or what level of the business that they're working.
If they're employees, like where they where they sit on the org chart because of what level of conversation they're having and so.
40:07
And at the highest level, you're talking about allocation of resources.
That's all it is.
It's just capital and human allocation.
And you know, one level maybe below that would be human like human capital, which is how are we going to attract talent, how are we going to train talent, How are we going to get compounding returns on talent?
40:23
Because you know, I I like the saying, but you're just one great hire away from all of the money that you want.
But The thing is, is that I think the catch of that, that ISM, is that you have to become the type of person that that person wants to work for.
Totally.
And that's, that's the hard part.
40:39
Yeah.
That's like sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
What's his name?
Tim Cook, right of Apple.
He could, he could probably grow your business, but he wouldn't work for you.
And so like that has been always at the forefront of Leyland, Eisman is and that's part of of what we do with the brand stuff which is we want the brand to stand for things that because we're we're just as aggressively advertising at a tactical level, we're more aggressively advertising from a transactions perspective for the talent we put in portfolio companies.
41:10
So we place talent I mean a few times a week, I mean we have 3-4 leadership positions a week that we fill in our portfolio companies compared to how many deals we do at the portfolio level.
And so and that's the that's the highest return on capital that we have is buy someone and I say buy just in the capital term, buy talent for 200,000 a year make 20 million a year, great trade, right.
41:35
And one of the big, one of the big misnomers.
I think that one of the biggest mistake entrepreneurs like myself included when I was earlier on is that I didn't understand the difference between A&B talent.
You can pay a talent 30% above market and get 10X the output and like there's no sense in ever paying below market in my opinion because you just don't get, you can get so much more for the for the extra premium that you pay that it's one of the best.
42:00
It's like the best, best bet in Vegas.
Yeah.
I mean the best trade you can make is that premium to bring the the right person in that's 10 times more effective.
You know, have you heard of the the Keith or boy, he has this expression about barrels versus bullets.
So the concept here this guy was, I think he was like a CEO of of Square or Block, whatever you want to call it his high up at PayPal.
42:22
But anyway, So what he said was like look.
In an organization, you need barrels.
These are gonna be the ones that you give them a problem or like something.
They'll just solve it, right?
Yeah.
And then the bullets, like, they will do what you tell them to do.
But you should always hire a barrel whenever you meet a barrel.
And that's kind of what you're saying here.
And to me, like, I love playing poker, right?
42:40
Like I'm a gambler at heart.
But in like, in business, it's like, unfair.
It's like, can you make this hire?
It's like.
Outside is unlimited.
Well, I mean it's got to the point now where we will like we interview, we basically have open interviews.
So if we see someone who's incredibly talented, we will hire them without really having a clear position for them yet.
43:01
And like, yeah, I'm saying that's a bit, that's if we have an incredibly talented person.
Like we had someone recently who is an exceptional sales director at huge experience was an ex CEO, like all this great stuff, great value fit.
And one of our portfolio companies, we're about to, you know, make the recommendation that you should take this person.
43:20
And they were like, we don't, we don't think we want to do it.
And so we hopped on the phone and we're like, you're wrong.
Like we have a lot more context on this.
You should do it.
And it ended up somebody from like their outside that said you shouldn't do it.
And they had that person had no context and they were like, we actually wanted to hire them.
43:37
But we didn't trust ourselves.
Which, by the way, is huge part for entrepreneurs is like, you make one bad hire and then you think, I can't hire people.
Like, you're going to make mistakes.
It's part of the game.
You get better and better at pattern recognition.
And so this person had talent.
It was clear.
And so we were like, just so you know, we're hiring him no matter what.
43:52
And so we're either going to put him in your company or putting him in somebody else and they're like, OK, yeah, yeah, no, no, we want him.
And so it's like, I think that's the level of talent is like, you should feel FOMO when you're talking to the person.
And here's the other litmus test that I love.
I got this from Layla.
If you are not learning on the interview from the candidate about the thing that they're supposed to take over, you shouldn't hire them because it means that you know more than them.
44:14
Which means that you're required for them to be successful.
Yep.
Which means that they need you and you know you don't get leverage.
Yep, that dude.
That's way better.
So I used to use this Larry Page proxy so he would just get bored on all these interviews, right?
One of the founders of Google.
And he would be like, yeah, so like, tell me about something you're passionate about.
44:32
OK, great.
You're gonna teach me for 7 minutes so you can learn something.
Layla's is even better.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Because if you think about from a chunked up example, an organization grows if the not if the cumulative knowledge base of the company grows.
And so if you bring somebody in who you have the complete you have their entire complete knowledge set about whatever the subject matter is, then the organization doesn't grow.
44:56
Just as simple as that.
And if you were the smartest person in your business, then it means that the business will be capped by your brain.
If you have four other people who have huge trench knowledge, then I see it as this.
45:11
Like in my head, I see it as this Christmas tree where like if you have four like this, the peak goes way above because you have this wider, wider top.
So the peak is way, way higher.
Whereas if you're the single brain at the top, the peak is the top of your head.
Yeah, that's like how I visualize.
Very small Christmas tree, Yeah, very small Christmas tree.
45:27
Exactly.
No presents.
That's, that's good.
So actually we have a couple minutes left here, but the Layla conversation is going to be really focused on talent acquisition because that.
That is the game.
So she's AG at it.
She's a savage.
I mean, Speaking of savages, So A, yes, both of you are savages.
45:46
In a good way, obviously, but B, when you find this talent, right?
Like I tell people, I tell my staff, it's like, dude, you know, And if you have that feeling, that little gut feeling, you pull the trigger, You don't wait that long.
Yeah, cuz the next person to interview with the Hiram Yeah.
Totally.
46:01
So you'll do it on the spot.
Sometimes we don't do.
I mean we don't, we still follow our process, but we we do 24 hour turnarounds to move things.
Forward.
There you go.
Yeah, but usually your your turn around's like we try and do, we try and do everything one day apart if we like, we always try to do that.
Like we have really good metrics around HR like our cost to fill is way below industry average.
46:19
Our time to fill roles is like 22 days versus industry average is much higher.
Yeah, our two sided fit at 90 days, which is one of our key metrics is that the the person above the person and the person both say that it was a perfect match 90 days later.
Two sided fit.
I like that you guys came up with that one too.
46:35
What director of HR did.
And that was because she came from Audex private equity firm.
And so she was director of people there.
Yeah.
And so on the interview she was teaching, she gave all these metrics that I didn't like time to fill.
And I was like, I should why have I never tracked this?
Like, that's so smart And she's like, what's the cost to fill?
46:52
And here I am thinking I was like, Oh yeah, I'm this big metrics guy.
I know the question for our customers, CPMCP, all these things and she's like, oh, you don't know what your cost to fill was.
And I was like, wow, like such an idiot myself.
And so that's why.
Like, that's why you need really smart people around you.
Because, like, I learn from from her all the time.
47:09
You should feel like an idiot when you're talking to high caliber prospects about their subject.
Yeah, yeah, I love it.
Cool.
You know?
So I'm gonna go back to the story here because because we have a guest question here, but we were eating lunch one time and your order was.
47:25
It can be 4 chicken breasts, yeah.
So tell us about the I've seen the video you have with the ice cream and all that.
How is your diet?
Like what is the question here from my buddy is what is Alex's fitness routine aside from what he has said, diet as well.
Yeah, like right now I haven't worked out in like 3 or 4 weeks, which is not as common for me.
47:46
But I go through seasons.
I would say, like, I didn't.
I didn't miss more than a week of working out for like 16 years.
Wow.
And then I in my old age, you know, I'm crossing 19 years of training now.
So I've like for everyone who's like the entrepreneurs who like all of a sudden decide to like start getting into fitness and then they start lecturing people when they've only been doing working out for like 2 years.
48:08
Like I read the book in the article and I know the guy who wrote it.
I know how he makes his money and you're not seeing the whole truth, but that's OK.
With which article?
I'm just saying like in general, like whatever that thing is that you're like really obsessed about right now, it's because you understand it very.
Like, I'm all keto, I'm intermittent fasting.
48:24
I do high carb, you know, high carb or I only do vegan or I like whatever make believe thing you have.
Like there's a few things that matter and everything else is just preference, you know what I mean?
And so I don't know if this is an evolism, but like if you can't do it for a decade, don't do it for a day.
And so there's definitely been seasons when I'll train harder, but overall I do resistance training because it's the number one thing for, you know, longevity, maintaining bone mass, etcetera.
48:52
And then from a health perspective, it just comes down to calorie intake from a body aesthetics and then making sure that you have the vitamins that you need and micronutrients.
But like for most people in the developed world, we don't normally have vitamin deficiencies and we usually don't have mineral deficiencies.
Again, that clinic that you go to where they do the blood work and they can have you chew on something and then spit it out and it does pink and then you take a supplement, then it's blue.
49:15
Like you have to understand these are also businesses.
Like I come from the health and fitness world.
Like, I think there's there's games behind these things.
And so I try to keep things as simple as possible.
I eat 2 lbs of meat a day.
That's how I get my 200 grams of protein in.
That is very easy for me to do.
And then I have dessert in excess of my calories to hit my goal.
49:33
If I want to lose weight, I eat less dessert.
If I if I want to maintain weight, I eat the same amount.
If I want to gain weight, I'll add other calories to my other meals that have meat in them.
So rather than just meat off meat and pasta or meat and rice, whatever.
But training has been progressive overload on resistance training meaning weights and machines and plate loaded machines for almost 2 decades.
49:53
Got it.
Is there anything else?
It's I I think you probably.
My guess here is that you started out and then you tried all the things and it's like, no, let's just simplify to these and these work you do anything around.
Anything else that's strange like preventative healthcare.
50:08
People are like Oh yeah, the MRI scans, all this type of stuff.
I don't maybe I will later, but right now I I don't.
I've I've focused, I mean all the things that I just mentioned.
So like I did kittable only training, I did barefoot training, I did exclusively swim Sprint training.
I've done high intensity interval training.
50:24
I've done like all strongman style training.
I've I was a competitive power lifter for five years and now people would probably consider me more like a bodybuilder esque in terms of training style and aesthetics.
And so like I have done a lot of different styles of training and when it comes to diet, I did the warrior diet.
50:41
When you ate one big meal at night, I've done intermittent fasting.
I've done alternate day fasting.
I've done I've done keto.
I've done all the opposite of keto.
So like high high carbs, super low fat, high protein.
I've done zone.
I've like, I have done them.
50:57
And it was because in my first decade of fitness, you hop on all of these trains.
Because part of it is like, you want to experiment, you want to learn, you want to see how you react.
And part of it is because you believe the magic, right?
There's something different.
But there's a few fundamental truths, and they all come down to physics, which is just like law of thermodynamics.
51:14
Like there's a certain amount of energy that you consume, and if you have less than that, you will lose fat, period.
It will get taken from energy stores like, well, what about starvation mode and things like that?
Like there was a Minnesota starvation study where they had starved people for like months, no food.
And the biggest decrement they saw in basal metabolic rate was 30%.
51:32
And so that means that when you're truly starving, your BMR goes to 70%, which I mean is significant.
But it's also not like, like the women that I used to, you know, have at my gym, like, I think I'm in starvation mode.
I was like, I think you just snack, you know, like I was like if you want to see starvation mode, go to Africa.
51:50
Like, none of them have Cellulite because they are starving.
Like, you know, we use these words.
But like in order to truly get that level of decrement and decrease in your, you know, BMR, you have to really be restricting for a very long period of time.
And most people don't even track what they eat.
52:07
And so like if you don't track what you eat, it's kind of like the guy with the opinion, like I don't, I don't care.
Like you don't even have data.
So.
And the the thing with any of these these, you know, diets or at least approaches is you have a certain calorie intake that you maintain your body weight at.
52:22
The thing that fudges this is that people are very bad at measuring what they take in, like what they eat and they're but that's even that's still easier than measuring what your output is because you have non exercise activity That relates to like if I'm if I'm bobbing my foot or I'm chewing more gum or I'm taking the stairs more I'm cleaning the house, Like those few 100 calories a day over a week or over a month add up a lot.
52:47
And so usually what happens is when you get older, your metabolism doesn't necessarily decrease nearly as much as people's activity decreases.
And so they think that their metabolism's really slow.
But it's like when you were 20, you were in two rec leagues and you had to walk across campus at college, and you were walking three miles a day and you'd even notice it, right, With a backpack on that was like 25 lbs, right?
53:08
Like it was rocking now, but like, you just had a backpack as you were a student.
And so it's just like we have these perspective shifts that have to happen, but there's a few things that happen.
Progressive overload, meaning you lift more weight over time, works.
That builds muscle, right?
Protein increase builds and maintains muscle hormones.
53:24
Build and maintain muscle.
Calorie surpluses help maintain anabolic states.
Calorie deficits.
You lose tissue, you go into catabolic states.
Period.
That's it.
The rest of it is preference.
Yep.
Look, I I think this all wraps well together because it's.
53:41
The reason I bring this up too is because you've simplified it and just like business, it's.
It comes down to people, right?
A lot of blocking and tackling.
Same thing with this, the health stuff too.
It's like we're there's a lot of distractions.
Oh, there's this new diet over here.
Oh, should we like cold plunge or should we like infrared sauna?
Like, should we, I don't know, blue light blocking, whatever, right?
54:00
But it just comes down to the simple stuff and I talk about this just for context.
So this is for you guys.
You can add it back in.
Is this is purely from the perspective of aesthetics.
If you want to maintain a certain amount of body mass with a certain percentage of fat and certain percentage of muscle those are the only things that matter.
54:17
The other stuff it, it gets into, you know, magic and and all the stuff that I, I don't, I don't partake in.
And what's interesting is like I don't talk about fitness much and it's mostly because I am.
So I mean it's been 20 years.
So like I'm I'm, I've been in.
54:33
I've been knowing about fitness for longer than knowing about business for a context.
And so I also did that professionally for a very long time.
And a lot of like the the YouTube world and like the influencer world or people that follow me don't know, like they see that I'm quote jacked.
But like I wrote the plans that 4000 gyms use like you've probably used my stuff And so you know people are like, oh this guy has such great thinking.
54:57
But then if I make a comment about food, then everyone feels entitled to an opinion because they have a body, right.
Right.
So they.
But, like, they How many people have you helped change?
Like, their physiques?
Probably not many.
And you probably can't even change your own.
55:12
So, like, it's kind of like in in in business where, like, no one wealthier than you will take shots at you.
No guy who's ever been more jacked than me has ever said anything negative to me about fitness stuff.
It's only like laptop warriors and whatnot.
And so, like, again, my, my level of care is so much more passionate about helping people make money to, like, sustain their families and whatnot.
55:34
And it's, I don't have a lot of passion anymore around fitness.
And maybe it's been 2 decades and maybe that's why.
But yeah, to me, it's the the equation's been simplified.
And The thing is, is that business?
I remember this.
There was a moment when I stopped reading Tea Nation.
And mind you, that's not where I got my source of content.
But I'm just saying, like, it was like back in, I mean, back in the like the early 2000s, there's like all these articles for, like lifting and nutrition and stuff.
55:57
And I remember there was a day when I was like, I think I get it like I, I human bodies haven't changed.
And so I I have a sufficient amount of knowledge to do all the things that I need to do and to help other people do what they need to do.
And so my consumption of new stuff dropped dramatically because everything at this point is such a small increment in terms of changes in physique and performance and all that stuff that like sleeping well, eating your protein and working out are still so big compared to everything else that it just doesn't matter.
56:28
And the reason I think I got into to business and I've stayed and I think I will continue to be interested in business whereas I my, my love of fitness started to wane is because business changes all the time.
Yep.
So like bodies haven't changed, but business in the market changes all the time and I think that's why I love.
56:45
Best game ever.
All right, last question for you.
Your coach is 80 year old Alex, if you're not mistaken.
What are some things that 80 year old Alex has told you recently?
Sometimes you have to give time, time.
I mean most of the themes of my 85 year old self, like if there was like a handful of themes that our conversations lead toward.
57:06
One is like, this doesn't matter.
Like it's gonna work out either way.
And since me it's like basically just zoom out.
So that's probably one.
A second theme is just around patience, which is like, I think you just need to stay busy.
I don't think you need to do anything about this.
57:22
So that's a second one.
I think redefining problems is not problems.
Like my my undefeated heavyweight champion of the world's solution is to decide something isn't a problem.
OK, I like that.
Yeah, like, like, how do I solve this?
It's like, what if I just decided it wasn't a problem to begin with and kept living my life and that a lot of times when you're 85, I feel like you have more of that perspective.
57:41
It's like, that's just not.
I'm just not.
I'm gonna decide that's not a problem.
Yeah, no fucks given, right?
Yeah, and so I would say those are three.
But dude, patience is by far the biggest one.
And and and I'll give the 4th embracing uncertainty because I and many of us want a guarantee from a world that doesn't give them.
58:07
It's like I want to know that this is going to work, which is such a fallacious thought at the onset, because if I actually knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that something would happen, I would lose all interest because then it would be boring.
It's like having the cheat codes and playing a video game.
It's good for like 5 seconds and then you realize it's not a challenge at all.
And so like I have this desire that if it actually were met would be the ultimate undoing of my desire.
58:28
So it's just a complete smokescreen that I've made-up in my head.
And so my 85 year old self just I would say like most of the time it just points, it doesn't have to say anything.
It's just like you're like, but it's crazy though, how powerful it is.
Because I don't have, like if I had a a therapist or a coach or something, I'd have to spend 90% of my time trying to give context to the problem that I know the answer to and I'm just not doing it.
58:51
Like we give significantly better advice to other people than we adhere to ourselves.
That's the paradox you're talking about, Solomon's paradox, Yeah.
And so if we can harness our own ability to give better advice with the absolute context that we have on our situation and the aligned incentives that we have that no one else can have as aligned incentives for us as we are, then I think it unlocks it.
59:10
Another level of quote coaching that's been tremendously helpful for me.
And I would say that I haven't like my sessions with Solomon, even though it's me, but I just call it Solomon in my head.
Sometimes they're really long and sometimes they're short because sometimes like, things are working and I'm good.
59:28
And so I kind of see it as like the the therapist or the performance coach that is on demand.
Like if I need him, he's there.
And I have a blocked, you know, hour in my calendar every Monday.
It's the first thing I do every Monday is have my time with Solomon.
But it's rare that I take the full hour.
59:44
It's usually between 5 minutes and 30 minutes is usually what.
Are you sitting around?
You walk in.
Oh no.
I'm on my computer.
So I actually do a chat back and forth, and I go from him to me, him to me, him to me, and I type out all the response because I think even typing out what my question is, even like like many problems, if you can probably ask ask the right question, that's 90% of the solution.
1:00:04
Is asking the right question or precisely stating the problem you're trying to solve.
And so that process helps me solve most of the issues that come up that aren't really issues to begin with.
I love it.
Well, I know we can go on forever, but what?
We're going to end it right here.
So what is the best way for people to find the book?
1:00:21
And I mean, just Google.
Alex.
Emoji, right?
How do you find the book?
Yeah, you can go to, I mean you can go to Amazon, but if you want to go to acquisition.com/leads and we also have training and courses and other materials that are all free, no opt in on the side at acquisition.com.
1:00:39
And if you are a company and you have, you know an EBITDA of a million, two million, 5 million. 8 million hit us up.
We're always looking for great founders who we're looking for growth partners because that's what our day job is.
All right, I love it.
Alex, thanks so much for doing this.
Thanks, Rob.

Let's be real.
You're not going to change your entire business for the holidays to make something sound different, but you can make it look different based on how you present it.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast The Game is my attempt at documenting the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:17
My hope is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to $100 million and beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
The holidays are upon us and most businesses make more money in the last month of the year than they do any other month.
0:35
If you own a business or you work for a business, this is your opportunity to capitalize.
And every one of these presents I'm going to open up and give you 1 holiday money making tactic, starting with this one.
So let's open this guy up.
What do we have inside?
We've got diapers and we've got baby bottles.
0:52
Now what do these have to do with making money inside of diapers?
And the baby bottles is actually one of the strongest concepts for holiday marketing, which is something called a loss leader.
So what is a loss leader?
A loss leader is basically where you sell a very well understood product and you sell it for less than the market understands the prices for.
1:09
So you sell it at a loss.
Now why would it be called a loss leader?
The leader part of it is that it brings people in the door.
Most people know that if you have a baby, you got to buy diapers.
The highest percentage of the population you have babies buy diapers.
They all need diapers.
Sell the thing that most of them understand what the price is for, that almost all customers will buy so that you can bring them the door.
1:30
Because if you have the cheapest diapers, they're going to come buy diapers from you.
Now what they might not know the prices for are all the ancillary purchases they might make once they come into your store, whether that's a digital store or a physical brick and mortar store.
Like these non drip bottles might have insane margins in markup compared to the diapers.
1:46
And so trying to make quarter or two quarters more on the diapers compared to making dollars on the baby bottles is where you can make up what you lost here, but you make it up in significantly more profit and total units sold.
How do you use this for a holiday promotion?
What you want to do is you want to look at your product stack.
2:03
So if I have my services and so there's different components to my services, like for example, and I use fitness a lot, you have access to a facility, that's a component.
You also also have accountability, which is another component, the actual workouts or service with a trainer, you could also have nutrition, meal prepping, eating out, guides, alcohol guide for the holidays.
2:22
So there's lots of components to whatever it is that you sell, whether it's services or products.
Many people sell something like this as a bundle and there's nothing wrong with that, makes it harder for other people to compete with you on price.
But if you take out one of these pieces, let's say, this one's accountability I guess.
And then I say, hey, I'm going to make this 90% off.
2:41
People be like, holy cow, that's a great deal.
And So what happens is you can promote this 90% off thing, which is what a huge holiday promo Big Bash would be like.
And you're like, well, you don't just want accountability, right?
You probably also want some help with your food.
You probably want some workouts, probably want to access the facility, probably want these other things.
2:57
And you're like, you know what?
You're right.
I do kind of need that stuff.
But the reason they came in doesn't necessarily need to be the way you make money.
And so that's the big theory or strategy behind loss lead.
And I'm pretty sure diapers.com, I think was what it was called.
This was the strategy they actually used to take over the baby market was they sold them cheaper than everyone else did, but they made all the profit up on the other ancillary upsell.
3:18
And so this works for products, it works for services, and it even works for technology.
Look at what you have, put it into an itemized list of all the things you could potentially market or advertise, and then you peel off one of them.
I call it splintering your offer.
And then you make an insane discount around one of those pieces.
Now, ideally, even if you lose a little bit of money on this, you will make it up in the total amount of leads.
3:37
And the reason it's so important in general to have a promotion going on during the holidays is the thing I said at the very beginning, most businesses make more money in the last month of the year.
And that's for two reasons.
One, because they advertise more and two, because people want to spend.
So if people are buying during that month, then that's when you want to be selling even more.
3:53
All right, So that's it.
With our loss leaders.
Now we have gift #2 gift cards.
What do gift cards have to do with holiday promotion?
First off, gift cards are one of the most lucrative things that you can sell in general.
Did you know that Best Buy has an insanely low redemption rate?
So when grandma gets all the kids Best Buy gift cards, the percentage of people who actually spend the money is very low.
4:14
But it essentially is is a loan that a customer gives to a business and the business just keeps the cash on their balance sheet, can earn interest on it while they wait to redeem for it, and after a certain point of expiration they can just keep all of the money without even providing goods.
Unbelievably pretty profitable thing.
People literally give you money for nothing.
Not a bad idea.
4:29
But how do we use this besides the way Best Buy did to generate leads?
So I call this the gift card strategy and this is one that I used all the time.
My brick and mortar location.
You offer $200.00 gift cards to your services, 1 purchase worth of services.
So if you give out massages or you have a membership to a facility or you do cleanings, it doesn't really matter what it is, but one unit's worth.
4:50
You do that dollar amount as a gift card.
That's number one one full unit in dollar amounts.
That's step one.
The next step is that you market to your existing customers.
Step three is you say this is a $200.00 gift card, but I'm selling it for 90% off or 80% off.
5:08
Whatever you want.
I'm going to say 90 because I'm going, I'm going big here.
So your $200.00 gift card is actually 20 bucks, which is 90% off.
Remember, we're trying to get attention, everyone else is doing promos and we need to breakthrough the noise and this is a crazy good promotion.
But here's the catch.
Only as gifts for friends and family.
5:27
So this is the ultimate stocking stuffer.
You tell your entire client base they can buy two of these gifts for other people, and they get the credit for being $200 because it's a gift card.
So imagine you open a gift that says $200.00 on it.
You're stoked.
The fact that grandma went to Alex's gym and she only paid 20 for it.
5:44
You don't know that, nor do you really care.
But this is the genius part of this strategy.
Number one, this is an insane promotion, so you're going to get a lot of attention and a lot of people are going to want to buy it. #2 is that you're actually going to get paid money for selling these gift cards.
But here's the secret.
All of this is new customers.
6:02
And So what this basically means is that you're going to get paid to get new customers, and you would probably give the services away for free anyways to get a customer.
But rather than marketing and spending money to get someone in the door to try your stuff out, you're going to get paid to do it.
But not only that, these are the highest quality customers because they're referrals and referrals buy in higher rates, stay in higher rates, and because they're coming from somebody else, they can usually help assist them in kind of onboarding and figuring out the app.
6:27
If you need to check in for a facility or whatever it is that you sell, you get the assist from the friends.
You can AA client base because you can get every single person to bring not one but two.
And the reason we limited 2 per customer is because it increases the perceived value.
You could sell 2 units and make it 70% off, 2 units would be $400.00 and you give 70% off, which would be 60 bucks.
6:44
Doesn't matter.
You're getting paid to get new customers and the highest quality source.
And so one of the important details to do with this is that when you make the sale, ask them who they're going to give it to and get the contact information.
So not only that, you're actually going to get these as leads.
So if for whatever reason that person doesn't redeem it, you can follow up with the lead to bring them in.
7:02
And because you'll have the contact information, you can do a three-way intro with the customer who bought it and the prospect.
But what else can you do with this?
The gift card is for $200, right?
Well, what if everybody who comes in, you have a sales console with and you try and sell them all $1000 thing?
Well now you take that $200, you mark it off and you can turn these into $800 sales and that's the last step of this.
7:23
So big picture, one full unit 200, four $100 whatever one unit or whatever it is you sell is limit it in some way 2-3 people per person make it 90% off, 80% off, so you get paid for it, limit it to referrals of friends so they're not going to use it on themselves.
So they bring more customers, get the three-way introduction, so you get the leads and and then when you bring them in, actually sit down with them for a sale.
7:44
And this is one of those great things that you can use to immediately attract tons of new customers at a profit during the holidays when it's hard to breakthrough.
So that's enough with that.
All right.
Now we're going to talk about what's inside of here.
Ah, it's tickets.
So this strategy is about high ticket.
7:59
So let me explain how this works.
You look at what your services are and think what would the ultimate version of this be like 10 times or 50 times as expensive as whatever I normally charge like a complete transformation.
This works especially well with services, which is what I'm focusing on.
You could probably think of a version of it for physical product.
If my normal client load, let's say at my business is I have 100 clients, I can't manage more than that.
8:18
Then you say, OK, I'm going to limit this promotion to 5% of my customer base.
If you're a hair person, you have this many customers or you're a chiropractor, this many customers, it doesn't really matter.
But you say this how many I have and I'm limiting it to this.
You say, hey, I'm doing this personal program that you're going to get more service.
8:34
This is the 10X to 50 or 100 X of your normal price with a massive scarcity.
So you limit it to five to 10% of your customers.
I'd recommend 5 if it's your first time because you want to sell out, That's the point.
And then next year you can bump it to six percent, 7%.
Let's say that you sell normally a $200 thing.
8:51
Well then you would sell something that's between $2000 and $20,000, which sounds like a huge price gap and it is.
But The thing is, is that most customers are fractal.
And So what that means is that it's eighty, 2020% of customers will spend five times more than 80%.
And so when you do 5%, it's actually 8020 twice.
So you have the remaining 20 that are the five time spenders and you do another 8020 on that.
9:09
That's the magic between 5% because those customers are 2 standard deviations above the rest of the group.
And we capitalize on that by making a product or service package that people like that want to buy because it's scarce.
Let's say you had 100 customers and you sell five of them, a $5000 package.
9:25
You make $25,000.
And if you're used to making $10,000 a month or $20,000 a month from your remaining customer base, you can literally double your revenue that month only by selling 5% of your customers, a much more expensive thing.
The key to making this work?
You build lots of hype around it before the holidays.
You advertise the crap out of how scarce it is.
9:41
And you talk about the minute it's going to go live and you prepare people, you say, hey, have your credit cards ready, be ready for it because I'm going to drop it and they're going to sell it immediately.
And then when you do, the moment you get your first sale, let everyone know four left, three left, two left, one left, sold out.
Every time you do that, you'll drive even more FOMO and more scarcity and more purchases.
9:59
So that's the high ticket, high scarcity strategy.
Hey, MO's edition quick Break.
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, so send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag?
10:16
Them in one of my relayless posts and I will give you all the love of the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Let's open up our next gift.
We've got shirts.
Wow.
Not only is there one shirt, there's two shirts in this package.
And how are we going to do one shirt to get someone to buy 2 shirts?
10:33
I'll tell you.
So this strategy is called Free with Prepaid by X.
Yet why free?
We're talking holiday season.
We're talking special occasion.
The key to this is how insane you make the free thing.
If you're giving away your core service, then what you can do is think about what's the highest margin service I have and package that in a way that you can have people prepaid to get X amount free if it's services or buy X and get Y free.
10:58
And I'll tell you the first place I learned this.
So there's a place in Nashville I saw and I came back ten years later and it was still there and it had expanded.
So I was like, oh, they must be doing well.
And their entire window pane said buy one, get 2 free.
And it was pairs of boots.
And I was like, that's wild.
11:13
So I went inside the store and I was like, huh, I wonder how this works.
And the boots were all 600 bucks.
Now if you're familiar with cowboy boots, cowboy boots probably run about $200 normally.
So all they did was they tripled the price for one pair and said buy one, get 2 free.
And they capitalized on the fact that for them specifically, there was Bachelorette parties and all the girls come in, it's like, well, I'll buy one and then my friends will get 2 free or whatever.
11:35
And ideally, if you really want this thing to crush, you actually give more away free than you charge for.
So it's buy one, get 2 free.
It's not even just buy one T-shirt, get a second T-shirt free, it's buy one T-shirt, get 3T shirts free.
But The thing is, is that for most products and services you can increase the price of the one.
11:54
And so if you want to have a level of service that you haven't offered before that you want to do specific for the holidays or a product you want to come out with, this is the perfect time to do it because no one had any comparison for the pricing.
Let's say normally I would sell these shirts for 5 bucks a pop.
I might say buy one shirt for $10 and get 2 free.
12:13
Now what ended up happening is that I got $10 and I sold three shirts, which is really just like a 30% discount.
Not a huge deal, but the perception of how much more compelling get one to get more free than what you paid for is the thing that drives the buying behavior.
So I just gave you a few different physical products examples, but this is actually super deadly with services, but it can be abused and then some people can become dependent on this.
12:35
There are businesses that I have looked at in order to invest and decided not to invest because they were too dependent on this because it's such a strong strategy and the reason it's so strong is because there's all the cash is front loaded.
So normally, if let's say you have a recurring membership of some kind that's $100 dollars per month, that means it's going to take you a year to get $1200.
12:51
But if you say, hey, I'll give you the year for $600.00 one time, that's a crazy discount.
Here's the key.
If you're really expensive for whatever it is that you sell, they have to prepaid it.
They can't lock in the price and then say, can I make a payment plan on your discounted services?
13:07
Like, no, it doesn't work that way.
That's the normal price if that's what you want with any of these things.
If you want to make sure that you limit downside if you are worried about too many people, quote taking advantage of it, you can drive even more scarcity by limiting quantity.
For most holiday promotions I'd recommend doing anyways because one you can just get your immediate shot, you don't risk the business, and you can take some cash off the table that you can buy your own Christmas presence with this one.
13:29
I've even seen work really effectively as a grand opening strategy, even though we're talking about holidays.
But if you wanted to cash flow, the opening of a facility so that you could cover all the costs of the place without even having to take capital out of your pocket, you just say, hey, for the 1st 50 people who sign up as patients at my chiropractor clinic or my first fifty patients at my dental clinic or my first 50 whatevers, you just say, cool, if you buy six, I'll give you 6.
13:52
And they're like, holy cow, what a deal.
Now again, you control the price and you can control the service.
And this is a key part.
Let's say we want to have this $100 month as our standard service.
So what we'll do is we can bump this price, let's say, to $200 a month for this promotion.
14:08
Pause.
Don't think I'm doing something.
I think, oh, let me explain.
You then add in one to two things you wouldn't normally do with the main service that don't cost you a lot but is enough to differentiate the off offers so that if someone else later comes in is paying $100 a month, this person doesn't get upset because you can clearly say, well that person doesn't get these things that you get and they're like, oh, that's the reason why.
14:27
And so if you're going to use this promotion, if you're already in business, come up with a service level that you already have, add one to two things.
You can increase the price and then do buy six, get 6 or buy four, get 8.
And you can drive an insane amount of cash and purchases in a short window.
14:43
And then you can limit it by saying no more than X can buy.
And it's one of the strongest promotions that you can run anytime year.
But specifically during the holidays, it crushes.
So that's our buy X, get Y free.
Now let's talk about the final thing, which is the wrapping paper itself.
So we give 4 strategies on how you can maximize how much dollars you make during the holidays.
15:02
Let's see what present #5 has.
So we've got a magic hat and a magic wand.
Now why is this relevant?
It's actually more about the wrapping paper itself, because every one of the strategies that I outlined is basically a gift that you can deliver to your customers and you can actually use them year round, but they're especially powerful during the holidays.
15:20
But the key is how you want to wrap it.
Because let's be real, you're not going to change your entire business for the holidays to make something sound different, but you can make it look different based on how you present it.
And that's where the magic wrapping paper comes in.
I call it magic because it's an acronym.
M is a magnetic reason why.
All right, This is key.
15:35
The reason why we already have solved for us because it's the holidays and everyone expects that.
But the rest of the year, you can still use the same concept.
The 2nd is the avatar is that you actually want to say who you're targeting.
You don't want to just say this is available for everyone.
You want to say it's available for a local market or somebody of a certain age group or someone who has a certain interest.
15:54
Any of those things you want to call out.
So they're like, oh, this is for me.
And then they pay attention.
G is for goal is what's the ultimate outcome you want the person to experience.
What is the dream that they envision in their minds that you want to say that you can help them deliver through the gift that we're wrapping with this wrapping paper?
The I is for a time interval, which basically just says when is this person going to get this goal or when are they going to experience it.
16:16
And then C is something that I call the container word.
I don't have a fancy word for this, I just know that it has worked and it continues to.
So this is when you say blueprint, accelerator, program intensive, whatever, right?
Launchpad Like there's a million different words that you can use to bucket in all of the things that you're trying to sell in one bundle.
16:34
If I wanted to do something around stress, right, I might say avatar busy moms.
So we got our avatar check goal is relaxation.
Holidays is my reason why.
Interval 30 days and then this would be getaway.
16:53
So just like that we can create our busy mom's 30 day relaxation getaway for the holidays.
Boom.
And so if we're a spa we put this together in the call out for a promotion.
This becomes the naming convention that we use around the first four.
So this could be our reason why we're doing a loss leader for the diapers or that we are giving the gift card or making it available is because we want them to bring their other busy mom friends.
17:19
Or if we have a high ticket thing, then we say this is only for this specific type of person, which is why only 5% of our audience can buy it because it's the high scarcity, high ticket program.
Or the reason we're saying you can buy one and get 2 free is because of these things.
And so this magic wrapper allows you to give the wrapping paper that we're going to put on any of the first promotions to get even more people to want to buy yours compared to everyone else's.






0:00
The closer you can have the trust so that when you make the recommendation, it's like having a referral.
The person will believe you because the way you are saying it is believable and the way to make it believable is to actually believe it.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:20
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk, and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I'm going to tell you the number one way to increase the percentage of sales that get closed by you and your team through a systematic process.
0:38
And so the reason I want to make this is years ago I was recruited to bring in or to be brought in and flown in for a sales consulting gig which I don't do.
And it was it was years ago but the team was selling mortgage leads And so they wanted me to do is the first half of the day I I took apart the the actual sales script and rescript everything kind of reframe the offer all that kind of stuff.
1:00
And the second-half of the day I was supposed to train the team.
Right.
And so after spending the first half on that talking to the founders all that kind of stuff.
The second-half they had a nine person team and they were selling mortgage leads.
And when I walked in the first thing that I asked the team was hey, and they were like, hey, this guy.
1:17
John's been kind of a problem.
I was like, OK, cool.
I was like hey John, how good are the leads?
Whole team's there.
It's quiet ever.
Like precious on John.
He's like, well, I mean they're And I was like, I'm good, thanks so much.
And everyone was like, what is happening?
1:32
I was like, dude, I can give you the best script in the world.
I was like, but if you don't believe in the product, I was like, none of this is going to matter.
I said if you believed in the leads, I was like, you wouldn't even need the script.
Because if you were to ask me the same question and I truly believe that these leads were amazing, I was like, I would be like, dude, these leads are sick.
1:51
I mean, right now my, my cousin is a realtor and I'm sending herd leads right now because she's already building so much of A pipeline from it.
I'm actually studying for a realtor exam so that I can so I can buy these leads from this company and not even sell these, but sell houses instead, right.
Because houses have a bit bigger ticket than these leads do, right.
2:08
And so for me, like, I'm just basically waiting to get through to that point so that I can move out on my own.
But yeah, I mean, these leads are awesome.
So the way that you talk about the products that you have will indicate the level of conviction that you have.
And the best sales people are true believers and you that's why a lot of great salesman come from clients who've used the products and services if it makes sense for them for their life and whatnot.
2:32
And so people will believe like if you think about what sales really is, it's a transference of conviction.
And so you've got some person who doesn't believe, one person who does believe and trust is what completes the transfer and you have to duplicate the conviction in this person and this person.
2:48
And so if a sales person doesn't believe in the product, they have no way to transfer the conviction because they have no baseline of conviction to work off.
And a different version of this happens when people start hot, they do really well, and all of a sudden they start not selling as well.
3:05
It's not because they don't know how to sell.
And training is not the thing that's going to fix the problem because they're already closing before and they're not closing now, it means they've changed something.
And often times it's because they've heard something from one of the prospects they sold that something was not good.
3:21
And so the way to prevent this and to actively increase conviction, which is what's going to change the way they say the words on the script is by actively having a process to make them believe, right.
And so obviously, the way to make a believe is to actually have a good product.
3:36
But in terms of systematizing that, it's having a regular cadence between customer success and sales.
So this is me getting a little bit operational with you, but this is how it works.
You meet weekly and you have both teams on and the people from customer success share the wins of the clients who are going through the program that's on a weekly basis and it's a long form format.
3:55
It also services as as a way for them to talk back and forth to each other.
The sales team can see what's happening on the customer success side.
The customer success side can see what's happening on the sales side and you create cross departmental knowledge which is really useful because the sales team knows not to say some things because people are misunderstanding them and the success team is giving the sales team ammunition for the things that they know that they're doing to deliver that makes them more convicted.
4:17
On top of that, you should have a pipeline that is established for customers where you can collect testimonials and reviews.
And what you do is in the best case scenario you have that client hop on with the sales team and explain their story.
And I can tell you this because me first hand, one of the things that I realized when I looked at our stats was that on Saturdays, in particular, Saturdays, we were closing like 100% of people who were walking in the door.
4:41
And I was like, huh, what's different about these days at my facilities versus the days that we're not, You know, we're closing a normal amount.
And it turned out that those days were the days that we would actually do the way outs for our program.
So people would finish their six week or their 12 weeks or whatever it was, and we would do all the way outs on the same day.
4:59
And so it's kind of like a graduation ceremony.
So everyone steps on, they're crying, they're losing weight.
They feel amazing.
But all of my team was there and so when we had sales consults that were that morning or throughout the graduation day or right after the graduation was all fresh in their mind, they would, when someone walk in, it's like the sales took half as long because the belief in the conviction was so strong and the salesman, it overcame the fears and the doubts of the prospect, right.
5:25
And so in a lot of ways, you have to compensate for lack of conviction with training and you know, learning logical based frameworks and and learning how to have excellent conversation, right, that they help people make decisions.
But if you truly believe and if you think about how we buy things as prospects, we buy these things because somebody recommends them and we believe the person.
5:49
Like, think about an organic buying process, right.
Someone says, hey, have you gone to that sandwich shop?
It's awesome.
Like, you're like, well great, I'm going to go there, right?
Like, why would I not?
And so the closer you can have the trust so that when you make the recommendation, it's like having a referral.
The person will believe you because the way you are saying it is believable and the way to make it believable is to actually believe it.
6:15
Mosa Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to fifty $100 million plus, we would love to talk to you.
And if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com.
You can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
6:34
And so having a structured process of increasing the conviction of the sales team is a way to massively increase the closing percentages of your team, not based on skill, but based on heart.
And so if you can bridge that gap between the customer's success in the sales team and you can do that both internally and externally.
6:53
Internally, because you have processes externally because you get those customers on the call so they can hear the stories, but also you and the sales directors can read those testimonials every single day to them in the morning.
And I like that because it sets the cadence for the day because it reminds us why we do what we do on a regular basis.
7:11
Why am I taking these calls?
Why am I knocking on these doors?
Why am I setting up shop and collecting leads at the Whole Foods so that I can so we can make sales later.
Like, why am I doing this?
I'm doing this so that I can be a part of this transformation these people are going through as a result of whatever products and services we sell.
7:27
And so customer support and sales, I feel like are very similar in that they get beat up all day long and salespeople especially.
And so this is for the founders and the CEOs are going out there and they're fighting for you every single day.
They're the frontline in my opinion.
They're the offensive line of the team.
7:43
They're just pushing.
They're in the in the trenches, moving the ball forward every, you know, 1-2 yards at a time.
They're chipping away at it and they're pushing your products forward every single day on your behalf.
And so the biggest thing that a sales director, and if you were the sales director because your business is smaller, is that you have to breathe conviction into them because their conviction can wane over time.
8:07
And it's a cup that has to be refilled because it's that conviction that they're spreading to all the prospects.
And The thing is, the prospects are spreading doubt into them.
And so you have to fill it up from your side so that they can become deluded and then get refilled, right.
Which is why a good sales person comes in, they can crush and all of a sudden they start going down.
8:24
It's not because of skill because they already had the skills.
They already knew how to.
They already knew how to close and they came in.
The problem was their mojo was off.
All right.
And so this is fundamentally about fixing mojo within a sales team, which is just getting them to believe and reminding them to believe, which is why one of the biggest things I have in sales is we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
8:42
Like people who believe in something automatically sell it.
And I'll give you a final, final example to drive this point home.
I'll just use the the Christian community overall or really just any kind of religious community in general.
A big part of most faiths is spreading the faith right and you can tell when someone truly believes the faith.
9:02
They're on fire with the face because they they truly believe it.
And it's not like people go through sales training, right, to bring people to faith, right.
They just truly believe in it.
And if you've ever been around someone who has absolute conviction, because conviction, and this is the key point, is not do you believe in the product?
9:23
Do you not believe in the product?
But to what extent do you believe in the product?
How much and how deeply do you believe?
That is the predictor of your ability to close, right?
A massive predictor of your ability to close.
Which is why so many founders are always some of the best promoters for their businesses because they believe in it more than everyone else.
9:41
And they should be.
But you can duplicate that ability in getting other people to believe by having a process in place to do so and understanding that the training, the blocking, tackling in terms of like say this and that, say this and that.
Sure, it's important.
It's good to have those.
They're tools, right?
9:56
They're tools that you have in your tool belt.
But the fundamental work ethic that someone will fight and their desire to actually help someone is the difference between them thinking about themselves so they can get their Commission check.
And then thinking about the prospect and how this person is missing out on something that's genuinely going to help them and really transform their life and really solve the problems that they have.
10:15
And they will fight for the sale so much longer because they genuinely want this person to win, because they genuinely believe that your products and services are actually going to help them.
And so bridging that gap and understanding this for myself was so important because a lot of times we get obsessed with the the drills and all the stuff.
10:32
And you have to do that stuff for sure.
You have to drill.
You have to understand how to say the words all that kind of stuff.
But the heart, if you can, if you could change the heart and you can depth in, right.
Because it's not just like I said it's not just do they believe but how deeply convicted can I get this team to be.
10:47
And that is where having proof where you're actively selling your sales team, that is where you'll get the outsize returns in my opinion on increasing the effectiveness of the team is that they truly and deeply to their core belief.
And the last point that I was making is if you've ever been around someone who truly believes in something and it's like, kind of insane, like whatever.
11:08
The thing is, like, it could be aliens, It could be whatever, right?
But like something crazy.
But they are like, so sold on it.
There's an element of yourself that wonders if you're right because you have conviction, too, in whatever you believe.
And so you see their depth of conviction, their depth of faith in the thing that they have concluded.
11:28
And the deeper it is, the more you start to question your own beliefs, which is why the pastors of huge churches typically have deep, deep faith.
And it's like there's a lot to study in terms of converting people literally, because you're changing someone's entire world view.
11:45
And so if you study the process that people come to faith and how they convince others to come to faiths in general, there's a lot of elements of selling that occur there, right?
In helping people make decisions to help themselves.
And so the person who typically does the converting can never believe less in the thing that they're trying to convert someone into than the person who's being converted, right?
12:07
The person has to believe in your conviction more than they believe in their doubt in the story that they have been telling themselves.
And so the skills are simply a way to clearly communicate and build trust so that your conviction can be transferred.
But it starts with having the conviction to begin with in order to initiate the transfer over the bridge of trust.
12:29
And so this is the number one thing that I see missing from sales trainings and it's one of the easiest things that we can do to implement in a team or even in yourself to improve your numbers overall in your business.








0:00
You just spent two years of your life dedicated to this book and blew the launch out of the water.
So what now?
Today we're going to be going to four different podcasts to talk about what's next for the brand and beyond.
0:15
Thank you.
Can I have a piece of gum?
Oh, it's your last one.
I'm not going to do that to you.
No, No, I will never take a man's last piece of gum.
No, it's crude and unusual.
Thank you.
So the last piece is always a holy piece.
I would have done this with him and like split it leading the trim style my man.
0:36
Yeah, that's rock.
Your wedding ring is rubber.
Yeah, the other ring.
It would get a little tight while I was sleeping and I would end up taking it off while I'm asleep and I'd be like, where is it, Mark?
You are ridiculously good at writing instruction manuals for how to make money.
But if people don't know how to think and they've got a life structure that doesn't make any sense and they're wasting time on the social media or even just a friend group that is going nowhere fast, what advice do you have for them to get back from?
1:02
One of my favorite quotes from BF Skinner, who was a behavioral psychologist from way back in the day, was you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make a drink, he said.
Well.
If you bleed it out enough and you starve it and you leave it in the sun and you put the water right in front of its mouth, he's like, I can veritably guarantee that I can make a drink.
And so if you were to think about yourself as that horse and it's like, OK, well what is the equivalent of the the, the bloodletting, the dehydration, the starving that you can put yourself in to get the behavior you want.
1:26
So starving has a negative connotation, but we can also starve out the negative things in your life, like you can starve the alcohol, you can starve the friends.
And I think the easiest way to do that is to.
Get out of the environment you're in.
I think this was an atomic habits in Vietnam.
1:42
Like I think it was like 10% of troops or something.
We're taking heroin when they were over there in the 70s and they thought there was going to be this massive problem when they came back to the States.
But when they came back to the States, almost no one continued the heroin habit.
And so going from Vietnam, we were doing heroin to the US where you're not doing taking heroin had a 90% success rate, whereas the inverse is true of recovery centers in the United States today.
2:04
People go there and 90% of them relapse when they go back home.
And so the difference is that people were doing heroin in a different environment and then they changed their environment and then they never went back to the environment that they did heroin in.
To be fair, I think the reason a lot of people kind of like some of the content that I put out from a money making perspective is how can I operationalize this word, right.
2:21
So like patience, for example, is when the people throw out a lot.
But for me, defining patience was helpful, which is figuring out what to do in the meantime.
Like that's patience.
Like we're like I'm not patient.
It's like, no, you just need to figure out what to do in the meantime.
I think these are like mental.
Models around using emotions to fuel the behaviors that you want.
2:40
So me defining amorphous terms like confidence, winning, respect, loyalty, sadness, anxiety have come from my own desire to understand the words and reading the dictionary definitions and feeling like they don't provide much and they can't help me.
2:58
What is love?
And you know, people are like, it's a feeling that that doesn't help me.
How do I operationalize this word love for me?
How much are you willing to sacrifice to maintain a relationship?
That is how you can measure love.
Or you could use an example of, like, man, that guy works on that piece of crap car all the time.
3:14
He must really love it, right?
Like he's willing to sacrifice a lot to maintain that thing to the same degree many people would sacrifice everything for their kids.
Now, there's plenty of times where they don't like their kids, but they'd be willing to die for their children.
You might be willing to die for your country.
And so when I define these terms, it has been out of my own self-interest to learn how to navigate life better.
3:34
You just did a book launch.
It was unreal.
I mean, really, like, blew people's minds.
Set a standard.
Or what did you demonstrate in the way that you did that that other people don't understand?
With each book, I wanted to demonstrate the concept of the book with the book itself.
3:50
Since the concept of the book was to advertise and to get lots of leads, then I thought it would be.
Appropriate to advertise and get lots of leads.
And I used every method in the book.
I ran ads for it.
Even I didn't need to run ads.
We still got 137,000 people from ads.
4:07
We had affiliates.
We got 104,000 people there from affiliates.
We had 27,000 affiliates promote the book.
We had customer referrals.
People sent their friends there.
So I had an incentive that if you just get 10 people to come, you'll get two bonus chapters that aren't released with the book.
And so you know the next book I'll try and continue that meta theme of.
4:23
I have concepts in this book and I will show you that they work because I will use them to mark and promote.
The book Tell me on a no strip.
It says be one of zero.
What does that mean?
So one of Zero is a brand that I am really passionate about the concept.
One of Zero actually came from my media team.
4:40
You know, we talk about content in general as one of one content.
Like we try to make content that only we can make.
And that's actually one of my big marketing rules is that say what only you can say, show what only you can show as we were approaching the event.
The team learned more and more about what we were going to be giving away and how much we're putting into it, and they're like, dude, this isn't even one of one, this is one of zero.
4:57
And that statement just clicked.
And then everyone latched onto it because it wasn't about just doing what only we could do, it was doing what no one else would do.
If you look at one of zero 1 / 0 from a mathematical perspective, it's undefined.
And I think a lot of that is stuff that I resonate with, which is doing work that no one else will do, is doing the things that other people will tell you not to do.
5:17
And.
Foregoing the shoulds and the musts and the have to's that people around you tell you to do because they want to project their life and their expeditions on yours.
But you want to live in direct contrast to that because you want to be your own person and be beyond definition and let your actions be the only thing to define you.
5:37
One of one is doing things that only you can do, but one of zero is doing things that you're not even sure you can do yet.
Appreciate you man.
Chick-fil-A Action What is the Chick-fil-A order?
I go 12 count grilled nugs, 4 count fried tenders and then a Spicy Chicken Deluxe.
5:54
No cheese with Chick-fil-A sauce and ranch.
That's to go to.
If you can only choose between one sauce out of every restaurant, it would be no, it would be.
Mustafi are the Persian yogurt sauce.
6:09
Go with the roots.
Yeah, I mean, it also has nutritional value.
Yoga.
It's got protein in it, right?
Little fat.
It's refreshing.
What's the sign of a good podcast interview for you?
#1 is my rapport with the host.
If we're comfortable, then automatically the conversation's going to be better.
6:27
The second thing is how much they know about me and our stuff.
If I'm doing like recaps, it's less interesting.
If I were to do a third and fourth thing, it is quality of the follow on questions.
Because there's some people who have like these are 12 questions that I will ask Alex.
They ask a question, I answer the question, then they say question two, and then they they don't dive deeper into it, which to me makes it almost makes it seem like they're not listening because then it's not a conversation.
6:50
It's really just like 12 short clips.
The last one is really their ability to let silence exist.
I will say that the I have noticed this about the best podcast host.
Is that like they will ask a question and then I might answer.
And they will just, they will just sit at the end of that and then give me another second or two and then I might add something to it.
7:11
That might be the the real nugget or crystallization of thinking.
And if you have a really rushed cadence in terms of how the conversation is going, it becomes more difficult to have thoughtful responses.
Oh wow, What's up stud?
7:29
How's it going, man?
Good to see you, man.
What have you learned in the last year?
The hardest work I have done has been my redefining winning.
I think for me that is like that has been my big unlock for how much effort I could put in to make better and keep pushing.
So I think one of the hardest things as an entrepreneur or just an individual is shifting how you define winning for yourself.
7:48
And it's easy to say it and say of course I'm in the game, I'm winning.
It's much harder to actually believe that.
And so it's easy to make the Instagram clip, but it's hard to live it.
And what's been interesting for me is that I feel like it's unlocked a different level of work ethic.
I thought that the fear of the gun to your head is still the strongest motivator, and it is in the short term.
8:06
But if you need to run a marathon, then you need to have something that is going to sustain for a longer period of time, Like punishment is always stronger, the short term reward is always longer the long term.
And so we have to redefine how we reward ourselves for the work we do.
And so.
8:22
Since I don't believe in legacy, and I don't believe that in 5000 years people are going to remember who I am, I had to make winning working as hard as I could on something.
How do you measure working as hard as you can tough?
I think about a future version of myself who has all the context in my current situation, my skills, the information available to me, the resources I have, and that man, that future man knows what perfect work looks like, which is how much effort can I put into this thing.
8:50
And not be distracted and continue to chisel away at this project.
It's very hard because it means there's very few projects that I can do if I have that level of work as my new standard.
And so if that level of work is the standard and that is what winning is, then I can only do it for a few things.
9:08
There's just a lot of things I'm not going to be able to do.
Which is sad in some ways, but I think a necessary trade off because like we have one Human Life hair band, no strip.
I tested a zillion different bags to get the bag that I have.
I wear one pair of shorts and one beater.
9:26
If I want to conserve space, I can do 2 to 1.
So I can do 2 beaters per one pair of shorts.
I can wear shorts twice.
I know I'm I'm risque like that.
I bring no strips and I usually have one flannel or button down that I bring with me and I wear the same shoes that are appropriate in all venues.
I can wear to the gym.
I can wear them to a restaurant.
9:42
I can wear the most age that makes packing take.
Less than a minute for me.
And that's how I like it.
And so I can pretty much work until the moment we have to leave And I just throw my 2 beaters in and my shorts and I'm good to go.
The first time you put them on, you're like, this is not going to make it better.
If you ever have breathing problems, whenever you've got like a good line of of air, you're like, don't fuck with it, you know, like just let it go.
10:03
So you go here to just destroy all of the good stuff.
And then you take your first breath and you're like, I didn't know I could breathe so well.
I didn't know the air could be so sweet.
What's up, man?
The studs?
What's up, man?
What up, council?
10:19
We need to do something about billionaires.
I am proposing that the city of Los Angeles ban billionaires from the beach.
What do you think is the biggest mistake content creators make today?
Not being them basically getting taken over by the algorithm and then like talking about blue trees when they don't actually fuck with blue trees.
10:38
But they did it because they did one Blue Tree post and people, right?
So you had to.
And so they got a lot of likes.
And they're like, maybe I'll start making more stuff on Blue Trees.
But like, then they go down that alleyway for six months or a year, and then they're like, I'm like the Blue Tree channel.
But like, I don't even care about trees.
Like, that's like the stuff I like talking about.
And so they can't actually sustain it because the biggest brands are built over decades, not days or weeks or months.
10:58
A secret confession.
The majority of my news feed.
Almost all of it is comedians.
And that's because I like comedy.
And I think comedy and philosophy are probably my 2 great interests in terms of the things that I consume, because they are the two.
The two truth tellers of society is philosophers and comedians.
11:15
I love what they do and I also think, like what?
More philanthropic?
Line of work can you have than to just bring joy to people and I think that's really cool and I I I have a lot of admiration for the craft and so I'd like to do more stuff in that arena if the comedic world will will happen.
11:32
As of this morning both $100 million offers and $100 million leads are on Amazon charts.
So top 20 books on all Amazon.
We have two of them.
Yeah, we beat Harry Potter.
Take that, JK, I'm kidding.
You're amazing and I'm a huge fan of your work.
11:49
I'll say American chicken and rice is like, man, that's why you got to go off the sword.
Got to go Middle Eastern style.
Some Juji kabob if you know, you know.
Hello.
Hello.
How are you, bro?
Good, man.
You.
Need to get back in the gym?
I know I can lean down a little bit.
12:05
The challenge for you is going to be you continuing to grow and experience and dig deeper.
Into not becoming a repetitive asshole like everybody in this space.
You know exactly what I mean.
Because you are the best right now.
And you take on that title, it took you a while.
12:20
You were like a rising dude coming up.
Or I'm like, he's going to do it.
He's going to do it.
He's going to do it.
Now you've done it.
And by the way, when I talk to other people, this is kind of a consensus.
It's not like I'm giving you some compliment.
No one else has told you I think you're the best right now.
And I say right now because that's not a title that you keep.
Long term.
You have to keep arguing and fighting for it and scratching, but you're the best friend.
12:38
You just spent two years of your life dedicated to this book.
You spent six hours every day writing it and blew the launch out of the water.
So what now?
More better.
We will do more of what we were doing before.
We'll do it better.
12:54
I do have my project one of zero that I'm working on in the background.
At the same time, I still have my third book and I think a lot of a lot of people are going to make a lot of money from it, which I'm very excited about.
And we'll, you know, get more companies in acquisition.com.
But I have, I have two big projects that I'm working on.
One is the third book.
13:11
The other is is one of zero and those are kind of the two big projects that I have for the next two years.







0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Everyone happy Thursday.
This is a little bit less common for me I'm I'm going to make a video or I guess podcast depending on how you're consuming this on a pretty Pine that pie-in-the-sky topic and I titled this the new entrepreneurial golden resource now.
0:44
You're probably leaking it.
So a lot of people don't know this but I probably I would say I mentor.
Four or five people on the side, not in a formal business setting in terms of like them hanging or anything like that.
But just people, that are had become friends that I've taken interest in their business and I've helped them along and invariably.
1:05
And what's interesting is that the higher up, you go, the less tactical, the mentorship is.
And so I had.
So I've had, I've had the fortune of actually connecting and befriending my first billionaire friend, which is cool.
And what's, what's happened?
1:20
As a result of that?
Is that like, I Obviously obsessively look at what people who are doing better than me are doing.
And then when I'm relaying to the people who are, well I'm trying to help.
There's this one resource that people who make a ton of money, managed extremely well and people who do not do not and a lot of people I would say mistakenly think that the number one resource is time, right?
1:43
Everyone's like time is money, time is money, time is money and I would argue that that's not necessarily true.
I would argue that it tension is money and That is the golden resource.
So the billionaire friend that I have, he's actually been helping me on the new Endeavor that we are launching to our gym Lord's soon which I think will change the industry.
2:03
And anyways, he's been helping me with that stuff but like here's an example on his phone, his phone does not ring unless you are already a contact that has been whitelisted.
His phone doesn't ring.
It's he's impossible to reach, right?
2:18
And the more, the more successful More the larger company, grows the more you scale.
The more you need to scale and luminous kill you it because you do have a finite amount of attention.
And so, what happens is, you have to decrease all of the other things in your life that drain attention because you can have as much time as you want.
2:38
But, if you're not there, you're not potent, you're not able, then you can't get anything done with that time that you're supposedly allocating, which is why a lot of people end up in this in-between state of always everywhere and at the same time, nowhere, right?
And so, They're, they're everywhere, but they're not paying attention to anything and that's and the reason that it's difficult to focus is because entrepreneurs, this, the character trait that made us into entrepreneurs, is that we're go-getters where risk-averse for creators were innovators, were Builders right?
3:07
We have all of those traits, but the difficulty is that the thing that gets your 2021 is not the thing that gets you from 1 to 2, right?
And so, one of the, the reason that you have to totally morph and why you have to be a growth-oriented individual is because you have to change your own.
Visual character traits in order to progress as a business owner.
3:24
And so like I said the things that got you here and not the things that are going to get you there.
The things that got you here which is your own internal skills are not the things that you need to pass on to other people.
So the only way that you are able to grow your business.
At a certain point is by growing other people, right?
And the only way you can do that is if you have the attention in the bandwidth in order to do, so, and that's why if you look at a business owner and like the more I obsess on looking at billionaires and people who are we're doing better than we are, is I look at how quiet and how clean they keep their Case.
3:52
And I mean that both in a literal sense that like, their surroundings their office, their house, their homes, their cell phone, their computers, right?
It's quiet, right.
Everything like its pristine and we can talk to these people.
4:08
There's a certain amount of Tranquility that's there and, and they just, they just have very low tolerance and it's not that they're trying to be impatient with you or impatient with the world.
It's just that they understand that they have.
So like, They're operating at such a high level that there's so many things that are demanding of their time and attention that they just like they can't.
4:28
And so they have to forcibly remove themselves from so many different situations and I'm going to give you an example like I'm trying to think of a good one that happened recently.
So, man, I don't use that one.
Um, okay, so so one of the people that I'm, I'm somewhat mentoring, right?
4:50
They had, they had for businesses and this is something that happens so many times.
It looked like, like, you want, you want 100,000 our coaching.
This is what happens in hundred thousand our coaching sessions.
And I'm being honest with you.
What happens is someone who's coming in usually doing between one and three million dollars a year?
5:07
Can't get past a certain point, right?
And the reason they can't get past this because they only have so much attention.
They that spread between four or five different cakes.
That's when the gym owner has four gyms and is making less money than they did.
When they had one gym because the amount of attention that they can allocate to one facility has gone down so much that with fixed costs.
5:25
They basically are breaking even, right?
And so the same thing happens.
Now that entrepreneur is probably making one two, three million dollars in gross revenue, but not taking anything home because they don't have the attention to actually put on two things.
And so in order to Ro you need to do less in order to grow.
You need to do less and there comes from both delegation and also choosing what not to do the better, you get the better, the opportunities that you have to say, no to imagine the level of opportunities that we have.
5:52
Now, I'm just being honest, so imagine how many things we could do or try and JV with or do a partnership with or whatever because of the distribution Network that we have and the trust in the Goodwill that we have at the gym owners that we have in our Network, right?
Right a lot.
6:08
I get I, you know, me people cold message me, like I have an opportunity for you.
I'm like, really you have an opportunity for me, right?
And so the better, you get the better, your options.
You have to say no to, which is why becoming a higher and higher and higher level.
Entrepreneur is more and more difficult because it requires discipline.
6:26
It's not about doing more, it's about doing less because we innately want to do more so doing more of your own internal characteristic.
If that was what it took to get to be more successful, then everyone would be More successful because it would be something that does not take effort because that is something that we already do.
It's like man I don't work any one.
6:43
I've got all this work ethic cool that gets you from 0 to 1 so I can I get you any further than that.
So stop so stop identifying with that.
It was something that I used to identify with us I'll although I work anyone would have liked that was something that I used to think about and it was a character figures and identity thing and the more you grow, the more you realize that your identity needs to be fluid because what it needs to be is exactly what it needs to be.
7:07
At that given time of development.
Because the character traits that I'm going to have to emphasize in a year, are going to be different than the ones that I have to emphasize now and so the skills that you need to learn like delegation leadership, those are things that are not the things that take you.
In the beginning, you have to be independent, you have to be hustling, you have to be grinding.
7:26
You have to be willing to put in the work, because no one else will do it for you.
Especially if you have no Capital start, which most people were on here, are in that situation.
And so to reel.
This back in the number one thing that you Have to be paying attention.
To is where you are.
Paying your attention.
7:44
Because love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Right?
8:04
Like you spend attention, that's why they called paying attention.
It's because it is a resource and most people don't pay attention to that, right?
And so, one of the things that a lot of people don't know about me, this one's going to go long.
What about some of the things that a lot of people don't know about me?
Is that I for nine months paid a coach to teach me one thing which was to manage my attention was to teach me how to think.
8:28
And so for 90 minutes every single day, all I did.
It was talked about what I was thinking about.
Think about that, every day, I paid attention to one of my attention was and when I did that, all of a sudden, my business blew up, right?
8:46
And I realized that I had toxic relationships.
I had talks relationship with parents, I had toxic relationships with friends or pseudo, friends things that I, that were taking my attention past things that I had on my mind that I knew, I had not handled.
So those are called like open Loops are open Cycles, right?
9:01
So when you have something that you like haven't resolved, this then you need to handle that.
You get that attention back because what happens is, you have this bowl, this tiny little bowl of marbles.
In each of those marbles is a unit of attention, right?
If you had to measure it.
And so you put little marbles of attention on your childhood traumas.
9:18
You put little marbles of attention on your marriage.
You put a little help marbles of attention on your health.
You put little marbles attention to your spirituality and then massive marbles of attention on your business.
But the thing is is that sometimes you need to quiet and collect all of these other little marbles so that you have more More potency, more potential energy, more potential units of attention to spend on the one thing that you're trying to grow which in this case would be your business.
9:44
And what's interesting is that, what happens is that things that were perceived as difficult become really easy.
And I don't know if you've ever had this happen, but like if you were in college or you were in high school and you're like, man, I can't solve this problem, it's not a problem and you were exhausted, then you go to bed and you wake up the next morning and then all of a sudden, it seems really easy.
10:00
You're like, I don't know why I didn't see that before because attention gives you the ability to see Like, if you think about wisdom, right, wisdom is inability to see what other people cannot see.
Right?
To people are presented the same situation, the wiser person sees things that the other person doesn't and how can you see better?
10:17
You see better if you have more ability to see which comes from your most valuable resource attention, how much horsepower do you have, right?
And so look at the things that you have in your, in your life right now.
Like if I see someone who has a messy relationship, wife, who's got a messy, love life who goes out every weekend and gets trashed, right?
10:34
Like I can tell, You billionaires, don't do that.
That like the whole Tony Stark, like, vision of the entrepreneur is a farce.
It's not true.
Don't believe that every single billionaire every single high level entrepreneur is quiet.
Unbelievably quiet.
10:51
They keep themselves completely isolated.
They have a bubble around them of layers, of protection there.
Like like for me it's me.
And then there's Layla and then we have our CEO and then we have our executive Assisted team because we have a team of EA's.
11:07
At this point, we have four who worked the next level.
There's no one who has direct access to including our employees.
No one does, and that's because it's, it would diss serve you.
You guys are gym owners if everyone had access to me.
11:23
The reason that I don't respond to Facebook message, it is not because I don't want to, it's because I literally can't.
And if I did, I would be disturbing everyone because then, my attention would be split because someone can't generate leads in their work or Or whatever, you know what I mean?
Like, because these little things, these little things that are perceived as huge issues to you in that moment because you have a little bit of attention.
11:44
You have so little left, that everything seems like an explosion.
But when you have lots of capacity, big problems, seem small and small problems, seem big and it sounds reverse because what you do is you start seeing that all of these, things are attention drains and you just say I don't want to play anymore.
12:01
And you stop humming.
And then all of a sudden, everything gets really simple because the only things you have to do become really simple at our generative, that one of the things that we had to do, our that I had, everyone do with simply to find the number that they needed to have in their Gym.
12:16
Number of, you have TS in order to have the lifestyle that they wanted to have really simple simple process, most people didn't have that, right?
But it's amazing.
What happens when you have Clarity because it allows you to put your attention in.
Erection.
Right?
12:32
And then it gives you a litmus test.
Will this help me grow this number?
Yes or no.
Yes, cool.
Let's do it.
No, ignore it, right?
And it takes discipline to say more.
It takes discipline.
That's why it's hard.
That's why most entrepreneurs aren't successful.
That's why most Farmers.
12:47
Don't grow is because it's hard.
It's counterintuitive, it's counter your character.
And so you have to learn how to not be yourself in order to be the person that you want to be.
And that's why, that's why most people don't do it.
And so, to go ridiculously full circle on this.
And every time I meet with an entrepreneur and I felt like, I told you we coach is probably a loose term, but I'll meet with a few handful of entrepreneurs on a semi-regular basis in to see, how's it going?
13:13
And the question that I always ask is what's your attention, please?
Your attention, right?
And if someone comes in, they seem really really like scattered.
I already know that their attention is all over the place.
They're super spread that they're less able.
So of course they can't grow their business because they don't have the very horsepower, the main resource that allows them to On push and so, look at your life.
13:33
Look at your relationship with your spouse, loved one.
Look at your habits, how you wake up?
How you eat you exercise, do you drink?
Here's an example for why we stopped drinking, all right?
And it has nothing to do with any kind of.
Like there's no religious, anything regarding this.
13:49
We stopped drinking because I realized that I would drink at night on a fairly regular basis.
Not like I always had some issue with that.
I really didn't.
I mean, I drink a lot, but I just whatever the point is this is that I would, I would drink in the evenings because I would say it would help me just distress, help me unwind.
14:06
But what that does, is it masks?
The thing that is taking my attention that I have anxiety pain, right?
And so, if you need to take a drink to unwind that, it means you have things that you have not resolved.
And so one by one, what happened is that when I stopped drinking everything got really loud.
14:23
And so I had to face and confront the things that I had not resolved yet.
And so, in the beginning, it's the hardest.
What happens is once you actually resolves all of those things, the desire to drink goes away because you're like, well I actually feel really good right now.
I don't want to mess that up and so it flips.
14:40
But it took, it took probably six months for that to happen from it.
And so I'm just giving that as an example of of what of what having your attention split and kind of getting gaining that attention back can be.
So look at your life.
Look at your relationships.
Look at your habits and the things that are taking your attention.
14:58
You need to handle complete the cycle.
As and get the attention back so you can work on the one thing that you're trying to grow and if you have side hustles inside businesses, get rid of kill me.
That's what people like people come and they pay us tons of money to tell them do one thing and the only reason that they listen is because we make one and I'm telling you right now, that's what I would do.
15:20
One thing, Focus do, one thing Focus.
So I'm going to again, that's why most times when someone comes into like, hey, I want to start an online business in a food prep.
Business end up, And end up whatever, right?
All at the same time because one of them is going to take off, it doesn't work that way.
15:37
All of them could take off, you could have a billion dollar food prep business.
You can have a billion dollar gym business, like your business, like having more businesses is a farce, I was talking to a gym, one of the other day and he's like, yeah, I mean, two paychecks is better than one and I was like, no one fat.
Paycheck is better than two.
15:55
You can have a hundred million dollar roofing business that just repairs Roots.
You don't need to do General Contracting and also windows and also gutters and roofs.
You can just do one thing and be really, really, really, really, really good at it and make as much money as you want.
And so just break that belief of yourself of like, I have to have three things in order to make more money, you don't, you don't, you don't, it's not true.
16:15
You one thing, I'd someone who's in the real estate space who is doing real estate coaching after her first month of being in the coaching called me up and was like There's just not enough.
Real estate agents, choose to only 200 thousand dollars a month and I was like real estate agents.
I said how how small of a market using micro gym owner is as a you literally outnumber my market 100 to 1 and I was like can we are out doing outpacing?
16:39
Your Revenue, 20 21.
It's just these beliefs that we have that are silly.
And I can tell you that, the the higher up, you go all of those limiting beliefs disappear and you just see people who operate a very high level, very quiet, very clean.
They're like if someone walks in the door and it's any negativity, those people just get up and leave nothing personal.
16:59
I just can't have that in my life, right?
Someone complains someone's - this is whether our traffic set, like, worries.
I'm just gonna get up and go.
It's nothing personal, right?
That's how they handle themselves.
So, thank you guys for your attention.
I hope I gave you a positive.
Return on it.
That was my intention.
17:14
This wasn't a normal type of video that I would normally make, but it was something that was like on my mind and I just had two or three calls recently where I had told people to consolidate their businesses, get rid of one, two or three businesses.
And then within a matter of 30 days, two of those people had a multiple of 3 X on their total revenue between of what they were doing before within 30 day period just by getting their attention back.
17:42
So Look at what you can consolidate.
Lots of everyone.
I appreciate you.
Shoot a like for someone who feels really distracted or if you have a spouse and you're like, we should clean up our stuff tag them so that you can clean it up and have it get some attention back.
All right.
17:57
That's 11 amazing, Thursday and I will catch you guys soon.
All right.









0:00
The only thing we can control is our behavior and so that we define the words in terms of what we do about it, then these all become things that we can control and can change our lives with.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
0:18
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
You are ridiculously good at writing instruction manuals for how to make money.
Literally you are singular in that way.
But if people think poorly or they do dumb things, they are never going to make progress.
0:35
So what advice do you have for people that are wasting time on things like porn, social media, or even just a friend group that is going nowhere fast?
If you, it's my belief that if you can control every one of the variables externally to an Organism, you can control its behavior.
0:53
So one of my favorite quotes from BF Skinner, who was a behavioral psychologist from way back in the day, was the old saying is you can lead a horse to water but you can't make a drink.
He said, well, if you bleed it out enough and you starve it and you leave it in the sun and you put the water right in front of its mouth, he's like, I can veritably guarantee that I can make a drink.
1:10
And so if you were to think about yourself as that horse, then it's like, OK, well, what is the equivalent of the the the bloodletting, the dehydration, the starving that you can put yourself into get the behavior you want.
So starving has a negative connotation, but we can also starve out the negative things in your life.
1:26
Like you can starve the alcohol, you can starve the porn, you can starve the friends.
And I think the easiest way to do that is to get out of the environment you're in.
Because like, I'm sure you heard about the, I think this was an atomic habits in Vietnam, like things like 10% of troops or something were taking heroin when they were over there in the 70s.
1:45
And they thought there was going to be this massive problem when they came back to the States.
But when they came back to the States, almost no one continued the heroin habit.
And so going from Vietnam, we were doing heroin to the US we're not doing taking heroin had a had a 90% success rate, whereas the inverse is true of recovery centers in the United States.
2:02
Today, people go there and 90% of them relapse when they go back home.
And so the difference is that people were doing heroin in a different environment and then they changed their environment and then they never went back to the environment that they did heroin in.
And so it's like, if you have these behaviors that have cues from the people, the surroundings, the colleagues, family, whatever.
2:21
I think even if you can't afford to move out of the state, like almost anybody can move across town, even 30 minutes away to just make it a little bit more inconvenient for your drug dealer, for your bars that you know, for the friends to say, you know, hey, we're doing fantasy whatever on Friday.
And it's like, I can't make it right.
2:37
You just make it inconvenient to do all the things that you don't want to do, and make it more convenient to do the things that you do, and you'll do more of them.
All right.
So the interesting thing for me about the Vietnam heroin thing, which I've heard before is, and this relates to why I think people might be struggling now, is there's an underlying thing that's happening that the the heroin or the porn or the social media or whatever is trying to mask and cope with what?
3:05
What is that today?
Like we have things amazing things could not be better, but.
You've got people doing things to numb themselves out to.
What's that thing that they're afraid to face?
I think it's their perceived judgement, their perception of other people's judgement, of their failures that haven't existed yet.
3:30
And so when you're when you think about constructing A mindset that is going to allow somebody to be successful, like when I think about your blueprints.
If you had to prep somebody to be ready to deal with that blueprint, what are some of the either core beliefs or habits that you would get them in the routine of doing so that they could actually deploy the things that you teach?
3:54
I think some of the things that I'll say might sound repetitive to some folks, but I'm a big believer in a lot of the Stoic virtues and a lot of that just comes down to having your opinion of yourself be all that is required.
And so it's like, it's like living for the future version of yourself and letting that person be your ultimate judge and no one else's voice.
4:19
And I think that obviously it takes practice.
We're social creatures.
We learn how to behave from other people and their judgement of our behavior when we're kids.
And then we have to unlearn it as we're adults because we find out that the people who are giving us feedback actually have no idea what they're doing.
So but like it's super ingrained in US and I think it's just it's a it's a long process but like how do I prepare someone for that?
4:41
It's it's like everything is removing the limitation, right.
It's like I want to get to here and so getting there is usually straightforward.
It's the obstacles that are all the things that people put in their own way.
So it's like, what are because the obstacle might be have a different name for every person and and then trying to pull apart like, why is this thing?
5:02
Like, why am I putting weight on this thing?
Because you had a strong drive when you were growing up.
Right?
And you wanted to get into film school.
You had this thing like, I don't know what that snap point is for me.
I just like my fear of disapproval from you know, my dad was my big, was my big driver.
5:22
And so that was the thing that's could get me to quit whatever it was.
You know what I mean?
To do the one thing that mattered more.
And I think that's at least for me that was.
I don't know how to find that for someone.
You said something in one of the interviews that you were doing leading up to your book launch that really hit me.
5:42
And that was you rewrote the book something like 19 times.
And when you got to a .1 time, you're like, look, they're going to be able to get this.
And the guy that you were working with said, look, there's a guy in Iran and he has one goat.
Yeah.
And he's going to sleep with a copy of this book under his pillow.
5:58
Yeah.
Do it for him.
Yeah.
And that somehow sparked you.
Yeah.
So my question is, given your response to that, given everybody needs that thing, are there some people that are beyond reach?
No, I don't think.
6:15
I mean unless you have like mental disability.
You know what I mean?
Like, I think that that barring biology, right?
No, I don't think so.
I think, I think I'm a big behavioral person, which is like anything can be trained, even like, oh man, he has such a great personality.
6:30
It's like, what is personality?
Well, personality is probably 170 individual skills.
And so if one of them is when someone walks in the room, you stand up.
I can train that.
If it means that, like when someone's talking, I need you to nod your head like this when the other person talks, I can train that.
And if we just had to make a checklist, it's just because it's hard to describe doesn't mean it's that's impossible to teach.
6:51
That's interesting.
OK, so the the spark, the thing that causes somebody to finally get into it can be translated into a set of behaviors.
And then if you get the set of behaviors, then you're going to be in a position to go right.
Right.
So what are some of the behaviors that people are doing now that you think are destructive, and what do we replace them with?
7:14
A lot of it is inaction, but like it's, I'd love to say, like all these people are failing and this is the thing that would fix it.
It's like most people just don't take action to begin with, and so I think a lot of it's between their ears.
To your point.
7:29
Which is why I talk a lot about fear of failure being being the actual enemy rather than failure itself.
And really even like even the idea that people are like, I'm afraid of failing, no one's afraid of failing.
People are afraid of other people's judgement about their failure.
If you could fail in private and no one would know, like when you play video games and you lose the level, you're not embarrassed.
7:49
Interesting.
So I've heard you say that before and I've always agreed, but I do think that there is something that will chip away at somebody.
It so it comes down to what do you build yourself esteem around.
This was the big breakthrough in my life was the day that I realized I got to choose what I built myself esteem around and I had been building myself esteem around being smart.
8:10
And so I was constantly putting myself in a position where I could prove to myself and others that I was smart.
I began to realize we are both the shout and the echo, and I wish it weren't so.
I wish we weren't the echo.
And what I mean by that is you're what you do, but you're also what other people say about what you do.
8:29
And as a just unimaginably social creature, it is baked so deeply into our DNAI.
Don't think there's any escaping that.
So you come into whether it's playing video games or trying to build a business or whatever.
With a lifetime of being both the shout and the echo, so you have a sense of who you are.
8:45
You've mapped yourself esteem, and now if part of yourself esteem is I'm good at this thing after a while, like you're way happier to fail in private because nobody sees you, so there's no new echo reinforcing what an asshole you are.
But I don't think you have unlimited failures on your side before you go.
9:02
Fuck, maybe I'm really not.
Good at this thing, and if yourself esteem is about being good at that thing then it really will begin to erode you.
Do you have, Assuming I'm right about that, do you have a thing that you encourage people to build their self esteem around to avoid the kind of traps that will make them afraid of failure?
9:25
I think it would be around the traits which can be evidenced by the things you do, which I think is probably where you made your shift.
I'm just, I'm just me assuming here but like it's not about being intelligent but about being like hard working right.
It's like if you if you build your identity around that trait then you can always do more of it.
9:41
Like you always work harder you can always do put extra reps in etcetera.
And I think if yeah people build build that trait as their as their identity and where they get their self esteem from then it becomes a self reinforcing cycle.
But they're the ones who are in control of it rather than the outcome.
9:57
And so that way it's like all of the variables of your identity and yourself confidence are under your control, which I think is cool.
Which is very cool.
So have you identified the trait smorgasbord that people have at their ready to be thoughtful about?
10:13
So for instance, being smart would be a trait.
Being honorable, Being honest.
Being hard working.
What should people be building their self esteem around?
What traits?
Is there one?
Is there a magic handful?
I think the ability to delay gratification and from a behavioral perspective, it's being able to continue to act on a longer extinguish curve, which is like if I knock on a door.
10:42
So if I knock on a door and nothing happens, how many more times do I knock on the door before someone opens?
So like if you if you if you fire someone and they're like, wait, I I I want my job, right?
You can, you can measure what someone's curve on, how many times they will try again on something before they move on and give up, right?
11:01
And so the longer you can make that curve on someone, the more likely they will hit the jackpot, which then extends how many more times they'll go the next time, which is basically how addiction works too.
But you can also use the same concept for good things.
So number one is being able to delay gratification.
The second one is, I think it's it's it's vision of what you actually want to do is like where do you want to go?
11:24
Because you can have somebody who works really hard at building a restaurant, like one single store and you work really hard at building an app that's going to change the world.
The amount of hours and effort that go into building an amazing restaurant and that are probably at the about the same, but the amount of impact is disproportionate on something that can go to gazillions of people is I think you have to have some level of vision and that comes from the people that you're around.
11:45
The third one is, is having some level of drive and I think that you can have either pool or or away from drive.
Pick which one.
Whichever one you've got more of.
I would say start with that one.
And I think it does shift over time because many entrepreneurs have away from drive.
12:01
In the beginning.
We're afraid of failing.
We're afraid of not being enough.
You know, we hate being poor, whatever your thing is.
A lot of times, especially I get a lot of DMS about this.
It's like I'm trying to find my passion, I'm trying to find my purpose, my thing.
And I don't think you find it.
I think you'd make it.
12:16
How do you know if you're going to like anything without trying it?
You don't.
And most people hate things that they suck at.
And how do you stop sucking at stuff?
You you do stuff that you suck at a lot until you suck less, until you're eventually good.
And so it's like so.
So you're not going to be passionate about anything that you suck at.
12:32
Which means that the it's a fallacy of thinking.
I have a hypothesis that haunts me, and that hypothesis is for real, partly because it applies to me.
That hypothesis is that people have a very hard time holding sophisticated ideas in their head.
12:47
Part of what I think makes you so amazing and PSI would like to say that.
Almost a year ago, I said within the next five years you'll be one of the biggest names in social media.
And I think you crushed the timeline just monstrously.
You killed the predictions.
13:02
Hey there it is.
Just really, really crazy.
But people really have just such a.
A difficult time holding sophisticated ideas in their head.
The thing that makes you is amazing is that you are able to hold sophisticated ideas in your head and simplify them so that people can understand and they can deploy them and actually use them.
13:24
But the inability to hold the sophisticated idea in their head is going to create a tremendous amount of problems.
So when I think about.
OK, you're going to have to pick something for your identity that's going to allow you to face failure, to go into that loop, to be able to tear yourself down and not have your desire to push forward extinguished.
13:47
You already have to be able to conceptualize that idea that you're going to be fighting against your neurochemistry.
So you're going to knock on that door.
It is going to be brutal.
It's it's going to feel so bad, like death and.
You then have to do mental jiu jitsu to translate that into ah, but I build myself esteem around being the person that can have this long extinguish, that I can knock on 1000 doors when anybody else can only knock on two.
14:13
And I worry.
God, it's my big fear that I do think some people are beyond reach.
I think that is my big fear, and I do.
Impact theory is predicated on the idea that as long as somebody meets minimum requirements, that they're going to be able to do it.
14:31
But to press on this point, because I'm deeply optimistic and so Lord knows, I hope that you convince me.
But the more I do this game, the more I realize that people get trapped in things.
Like I'm trying to find my passion and that the emotion of nothing feeling real is and and what you have to do to build a connection between I choose to make this my passion.
14:58
And how you make that emotionally resonant is so sophisticated that most people won't be able to pull it off.
You talk about stacking pennies on the evidence column.
What evidence do you have for all of us that if anybody really can turn a lack of belief into simple, rudimentary behavioral?
15:26
Things that they do to get those wins, Yeah.
So I'll, I'll make a statement and then I'll I'll answer that, which is I think like confidence without evidence is delusion.
And so the idea that you aren't confident, if you don't feel confident right now is OK because the question is what are you trying to be confident about?
15:50
Like confidence as a word, right.
So if we can define terms is you're the own the percentage likelihood that you have that what you think will happen or will happen, right?
Like in statistics, like what is our confidence score on this metric, right.
16:06
And so the same thing applies to a person.
What is our confidence that when Johnny says he will do this, it will happen.
And so we have our own confidence metric for ourselves, which is a percentage likely that we will do what we say we're going to do.
And so the way that you can increase that confidence is to have more evidence that you've done things when you said you would do them in the past.
16:22
And so I think it's about looking retrospectively and thinking, you know, what story can I tell around this data that would give me more evidence that I actually do have some of these traits that I didn't think about.
And I'll give you a funny little clip on this.
So when I was selling weight loss memberships way back in the day, I remember a common thing that would come in would, you know, a lady would come sit down and say, you know, I haven't worked out in seven years and I, I know I need to be going to the gym.
16:48
And I would say that's amazing.
And they would just be shocked.
What do you mean?
I'd be like, you're so consistent.
I was like, so you already have the tree of consistency.
I was like we should have to flip it.
I was like, it's way harder to learn to be consistent.
Then I was like, if you were just yo yoing back and forth all the time, I was like, it might be way harder.
17:03
I was like, but you actually stick with what you what you.
And they were like never thought about it like that.
And so it's just like and I say that a little bit tongue in cheek, but to the same degree.
It was really just a reframe for these people.
And whether or not, you know, people want to take that and run with it in whatever direction they're like, for me, I just wanted this person to believe they could do it.
17:19
And so I think to the same degree.
It's like, well, if every day you didn't make 100 reach outs, right?
Or you didn't make the piece of content that you wanted to.
But up until that point, you've always like been able to, like, make a cup of coffee and like, sit down at the computer rather than going to the arcade.
17:36
You know, figuratively, or, you know, playing video games or.
Going to the arcade boys and girls back in the 1980s.
Yeah.
It's so it's so it's it's counting the win sometimes of of losses that didn't happen.
17:52
Which is like, what?
What could have gone worse, Which is also a stoic frame.
But it's like, what could I have done to mess this day up more than I did?
It's like, well, I could have, I mean I could have taken five shots when I woke up.
I didn't do that.
It's like, OK, check, Great.
I OK.
I haven't, I haven't started my day with drinking.
Have I served my day with drugs?
18:09
No.
How many days in a row have I not started my days with drugs, You know, drugs and drinking.
It's like, I don't know, a whole year.
It's like, OK, well, like let's just basically chunk down a level and then you see all of a sudden you like, peel back the the onion and you're like, oh, I have tons of evidence that I can be consistent on things.
I just need to add another thing on top of those behaviors that I already have proven that I can do.
18:29
And so now when I make this prediction of my confidence that I can do this like you just take one step at a time.
And I think that the the big meta skills come from those, what we call virtues.
But virtues are just behaviors which can be trained.
Virtues are behaviors that can be trained.
18:47
It's really interesting, man.
I I very much like the way that you look at the world and I think I've tried to articulate a similar idea and the way that I approached it was it doesn't matter if you think negatively and act well, you'll still get the success out of acting well.
19:03
If you act poorly but think positively, you'll go nowhere.
And This is why it drives me crazy.
When people's advice is look in the mirror and say that you love yourself and all that it won't work.
And at the end of the day, success really is just it's doing the right things, another killer.
19:20
So I I do look out at the world right now and I see where building products that squeeze our dopamine has created.
Amazing products.
The iPhone is incredible and I'm very glad that it exists.
But I also see it having a very negative impact on a lot of people that simply pull the dopamine lever.
19:42
And for people that aren't familiar with, there was a behavioral study done in mice or rats.
And if you let.
One, you're putting the mouse in a cage, so you're already is an artificially limited environment.
But if you let it tap the lever for cocaine, it will tap it until it dies.
19:59
Now the fascinating thing about cocaine is that it's dopamine.
It's the basically the potential for for reward more than the reward itself.
And so I think that we have a lot of products that do incredibly well because they're all about squeezing that dopamine release.
20:16
And therefore for people to do what you're talking about.
Like if let's just embrace the frame for the rest of this conversation, and I hope the rest of my life that truly nobody is beyond this, barring some a mental problem that makes it impossible for them to move forward so that you really just have to find those behaviors.
20:36
So if you understand that the world right now is designed to get you to be watching pornography, to be playing on social media, to play mindless video games, I will say is somebody making video games, I'm, I'm well aware there there's usefulness and then there's is waste.
But understanding all of that that the world is set up against you then you have to have a technique that's going to allow you to get into these habits that are going to be effective.
21:00
And one thing that was absolutely transformative in my life was of rules to just a an absolute binary And so this this will be a hot take that will piss some people off.
But I've always said I do not understand how people get addicted to drugs because if you just have a rule in your life that says obviously I will exclude pain management.
21:19
If you just have a rule in your life that says I don't let's take drinking, I don't drink more than twice a week period.
So if you've taken a drink for the third time in the week, you violated your rule.
You know that you're out of bounds.
You need to immediately correct course.
Do you leverage rules or things, binary things so that, you know, like, I give myself 10 minutes to get out of bed?
21:42
That's like my big rule.
Do you have anything like that that allows you to?
I probably live the exact opposite way.
Not as a contrary point, just I I hate rules.
All rules.
And so how do you stay on the right behaviors?
I I do the things that ever worded me in the past.
22:02
I mean that genuinely.
Like when I wake up earlier, better things have happened for me.
When I do more work before I have my meetings, better things have happened for me.
When I eat a certain way, I look the way that I want and better things happen for me.
And so I just, I I buck against rules really hard.
22:20
And I don't know why that is.
But like, the moment someone's like, you can't have chocolate or you can't smoke, you can't whatever, I'm like, why not?
I'll do it and then still win at the thing to prove that that's not the point.
Which is why, like I get, I get annoyed with a lot of the superstition around routine.
22:37
And what I mean by that is like, you know, I've got, I mean I remember there was a guy who messaged me.
He's like, dude, I'm doing my my morning routine.
He's like and I have a cold plunge, a red light sauna.
I ground outside and then I do my gratitude journal and then I like he he did this list.
It was like, you know, it was taking like 3 hours to get his routine done or whatever in the morning.
22:57
And I was like, you know, you could just not do that and work for three more hours every day.
I was like, I'll bet you'll make more money.
And so I think there's a lot of superstition around, especially in the entrepreneur space around routine as like if I don't get my morning routine and I'm just useless and I'm like, man, I'd love to compete against you, right?
23:16
Because like, you have one bad night of sleep and you're fucked.
I was like, I will continue to work because working has worked for me in the past.
But I love what you were saying earlier with.
Like success doesn't really care, or the result doesn't really care. 1 + 1.
If you still do the addition, it equals two whether you're a good person or a bad person.
23:32
If you make a hundred calls or you, you know, make 100 pieces of content, the likelihood that somebody will find out if your product is greater than if you make zero, period.
Fight me.
And so you can do those things and be you can.
You can drink and do drugs and watch porn.
If you still do the shit, that's all that matters now.
23:50
Those things might make it more more difficult.
But I I always came up from the perspective of, like, I want to do the formula and then live my life how I want to live.
And if that means that sometimes I drink more and sometimes I drink less, or sometimes I work out more and sometimes I work out less, sometimes I eat dessert, sometimes I eat really small desserts, that's fine.
24:07
And so I it's just like, what?
Like what are the, what are the actual things that matter?
And if you look at, and I know you don't have a lot of wealthy friends like people, the way people work, the routines that they have are so varied, which to me means that they don't matter.
Because if there were something that absolutely has to be done, then it has to go down to first principles of OK, in order for people to find out about your stuff, you have to let them know.
24:29
Great.
So you have to advertise it in some way for people to find out about it to buy.
Period.
No, Like anybody who has a business, that rule applies.
Now, some of them are, you know, don't drink.
Some of them drink a ton.
Some of them watch porn.
Some of them don't watch porn at all and also make tons of money.
24:45
And so I I try to have as few rules as possible to give myself as much latitude to live my life that is that's really interesting and I will no, no, for sure.
I love that.
And I think that's one of the most interesting things about the era that we're living in as people get all these different perspectives.
25:05
So for I, the thing that we agree on is that there are physics to everything.
So success has physics, and if you're not trying to do something that violates physics, then you're going to be fine.
And so how you get there is somewhat irrelevant.
I I have a feeling speaking to the people that are caught up in the there's they're wasting their time.
25:28
They're not doing the things that they need to do.
They're they're going to need to create some structure.
Now that structure may be as simple as what you're talking about, which is because if if from my frame of reference, the way that I would put thoughts in my own head about what you're saying is I have a rule, and this is a literal rule of mine.
25:45
I only do and believe that which moves me towards my goals, which sounds very akin to what you're talking about.
It's like if I do this thing, I get this output when I wake up early, I've had better things happen.
When I'm in shape, better things happen and I put in the work, better things happen.
And ultimately, that's the thing that I'm trying to get people to anchor around.
26:04
Is there everything that you do is a test.
Your test will have results.
It's what I call the physics of progress.
So to make progress, one must have a hypothesis, know where you are, know where you want to go, understand the obstacle between you and that, come up with a hypothesis about how to overcome that obstacle, run that test, look at the data, very frankly, don't BS yourself and then come up with a more informed hypothesis and try again over and over and over and over.
26:32
But ultimately, you're steering by results.
And I think very often people either don't know how to.
In fact, I think there's a few things that will happen.
One, they don't know how to conceive of the problem, so they don't understand the obstacle. 2, they don't know where they're going.
Or three, they cannot break themselves out of the dopamine cycle.
26:51
They haven't identified the pain.
They're moving away from whatever insecurity they have.
And so they end up in that death loop of feeling like they don't have enough time, when in reality they have the same time is hyper efficient, successful people.
They just don't use it in the same fashion.
27:09
I think Seneca said that we all think we don't have enough time, but it's really we just don't use the time we have.
Well, and I think I think a lot of it is around like how we how do how we choose to pick our identities to to your point earlier like someone might say like man, I'm lazy.
27:27
I I would say like, that's amazing.
Like a lot of great CEOs are lazy.
That's fine.
Let's use that.
And so let's just make working more convenient than the other thing and then your laziness will take over.
You know what I mean?
Just like in terms of how we can frame the problem, right?
27:43
Like as a as an example we were saying earlier with the iPhone, like scientific study, anyone can do this.
You can decrease your iPhone usage by simply going to grayscale.
Like across age groups, if you switch your colors on your screen to grayscale, you'll lose use it 30% less than you normally would.
28:01
It's like, great for most people, that's like an hour plus a day. 30% is an hour plus.
Oh my God, yeah.
Well, I think it's what I mean.
I think average iPhone usage is probably like, I mean, I think one hour is like conservative on that.
I think it's like like maybe even 2 Yalza.
28:17
Yeah, hours.
It's like, there you go, found your time.
You can make all your content, you can all the stuff you watch, a movie, The time that you have.
From saving it, but like anyone can do it.
And so just like how many, how many of these little things can I make convenient, right.
So like if you're like, if you're trying to eat healthy, right.
I mean obviously guys like we both came from that space.
28:33
It's like, well, you just make it more convenient to eat healthy than eat unhealthy.
It's like, OK, we'll remove all the stuff in your house that you don't want to be eating.
Make sure that all the snacks you have are protein related snacks.
You know, anything that has calories in it, that's a beverage, don't include it.
Right.
Like just the just simple things that all of a sudden you're like I'm hungry and you're like you're like I've got cucumber slices and.
28:53
And protein chips?
You're like, what do you think will be more effective that or dehydrating the horse?
I think that is dehydrating the horse.
Interesting that ones never spoken to me one because that's not my problem.
You can fill my house with snacks, and if it either violates one of my rules, which I'm obsessed with because I created them and they're designed to give me the results that I want, or they violate my identity, I'm not going to do it.
29:18
That's unique to you.
I don't.
I don't.
I think that's like a Tom, like 1% thing.
Just me from the outside.
I think a lot of people have a hard time following rules.
You don't think people will drive 30 minutes to gorge on something?
I think they could, but they're just as likely to break a rule, and I think it'd be.
29:35
I think it's it's more likely that they will break a rule because it takes less effort to break the rule to themselves than it does to drive 30 minutes, and so I just want to make it as inconvenient as possible.
To do the wrong thing and as convenient as possible to do the right thing, that will clearly be advantageous.
So in no way is what I'm about to say arguing against that so huge love that total support on board.
29:56
Now, having said that, I have a feeling that the thing that people are up against and and I thought a lot about this with food, that quest, I wasn't thinking, oh, I need to make this convenient.
That was part of it.
And we certainly were not blind to the fact that giving somebody a package of good that they keep carrying their purse was going to be really helpful.
30:14
But the mantra I kept saying to myself was I want to make food that people can choose based on taste.
And it happens to be good for them because I think people will go way out of their way, violate rules.
All that to eat something that makes them feel the way they want to feel.
And if I had to anchor all of my fears around people not being able to accomplish what they want to accomplish, it would all be around the things you're going to need to do don't feel the way you want them to feel.
30:40
And because they don't feel the way you want them to feel, you veer towards the things that do make you feel the the way you want to feel Now.
Part of that you can accomplish by reframing, but part of it, I think is inescapable.
You're going to do what feels good, and you're going to avoid what's painful for the most part.
31:01
OK, I love this.
So one of the one of the big misnomers in my opinion about discipline is that people who who like some people might look at me and say that oh, Alex is really disciplined, but I actually really do what I want to do every day and it just so happens to be work that is productive and and makes money but that.
31:19
Statement that you made earlier that people shoot.
What do you said, you said people do what makes them feel the way they want to feel.
Right.
And then they, you said, oh, it's because it's not making them feel the way they want to feel.
And my only addition to that would have just been yet just yet.
31:36
And so it's usually because their extinction curve is too low right on the behavior.
And so if I go, let's say I'm the best door knocker in the world, best door knocking sales guys, and I knock on five doors.
I might not get an answer from any of those 5 doors.
And I walk away and I say, I guess door knocking isn't for me and I might be the LeBron James of door knocking, right?
31:56
But if the sample size is too small because my extinction curve just cuts off really fast, I'll never know.
And so that's why it's like if if you can give the thing the opportunity to reinforce its own behavior, then it goes from external to internal, where, like video editors, for example.
Like there's people who love, I mean, we're going to film school, right?
32:14
In the beginning, you suck at editing film, But then you, like, make the letters appear and you get instant feedback and you're like, whoa, that was rewarding, right?
And then you do it again.
And then you learn another technique and another technique, another technique.
And so then the behavior itself becomes rewarding and you begin to, like, work, right?
32:31
You begin liking your work.
And so I think it really is that.
Just getting over the hump in the beginning of knocking on 1000 doors rather than five.
And realizing that it would make sense that you would suck because you haven't done it before.
But knowing that if other people have done it too, that there is a reward that will eventually come and it will reinforce me, just like it has every other human before me who has done this.
32:51
And I think just like one of my, my core, you know, assumptions as I like to say is that if if somebody else can do these behaviors, I can do these behaviors and get the same outcome.
You know barring external environments or timing and things like that.
But you know assuming that those are the same like door knocking to sell solar today is the same as it was last year.
33:10
And if I see somebody who's number one in solar and I do the same behaviors as them, I will likely get a knock on that is decent.
And so I that that's what gives me confidence going into a new environment is modeling somebody and just being like ignore all of these other things, what are the behaviors?
33:26
How many times is, you know, is this person, you know, how how quickly do they walk from door to door?
Do they only go to apartment buildings?
Are they, you know, like what's their, what is all the steps that they do operationalizing success rather than kind of like the the theorizing that I feel like happens a lot.
And I think that's to be fair, I think the reason a lot of people kind of like some of the content that I put out from a money making perspective is how can I operationalize this word, right?
33:47
So like patience, for example, is when the people throw out a lot.
But for me, defining patience was helpful, which is figuring out what to do in the meantime.
Like that's patience.
Like we're like, I'm not patient.
It's like, no, you just need to figure out what to do in the meantime, that's all.
Like you and I are being patient on all the investments that we made last year while we're having this podcast.
34:06
Like they are happening, we're figuring out what to do in the meantime.
So we're being patient.
And so it's like patience feels bad when you're focusing on it, but if you're not focusing on it, then patience happens by default, like sadness for example.
Like that was really helped me to find figure out just even defining the word in terms of operational perspective.
34:22
Help me get out of those folks faster.
Which is sadness comes from a lack of options, a perceived lack of options, which is why it feels like hopelessness.
But if it comes from a perceived lack of options, then it means that you solve that with knowledge because it's perceived for lack of options.
34:41
Which is an ignorance problem, which means it's solvable, which all of a sudden gives me something to do, so then all of a sudden I do have an option and then you can get out of the funk.
And like anxiety is, the is the reverse of that, which is I have many options and I don't know which one to pick, which means I don't have priorities.
So, like, you solve sadness through knowledge.
34:57
You solve anxiety through decisions.
And so, like, helping me just spell those out to myself, I'm like, huh, I feel anxious.
OK, That means that I have lots of paths and I need to make a decision.
So which one am I going to decide so I can get out of this bad feeling?
If I have sadness, great.
35:14
What do I not know?
OK, now I have to go figure that out.
Great, I have something to do.
And so that, like, you can.
I think these are like mental.
Models around using emotions to fuel the behaviors that you want.
35:32
I didn't want to say a word during that because I think what you're talking about is so I'm as as you're talking, I'm trying to map my fear about people not being able to make the change.
And I the more I think about it, the more I think this boils down to people feel a way that they don't want to feel and they don't know how to handle that.
35:55
Yeah.
And you just, without me even thinking to ask you, you were going through how to deal with different emotions and by having a plan, by having a procedure, which I think you're going to call operationalizing.
Yeah.
Then you know what to do.
Oh, when I encounter sadness, then I do this.
36:13
When I encounter anxiety, then I do this.
And so it's a very action oriented plan.
So I want to plant a flag in that and then I want to follow up with how one goes about operationalizing something.
OK, So I'm going to lay out a thesis so you can push back or whatever people.
36:29
One of the the things that you and I have both said historically that I think is maybe the most powerful thing we will ever say and everything after that is just what you do.
Once you get over that, your life is an exact reflection of your choices.
You are not a victim.
And even if you are, it does not help you to think that way.
36:45
You have to breakthrough that.
And one of the intros to this episode that I considered was that every day each of us has to make a choice whether we are going to play the victim or play the game.
And if you're going to play the game, play to win.
It's the only thing that makes sense.
37:02
But that is a negative emotions can be so gnarly that we need to make it somebody else's fault that to point all 10 fingers back at us.
And this is one of the things to get hired to impact theory.
You're going to be asked a question along the lines of something horrible happens to you, how many fingers go outwards and how many fingers point back at you?
37:22
And the punchline is, if all 10 are not coming right back at you, it's just disempowering.
It doesn't mean that bad things don't happen, nothing you can do about a tornado, etcetera, etcetera.
But still to realize that you can make different choices and get a different outcome.
37:38
But people don't do that a lot.
Because to do that, if you don't have the right frame of reference, if you haven't leaned on the right traits, if you aren't building yourself esteem around the right thing in that moment to say that it's your fault.
Fault, fault is just emotionally devastating, and people have not operationalized their encounter with negative emotions, and therefore they will do anything they have to do completely unconsciously to not feel that way.
38:06
Now, if that is doing drugs, they'll do drugs.
If that's drinking, masturbation, cheating, whatever, they will do all of it.
But it really boils down to what's your relationship with your emotion now?
To push us farther and to really make clear what I think.
38:23
I don't think emotions are objectively real.
I don't think that people ought to believe an emotion.
I think people think because they feel it.
It is the right reaction to objective truth rather than a subjective reaction to perception.
And if you can understand that all of your emotions are a subjective reaction to perception, that you can take control of that, that you can reframe things, you can have a different emotion.
38:47
And now in that moment, instead of doing something that moves you away from your goals, you can replace with something that moves you towards your goals.
OK, so that's my thesis as, as I really think about boiling it down to what messes people up, it's that if I'm right about that, how do you operationalize anything?
39:07
Like, what does that mean?
Because I have a feeling the thing that makes you phenomenal is the ability to operationalize everything.
So if I I love this, but the conversation just a side note.
39:25
So in my opinion a lot of things, even huge apartments, practices in business and medicine and everything come down to learning and communication and so let's define terms.
So learning is same condition, new behavior.
39:43
So to the point, I felt sad last time I learned this new thing from this podcast on Impact theory, which is OK.
If I feel sad, then it means that I don't see an option.
Which means I need to get more education or knowledge on the subject so that I can figure out what to do.
Well, at least deciding that I need to learn more gives me the next step that I need to do.
40:01
And boom, I'm not sad.
And so you've been sad before, and then it took you five days to get out of it, and you're sad now, and it takes you 5 minutes to get out of it.
Same condition, new behavior.
So you learned.
And so if we go 1, move from that, and I'm going to circle back to the original point, if we think about intelligence, right, like, what is intelligence as I define it from an operational perspective?
40:26
It's rate of learning, right.
So somebody who learns really slowly is less intelligent.
Somebody who learns really quickly is more intelligent.
But that means that intelligence is just a rate.
It's a measurement of how quickly you change your behavior in the same condition.
And so if you continue to listen to podcasts and you're wake up in the same exact conditions every day, and your behavior does not change, it means you learned nothing.
40:47
Which means you are not as smart as you think you are.
But it also means that you can influence and have a direct influence on your intelligence by increasing or decreasing the time it takes you to actually act on the knowledge you have when the same condition presents itself.
And so for me, that's incredibly empowering because it's like I can be smarter by simply hearing what this person says, getting the same condition, and then immediately changing my behavior.
41:09
Wow that's cool.
And so that then like from the fingers perspective it's like OK all 10 fingers are on me of how I can influence my own surroundings and and do the things that I want to do.
So to to circle back to the original question, I think would I have to probably dovetail a little bit was can you repeat it one more time?
41:33
How do you operationalize things?
What does that mean?
So OK, so it's breaking down.
What does this word mean from a behavior perspective real quick wise?
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have of you guys that you help me spread the words.
41:51
We can help more entrepreneurs make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast.
So the single thing that has to do is you can just leave review.
It'll take 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
42:07
It would mean the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
So it's it's it's it's really hard.
Like, I think the reason that so many people are confused and they have a hard time remembering things and understanding complex topics is because they have lots of words in their heads that they have not defined.
42:24
I really mean, like, I I truly believe that, which is why every book that I have begins with the definition of terms.
Just like this is what an offer is.
This is what a lead is, right?
These are, these are what this means, right.
And until you have that, you're just, you're basically making face noise, right?
42:40
Like, if I say leads and you perceive that as something different, then we can't actually have a conversation because we're not talking about the same thing.
And so a lot of people have a lot of words they've heard other people say that they nod along to.
And people were like, makes sense and they say yes.
But when someone says, does that make sense?
We have been trained as humans to nod and say yes.
42:57
It doesn't mean it makes sense.
It means that when we have that cue, that's the behaviour we do.
Right?
Because we know that we get punished when we say no, because then it becomes all this big thing.
And then, you know, you dovetail into all these other conversations and you get punished for it, right.
And so you learn what's reinforced and most people say makes sense.
And then you say, which means nod your head when I say this and you're like, I nod my head, great.
43:16
And then you move on.
And so I think that's why a lot of people don't learn because they actually don't know what the words mean.
And so to operationalize something, it is simply going back down to when I say I'm confident.
What does that mean?
It's not a feeling, it's not a what other people say about you.
43:32
Like none of that is measurable.
Like how much like what is measurable?
It's a percentage of likelihood that what I say will happen, will happen, period.
That's what it is.
Now what you'll also find is that there are a lot of words that mean the same thing.
And that doesn't mean that the the concept wrong.
It's just the fact that English or whatever language you learn usually has a melting pot of like, well, this is the version of the Nordic word and this is the version of the Hindi word and this is the version of the French word.
43:55
And they're all in the lexicon, but most of them more or less mean the same thing.
And so getting away from words meaning what the the dictionary tells us it means and just say what does it mean to me in terms of what I can do with it, Then I think it makes navigating life a lot simpler because the only thing we can control is our behavior.
44:11
And so if we define the words in terms of what we do about it, then these all become things that we can control and and can change our lives with.
Yeah, OK.
That.
I think it's super important.
One of the things that that changed my life and the easiest way to explain it is how it manifested in my marriage was to define terms.
44:33
And because what Lisa and I were realizing is we're saying the same words, but we don't mean the same thing totally.
And that's creating a lot of confusion.
Now as a leader in a business, this becomes problematic often because you will say something that to you is self-evident.
44:48
Exactly what it means.
People do the IT doesn't make sense.
Yeah, nod and.
They do that a lot.
And so Lisa and I started defining really simple words like what?
When you say you promise, what does that mean?
When you say something's important, what does that mean?
And so, like in our marriage, if we use the word important, I mean stop.
45:06
Whatever you're doing, I don't care if you're with the president of the United States, you will immediately get up, leave that and deal with this thing because it's important.
So if it is meaningful but not important, then fair enough, it's meaningful.
But I'm in the middle of something.
I'll get to it later.
Doesn't mean that it's, you know, not something that needs to be addressed, but it isn't important.
45:24
Cool.
Now we have a shared lexicon.
And I think that going back to my thesis around emotions, emotions are the subconscious's way of communicating to the conscious mind.
So when you think about, and this isn't, I mean, this is me making things up, this is me connecting DOTS that behavioral science has made abundantly clear, but I am admittedly connecting DOTS.
45:47
But Lisa Feldman Barrett wrote a whole book on this called How Emotions Are Made.
So this is not me just shooting from the hip.
But I'm I'm putting my own words to it.
The the way that you feel is the subconscious mind, which can process information faster and faster, as they say.
46:06
So it's a a much larger number of data points process much quicker.
But when you bring it into the conscious mind, you're going to think either in images or in words.
Most people probably think primarily in words.
And so it really narrows down your ability to deal with a lot of information.
46:24
And because emotions are coming from the limbic brain, which we had before we had the higher level cognition that humans have that other animals don't have, you're going to be in a situation where, oh snake and you just jump.
You just have the emotion and you move.
Most people leave things there.
46:42
And so they're never pulling that into the light to say, oh, why do I feel so uncomfortable in this moment?
What?
What is it?
And if they would take the time to define what the discomfort is, then they might be able to operationalize the response that they should have to this predicated on, at least from my perspective, what's your goal?
46:59
So I feel some kind of way, but I have a goal.
My goal makes demands, which is something I don't think people think about very often to achieve your goal.
Just, hey, there's physics to it.
So certain things will move you towards your goal, and certain things won't.
So my goal makes demands, but I feel some kind of way that make me want to move in the opposite direction of the demands of my goals make.
47:17
So now, using your words, I have to operationalize my encounter with this emotion, define it, define a response, and then actually adhere to that response in order to move towards my goals.
And that the the moment where you pull the emotion into the spotlight of your conscious attention.
47:39
And define it in a really simple way.
I think it's where the vast majority of humanity get lost.
So I do something called impact through university, and I answer some of the same questions over and over and over.
And they often have to do with that moment.
Somebody does not understand their own emotions and therefore they cannot operationalize the next move.
47:59
So much to say.
I will keep it short.
So, so I want to so in reference back to what I was talking about, like with sadness and anxiety and patience, like these are all all patience is more of a behavior.
Sadness is a feeling that and then how do we translate that right.
I want to be clear that I use those terms because I want to meet people where they're at me personally.
48:25
And if you look at it from like the the behavioral science perspective, you have stimulus and you have response.
What happens in the box of, like, what this person feels, right?
Like if I hold up a red flash card to a random person, and then I slap them, and then I hold the red flash card again, like all of a sudden some of them might feel anger.
48:46
Some of them might feel fear, like what they feel when they see the stimulus, Which I've now paired with a response, right, is going to be different.
And so I think a lot of effort goes into people and even people in our world trying to how people describe their feelings, talk through things, blah, blah, blah.
49:05
And I I just genuinely think that it's a waste of time because not who cares, but why does it matter?
Because you can do it when you're sad, you can do it when you're angry, you can do it and you're fearful.
49:20
And again, to the point is if 100 people more find out about the thing that I'm trying to sell or whatever I'm trying to do, then I'll have a greater percentage likelihood that I will get this outcome.
That's it.
And I think a lot of people, they just get into this cycle of trying to analyze their feelings and then they're like, oh, it's because I had this trauma when I was a kid and you know, because my dad didn't hug me enough and like blah, blah, blah.
49:40
It's like the because for most people's explanation is irrelevant because I get like I had a a podcast question the other day that asked do you feel like trauma, You know, is is something that creates success later in life among entrepreneurs, blah, blah, blah.
49:56
And I really thought about it.
And I was like, I think people suffer and some people become successful.
So do I think that suffering creates success?
No.
I think that everyone suffers and some of them become successful, and then they attribute their success to make it feel worth it to have gone through that suffering because they have an outcome.
50:19
But I don't think that they're related in any way because, like, you were successful because you did the thing.
How you thought about it is completely irrelevant.
And I just think that there's so much effort that gets put into that conversation, which is why I have really contrarian views around like therapy and things like that.
50:35
But I think like if you keep opening a wound, like what does it help you?
I don't know, like you still didn't make the calls.
So like, let's let's let's create an environment where it's more likely that you create that you do the calls that you need to make.
And it just, it it simplifies the variables that we can control because no one, like even even adding the because to things like I did this because it's like you don't even know why you're doing what you're doing.
51:02
And so when people realize like Tom, what's your number one reason for success?
We're making it up.
We're making up our our response.
I mean, it's what it is.
We're like, how do I?
There's a hundred things, a zillion things.
I don't know.
Like, is it because my dad didn't hug me enough?
Is it because my mom?
Like, who knows?
51:18
Maybe if he would have been president still, it would have been fine.
Like it could be completely irrelevant.
But we just choose to give this thing that some percentage of the audience then says, oh, that's like me.
And maybe then I can be successful too.
And that's fine.
But I think the the, the boiling it down to the absolute basics or not even basics.
51:33
The absolute truths of it are that there's a stimulus and there's a response.
What happens in the box inside of your head does not matter If you respond a certain way.
You have learned, and if you continue to see the same stimulus and you don't respond the way you want to, you have not learned.
So you need to learn.
51:51
I love how direct and simple that is.
See a red card get slapped.
See a red card duck?
Yeah, you learned.
Or block right?
Even better, right?
You preemptively slapped and if I and if I have to show the the flash card to you 7/10/12 times, the person I show to once and then ducks the second time is smarter, more intelligent, then the person has to show it to 10 times before they react in in a different way than standing there and getting slapped.
52:17
Dude, I love that.
I will.
I will say for all the people that I because the the people that I have, maybe I glom onto because of my own hat.
Here's me making up a a reason that I've gone on to because of my own sort of a the journey that I've had to go on, the thing I've had to deal with.
52:37
Is that, I think, where people fall down.
Because you are right.
There is no, in no uncertain terms if upon stimulus you do the right thing for goal attainment, you will attain your goal.
Like that's just how it works.
But then the question becomes, why do the vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority of people never reach their goals?
52:55
And I think it's because they're not able to either because either will work, they're not able to either stop caring about what the reason is, or they never take the time to figure out the reason.
Now, given that, I think most people struggle because they just don't have clarity, I do think people are going to need to.
53:13
They might not need to understand why they feel that way, but they're going to need The very thing that leaves them uncertain about why they feel that way is the thing that leaves them uncertain about what they want to do with their life or how to achieve what they want to do.
OK, I really, I love this.
OK, So the first part of the statement was people are doing the thing, and then it was because.
53:33
And then the second part of the statement, I would pause it that with the because I would put the reason they're not doing the thing that they want to be doing is because they've been rewarded for doing what they're currently doing in the past.
And so all they're doing is continuing to do they have learned works.
53:51
And so it's like if you are continually rewarded because, like, there's a reason that you do what you do right, which is that you have been trained to do it.
Now train is a you know, the environment can train you, which is what most of us switch to over time.
You have an external stimuli that wants to pair a new behavior with a stimulus, right?
54:09
If you want to teach someone to duck, right, you show the red card and eventually they learn, right?
But at a certain point, once you do the red card and then eventually you pair the red card with a fist, then all of a sudden the person gets into fighting, right?
And then you don't need to pair that anymore because the environment will self reinforce and reward the behavior of ducking and will punish if they took it, if they don't duck, right.
54:32
And so if you just think about that as like a really simplistic microcosm of how we learn thousands of things, like even even the concept of of speech is 1,000,000 reinforcement points from the time a baby is alive, right?
So if you think about a baby as stimulus response, so they're alive, they make noise, reward are here, right?
54:53
Attention, affection.
Approval, right.
Reward.
And then they make no noise and they make noise again.
Reward, make, make noise again, reward, reward.
Then once they learn to make noise consistently, we then start rewarding noise that sounds like words.
55:09
So it's like, like, right?
And they're like, whoa, it's like that's we're not going to reward that one.
And then all of a sudden they start approximating the first word.
And so all of it is, is this continuous feedback loop of me doing something and it having an extinction curve because nothing happens or me doing something and I get reward.
55:28
And so that is the that is the micro and so you can apply that to everything that's happened.
So like when you when you start seeing the world in that way, it becomes much simpler to navigate because you don't need to find the reason.
You just say like I do this because I've been rewarded in the past, cool.
55:44
So I just need to reward myself in the present for this new behavior.
And like, how can I pair this new behavior with something good, which is like, as a total side note for me, a little trick.
Like when I go to the gym, I always get a little shake, even though it's a little bit more expensive at the gym because it's like a little reward that happens immediately after I lift.
55:59
And I look forward to that.
And so it's just like little things that you can do to reward yourself to, to hijack that cycle that changes behavior.
And so it's like we want to change our behavior.
I think we have to define the terms of what behavior is to begin with and how we define learning, because that's all it is, is parent, you know, learning is pairing a stimulus with a response.
56:19
And so if they want to learn things, that's what they have to do.
All right.
If so many people fail, so many people have a victim mentality, what reward are they getting?
That reinforces that.
So it could be that they're because a reinforcer can be both a more of a positive or less of a negative, right?
56:36
So if I remove a slap, that's a reward in its own way, or I add a positive.
And so they may be avoiding punishment in certain ways by staying in this place.
Because in the past, because everything's extrapolations from the past in terms of how we see behavior, because that's our pattern, right?
Like we look back at what?
56:51
Like we use our history to make predictions about what's going to happen with when I when I try to turn this door knob to get into the room, I turn it and I turn it.
Because when I have turned or knobs in the past, it worked.
And the first time I encountered the door, I was like, what do I do now?
57:07
What I probably did is I looked at somebody else and when they turned it, the door open.
So I know when I see this thing.
Now if I made that thing solid and it can't be turned, I would like and then I would think what other types of doors are there?
And then you'd be like is there another handle on the store like.
And so you go to secondary and tertiary behaviors whereas the most likely one that's going to work is the first one you start with.
57:24
And so we have these behaviors that let's say laying on the couch and watching Netflix has been rewarded.
Watching Netflix is a rewarding experience.
It's, I mean like it's it's more positive and it avoids negative, but then you get into short term and long term reward and punishment, right?
57:40
Which is why it's harder.
Which is why I think it's the meta skill which is on top of those things, which is that I know that I can delay a short term for a long term payoff.
And I think that's where that's where the big leap has to happen.
Because if you can train yourself to know that, like, I know that if I do one workout, I'm not going to look different and I know if I do 6 workouts, I'm still also probably not going to look different, right?
58:04
But if I do 600 workouts, I probably will.
And as soon as you have that one first thing where you had to delay gratification and you got a much bigger payoff, you start to associate the behaviors in while you're doing it with reward.
And so the difference between experts and beginners is that experts find more ways to reward themselves while they work on whatever The thing is.
58:23
And so it's not that they are more disciplined, which is the Finally the full 360 on this is that experts are not more disciplined than you.
They've just found more ways to win.
So how do we effectively take control of the process of rewarding and punishing ourselves to keep us on track towards our goals.
58:39
I think being cognizant of it at at at the absolute base layer, you start to see the world through very different lens and you're like, OK, that was punishing, huh.
Like that was rewarding.
Great, I'll do more of that.
But then you start to think you're like, why do I do that And you really start thinking about you're like well, because I it's sometimes it's so funny like I'll have because we, you know we we invest in buying products and whatnot.
59:00
And so I had two different products that were in the same category because I like the category that was looking at and one of the products had a better result like it had a better, better end outcome when the when the customer uses it and the market leader and this is who they were trying to disrupt had a slightly inferior result, but it delivered the result almost instantly.
59:21
And the other one took like 5 minutes and this one was like 5 seconds.
And the other one was objectively better.
Like even like science, like science.
It had all the stats and everything.
Like it was objectively better.
And they wanted me to invest in this company and they're like, we have a better product.
I was like, no, you have a better result, you have a better product.
59:38
The reason these guys are still number one is because latency matters more than intensity when it comes to the reason that a little icon on your phone is because it's immediate, right?
And then it goes away, right?
Like you have this immediate feedback loop, whereas I don't know if you've heard this.
59:53
OK, so sorry.
I I love this stuff.
So if you're trying to train a dog, right, they there's this.
I wish I could.
I'll maybe send it after show.
Like a graph that shows how you can train a dog to sit with like a treat.
And so if you tell the dog the command and then you wait and you immediately reward it, it learns faster.
1:00:13
If you wait 30 seconds, it learns, you know, it takes more tries to get it to learn.
After a minute, the dog's untrainable.
A minute.
And so it doesn't know why it's being rewarded.
Now The thing is, is it's not that you aren't training the dog because whenever you have some sort of reward, you're training it.
1:00:34
You're just not training what you think you are.
So you have to look at what happened immediately before you give the reward, what happened a minute later, right.
And so we think because it's like it's at I'm going to wait a minute and then give it the cookie.
But I'm not reinforcing the sitting, I'm reinforcing the thing they did right before they got the cookie.
And so as a, as a, as a, as a zoom back out here when we're thinking about like.
1:00:53
And the reason I brought up these two products was that the the, the, the original product, the one that was the the market leader, was better because it gave even a smaller benefit, but gave it immediately.
And so people will probably it, it seems silly, but when you really try and be honest with yourself, like, why do I, why do I go to this gym instead of that gym, 'cause I have a bunch of gym memberships.
1:01:15
I'm like, why do I 'cause I like to think about this.
I'm not surprised by that.
I'm like, why do I go to this place?
I'm like, 'cause the other place has better equipment.
And I'm like, the person at the front always says hi when I walk in, immediate reinforcement for walking in the door.
And I was like, I think that's what it is.
1:01:31
So I like it.
Like when I come in, they always say hi and I have like a two-minute conversation and like, I look forward to that.
I drive 10 minutes further for that.
I'm like, how silly.
But when I think about it, when I'm really honest with myself and so to go back to the person who's on the couch, it's sometimes the rewards are minuscule and then when you name them, they feel a little bit less powerful.
1:01:51
But it also means that you can say, how can I make another miniscule reward in another direction that gets me moving towards my long term goal and then I can kick start that cycle where I start to learn like a master does, because masters enjoy, love the process.
It's like easy for a master to say because you're fucking good at it.
1:02:08
Easy for you to say, right?
Like when you're, you know, if I'm right, like I write my 19th draft of the book.
I've now written a decent amount, you know what I mean?
Like, I've I've spent a long time writing, and so I the act of writing itself is rewarding for me.
Like you must work so hard, which I do.
But it's not that I'm willpowering my way the whole way through.
1:02:24
Not always, of course.
There's times where it's like, not the most fun but big picture.
The process is rewarding because I've gotten good enough that it is rewarding.
And so the more ways you measure, the more ways you can win, which is like one of our one of our little monikers.
1:02:40
And so it's like, how many different ways can we measure that we can make progress on these little things and have wins as quickly as possible in the direction you're trying to go and then start the loop.
OK.
So to say that really succinctly to make sure I understand, no, no, no.
The exploration was amazing.
1:02:56
I just want to make sure that I understand it.
I think we've covered the reward part.
So I'm going to do something measurable and see my growth and that starts a positive reinforcement loop that's going to send me down the right path.
OK, so that makes all the sense.
1:03:12
In the world proximity, the rate at which you get the reward is really going to matter.
That's really interesting from a product perspective.
You're the first person I've ever heard talk about that.
Super interesting.
But now how do I punish myself?
Do I?
Like, I'm a big believer that you need to punish yourself.
1:03:27
But when I say that sentence out loud, I know what people hear and it feels icky and weird, but it's been incredibly powerful for me.
So do you believe in the power of self punishment?
And if you do, how far do we take it?
So I will just just forsake of everyone, I will just state this as my opinion and we'll just leave it at that.
1:03:53
So you have praise and you have punishment or you can have reward and you have punishment, whatever you want to call it.
Punishment is more effective to change behavior in the short term.
Like if I hold a gun to somebody's head, I can immediately change their behavior, right?
Reward is more powerful over the long term.
1:04:11
And so like, if you look at an environment, so we think we talk a lot about this at acquisition.com because it's kind of part of our mission internally is to create a culture of reward on punishment.
And the way that we think about this is if you have like, let's say Goldman Sachs or McKenzie, some of these very big organizations that attract some of the best and brightest and are renowned for having relatively terrible or punishing cultures, right.
1:04:34
They work people to death and blah, blah, blah.
So what happens is if you, if you put an animal in a cage and they can't escape, then they will revert to the law of least effort.
So they will do as little as they can to not get punished.
And so then when you're in a punishing environment, you all you have to do to get them to do more is you just raise the bar for what they have to lawless effort do to not get punished.
1:04:56
And so in an environment of high performers, that gets everyone to raise the bar but then quickly burn out.
Now that model works if you have an endless supply of bodies, but if you are the person who is being burned out, then that works for two years or whatever.
Praise on the other hand or reward can unlock, in my opinion, discretionary effort.
1:05:17
So the effort beyond the law of least effort required to keep your job and not get punished.
And so the issue is that the people who are the most able are the ones who are able to work the least and still keep their jobs, but they're also the ones who get the absolute most upside on if they work because they want to, not because they have to.
1:05:37
And so that is kind of our, our, our thesis of how we try and build companies at acquisition.com.
And we're not perfect.
We, you know, believe me, there are plenty of times when I want to shoot someone set off.
But we really try.
I know my teams are nodding, but like we really put serious effort into saying like, so let's say like I find out the dog shits on the on the carpet when I get home, I hit it.
1:06:02
It doesn't learn.
All I'm doing is hitting a dog.
Like if it was less than if it was within 60 seconds from the time that happened, it's not going to learn.
And so, like, if you know that and then you hit the dog anyways, what does that make you interesting, right?
1:06:18
And so now obviously, if we're like punishing ourselves and whatnot, that might be somewhat different.
I'm talking about how we relate to others.
But you can either avoid punishment or you can seek reward.
1:06:34
And I think both of them are powerful motivators.
Avoiding punishment is powerful, more powerful in the short term to change behavior.
It's faster.
Reward is more powerful in the long term to keep behavior going because eventually you like kind of like heat on a adaptation, you get used to a punishment and then it no longer works.
1:06:50
So you have to have you have to increase the variety and intensity of punishments in order for it to continue to be effective.
Do you punish yourself?
Honestly, not a ton.
1:07:10
I have super high standards, but I don't know if I punish myself.
I don't know if I'm like Alex.
You're a piece of shit.
I don't not really because I you know Leila and I are kind of sit on opposite sides of the but like I'm like some people have like a base of anxiety that they like work through.
1:07:29
I don't come from that side.
I come from probably like a base of laziness like and just you know like and that's why I have I have all these things to get myself to do stuff.
But punishment just like it's also just never been effective for me.
Like when I get punished, I I want to just figure out how to would punishment not do what they want me to do?
1:07:46
Like when you when you use punishment to like train kid you get them to sneak out or right, not like they just find other ways to get out of the house quietly.
They don't necessarily change the behavior but if you reward them for staying then they never want to leave that kind of idea.
The reason people leave when they're younger is because there's more reward outside of the house and inside the house, and so if you want to fix in the long term, make the reward for beings home more than leaving home.
1:08:11
That's interesting.
So this is probably 1 where defining the term would be very meaningful.
I I personally use what I call self punishment now.
To me, self punishment is to force myself to acknowledge that I said I was going to do something that I did not do.
1:08:27
That's normally where this will come from.
Interesting.
I would call that stating the facts.
Interesting.
I would call that punishing.
So and This is why it's important.
So I understand why people always react so negatively when I say that you.
You are missing out on an incredibly powerful tool if you don't punish yourself.
1:08:47
Now just to acknowledge, and you've said this as well, we we are all speaking from this is what works with me.
So this is the experience that I've had a comment section exactly and there.
So getting out of bed in 10 minutes or less is I I struggle with it every day of my life.
1:09:03
It's, it's.
Hysterical to me that even now, all these years later, I still have to be like you said, you'd get out.
I stay in bed for like 45 minutes on my I.
Can't allow myself immediately as soon as I wake up.
Well, if I'm.
Doing something in bed, I I suppose I should change it to working.
Then I have 10 minutes to be productive, is probably the right way to think about it.
1:09:21
And 'cause there are times where there's something that I can do in bed, like this morning when I could start researching you The second I wake up, then then I would still call that a win.
But if I don't do the thing that I said I was going to do, then I force myself to to acknowledge to myself with no, I don't let myself run.
1:09:38
So I don't let myself be distracted.
I'm just like you said you were going to do something, you did not do this thing, and therefore you should not feel good about the behaviors that you enacted in this moment.
And then I will often confess to my wife or my employees or my community so that I am holding myself accountable.
1:09:56
And now I'm sitting in something that I do not like the way that it feels.
I'm not letting myself run.
And so then I'm like, I don't want to be back here.
So next time I'm going to take a different set of behaviors that has been transformative for me and that not using that for me would be to miss out on a huge motivational.
1:10:17
I love this and I want to draw similarities for the audience because and I think I think this This is why I think this stuff's kind of interesting for anybody who's listening is like is there are different ways This is why like there there are only a few things you need to do to win and the way you do it is entirely up to you.
1:10:33
Which is why I love boiling things down to just like what are the few the few things that everything has in common and everything else is preference.
But with what you just said, I think I have like the first thing we do is we state the facts is that I said that I would wake up within and do something within 10 minutes observation that did not happen.
1:10:53
Then comes the third step, which is that you this is me.
Putting words is that you label that as bad, and then maybe label yourself as bad depending on you know that.
I don't do right.
Yeah for the for the audience.
Just to be clear, OK, I need to not see you so one.
1:11:10
So if if one wakes you know doesn't wake up in 10 minutes and then states the facts.
I did not do what I said I was going to do, then labels the the thing as not good and then says I am also not good, then that becomes trouble.
Now 1 before that is just labeling the behavior is not good or not ideal for the outcome that I want.
1:11:29
But I'm not sure how much it matters to feel bad about it.
Again with the behavior box of like stimulus response, because once you feel bad about it, right?
And then it's like well what what do we do to increase the likelihood that next time it increases now because we could feel amazing about it, we can feel terrible about it.
1:11:49
We can feel neutral about it, but all that will matter is what behavior we change in order to increase the likelihood that we do what we want next time.
At least as as as I see it, and I found that I put for me a lot of energy into trying to understand things, trying to label things as good or bad, trying to label myself as good or bad as a consequence.
1:12:09
And the only part that mattered for me to actually get what I wanted was the last step, which is what am I going to do about it?
And I can also just skip these.
I can just skip these other three steps and just go straight from I always said I was going to do this thing.
Observation, I did not do it.
What is the change in my behavior or my environment that I'm going to do next time to increase the likelihood that I do it?
1:12:29
And then even with the binary thing that we were talking about earlier with rules, I'm actually more of like a weighing system of OK, over the last 60 days, I got up within the 1st 10 minutes 60% of the time.
OK, next 60 days if I can do 70% of the time I am making progress and so rather than like because most people will fall short of perfection and so I feel like it ends up setting up a an inevitability of failure if we define it as binary.
1:12:59
Just my own perspective.
So how do you then deal with people that are not hitting a standard, whether it's you or somebody else?
I have found in business if you let people get away with.
Low standards.
Not only will it devastate their performance, it will begin to drag down the company and and it really matters totally.
1:13:19
So do you stick to only rewards?
Do you call it out, like what do you do?
Yeah, Yeah.
So we absolutely we state the facts and then we say what we're going to do about it.
And then if someone consistently cannot do because at at some level there's always, there's always a chunk down skill someone doesn't have, right.
1:13:35
So if I say, hey, can you send an e-mail to so and so we have assumption that they have a stack of skills before that.
I assume that they can read, I assume they can write, I assume they can use a computer.
I assume they have from an environmental perspective, they have access to Internet, they know how to use a word processor, like they know how to open up an Internet route.
Like I know where this sounds silly, but we make these assumptions, but for some people they're missing one of those And so they have all this failure because they're just missing one link on that chain.
1:13:59
And so trying to identify what is the skill deficit?
And then is it a skill that I'm willing to invest time into teaching somebody.
And so we want somebody who have as many base skills as possible that apply to many scenarios.
So like if two people go through the same training program, right, and one person gets the outcome and the other person doesn't, it's usually because the training program doesn't account for every single skill that is required to get the outcome.
1:14:19
There are certain assumptions that come in, like if someone reads my book, I assume that they can speak English.
I mean, I'm saying as simple as that sounds right?
But there's a hundred other skills, and the people who are successful faster just have more of those skills stacked up so that when they get the right information, they can immediately use it.
And some people still need to go back and learn how to wake up on time and like have someone say no and not cry.
1:14:41
But like, these are, these are other skills.
And so in the environment of work, how do we address somebody who is not performing?
We state the facts.
We recommend a course of action that can help increase the likely that they do it again in the future.
And if that doesn't happen, then we say like, this is what will happen as a consequence.
1:14:59
Neutral of you being good or bad or this situation be good or bad.
It's just these are the standards that we will accept, and you are beneath those standards based on these facts.
That's it.
Like if you showed up to work late.
OK, Just to be clear, you understand that our expectation is that you show up on time?
1:15:15
Yes, I understand.
Great.
You also understand that that what you did was not to that expectation.
Cool.
So let's do this.
Do you have an alarm on your phone?
Yes.
Do you use it?
No.
Do you know how to set an alarm on your phone?
Yes.
Great.
So why don't we do this from here on out?
Let's set two alarms 5 minutes apart at this time.
1:15:32
That'll give you ample time to get up, clean your face, whatever, and then get on camera.
Does that work?
Yes.
And then we measure.
And if it doesn't happen again?
If it does, then it's like, why did?
Because then you get into the base skill being.
Do I adhere to authority?
Like, can I listen to instructions?
1:15:49
Like those are skills.
And if someone nods their head and then doesn't do that, then they don't have that skill.
And then the question is whether am I, am I willing to take the time to invest in teaching someone the skill when the opportunity cost of that time could be allocated to somebody else who might already have that skill or suite of skills?
1:16:06
That's how we think about it.
So one of the things that is a recurring theme is the idea of extending the time to extinguish.
What if we are going to operationalize that?
What What do we do with people and?
1:16:22
If I were going to personify the the length to extinguish, I'll give a historical example and then I'll give a more modern, so historically, Winston Churchill dude.
I don't know if you've read much about him.
Unbelievable what that guy was able to pull off and how long he was able to delay gratification.
1:16:44
And then a more modern example would be a David Goggins.
So how do we operationalize it?
What do you take from those guys?
I think it's the the the master's thesis of those guys are masters at whatever The thing is and so they find ways to reward themselves in the meantime.
1:17:02
And so we only think that they have supreme ultra discipline willpower because we are measuring what we can see as the outcome of running a race, you know, 26 miles or whatever it is.
But if they are rewarding themselves throughout the entire process, then if anything at the end of the race might be a removing of a reward and might be actually anti climactic.
1:17:24
Which is what happens with most athletes after they compete in the Olympics or they win the championship or lose the championship.
The build up is where they have all the reinforcement.
And then when that thing actually happens then they have to get right back on the the horse of where they get their reward from, which is the work to get there because they are good enough at it that they can win in more ways.
1:17:42
And so just the more you know about something the better you are at it, the better you are at it.
The more you can win.
The more you can win, the more you want to do it.
How much of that do you think is identity?
Like when I look at somebody like a Churchill or a Goggins, it that feels to me like a game of who am I or who do I want to be.
1:18:02
One of my favorite Churchill quotes is well, so quotes.
Failure is the ability to go from sorry.
Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm speaks directly to this but one thing that I got reading his biography.
1:18:18
Is he said to his mother when he was really young that this is a paraphrase, not exact quote, but I yearn for a reputation for physical courage more than anything.
I mean, it was.
And and this is a guy that's for people that don't don't know a story that sent himself into war zones multiple times in his life when he absolutely did not need to do that, including World War One when he was like he was basically the equivalent, the British equivalent, of a senator.
1:18:45
Yeah.
Now imagine you have an active senator who felt like he had let people down.
And so he said send me to the front lines and they're like, whoa, why would we do that?
Like, you do not need to go to the front lines.
Even if you want to engage with the war, you certainly don't need to go to the front lines.
1:19:03
And he said, Nope, I want to be literally where the bombs are falling in the dirt with the men.
And that was somebody who had such a strong internal compass of.
This is who I want to be, or how men ought to be.
Same idea with Goggins, right?
1:19:19
Just felt like I'm a loser.
He's staring at himself in the mirror.
The accountability mirror.
Doesn't like who he sees, decides he's going to change and become a different person.
And I'm sure you've seen the clips of him screaming You don't know me, you don't know who I am.
That's an identity play.
1:19:37
So how do you see that?
Is is extending the time to extinguish?
Purely an an an identity play or is there something else going on?
So I think, I think the wording matters.
1:19:52
But if you want to extend how long you continue to do something without seeing the result of your doing, you need to find a way to be rewarded in the meantime.
Like that's that's what it is like that in my opinion.
1:20:08
And so whether we call it identity or we call it a skill or we call it a behavior, we call it a character trait.
So saying like with the, the, the many words that ultimately mean like what is the percentage likelihood that this behavior occurs, That is really all I would look at.
And is it as simple as I I was today who I said I was?
1:20:27
Like, how do we make that?
I mean, not to beat to that the idea of operationalize, but when I think about what I'm doing, when I reward and punish myself, is I am trying to feel the way I want to feel or not?
Or make sure that I'm feeling discomfort so that I will move away from that behavior.
Yeah.
So what is it or how do we leverage identity to feel the thing that we want to feel like?
1:20:49
Is it just words in your head?
Like how do you play that game?
So identity is really internal culture.
So if you think if you define culture as a set of rules of behavior, you know within an organization, identity is just the rules of behavior within an individual.
And so I think to your point, you have your rules of behavior that occur.
1:21:06
I would say that my rules of behavior, even though I hate rules as a concept, when I do these things, like when I see this, this happens, right.
I do have the these, these behaviors that have been cued that I have learned.
See, now we have all these words that we've defined.
1:21:22
So now we can at least everybody can agree on what we're talking about, which is why it means a lot to me.
But yeah, I just, I think identity is just a big stack of behavioral cues that we've said because people change over time.
And so it's really just like a mental construct of this is how I behave, like what is an identity.
1:21:39
It is like and even if you want to say like I know this person, what it really means is that I have a high predictive score on what this person will do or say as a result of whatever I do or say.
And so if that's the conversation that I'm having with someone, it's like, oh, I know him really well, oh, he'll love that because I have a good predictive score that when this happens, he will do this.
1:21:56
Now somebody who's all over the place or super erratic right then or do they have a an unformed identity or do I just not know enough about them maybe.
And so I it just that has just been my litmus test and maybe maybe it seems like oversimplification but for me it has been incredibly fruitful to just because then for me it takes a lot of the the superstition, a lot of the magic, a lot of the black box of feelings and emotions and and identity out.
1:22:25
And it's just Alex is a series of behaviors.
That's who I am, that I that have been trained into me by my environment and that I have tried to learn myself.
And I will change in the future because if I get better then it means I can't be the same person I am today.
Which means some of the things that I have learned now.
1:22:41
I will unlearn and learn new behaviors when I see a different stimulus or the same sorry when I see the same stimulus.

The difference between rich dads and poor dads and what they teach their kids is that rich dads in general will teach their kids to go after higher leverage opportunities.
They'll go after opportunities that have bigger base units of measurement, bigger base units of money that they can compile together.

This came from a conversation that I was having with a good friend of mine.
He exited his company for like half, just under half a billion.
And we were just having like a philosophical conversation around, you know, what is it that makes people successful and what are kind of the the things you can identify early or mindset shifts in terms of perspective that allow people to have an unfair advantage.
1:03
And so it, you know, if you followed any of my stuff, I talk a lot about time, I talk a lot about money.
And so it's unsurprising that the two traits have to do one with time and the other with money.
And so, and one of the things that's interesting about this is the concept of measuring sticks.
And so a lot of us have these base units that we measure things in.
1:21
And it's kind of like shorthand that you use in your brain.
And so I'll give you a simple example.
So when I was in high school, I used to measure, you know, how much money something was by the amount of Chipotle burritos I could buy.
And because I used Chipotle burritos because it was an understandable, like, quantity of value for me.
1:37
And so everything was like how many Chipotle burritos is this?
And that was because that was like the amount of money that I was making and that was a material amount of value for me at the time.
And so one of obviously the measuring sticks that people use is in money.
And so the bigger the people that you hang around with, the bigger the unit of money that they will measure things in, in terms of like base units.
1:59
And so you over time you want to increase what that base unit looks like.
So you want to start measuring things like how many 10K units there are, how many cars is this, how many houses is this, how many businesses is this right?
And even just the amount of money itself, how many 10K's, how many 100K's, how many, how many millions there is.
2:15
And just as a as an aside, here in Wall Street, in the hedge fund world, they have a term that I learned probably a couple years ago, which is a stick, right?
And a stick is their measuring unit, which is $1,000,000.
So they're like, yeah, give them a stick or put two sticks in.
And they say that because they have these measuring units that are significantly bigger than most people can fathom or imagine, but because our brains think in units.
2:38
And so if you can hang around people whose base unit of measurement around money is far greater than yours, then you will start chunking up and thinking about money in those greater terms.
And all of a sudden, for example, let's say your base unit of money is $100,000 or $10,000.
2:53
Even then it makes it much less likely for you to go participate in an activity, right, that's going to generate you $100 or $1000 because it's not even a full unit of measurement.
So it's like almost why bother?
And what happens in the difference between rich dads and poor for dads and what they teach their kids is that rich dads in general will teach their kids to go after higher leverage opportunities.
3:15
They'll go after opportunities that have bigger base units of measurement, bigger base units of money that they can compile together, right?
And so the first thing you can do in terms of identifying in other people and then also within yourself is what unit of measurement do they use?
Are you using Chipotle burritos, right?
3:32
Are they using $1000 units?
Are they using $10,000 units?
Are they using $1,000,000 units?
Right.
So the bigger the unit of measurement they're using for money, likely the wealthier they are and the wealthier they become because they only will participate in activities that can be measured in those units.
So that's number one.
Real quick guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it, told you about it, shared it on Instagram, or something like that.
3:56
The only.
Way this.
Grows.
Is through word of mouth.
And so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast, that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do, that would mean the world to me and you'll throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur. #2 is measurements around time and this has an interesting kind of like part A and Part B to it.
4:22
So part A is that they on a micro scale within like day-to-day, they're going to act faster.
They're going to be better utilizers of their time in general.
And then on the macro side and this is like to to to go back to to iron out the the first point on the micro side, it's just about speed, it's about execution speed.
4:44
If you start interacting with somebody and their speed of communication is rapid in terms of their turn around time, in terms of when they communicate with you, in terms of how they respond to things, you can be sure that that person is far more active.
And I'll give you a reason for why people move forward so much faster in life when they have that trait.
5:00
So imagine you're trying to get something done, right?
And let's say that you, you message someone and then, you know, they wait a day and they message you back, and then you wait a day and you message them back.
And then let's say it takes 5 interactions like this to to get this project done.
5:16
So that that would be 10 days like you one day, then one day five times, right?
And so that would be 10 days.
Now imagine a different scenario where you have two people who are wealthier in terms of how they manage their time, right?
How they leverage their time and they're able to have that entire exchange within a matter of 30 minutes, right?
5:34
And now if you look at the difference between a 30 minutes and 10 days, it dramatically compresses the time to achieve the result.
And then this is where it gets interesting.
Now after that 30 minutes, let's say they do that again and again and again and again in a very real way.
They will have accomplished more literally in a day than other people will try and accomplish in a month or more, right?
5:54
And this is how you compress time and you can drag your future into the present by increasing the speed with which you take action and you communicate with other people.
All right, So that is the part A micro for time.
Now, Part B of time is macro and so this is an important one when it comes to measuring sticks and also again with the measuring sticks on the first ones.
6:16
I really just want to drive this point home.
I made a video about this, but it's it's the idea of switching from end of week being your default to switching to end of day or right now being your default.
So how can I just make the default in my company end of day?
Like if if no one says anything it has to be done by end of day, right?
6:33
Or how can I say that my new default is by 4 hours from now, right?
And so that becomes your new micro measuring step in terms of how quickly you can get things done and reply and move things forward etcetera.
So you want to deal with people who have very condensed micro push things forward in terms of their activities and how they see things getting done.
6:51
On the macros perspective, it's when people are talking about decades and not days, right?
And so you can tell how wealthy someone is by their perspective on time in terms of how long they're willing to wait to see something through.
7:07
And so this is kind of like a very extrapolated version of the marshmallow test.
And if you've never heard of that, it's pretty famous test where they have two kids and they they said, hey, you can have a marshmallow now or I can give you 2 marshmallows in a few minutes.
And the kids who said I want the marshmallow now and I couldn't use the self restraint or self-control were significantly less wealthy, less successful later in their lives compared to the kids who could wait for the second marshmallow.
7:28
And if you wanted to add an interesting wrinkle to this, you could actually ask, you could make the marshmallow even further out.
What about if the marshmallow was in five hours?
What if the marshmallow was the two marshmallows were tomorrow.
What if the two marshmallows were a week from now?
What if the two marshmallows were a year from now, Right.
And I can guarantee that the person who had the furthest out date of when they were willing to restrain themselves would be significantly more successful.
7:50
And that is because impulse control or self restraint is one of the key drivers of success, because you can see where you're trying to go.
And it takes from a macro perspective, a long time to build amazing things, right?
Rome wasn't built in the day, which is a quote that's it is said all the time, but people don't actually live by it.
8:06
And so if you surround yourself with people who use measuring sticks of money that are significantly larger than yours, they have micro units of time that are significantly shorter than yours.
They get things done faster, they communicate faster, they move things forward faster, right?
And then in terms of how they measure the goals that they want to achieve in their life, they measure in decades instead of days or weeks or months.
8:25
If you surround yourself and you give yourself those three which is 2 with you know two with two micros.
If the lens is through which to to see other people, and then also to judge yourself, you will be significantly better off and you will move far more rapidly towards the goals that you want to achieve.








0:00
I think that there's just so much power in acceptance.
It's like so many people make themselves miserable because they think that they shouldn't be who they are and they shouldn't feel how they feel.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:16
I'm trying to build a billion dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished Bezos, Musk and Buffett had documented their journey, so I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy if you can expose someone to a stimuli and get a consistent outcome.
A lot of marketers and salespeople like to talk about the internal thoughts that someone has, like first they need awareness and then they need blah blah blah and then they need and so they're basically just make up the reverse engineer fictitious steps of someone's mental thought process when they have no evidence to support what someone's thinking at all.
0:45
I don't find it useful because it's not useful.
Like what are the things that are useful?
It is for the things that are observable that we can drive action towards that, that we create an outcome and then we have a feedback loop.
And so if we have those things, then we can move the variables and get closer to where we're trying to go.
1:01
And the feelings, although I recognize that they exist, they're not helpful in trying to edit what our activities are.
I would say there are days that I feel like less energized or things like that for sure or not about like the big picture of, like, I don't believe that this cause is not worthy, but I do think a lot of people have that too, where they're like what I'm doing is meaningless, right?
1:20
And then I get into, I think everything's meaningless and then we can just create whatever meaning, you know, we choose to because if we don't believe in a capital M meaning which a lot of people disagree with, that's fine.
But if you don't believe in a capital meaning, I think that's very free because then you can create little meaning for whatever you want.
And so if you believe, you can then choose to architect your own life in whatever ways that you deem meaningful and make the activities you do aligned with that meaning, the difference between capital M meaning and little M meaning.
1:47
And this is kind of like the basis of nihilism, which people have like a very negative viewpoint around, which I'm not entirely sure about why.
But like capital M meaning means that, like this is the meaning of life, period.
Like for everyone, this is the meaning of life.
Whereas if we say that there is no single agreed upon meaning of life and then people say, well then that is your big meaning of life.
2:05
And I'm like, yes, you're right, I believe that there is no meaning.
That is the meaning that I that I believe and they're like well then that is the capital and then sure that's my capital and meaning is that there is no meaning.
What's the implication of that?
It means now that we have meaning making machines in our brain and so we get to create and destroy meaning as we see fit.
2:22
And so if we choose an activity and we deem that goal meaningful because we think it's more interesting or it energizes us, then we can ascribe meaning to that and do more of it.
And what's nice about not having capital and meaning is that that can shift, right, That might be good for a season and then it can shift.
I will say that the downside of not having capital M meaning, which I consider to be religion off the shelf, is that it's more difficult because you have no one who's saying here's the big box of rules, you can read it and then that way you don't have to make the decisions about it.
2:47
But I think it's more difficult, but in ultimately more rewarding if you have reasoning behind why you believe what you believe because then you have to independently come up with your own conclusions about those things.
It also makes it malleable so that if you get new data or new evidence, then you can change your mind, which a lot of people again have difficulty with.
3:03
But like if you change the information, then it would make sense that if it materially changes the outcome that you the way that you believe about something should change.
And I think a lot of people identify with their beliefs as a part of themselves rather than as what I prefer to call them, which is assumptions, because they work the same way.
3:21
What's the difference in belief and assumption?
Not a lot, right?
The only difference is just what we call the word.
And so assumptions are based on things that we've observed and then we assume something as a result.
And so I would say the beliefs are just assumptions and but when you call them that, they become less tied to your identity.
3:36
If you have an assumption, you don't say, you challenge my assumption, it's like, well, yeah, I challenge my assumption, oh, that's great.
I I was assuming this.
It must be this.
And then they become much more flexible and then we don't tie our egos into them.
And I think ultimately it serves more people better in the long run.
I feel passionately about my viewpoint of the world, mostly because I struggled and I was in so much pain for such a long period of time.
3:57
I'm only sharing this despite the fact that I get attacked for sharing this because there are people who this does rest anyway.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
4:17
You can check on my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
And if not keep enjoying the show.
When there is no required meaning, then a lot of language changes which is should, must, need, have to like all of these things no longer exist because there is no capital M meaning.
4:37
So I don't should have to must need to anything.
And so a lot of the expectations that we bury ourselves into that weigh us down are just implied shoulds have to musts.
And so if all of those disappeared, then in a lot of ways it's very liberating.
And so for me, in business, it allows me to take actions even though I know that I shouldn't or must not, or other people would judge me for not doing it the way that they thought I should do it.
5:04
Because there are no rules.
Which is why that was the preference to the book.
It's like, there are no rules.
We can live our life whatever way we want to live in.
And that's OK.
I read a YouTube comic the other day.
It's like, hey, you know, you talk a lot about being sad and like, have you been able to XY and Z?
5:19
And I don't identify with being a sad person.
I think I I have been sad in the past, but I also don't think that there's a problem with being sad.
And so I think that there's just so much power in acceptance.
It's like so many people make themselves miserable because they think that they shouldn't be who they are and they shouldn't feel how they feel.
5:36
And so much of the medication that gets prescribed right now is because someone's like, oh, I'm anxious.
And why do we feel like someone shouldn't be anxious?
They are human.
Why do we feel like we shouldn't feel sad?
We are human.
Why do we feel like we shouldn't feel frustrated or angry?
We are human.
And so I think it's one of the most, like interesting things or phenomena where if you have a line which is the normal human existence and you have points above the line and the points below the line, you have the median right, the the middle point.
5:58
And people want to not feel the things below the line.
And then we ascribe or label the things below the line is bad and things above the line is good when all of it is.
And so I think that if we just accept that and accept ourselves and accept the feelings that we experience as things that we experience like rain and weather and sunshine, it's not like rain is bad, not like sunshine is good, just is I like happiness is good or happiness is bad or sadness is bad or sadness is good.
6:23
We just label it that way.
And I think the labels create more suffering than anything that we ever actually experienced.
And a lot of people spend a lot of time and effort trying to figure out how they feel because they want to then judge or label themselves as I'm doing well or not well.
Like a lot of effort goes into showing like, how do I feel about this.
I mean my father question be like why do you care?
6:40
Why does it matter.
And that's why when you asked way long ago about like how did how much do you think feelings matter.
I don't think they matter at all.
What would the case for feelings mattering be?
And it gets really interesting because it's like how I experience a feeling that I label in my head as sadness.
6:55
Is it the same way you experience the thing that you let?
It's like seeing green and I see green and you see green.
What if all of our greens are different, right?
I mean, it's, it gets very interesting like that.
But I think that I experienced something.
And if we were to just measure it based on like brain activity and like heart rate, I would say that I become aroused in the literal sense from experiencing what I would deem as emotions.
7:12
And so if we were to describe it or define the term in that way, I think I experience emotions.
And so I mean I'm fairly confident I experience emotions if we were to try and measure it that way.
And that's how it's a yes, I do experience them.
But the question is just like how important are they And then it would be like for what if it's for accomplishment, not very important, for fitness, not very important.
7:31
You know, if if we're saying how important is emotion for love, which is another emotion, right?
It becomes like amorphous trying to go to amorphous.
But then you say, OK, well for defining love by what I'm willing to endure to continue to keep something, then how important is it?
7:48
Well, it depends on how much I've conditioned myself to accept this thing.
So, like if I want to stay married, it's probably far more effective to condition someone to stay married to.
That is the external consequence of a good marriage as you stay together, right.
I'm just saying like we're just purely measuring from from external circumstances.
8:03
And so I think trying to measure and define things is what I actually geek out on and I really enjoy.
I think most people get bored to tears when I talk about this stuff.
So I don't talk about it much.
But that's the stuff that like when when we keep peeling back layers of like, why do you think you're able to get out of the, you know, a difficult place in your life or why do you think you were able to go through these things?
8:21
A lot of it is because I believe that I will redefine terms and so will have some instance or something that I should do and I will redefine it.
Or I'll say I I don't should I can just accept it.
And that's why the biggest refrain that I have in my head for like, my own mental illness is just like and that's OK.
8:37
Period.








0:00
If I were 85 years old and I got to go through a time machine and be back in my body as I am now, to experience my life from my 85 year old self, it's dramatically shifted how I see everything.
So let me walk you through it.
I've struggled to feel grateful for most of my life.
0:15
It's not that I don't have things to be grateful for.
I have tons of things to be grateful for, but I don't feel gratitude.
And so I've tried a lot of different practices to try and feel gratitude.
You know the journals and the daily meditations and things like that, but they've never really stuck.
That's not to say that they don't work for some people, but I want to share with you in this video is one of the most powerful perspective changes that I've ever experienced.
0:36
If you don't know who I am, my name is Alex Rmozi.
I'm the managing partner@acquisition.com, which is a portfolio of companies that does over $100 million a year.
I make these videos because I hope that you make all the money in the world and you experience all the joy that you possibly can in the process.
I have spoken in the past about the frame of the veteran, which I won't recap here, but it's really just having different frames or perspectives through which to see circumstances so that you can improve your experience.
0:57
Recently, I've been trying to toy with one that would create gratitude.
There's a clip that went pretty viral not that long ago.
It's also my number one tweet of all time, which is when I was 20 I wanted to be a millionaire.
Now that I'm a millionaire I want to be 20 when I'm 85 years old and in my mind I imagine I will be a multi billionaire.
1:14
At that point I know that I would give up everything that I have of material wealth just to be poor and 20 again.
I call this the frame of the grandfather or the grandfather frame and it works like this.
If you've ever looked at pictures from your past and you look at where you grew up, or you look at, you know, your old room, or you look at a picture of you with old friends doing something, we tend to feel these feelings of nostalgia.
1:39
And I tried to quantify, like, what is nostalgia?
So to me, nostalgia is gratitude in the present for past circumstances.
For whatever reason, we're able to kind of look past all of the kind of minutiae of how we were feeling, our moods, and we're able to kind of like, see big picture, the things that we are grateful for.
1:55
Take a pause here.
I'm sure all of us have tons of childhood shit and things that we wish were different and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
But there are still elements of our past, our childhood, our adolescence, our teenage years, our college years, whatever it is, right where you feel grateful.
Some of you guys are superstars and and are always grateful for everything.
2:11
And I'm, you know, I'm Jelly.
I don't roll that way.
It's not like I wake up and I'm like, man, I just want to count my lucky stars.
Like, I just don't.
That's just not how it function.
And I've been trying this on, and I I hope you do too, 'cause it's been, it's been really like improving my life.
I tried to do this or wake up thinking to myself, if I were 85 years old and I got to go through a time machine and be back in my body as I am now, to experience my life from my 85 year old self seeing it again.
2:37
If I wake up and I feel my body and I'm like, ah, this is so nice, I don't have all the joint pain.
Ah, my wrists don't have arthritis.
And then I wake up and I'm like, I remember when we used to live here, even when I looked at Layla this morning, I was thinking to myself, man, like, this is my wife, right at the beginning of our marriage, you know, we're only six years in.
2:56
We wake up and we walk over to, you know, to to have our coffee in the morning, which we always do.
And I'm like, isn't this so nice?
I remember when we used to have coffee here together.
This is great.
And I look out the window, look how young Vegas looks.
It doesn't have all these buildings and these flying cars like it does now.
It's, it's so underdeveloped compared to what it is today.
3:12
And I feel gratitude for an external just environment, which I would never really think that, but I know that my 85 year old self will totally appreciate those things.
And as I'm going through the day applying that frame also to business where I can see the, you know, the CEOs of our companies and the people that work within our holding company at acquisition.com, they're stressed about things.
3:29
And in my mind I'm thinking, isn't this cool that we get to do this together?
Isn't that fun?
Isn't that neat?
Look how cute that is.
It is the most powerful frame that I've encountered.
I think the reason it's so powerful is one it operates almost entirely from A-frame of gratitude that for me I can feel for whatever reason.
3:45
Gratitude journals.
The meditation sticks like that.
Like I don't feel that but thinking about my 85 year old self being able to re experience life through my 32 year old body, it's really shifted how I see things and also decreases the amount of anxiety and stress I have over outcomes because I'm like this isn't going to matter in the long run.
4:03
I also think it helps from a business, the term loosely but like a business wisdom perspective.
Because when you think about the decisions, you think about it within the larger context of your life and you're not like Oh yeah, I'm going to make that short term dollars because you're like, I'm 85.
I don't have anything to prove.
You know what I mean?
4:18
If you think about like the really stressful things that you've had happen in your past, I feel nostalgia for the sleeping on the floor that I did at my gyms for how tired I used to be at the end of the day of taking 20 plus consoles for months and months and months on end.
And rather than feeling stressed about it or resenting the fact that I have to do it, like I get to do this.
4:35
I get to make videos, talking to a camera, look at my 32 year old self go trying to make his content, trying to help other entrepreneurs.
Like, isn't that cool?
If I had to characterize seasons of my life, I would say I was very angry as a teenager and young adult.
And then I went from angry to being aware of the deficit between where I was and what I considered to be happiness.
4:55
From there I kind of switched to what I have affectionately called the Fuck Happiness mantra which I lived for a very long period of time, which was I stopped trying to optimize for happiness at all and just really stopped thinking about it all together, which I think move me closer to something that I would consider to be joy.
You can be joyful independent of circumstance because joy is from within.
5:13
Happiness tends to come from external right, it comes from circumstance.
And I think when we look at the grandparents or at least the people that that are older that I aspire to be is like they just have an internal joy.
They have gratitude for being able to live it one last time because at the end of the day like it is our last time, I'm being real here.
5:30
Like, I've had a guy that I graduated with died a few months ago and he was a really successful guy, really smart kid, did really well.
I mean, this is really dark, but he got randomly murdered and you know, he had grand plans for his life.
5:47
And I think to myself, I'm like, you know, tomorrow really isn't guaranteed.
Thank you for your attention.
I know you have a lot of places that you can put it and I'm grateful that you chose to share the moment with me.
So those nation appreciate you guys.
Bye.






0:00
That in essence is what entrepreneurship feels like, is uncertainty of whether or not all of the time that you've put in is actually going to work out.
And you have to get really comfortable with that is that you won't know because if you were to be guaranteed the outcome that you're going to get what you want, you wouldn't want to do it to begin with because everyone would already be doing it because it's already guaranteed, which means the opportunity is gone.
0:24
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So interesting.
So the way that I have always approached this is I I am trying to get people to change their frame of reference.
0:45
Frame of reference.
Speaking of things that need to be defined, frame of reference to me.
Are your beliefs and values OK?
And.
I didn't even think that's what you meant, I thought.
I totally thought you meant something different, so that's why we.
Yes, exactly.
This is why you define things.
OK, so and and I will say all of this in what I just heard you say is that where I'm coming at things is from beliefs and values.
1:05
Where you're coming at things is from behaviors and traits.
It's very interesting, very interesting.
Like I am gonna think about this so much moving forward as to one is it is beliefs and values just particular to me and that is I try to help people make change in their life.
1:23
I'm wasting all my fucking time because this is just the thing that resonates with me.
Or is there something I'm getting to?
The thing that's underneath your behaviors and traits and that if people don't address this, I'll never get to that or I'm just wasting my time.
You were going to say something, I think.
It's value.
So if we were to like when it's like I have these values, a value is just a behavioral short code.
1:44
When this happens, I do this someone who is loyal.
When he's out and his wife isn't there, hot girl comes up and says hey want to get a drink value.
It means set of behaviors.
I say no or I say I'm married or no thank you.
Whatever and so values are skills because you can train them.
2:03
That's.
Interesting values are skills.
I would say the adherence to a value is a skill that you can train, but if you have the wrong value that you adhere to, you're going to be in trouble.
Here's why I start with beliefs and values.
I think so much of the human animal is invisible to the person and that if they they'll never be able to control their behaviors, if they don't control the emotions that drive the behaviors.
2:28
And I think emotions are an echo of your beliefs and values.
And I can change somebody's emotion, like their cognitive the way that they frame something cognitively will drive their biological response to that moment, which is insane.
So the quote, nothing is either good or bad, but thinking makes it so the death of your mother is not good or bad.
2:50
Thinking it's bad makes it bad.
Now that is you and I think come at that from very different angles.
Totally.
And so not.
A bad way, I think it's great.
No, no, no, dude, this is so intriguing to me.
One, because all I care about is, are you getting the outcome that you want?
3:06
Yes or no?
And if you are amazing and so you're giving me new tools, new ways to think about this.
OK, so just a quick breakdown of of frame of reference.
So my hypothesis is that everybody's life is entirely controlled by their frame of reference, the frame of reference.
3:23
The best analogy would be to say that your frame of reference is a pair of glasses that you put on that distort the living shit out of the world that none of us have.
The option of taking the glasses off, taking the glasses off would be to exist outside of your biology.
3:40
Nobody's going to be able to do that.
So you see the world in a hyper distorted way.
Now, all of us over a lifetime of reward, punishment, oh God, would you call it approval?
Like there's all kinds of things that happen to you.
Attention, affection, approval.
3:56
OK, so all of us are getting that constantly from the time that we were born until now and we choose who to value that from.
And you've talked about your parents and all that, like, so anyway, you can choose, but you most people never become consciously aware of what's happening.
4:13
And so they're the distortion of their lens happen slowly over time in ways that they simply recognize mistakenly as objective truth.
So they think they see the world as it is, not through the warped lenses of their frame of reference.
4:28
Now once you realize that you can change the way the lenses warp the world.
Now you can start to shape your lenses based on action outcome.
I did a thing and it had this outcome.
And so it all becomes about your ability to predict the outcome of your actions, which is and we will get into sort of the physics of making money, but to me that's all about the ability to predict, like what tests to run and how to interpret the test and all that.
4:56
So it ultimately boils down to your frame of reference.
And if you don't get your frame of reference right, the world will be so warped you will not be able to predict the outcome of your behaviors.
Most people end up in the mistaken loop of my emotions are the the correct which one needs to define, and they don't.
5:12
My emotions are the correct response to this stimulus, even though it does not lead me towards my goals.
And they spend their whole life spiraling in emotion and that's why they're never able to get out of it and and begin to Polish the lens in a way that actually gives them something useful.
And what you're saying is none of that fucking matters.
5:30
All that matters is whether they do the thing that's going to yield the outcome or not.
I think it it just, I think it just saves a lot of time and a lot of because when we try to name these emotions like you know what am I feeling?
I'm kind of it's like this whole conversation of not this but like that self conversation.
5:46
It's like what does that accomplish until you then decide to do something in the real world like nothing matters and from a from an outcome perspective.
But I'll just share something with the audience because I have a my my first really big viral video was me just talking about like what how you scale companies.
6:02
And I first thing I talk about is scaling the entrepreneur.
I have 4 frames that I go through in the in the video and I used to believe that entrepreneurs get limited by skills with this is, this is what I used to believe, which is skills, character traits and beliefs.
6:17
Those are that's what I used to say.
I now believe that character traits are another way of saying when this happens, they do this which is trainable, which makes it a skill.
And then beliefs are when they are presented with this information, they then make this decision, which is yet again another thing that can be trained.
6:37
Because if you can learn it and it's a skill which means it just comes to as I see the world, it just comes down to skills.
And just because it's harder to define charisma because it might be 20 things because we have a term that buckets 50 behaviors or whatever it is, just because it's harder to describe doesn't make it not a skill.
6:57
And that's why I like the soft stuff in business.
Like, we probably agree that the soft stuff matters a ton in building a big company, the culture, right.
Mackenzie did a big study on this.
Layla cites a lot more than I do because she's on the on the people side.
But in a normal business, two out of three strategies fail.
7:13
Like new initiatives fail in businesses where they have the soft stuff down, one out of three strategies fail.
So two out of three succeeds.
So you get twice the percentage likely to success on big strategic initiatives.
I.
Guess why?
Why is beyond is beyond me.
I that that was just that was the yeah I don't get into my cousins yeah I don't get into because right this is that yeah doctor Cash is my my closest friend like a brother he jokes about he he obsesses about why things work I just care that it works and so anyways to to circle back on this is that people consider like leadership to be like a Foo Foo or like communication skills it's like soft stuff right.
7:51
Sales metric, you know like we have all these metrics driven things versus this and it's just because it's harder to measure doesn't make it less important and that was that was a big realization for me is that it was just because it was harder for me to measure, but it doesn't make it less important.
And so these skills that we're talking about, we try to find ways to measure them by saying when I'm when somebody walks, like I'll give you an example with our video team we realized that we have much better direct camera work for our content if because we were, we were like, man, we have this one guy on our team he's so good to film with.
8:23
And some of the other guys were just like not as good.
I'm not like as amped about it.
Like why is that?
So we could control the things that we're going to walk into the into the video session with like, OK, am I, did I sleep well?
Did I, you know, all that stuff.
If that's controlled and I still change, then it means there's something in the environment.
And so we then observed, actually, to be fair, we asked the the superstar to observe what are the things you're doing.
8:45
And so we noticed that while he's while he's filming, he's like, yeah, he's like, Jess, this is awesome.
And so we said write that down and then what else do you do?
It's like, oh, I I write down questions while you're talking, while I'm.
So he had to be able to multitask, so he had to Bob his head while we're talking and write down, follow up questions for what we were saying.
9:04
And so then all of a sudden it became this continuous flow of consciousness with literally constant reinforcement while we were filming visually.
And so then we gave that SOP to the other people on the team and all of a sudden filming with them was way better.
And so people would be like, he's just got a great vibe.
9:22
It just means that we don't know how to describe all the little behaviors that that person does.
And and say, when I start talking, nod your head real, right.
And when when there's something that you don't understand, write it down and ask me because, I mean, somebody else doesn't understand it too.
9:38
And it makes for great content.
Oh, right.
And so we had this big list.
And then now we operationalized what it's like or what what you what behaviors you have to do to become somebody who's good behind the camera.
Which means it's a skill that can be learned, like charisma, like patience, like confidence, like whatever.
9:55
And so boiling it down that way has just demystified the world for me and just made it a lot easier to navigate because I don't have to spend 90% of my time trying to figure out why I'm doing whatever I'm doing.
All I care about is whether I do what I need to do to get the outcome.
10:11
And if I do the thing and I don't get the outcome, that means there's another variable that I haven't controlled or I don't understand.
And if you know in the words of BF Skinner, if many variables are present, many variables must be studied.
So sometimes we want to oversimplify it.
But like there might be 10 queues in the environment that create a banger session, but if we have 9, is it better than the last one that had three?
10:33
Probably.
And so then we just make progress in that way.
OK, so this is your superpower.
This is the thing.
That dude, I just look at you in awe.
This it's really, really incredible what you do.
And I am so grateful to live on the timeline where the Internet exists and Someone Like You with this insane ability comes out and just creates all this content.
10:55
You know, I am as obsessed with learning as you are.
And so yeah, it's just incredible.
And to never stop learning is is the great gift of being a human.
OK, So the thing that I think that you're just unreasonably good at is taking a very complex problem that maybe I'm spending too much time and the why is this happening?
11:13
And you're just skipping past that and you're going, OK, I'm going to break it down into these, do this when this happens, do this when that happens to that.
I'm going to try to get to the physics of business through a weird question but keep in mind for anybody watching that's that doesn't know my story.
11:30
I I've been in the world of entrepreneurship for over 20 years.
I've had some pretty incredible success.
So this is, this is a well educated question from I've been in this for a long time so it's going to seem like a weird angle to attack it.
This for the audience more than you hang with me because if we really can dissect this, I think it will help people understand the magic thing that you do.
11:52
You rewrote your book completely four times.
Something happened when you read it the first time, the first time that you realized I have to start over completely.
That thing, whatever that was.
I promise you have the chills just thinking about it.
12:07
That is the thing that makes you go to business.
And so I need to understand what abstract.
Use the book as an example.
But I I want people to understand this is an abstracted version of something very important, which is you were able you did a thing.
12:24
I'm guessing you had to do the thing in order to find the part that wasn't right, but you were able to then identify that part, re conceptualize, get more intelligent as you did it.
Again, it's what I call the physics of progress, but like what your ability to learn and break into constituent parts is is the thing certainly I want to learn from.
12:45
So when you reread what you first wrote, what clicked do you remember?
Well, I got feedback, so I sent the first, which was really the first draft I end up sending to People was V nine of the book.
13:02
Had you rewritten it all over?
How many times have?
You read about that.
So that was like I had gone through.
I mean I start back at the top, I re edit everything again, start back at the top.
Without feedback, correct.
That's the one I want to know about.
OK, the first time you read through the book.
Now I have to re conceive of the whole approach.
13:20
What happened in that moment?
It wasn't clear or wasn't simple enough.
That's that's it.
Like and I like to use this example because it it might make sense for a lot of the audience if I were to say edit, assume you know how to edit videos just for the the simplicity.
13:39
If I said go edit this video, someone might edit it.
And I said get, you know, edit this video in 30 minutes.
And they edit the short clip and they give it back to me.
And I say, OK, if I give you 2 hours, what else would you do?
And they're like, oh, I might do this and I might do this.
I might do this.
13:54
I'm like, OK, go do that and come back.
And they come back and I'm like, OK, if I give you 2 weeks for this 32nd clip, what else would you do?
Like I might reimagine the entire thing and actually lay it out in this way.
It would take way more time.
But like, I think it would actually still be better.
14:11
It's like, cool, do that and they come back And then when there's no more loose room, like, what else could you do to make this better?
At that point, to me, the work is done.
I have exhausted my level of skill and understanding like I can't make the leads look better at current.
14:27
Now I'll bet you in a year I'll think of some things that I could have used to make it better.
But at present moment there's nothing that I can think that I would either cut or add in or breakdown or add a visual for or lower the reading level on to make sure that everyone would understand it.
14:44
And so whenever I have those like it's like a hangnail, you know what I mean?
It's like this little splinter or I'm like this could be better.
Does it start with a feeling or with a fact?
It's a good question.
I don't know.
15:05
I think I read something and I think that wasn't as clear as it was in my It's not as clear reading it as it is in my head.
So what's the discrepancy?
Like this term is confusing, or this phrase doesn't make sense, or I need to break this into a paragraph or whatever it is.
And honestly, it's just doing that like it took me.
15:23
It's funny, I had this this cover letter that I was going to include in every book and it was one page.
And I think I put 25 hours into the one page.
And it's it's interesting because people hear that they're like, that's crazy.
I'm like to me 25 hours doesn't count as one unit of work, yet thinking.
15:40
Hundreds.
Dude, you got it?
Yeah, 100%.
And so I ended up actually not using the cover letter, which is even more ironic.
But when my team saw how many iterations went through it, I was like, every single person will read this part.
Now you know the last chapter in the book, maybe it's 20%, or maybe it's 13%, or whatever it is, we'll get to the last chapter.
16:03
But the first page.
Every single person who reads the entire book will read that page.
Every person who reads half the book will read that page.
Every person who reads only the 1st chapter will read that page.
And so it's like, if anything, I should put more time into that.
But I approached just about every page of the book that way.
16:18
It was just that my team was able to see it on one page publicly.
And so that's we we wrote, my editor, not Doctor Cashy, wrote the book because we wanted it to be around in 100 years.
And so that was the frame was like, it has to be, It has to work now.
16:35
And the easiest way to know if it's going to work in 100 years is does it work 100 years ago?
Because someone 100 years ago read this book and it still helped them advertise better.
Because I'm going to read this book 100 years ago and help them make an offer that more people say yes to.
If the answer is yes, then we pass that Lummus test.
And that's actually really hard.
16:50
It's a very simple sentence to say, very hard to do, especially when you're talking about media, content, platforms, like all of these different things.
And so I think it's having an exceptionally high bar for what you what you want to do.
And having been rewarded in the past, Like if this had been my first book, it wouldn't have been as good.
17:11
But Offers was my first book and I wrote offers in 1/5 at the time as it took me to write leads.
Because you didn't hold yourself to as high of a standard.
Because you knew what better looked like.
I'd never been rewarded for writing a book before, and so once I was rewarded, the amount of time I'm willing to put towards something to get rewarded again extends.
17:31
So it's like intermittent reinforcement from a behaviors perspective.
That's how you get addicted to the slot machine.
Whatever.
It's like you reward the first time, immediately, the next time, reward in 30 seconds the next time.
Humans have a longer attribution than dogs do just for context, but you can continue to extend reinforcement until eventually you can eliminate it and the behavior will persist, which is kinda cool.
17:53
Which is very cool.
OK, I wanna no, I don't know what you're apologizing for.
OK, so we're at the beginning of what will hopefully be a magically delicious breakdown of how Alex hormozizes things.
OK, So what I took away from that is that step one is gonna be start with the goal.
18:11
So when I think about business, you need to understand what your goal is because you're and this, this goes for life as well, boys and girls.
If you do not have your North Star, if you don't know what is guiding everything, then you're going to be adrift.
And so when you think about you and OK, this is definitely me putting my language on you, here's how I experienced that first moment.
18:31
I read something and something feels off.
So for me, it always starts with a feeling, but I know that feeling translates into a fact.
And so I'm going to try to find the fact.
And so you were saying this isn't as clear as it could be.
And so now you have this North Star.
I'm trying to write a book that's going to be around in 100 years.
18:48
Again, I'm.
I'm maybe connecting dots that don't line up.
And so you'll correct me anywhere I go wrong.
We've got the idea of the, the guy with the one goat who's sleeping with this under his pillow, which, dude, you cannot imagine how much A, that makes me like you even more than I already did.
And B, that's so important for people to have, like, a person that they're thinking about that will make all the fight worth it.
19:09
OK, So be around in 100 years.
The guy with the goat needs to really understand this.
I read it, and because I know what my goal is, I have a feeling, a trained feeling, that something is off.
That's my again, this is me.
I understand you're different.
This is my feeling is my subconscious speaking to me.
19:27
It's already picked up on the problem.
I can feel it, and I'm going to translate that into something.
What I really need people to understand is you're going to take all of Alex's advice and you're still going to fail.
And the reason you're going to fail is because you're not yet good at the thing that you're good at, which is finding the fact and saying, oh, this is the very thing that's broken now as you have said.
19:46
So I'll just channel you for a second.
You're, you're going to suck at this for a while.
But don't worry.
Just keep doing it and you will get better at identifying the fact, OK.
Given how much you're nodding, going to assume so far, I'm on the right track here.
So how do you.
20:02
Yeah, exactly right.
How do you identify that fact?
So what is, is it just repetition?
You've just done it 1000 times.
So you can either have basically it's got contingency based reinforcement which is the environment corrects you, right.
20:17
You put the thing on the market, no one buys it, no one watches it, whatever it is, right.
The other is that you get feedback from somebody who has more knowledge than you.
And so you can either have a person give you direct feedback on you know, listen to your sales call and says hey you know, try this next time.
And ideally, that's where the feedback loop is.
20:33
Like if if I have a one-on-one with somebody and I give them that feedback a week later, it's much more powerful to be there an hour after the call, like the moment the call's over.
And even more powerful if you're sitting there with them and you can be like, say, like this.
And then you get the feedback loops way faster because they'll remember because they'll be in the moment of trying to learn like.
20:52
So if we're trying to teach sales and I'm going to, I'm going to come back.
But if if we're trying to teach sales because we've got 3 brick and mortar chains in our portfolio teaching frontline sales like very transactional, like front desk walks in, go here, whatever.
If you train them off site, which is what most companies do, then they will remember better off site than on site.
21:11
So you want to train them in the environment that they have to do the behavior because they'll have environmental cues while they're learning.
Just like if you if you study for a test, if you can study in the actual tread that you're going to take the test in, you'll remember more of your answers.
What?
Oh, for sure.
What?
Yeah.
If you ever, have you ever been on the phone and like had some conversation and then you walk the same path a week later and then as you see a tree, you're like, Oh yeah, I was thinking about because it's because you learn and you have.
21:36
Palace idea, geography.
That's interesting.
Actually.
Now that you say that, that makes a lot of sense.
I wonder if it's different for guys I don't want to be realized.
You guys have spatial memory.
Interesting.
All right.
Step one, we'll start with the goal.
We went through that.
Identify the fact, Yeah.
OK.
How do we get contingency versus versus individual?
21:52
So either either your environment gives you that feedback because it didn't work or somebody who knows more and has done it before multiple times can recognize the pattern for you.
So when you say like find the fact I would have just The only thing I would have maybe tweaked on the earlier preface was the feeling is because of pattern recognition.
22:12
I know this isn't right because it hasn't been right.
It looks like something that hasn't been right again in the past, and we always have something called successive approximation, so like.
Success of.
Successive approximation right?
Like girls named Tiffany are crazy, right?
And I mean a second girl named Tiffany.
Blowing up the feed.
22:27
Right now, right.
Yes.
Second girl named Tiffany also crazy, but looks different.
But I'm like, wait a second, I know Tiffany's.
You're all crazy, right?
Like, so you have a success or product like you learn.
It's a silly example but that is like, that's how we can generalize learning.
And the bigger, the the more depth you have in terms of the principles around any skill, the more you can generalize learnings from one thing to another.
22:49
OK, that makes a lot of sense.
Pattern recognition, huge.
Getting people to help you short circuit that huge.
OK, so getting into the reinforcement, what I want to understand is how I'm going to ask it and then we'll see if I think I know the answer.
23:10
But the real thing you're trying to figure out when you're doing the testing is what would need to change in order for this to work.
The reason I say it like that is because the language I would have naturally used is why didn't this work?
23:26
But you don't care about why, You just want to know what would I have to change in order to get this to work?
How do you?
We'd use experts if they're available, But if we're just testing, let's say we have to brute force this.
How do you go through that?
You, I've heard you say the number of tests that I thought were going to crush and they just absolutely tank.
23:45
So you thought you had it and all you get is an answer says no.
So all you have is no.
How do you turn that no into a new action item?
Yeah, so I think it's breaking down.
Didn't work from binary to a continuum.
24:00
So it's not.
It didn't work.
It didn't work well enough.
And so that's a huge one when it comes to like running ads, making cold call, whatever it is to get customers, whatever you want to do, it's not yes or no, it's how well, right.
And that just says it's an easier frame.
And so then you have to go, at least from my perspective, you break it down to first principles of, OK, what has to happen for someone to buy.
24:20
It's like well.
So that's just a whole lump of psychology right there.
Behaviors.
They have to see it.
They don't see it or hear it.
They will not buy it because they won't know you exist.
OK, that so and that luckily like within the marketing world because that's what the book is about is measurable.
24:37
Like did the impression get displayed, did the e-mail get delivered?
That is you can see that on any, any platform.
The next one is like did they engage with it.
So that's a behavior they engaged which would be they open the e-mail or they open the e-mail and click the link inside of my e-mail, they click the ad to then get to you know the landing page, whatever it is.
24:58
So they engaged to a degree.
The next, you know, the next thing is that they're going to like, in order for me to contact them in the future, then I need to have some way to contact them.
So they have to give that to me if I don't already have it.
Like an outbound thing.
You'd already have their contact information you want to reply.
25:13
If you're running an AD, then they need to give you the contact information so that you can reach out to them.
But it's really breaking down.
Forget what they think, forget what they feel like.
I I wholeheartedly reject the like.
There are 7 stages of awareness.
It's like, how the fuck do you know?
25:32
Like well, they have to have a desire and then it's like, how many people have bought things without desire?
Tons.
All we know is that when they see this thing, they take their wallet out and they purchase, period.
Right.
And the same thing with like a sales script.
Like, I truly believe that if you knew every single variable that it took for somebody to buy, you get 100% of people to buy.
25:53
Now the problem is that we don't have every variable every time for every person.
And so we do the best approximation we can to hit as many of those piano keys to get them to purchase, right.
And so that is how I that's how I approach all of them, whether it's, you know, what do I figure out what to sell, which is the offers book, who do I sell it to, which is the leads book.
26:13
And then, you know, future books will answer 1 singular question.
And the leads book was fundamentally like and the reason it's called leads instead of advertising is because I test advertising versus leads and leads beat advertising, even though the book is fundamentally about advertising in the divine advertising.
It's the process of making known.
And so did I make it known?
26:29
Great.
I advertised like she advertised that she was with that guy all last night.
Like she should let it be known, right.
She made people aware.
And so there's only four ways you can do that, right?
You can do one-on-one and you can do one to many.
Like I can tell you one-on-one in an environment where no one else can see me.
Or I can put it on a bulletin board.
Worked 1000 years ago, works today.
26:47
And then I can do that in public.
I can do that in private.
So you've got, sorry, I just repeat the same.
You can do that to people who know you and people who don't know you.
So you got one to one to people who know you, which is warm reach outs.
You've got one to one to people who don't know you, which is called reach outs.
You've got one to many to people who know you, which is making content to your audience.
27:07
And then you got one to one to many to people who don't know you, which is pay dads.
You rent other people's audiences and you display your thing.
You let them know about your stuff.
And so break it down that way.
Like there's no other way that someone will buy unless they find out about you, period.
Fight me.
Know it like no one can fight that.
27:22
And that's basically what the process of writing these books comes down to is I want to make a series of statements that are beyond reproach so that no one can argue with them.
You cannot get someone to buy unless they have given you a way to contact them.
27:41
So you walk down that logic tree and then you figure out which of these didn't happen.
So I ran an ad and I didn't make money.
Well, there's like 100 things that have to happen between then between them seeing it and them giving you money.
So we just look at and we start at the front because if you don't get to the third step, there's no point in trying to fix the third step because you haven't gotten people to even click.
28:05
And so the first thing you know we'll talk about is like, how do we create a hook?
How do we create a headline that people that will capture someone's attention?
That's it.
And then from there, it's like if you master that part or get good enough at that part, then you move to the second part.
And I this has worked very well for me because then it demystifies the concept of success and I stopped judging myself as being a good or bad.
28:26
It's just like, how likely is the thing that I did here, get them to move to the next step?
OK, how likely is it if I show this thing, they get to move to the next step and you just keep going until eventually you're like, oh wait, I made money and then you have all the the pieces together and then you do as many times as you can.
28:43
All right.
Just going to actually first let me address something.
So to say things that are beyond reproach, that's what you said.
I want to make sure that I'm saying things that are beyond reproach.
To me.
It's like another way of saying it's got to all be first principles. 100%.
Cool.
Makes sense.
So you're trying to boil things down to this is true, does not matter what people say, think, believe that.
29:02
It just is true.
OK?
That I think, is critically important for anybody that wants to scale a business.
You believe that we live in a deterministic universe?
OK, I actually don't even know what that means.
OK, so cause and effect, pure and simple.
Billiard balls bouncing around the table.
That behaviors are the the cause of a behavior is knowable.
29:23
I wouldn't.
I'd say there is a cause of the behavior.
I don't know if we can know it necessarily.
We can try and control as many of the environmental factors, but I don't know if we can say This is why.
Well, I'm trying to avoid this.
Why?
And get to if if the cause and effect God, is that a pure, why?
29:43
OK for for Alex, I'm going to disagree with you violently, based on your own principles, that none of what you do would work if it couldn't be known what you needed to do to elicit a given response.
Otherwise everything would be entirely random.
30:00
And So what I think you know, and what makes you so good at overcoming sales objections is that, you know, if I can get them, oh God, I don't know how you would explain the difference.
Between knowing why and knowing that.
So this is cool.
I just care about that.
And so this conversation.
I know that if I say these 12 questions when this person walks in the door, the likelihood that they will buy is 38%.
30:23
Do I know why they buy?
No.
I know that if I do these things, this will happen.
Perfect.
Deterministic.
So that that helps me to understand how you go about doing this.
So it seems to me what you were doing is you were trying to map behavioral cause and effect, which is why at the beginning of the episode you even said like I'm really into behavioral.
30:47
Psychologies that I think behavioral.
Psychology Perfect.
A personal obsession of mine, because I also believe that we live in a deterministic universe which calls into question free will.
We're gonna set that aside for now, yeah.
And so.
It totally does.
Do you think that free will exists?
Less and less by the day.
31:04
Yeah, I I think eventually we all get to the point where it's like it can't.
Yeah, then you get into very interesting questions about morality.
Yes.
Right, Which we won't get into.
Correct.
At least not now.
Maybe at the at the end but.
It's OK if you kill somebody if it's temporary insanity, but if it was premeditated, it's bad.
31:21
But So what?
So where do we draw the line of, OK, that means that there was environmental conditions that made this person act in this way that they wouldn't otherwise do.
But it's like were there not environmental conditions that created the person that that trained these behaviors that then created the murder?
Correct.
31:39
I'll just.
But now as as marketers if if we can understand.
Right.
Right.
If we can understand what triggers behaviors now, now the you can truly predict and execute because ultimately that's what this game is.
31:57
And the feedback loop that I think people either know about you or intuit about you is that you're really good at this process.
I did a thing.
It did not yield the results that I wanted and I was very shrewd about the next thing that I tried and getting people shrewd about because there's going to be 10, it's really 10,000.
32:17
There's going to be a lot of things you could do when the first thing comes back and you only got 38% of what you were looking for and you want to get as close to 100 as you can.
So being able to do the next most logical thing logic as defined as I have a goal and this is the thing most likely to get me closest to it, the ability to do that rapidly, I will.
32:39
I don't know if you'll agree with this, but I'll add bolt on to your definition of intelligence that if you're you said the rate at which you change your behavior is is the definition of intelligence.
I will say the the rate at which you can identify the the most meaningful next step or the most likely to be successful next step is also intelligence.
33:02
Not that that really matters, but this is the game people are playing and I.
Say it chunks up.
What does that mean?
So the rate.
So learning is defined by similar condition, new behavior, right?
And so if I have a fast rate of learning means that I have a new behavior that I do in that condition.
The only way I can have that new behavior is have some sort of knowledge, so I think it chunks up to the same.
33:21
Got it, got it, got it.
OK.
I see what you're saying prerequisite, right.
So if these two are the same idea of manifesting in slightly different ways as you come back down, that I think is what people are learning from you and why you're so effective.
So the the question becomes, do you have a methodology for identifying the next most useful test to run or is it true?
33:48
This is all just going to come back to the same answer, experts and repetition.
It is.
And then I did try to create an operationalized version of that from a funnel perspective, because I realized that some people don't have the money or whatever to test more times than you did.
You know, succeed faster, and so I operate off the theory of constraints, meaning that every system is constrained in some way, and then if you simply identify what the constrain is and deconstrain it, it will grow until its next natural constraint.
34:11
Can you give me a concrete example?
Let's say you you've got a Shopify store that sells coffee mugs and you spend $1000 a month and you make $3000 back on on the mugs.
34:30
So the constraint of the system at some point will either be I run out of mugs.
That could be the constraint.
It could be that I just need to spend more money because that might be the constraint today.
And then I spend enough that I run out of mugs.
Or I spend enough that my cost per impression exceeds my profit because I go to colder and colder audiences.
34:46
So then the constraint there might be like I need to build a brand or I need to get trusted sources to increase the like the increase the awareness, let more people know about my stuff so that when they do see my ad, they're more likely to make the purchase.
And so it it's really being able to accurately identify what the constraint is.
And so for me when I walked this through the book, I said usually the constraint that I will focus on in a funnel is usually the one that has the largest incremental, has the largest throughput difference with the smallest incremental change.
35:18
And so it's like if I have you know, 50% of people who are scheduling, 30% of people who are show or let's say 25% of people are showing and then you know 30% of people are closing.
It's like, OK, if I'm looking at these things, which one am I going to attack?
35:34
Well, I'll probably attack the 25% show rate because if I get a 10% or or 25% increase, just for math sake, I would double the throughput.
If I increase my schedule rate from 50 to 75, which is a 25% increase from an absolute perspective, I would only have a relative difference of 50%.
35:51
So I would make I would get more bang for my buck by focusing on the constraint, which is the one that the smallest incremental improvement increases the throughput the most, and that you can use math to find out.
Yeah, this is this is business for people listening.
36:08
So my obsession is helping people understand how to solve novel problems, not problems you've never heard of before, problems no one has ever heard of before.
And this is where you have to get down to first principles.
Thinking anything that can be turned into math should be something that we talk a lot about here.
36:25
Yeah.
So because then you're pulling it out of the realm of emotions.
I know I've been talking a lot about emotions, but I'm only trying to identify that as a as a predictive mechanism for the next thing, which may be just where you and I don't see the world the same.
So for me to understand what the next smartest thing is, you think, you think behavioral behavior.
36:50
What's the behavior I need to do that may be more useful.
And I will really be thinking about this after this discussion.
The way that I've always thought about it is if I can understand the psychology in that moment, I'll be able to predict the behavior.
So maybe wasted time or maybe necessary, maybe you intuitive, I don't know.
Time will tell him that.
37:05
But it's it's very, very interesting.
OK, so people are they need a rubric by which they figure out what the next thing that they need to test is.
You've just offered one which is to understand the limiting factor.
37:21
When you understand the limiting factor, then you're able to think mathematically and remove said limiting factor or at least know where to approach that problem.
I think that's incredibly helpful as so when you're explaining all this.
37:36
I your business model at acquisition.com is a pure understanding of.
Even though you're able to, even though you're willing to give all of your secrets away, there's still going to be a gap in execution.
Why?
Why are you better at this than most people?
37:53
I've done it more times.
That's it?
You really believe that?
Yeah, I've done it a lot of times.
I think that's a big part of it.
And then I think that there are elements that we have that are kind of competitive modes which we purposefully set up like we are building this brand so that we can attract the best talent.
So like if you have let's say a chain of nail salons, right, which is a company I'm looking at investing in right now.
38:14
So if you're listening to this, you're great, love your company and and so you have a chain of nail salons and you will probably struggle to get a plus talent to go to that.
I will not struggle to get a plus talent to place for you because they will want to work in an acquisition.com company because they know there's a huge backing behind it.
38:33
They know that we're going to be shooting big.
We're going to try and do big stuff.
And they might think the founder might be a first time founder of getting to a business of that size, but we are not.
And so they have a higher likelihood.
We have, they have a higher confidence that we will help the business grow to a much higher degree, meaning that their career can grow, they have more opportunities, it'll build their resume, all that kind of stuff.
38:52
And so from a competitive MO perspective, we're able to get better people and if we get better people, we build better companies and then that becomes a flywheel because the more companies we take on, the more we grow, the more success stories we have, the more talent wants to come and it just it just continues to feed itself and that's something that continues to compound in time and that's purposely built as a long term competitive advantage.
39:11
OK.
Talk to me about leverage.
I think that's an important part of this puzzle.
So there's a couple moments in your story around leverage.
One is is the guy that told you, hey, you shouldn't be in the gym business, you should be teaching people how to do this.
And then the other moment, at least for me on the outside, was when you realized I'm not gonna help these guys launch their businesses.
39:33
So I'm gonna sell them the course that I put together.
What's the What is leverage?
Why does it matter and how do people get some?
OK.
So First off just for the just for the audience, it was much closer to a franchise than a course.
39:51
So it was, it was a licensing model.
So we had it was more, it was closer to licensing plus services than it was a course just because it would just do, we don't even sell courses.
So like, I think that that's because there's a lot of people in that space that follow my stuff and so they make that assumption, which is fine and I only set the record straight for for Clarities beyond that.
40:11
Leverage as we define it is the difference between what you put in and what you get out.
And so if I and it's volume times, leverage equals output.
So it's how many times you do something times how much you get for each time you do it equals output.
40:28
So if I do 100 sales calls and I have no skill, then I will get fewer scale, fewer sales than somebody who does the same 100 sales calls and has much higher skill.
So skills create leverage.
You get more for what you put in at a simple at a, at A at a basic level, but it works with anything.
40:45
So if you're trying to invest, it's like if I can invest a smaller amount of money and get a bigger return, then I have more leverage, right?
The reason debt is considered leverage is because you can put 20% of the cash in and get 80% as a loan.
You buy a building 5 times bigger than you normally could.
So you get more for what you put in.
And so there are degrees of leverage.
41:03
And this is wholeheartedly taken from Naval and I'll probably have to think more about it because I haven't written the book on leverage yet.
So I'm borrowing, but I I remembered as the four C's.
He has different words for it, but you've got collaboration, capital code and content.
Those are the 4C's of leverage.
Like we make this video right now, we make this podcast and we put X amount of effort in, but we get unlimited upside on it.
41:26
Many millions of people can see it or one person can see it, but we get more for what we put in.
The better and better we get at this code you can write, you can write an app one time and then unlimited amount of people can use the code or use the app.
Collaboration is I say OK I will now teach 20 guys to sell and I will get 10 times the output that I had if I were selling.
41:47
And so I might not take any sales calls but make more sales than anybody else does because I have more leverage.
And so a big, you know, through line of the leads book is there's the Core 4, which is the first four things that I explained to you one-on-one.
One to many strangers and friends or people know you, people don't.
And then the other four to the four lead getters, people who let other people know on your behalf, which why their very nature have more leverage because you don't have to do it.
42:10
So if you can get your customers to tell other customers about your stuff using the Core 4 because they also have to use that.
Like a customer can only tell a customer by telling somebody through warm outreach, posting content about it, running an ad, unlikely and doing code outreach also unlikely, but they could do one of those four things and that's complete.
42:27
That completes the advertising cycle.
So you do something to get a lead getter who then does the Core 4 and around and around you go.
So I could also make ads to get affiliates who then run ads to get customers for me.
But if I go and spend, let's say I spend all my time and I get 10 sales a month of customers, right?
42:47
And let's say each customer is worth $1000 to me, great.
I'm going to cap at $10,000 a month if I use the same effort of marketing and sales and I sell 10 affiliates.
So still still same number of conversations, same number of humans, but I sell 10 affiliates per month and then those affiliates each month after that get me one customer each.
43:08
Well, then the first month I'll get $10,000 because each one of those guys got me a customer.
But then I'm still going to work and get another 10 affiliates next month.
So then next month I'm going to have last month 10 plus this month's 10.
So now I'll have 20 new customers and I do it again, I have 30 new customers.
43:24
And so I'm using the same amount of work to get more customers than I divide.
I directly went through it.
And so that is, that is a basic example of how leverage works within the context of advertising to get customers in a business.
So what is the, what is the way that you think about constructing a business or the way that you're going to structure something?
43:53
So when I first asked that question about leverage you you said something really interesting which was, hey, I just want to point out to everybody that that was a licensing model.
It meant something to you to make a, a distinction there, which I have a feeling there's there's a little bit of Hormozzi sauce in there that we would all benefit from understanding what, what drove that decision?
44:16
Why does that matter to you, you?
Mean saying that?
Structuring the business to be.
So this is exactly what went through my head when you said that was, oh shit.
Like, he actually had a more keen moment of understanding than has come across, at least to me.
44:32
And I've heard you tell that story multiple times and I've heard you say, oh, it was a licensing thing, but it never, I don't know, it never landed for me.
But this time I realized it really meant something to you.
So there was a keen insight there.
What?
What was the keen insight?
Why?
Why do it as a licensed model instead of just saying, oh this is the course, go use it.
44:52
Hey, MO's edition, quick break.
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, so send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with.
Tag them in one of my relayless posts and I will give you all the love of the world.
45:08
All right, so let's get back to the show.
If we added assistance and services where we would maybe run the ads for them and we would train their sales teams, which we do and we would give them the ads to run for their local area and we would help them build the landing pages to attract customers.
45:27
And we would give them the white label, you know, meal plans, grocery list for food preparation, you know, instructions for their clients.
If we do all of those things, then we would increase the likelihood that they would succeed and make more money.
And I can charge based on the a fraction of the value that I can produce for the majority of my customers.
45:48
And so if the average.
So right now Jim launched total company still continues to grow the average Jim Lord, which is what we call the community Lord, Lord, yeah, lording.
The average Jim Lord adds $200,000.
I wanna say two.
46:03
Shoot, I have to know the metric.
A lot.
Yeah, adds this is it, there we go.
Adds $200,000 a year to their business and 100,000 that's profit there, there that's what the the math is.
So the average Jim Lord adds $100,000 a year in profit.
46:19
I think it's a little bit more like 118 whatever and we can charge a percentage of the increase net profit that we are help we are able to help them generate on average and now we have to usually charge a significant discount on that because half the people are going to be below the average.
46:36
So for the people who are for, for half of them it's an even crazier deal.
You know they they, they pay for the license model.
They don't have to spend money to test ads.
We would say we already spent 50 grand in 20 markets.
These are the winning ads this month and they could just run them through the system and then just collect the money on the other side.
46:53
And so they get the speed and they don't have to have, they don't have to taste the test, you know the the, the failed ad test because we would incur that cost but we're able to distribute that cost at scale.
So no individual gym owner could spend $50,000 to test ads in all these different markets.
We could and then give it to 1000 gyms.
47:12
And so and again from a media perspective leverage, we could do that one time and 1000 gyms can do it at no incremental cost to us.
And so it is a very profitable business.
It still is a very profitable business.
All right, when you had that moment, and I'm sure people know this part of your story, you had the moment where you're fucking desperate.
47:28
You've lost everything twice.
You're scrambling to make money and you tell the guy I'm just going to give him a number that's high so that he doesn't bother me with it. 6 grand.
He's like, yes.
Had you already thought of it as a license model or you do those first, like whatever 150 grand that you made with the seven people or something?
47:46
I forget the exact details of the story.
It was like 7 people that you'd promised to do their gym and instead you sell them this model.
Had you already thought of it in that moment as a license play?
I had, I just, I think honestly a lot of, a lot of the, the words around like what we did came from outside sources because people saw how quickly we grew and we were in a world that was direct response marketing.
48:08
And so many people in that world sell courses.
So they use the words that they know how to describe something.
But it was much closer and arguably like significantly more support than what a franchise does for a franchise.
And that's how we structured.
I wanted to be owner to provide more service, make them more money for a lower fee than a franchise would.
48:26
And potentially this is smarter.
And I'm really my goal in this part of the interview is to help people map the models that you have running in your head that allow you to do the things that you do.
Because even from my perspective, it's very unique.
It's very rare you just have a a real ability to break things down to what I'll call the essence of the thing.
48:47
The anybody listening.
I will tell you right now the biggest mistake you're going to make is what I'll call a category error.
People fail to understand what the true essence of The thing is, which I am as guilty of as anybody.
So I don't put myself outside of this, but have spent a lot of time trying to understand my own feelings and shortcomings.
49:05
So as I'm hearing you tell the story, I'm thinking, OK, one, to identify the license thing is very shrewd.
And so trying to map how you conceptualize the thing feels tied to me to the the same idea of understanding that an individual gym cannot afford to do the market testing that you can afford to do.
49:26
And therefore if you do it, you now have a Moat, you have leverage, you have a service that you can sell.
That is, understanding the true nature of the beast.
Do you ever stop and model the the nature of this thing is and then you break into constituent parts.
49:44
What does that process look like?
And is it universal or is it nail salon nature of, gym nature of?
Yeah, I I boil it down to something probably hilariously simple which is number of potential units sold times gross profit that that's and then and then the you know the tertiary pieces, what upfront our capital investments required to be able to that would enable that right.
50:08
Like if I had, if I had to go buy a machine that could manufacture widgets that have you know phenomenal margins because the value that people get from it is you know $10 and I can make them for $0.10 then that's a you know, great business.
But if I can only sell it to, you know, one town in Alaska because it's a really unique fishing tool that only works in their environment.
50:25
There's elements of that that would make it an attractive business, but there's elements that won't.
So it's like it'd probably be a very small, very profitable business that could not scale.
Nothing wrong with that.
There's definitely a huge place in the economy for things like that.
But when I'm looking at opportunities, that's what I would that is the simplest way of looking at it for me is number of potential units sold, gross profit per unit and then what I'll call competitive dynamics as the as the third part, which is like if you look at, you know, cell phones, it's like what does it cost them to add another cell phone to this massive network?
50:54
Probably not a lot.
Is it really sticky?
Yes.
Do people stay and pay for a long time?
Yes.
OK.
So there's probably a lot of gross profit to be made there.
And how many people need, you know, cell phone service a lot, right.
It's like, OK, so that might be really attractive.
But the competitive dynamics is that I would have to have, I don't know, a billion dollars or I'd have to partner with somebody that would allow me to white label.
51:15
So this is when you get in the competitive dynamics of like, OK, well is there is there value in creating a brand and wrapping on top of an existing solution and say, hey, I might be better at marketing and sales than you and you already have the infrastructure to deliver cell phone services to people nationwide or maybe just in this region.
51:32
And I will do what I'm good at and you deliver on the back and we structure some sort of deal where you know the more volume I get the more of the economics I get to you know participate in.
So those are kind of the the the big three variables that I look at if I'm just trying to analyze a business in terms of opportunity and the and the big piece that I think a lot of folks will miss out on is when I say gross profit, I'm talking lifetime gross profit.
51:54
And so that's where like I have less care about recurring versus not recurring.
You know if from A and this gets into the push and pull of selling a business or not selling a business.
But you know if a if a company has something that's super recurring, let's say it's a service like accounting or bookkeeping and let's say there's really high, you know, gross profits on that because we've automated a ton and we've got some offshore workers doing, you know the remainder of it, we have really amazing margins and it's really sticky.
52:19
That could be a super high gross profit business.
But at the same time, if you're Elon Musk and you sell everyone at Tesla and even if everyone buys one Tesla, that might be still more gross profit than you know, the bookkeeping services just as a completely contrasting example.
And so I just look at what is the lifetime gross profit and some of that might be better structured for recurring and some of it might be better structured for a one time transaction.
52:41
And then I know I'm going into like stuff that will probably bore the audience.
But if you're looking at the business as a product then it then it also becomes you have two customers.
You have the customer that you're selling a product to and then you have the customer that you're going to sell the company to.
And most customers who are investors who are buying companies feel better buying something that is recurring in nature because then they feel that the likelihood that they it will continue to make money in the future is higher.
53:09
Even if the tam's huge all that stuff, they still feel they sleep better on it and so you get a premium for the company.
And so that's that's kind of picture how we think through what companies we want to invest in or at least the opportunities that we could look at.
And then from a personal investing perspective is how much value can we add to that specifically Like I probably wouldn't take on a wireless cell phone company likely, but if there's a, you know, a brick and mortar chain of services that's like Med Spas or beauty or you know how often fit, like that's my wheelhouse, like we know how to crush those.
53:42
And so it decreases my risk because I know that even from a value add perspective, if I can 5X the company because I know how to how to build those marketing and sales processes at scale at the unit level, then the likelihood that I don't get a tremendous return is really low.
OK, there's two things there.
One that's a.
Little quick no, no, no this.
53:59
Is This is amazing and I I hope people are taking this as is intended.
So in fact, let me let me give people A-frame of reference.
This is the way that you should be thinking about what we're talking about right now, which is all of these things abstract so that you can think through novel problems.
54:15
So big data sets with a few filters so you can make quick decisions on massive amounts of data.
What do you mean by that in terms of what we're talking about, right?
Now, so if I if I so, if I so we I get every day on my phone, I'll have a list of all the companies that have applied@acquisition.com and they'll be ranked in terms of like this one looks the most interesting.
54:32
These ones are less interesting and here's why we didn't think they were interesting for my team.
And so I will basically go pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass second call and ask these things and then they'll go and do that for me to be able to quickly make the decision because otherwise I would I would be inundated with the amount of data that I have to take and I have to have filters that are faster just LTV to CAC ratio.
54:57
Like I feel like you can boil down most businesses to what does it cost you to get a customer, what do you make from that customer over the lifetime period.
That's it.
Now Tam is you know how many of those customers can you sell short, but like if I just had, if I could only look at one metric in a business, that's what I would look at.
OK, so most of the entrepreneurs that are listening to this or people that want to be an entrepreneur, no, I think they'll get that.
55:17
But they're that's not where they're going to be at in their journey.
That's certainly a more advanced thing.
So the part that I want to bring you back to is they're going to, they're they're going to be thinking through how do I start a business, what business do I start, how do I identify the opportunity.
55:34
And so there's a couple things that you were just going through that I think are really relevant.
One of them is how you identify the business model.
So looking at a total addressable market, lifetime value of the customer versus what it costs you to get them all 100, they will have to figure that out or they're going to end up doing something dumb, chasing a small opportunity, whatever.
55:54
But the all of those metrics will change based on the decision that they make around what business model to pursue.
So I'll just by way of what a business model is, selling courses, that's one business model, licensing a business is another business model.
56:09
So people you're saying even when they try to retell your story, they are confusing the two.
So, but very different when it comes to execution.
There's no recurring course model.
Those just wild side of that, right.
So how do you process through if if you were starting, so not as when you're looking to acquire, how do you process through what is the right business model to pursue?
56:35
So this is pulled from my $100 million offers book, Which goes the point of that book was to answer the question, what do I sell.
And I think that a lot of people, especially when you're starting out, you're like I need a business plan, I need AI.
Don't think any business I've had has had a business plan as an aside.
It's just what are we going to sell and how we're going to get customers and then from there we build everything around it and so.
56:56
Isn't that a business plan?
I have two things on my plan.
I mean I've seen like 16 page business plans and I'm like OK, all these numbers are made-up.
It doesn't matter like do you know how to get customers and so picking the avatar which is the customer that you want to go after and then picking the problem that you want to solve for them and probably you want to solve as I feel like kind of a trite term in the in a entrepreneur space.
57:24
But you usually want to make their lives easier in some way.
It's usually going to track down a status or it's going to track down a time.
Like those are those are two huge buckets that that can that cover a lot of stuff.
And you know, different people say there's health, wealth and and relationships.
There's, you know there's a million bigger buckets that you can try and chunk this stuff into.
57:42
But if you are starting out, so let me just get you really tactical.
So we were just really clouds for a second.
Let me just get you tactical #1.
You can go and set up all of your autos of incorporation, your LLC and all that stuff online with a few clicks of a button under 30 minutes.
57:58
So you do that a step one.
Step 2, you take those papers to a bank and you get a bank account.
Step three, you hook up a payment processor to that bank account, which is again a series of clicks that nowadays are almost automated.
Once you have those three things, you get a stranger to give you money in exchange for doing something for them.
58:15
And so I would categorize businesses as I see them Usually as you either sell products, you sell services, so physical products, something like a mug, right?
You sell services, you do something that they would otherwise have to do for them.
You write software that does something that a human would do for them.
58:30
But because you have an, you have automation with code, you can get them to do it or you create things that entertain people that they want to have access to.
And so there's basically function into media.
Again, you've got people, products, code and and and and and content.
58:46
So it actually breaks out to those four types of businesses.
And I think that most people, if you have no, like let's say you aren't a software developer right and you want to start a business, The easiest ones to start are either the easiest one to start is a service business because it only requires your time and you to learn a skill that other people can also learn.
59:07
But some people just might not want to do it and that is all you need to solve.
And I remember like when I was in college and I've I spoke at some universities for for entrepreneurship and everyone there is always like here's my business idea, right.
And it's always like weird gidgets, widgets and gizmos and like these these never before seen businesses and most of those will fail.
59:30
Whereas like if you want to make your first business and the big fallacy is that the 1st is going to be the forever business, which it won't.
Most entrepreneurs have many business over their career and each business you learn elements that help you build a bigger and Better Business the next time.
And so you start with something that people already buy.
59:49
So it's like you can look what do people already buy?
They already buy lawn care services.
They could mow their lawn.
They just choose not to.
They could optimize the website for SEO.
They just choose not to.
They could run their own ads.
They just choose not to.
They could edit their own videos.
They just choose not to.
You could set up e-mail, you know, auto responders for people, but they choose not to.
1:00:08
You could set up voicemails for businesses and and transcribe it and send it to them because for those people it saves them time.
And so you can pick any problem you want that someone already does or already purchases, look at the solutions and you can literally just do it the same way and have a way to get customers.
That's it.
1:00:24
Like that's that's it.
You just reach out to people that you know. one-on-one, you reach out to strangers one-on-one.
You make content about the problem and you run ads.
There's the only four things that you can do to let other people know about your stuff.
So once you decide what you have to sell, you then use the core four, one of them pick and then you let people know about it until eventually someone says yeah, I'd be interested in you solving that problem for me and that's how you make your first dollar.
1:00:45
All right, Focus becomes the problem.
People end up getting really scattered.
They want to try a bunch of different things and see what sticks.
How?
How do you make focus work for you and not against you?
I.
Feel like focus can only work for you, I guess.
Lack of focus.
1:01:02
The nightmare scenario most people spend their time in.
Yeah, I think it's so I love showing this visual and maybe we can grab it at post for this.
But if you imagine a curve right where you go, you start here a little bit above the line at Uninformed Optimism, is that you see your buddies doing drop shipping and he's making money.
1:01:24
And so you're like, wow, this must be amazing.
I will do that too.
So then you leave your current opportunity to do, or maybe you start.
You start doing that.
Then you move to stage two.
So you go over the hump of excitement and then you go to informed pessimism.
Now you're below the line.
Then you're like, wow, OK, you had.
1:01:39
There's a lot of other stuff that's really competitive.
I don't have a brand.
It's hard to differentiate.
You know, the cost of goods is actually continuing to rise, and so are ad costs.
And you start realizing the other things that you didn't know before, so you have a a slightly more realistic view of the opportunity.
Then you go to stage 3, which is the value of despair, where you're like, nothing's working, I don't know what I'm doing.
1:01:56
And this point is where everyone then jumps to uninformed optimism in the next opportunity, and they replete, repeat 123123123 until they're eventually able to learn that they just need to stomach, because every single business has shit.
And when the grass is green on the other side, it's because there's lots of manure there, right?
1:02:14
Same as yours.
And then you go up to informed optimism and then you hit achievement.
And so those are the five stages that I see most entrepreneurs going through.
And they continue to cycle the first three over and over again until they learn the lesson.
So this is a skill.
1:02:31
Focus is a skill.
I can train someone to do it.
If you're in the same environment and you're at this point where you're not sure what to do, but other people have succeeded at this thing and then you think something else is easier that you find out about, that is a stimulus that we can then say, here's the red flash card, are you going to duck or are you going to get slapped?
1:02:48
And realistically, most people just need to keep getting slapped until eventually they realize that nothing is going to be easy and they have to go through the period of not knowing what they're doing.
Because that's like that in essence is what entrepreneurship feels like, is uncertainty of whether or not all of the time that you've put in is actually going to work out.
1:03:04
And you have to get really comfortable with that, is that you won't know because if you were to be guaranteed the outcome that you're going to get what you want, you wouldn't want to do it to begin with because everyone would already be doing it, because it's already guaranteed, which means the opportunity is gone.
So the opportunity is in the uncertainty.
1:03:20
And so as long as you can embrace that, which is why you have to sum tolerance for risk as an entrepreneur, because you have to pay down your tax of ignorance, which we all have to pay down every single day for not knowing the things we should know.
And the only way you do, you pay down that tax is that you test and you iterate.
And so you just want to get as many Nos out of the way, as many failures out of the way because you're not actually failing.
1:03:38
You made progress.
It wasn't yes or no.
Did it work or not?
It's how well did it work?
And I think if you can make even that frame shift, you're like, OK, well, I'm reaching out to people.
They're responding, but I'm not getting them on the phone.
OK well, then you have a scripting issue.
OK, Then you get them on the phone.
OK, well, they're not buying.
OK Well, then it might be a offer issue.
1:03:55
It still might be a sales issue.
Depends on why they're not buying.
If they're saying, you know, it's price, it's like, you might be mispriced, but you also might just be really terrible at explaining the value.
And so you just continue to work your way down until eventually someone's like, yeah, that sounds good.
And they read you their credit card over the phone and you're like, holy shit, this is actually happening and you make your first dollar and I promise you have to make your first dollar.
1:04:12
The second one comes 100 times faster than the first one did.
If there are many variables present, many variables must be tested.
Must be studied.
Must be studied, Yeah, that is certainly marketing summed up there.
No doubt that people are going to have a hard time figuring that out.
1:04:31
I want to better understand, you just did a book launch for your most recent book and it, I mean you set records.
It was unreal.
I mean really like blew people's minds.
1:04:46
Set a standard in in the world of online marketing.
What was it about that, that, or what did you demonstrate in the way that you did that that other people don't understand?
So with each book I wanted to demonstrate the concept of the book with the book itself.
1:05:03
And so offers when I released it was $1.99.
I've now since made it free, but it was $1.99 on Kindle.
It had a course that went with it that many people charged 5000 or $10,000 for and it was the sub headline of the book and offer.
1:05:19
So good people feel stupid saying no.
And so I actually launched that book with a single post when I had 10,000 followers on Instagram.
That's it.
And every month after the first month, it continued to sell more and more copies into this day, continue to sell more copies every month.
And that is based on the offer being exceptional and people sharing it because they got tremendous value relative to what they paid.
1:05:39
That was the that is the entire concept of the book.
The, the core framework of that book is is called the the value equation which we'll get into.
But that is basically people say the word value, but how do you operationalize value, right.
And so that book is about operationalizing value, making the thing that you currently sell more valuable in the perception of the customer.
1:05:55
So they're willing to trade more of their money for it.
The leads book had an entirely different core concept, which was the core 4 and the four lead getters and that is the advertising cycle.
And so it's how do you let other people know about your stuff.
And so the sub headline of that book was how to get strangers to want to buy your stuff.
1:06:13
Now to be fair, it's not, it's not how to get strangers to buy your stuff because that's sales, but how to get them to want to buy your stuff is advertising.
And so this book sits literally just between they don't know who you are and they show interest, and that's where the book ends.
You get lots of leads saying I'm interested, I'd like to find out more about your stuff.
1:06:31
And that's all I could fit in one book to make it actually effective and operational for most people.
And so since the concept of the book was to advertise and to get lots of leads, then I thought it would be appropriate to advertise and get lots of leads.
1:06:46
And I used every method in the book, all eight, for the book launch, even though I could just have made a post on my, you know, across all my social medias and probably sold plenty of books just doing that.
But I wanted to show that this stuff works today and it will work in 100 years.
And it worked 100 years ago.
1:07:02
And so I went through, I had some people that I reached out to one-on-one purposely just to check the box.
I reached out to some cool people so I could do podcasts.
I ran ads for it.
Even I didn't need to run ads.
We still got 137,000 people from ads.
We had affiliates.
We got 104,000 people there from affiliates.
1:07:18
We had 27,000 affiliates promote the book.
We had customer referrals.
People sent their friends there.
So I had an incentive that if you just get 10 people to come, you'll get two bonus chapters that aren't released with the book affiliates, which is the the another lead getter, right?
1:07:33
I mentioned it earlier, but affiliates, we got them to, to promote the book.
We got agencies who actually were the ones who ran the ads for us because we don't run ads at Holdco because we don't transact.
And then employees, which is the 4th type of lead getter, which is they do the core 4 on your behalf for you.
1:07:49
So we had Mozi Media, which is our internal content team made all the content and the ads for that matter for the event and the book itself.
And so I actually only did 17 long, 17 short form pieces of content and six long form pieces of content.
And then that got cut into 143 posts that we did over six weeks on top of the 2200 posts that we were making anyways over that same period of time.
1:08:16
And so I used all the methods in the book to demonstrate, to give proof that the book works.
And so you know the next book, I'll try and continue that meta theme of I have concepts in this book and I will show you that they work because I will use them to mark and promote the book.
1:08:33
The thing that I really want to make sure that people understand, and if you think I'm crazy, definitely let me know.
But I doubt you will.
The reason that all of that worked so well isn't what you did at the time.
It's what you did for the years leading up to that moment.
Building brand, building awareness, generating massive amounts of goodwill.
1:08:55
Is that like, what amount of magnification did the whatever 4:00-ish years leading up to the launch of that book play in the the launch's success?
It was everything.
I mean, it was everything.
1:09:11
Now that being said, you could still absolutely use it, like you can still use warm outreach.
You can see it's called outreach, you can still like.
And one of the concepts in the book is making content.
And I talk about how I structure content and how we pick topics, how we pick headlines, how we format it, how we do all those things so that people can use that and make content for themselves.
But usually the longer you can wait before making any ask.
1:09:30
And to be fair that I gave the book for free and if if you wanted to buy a physical copy, you could.
That was the whole that was.
Let me, let's spoil the surprise of the launch was that I gave everything away for free and said if they want to buy physical copy, you could.
I'm, I can't wait to write the book on brand because I have a lot of thoughts on it and I can't wait to have really clearly crystallized like, you know, beyond reproach ideas about brand.
1:09:55
But I'll give you a working teaser for for how it works.
But brand is basically teaching.
It's associating something people know with something they don't know.
And we associate these things enough that eventually I can remove this and then you'll associate water with my hand.
And so if I do that enough times and I have, you know, water and you know, coffee and whatever, then you might generalize and say the hand is a beverage thing.
1:10:20
Right?
And I like thinking about it that way because what do I want people to associate me with?
I want people to associate me with tremendous value.
I want people to associate me with long term goodwill.
I want them to associate me with money, right.
So that every book's $100 million something offers $100 leads.
1:10:38
And so I want them to associate me with investing, which is what a lot of the stories that I talk about are companies that we've invested in and that we owned and scaled or exited.
And so I we do those things so that when you have a brand, a brand is put on something to direct someone's behavior is a is a physical sign.
1:10:55
So if you look at the, you know, original the origins of the word brand was a brand, you put it on a cow, right.
And so if you have a cow that doesn't have a brand and a cow that does have a brand, you will behave differently with a cow that has a brand on it.
You're not going to go capture it.
You're not going to go kill it.
You might return it to its, its neighbor or whatever like the brand changes your behavior.
1:11:13
And so brands have at least as far as I'm concerned like these.
You know, I haven't read the book yet, but have kind of two, two continuums.
You have the strength of the brand and then you have the positive or negative inclination towards its away or towards.
So like Nazis for example, have a very strong brand away for most people.
1:11:33
Now to be fair, there's also a subset of people who are super strong towards, there's a subset of people who, right.
It changes their behavior.
Yes, it does.
And then and the inclination says towards her away to some degree.
You know, Donald Trump has a strong brand, right, for many people.
1:11:50
For, for a percentage of the population it's, it's negative and for a percentage of population it's positive, right.
And so when we think about brands that way, it's been helpful for me because you really answer the question, who and what do I want to associate myself with?
And then by doing that, eventually your logo and your identity will then have a set of things that people associate with, which then will change their behavior.
1:12:15
Which is why I think brands are the most valuable things that you can build because it really becomes a way to influence the behavior of the masses at scale.
And so if every single person recognizes the Nike swoosh and I can take a water bottle and then put a Nike swoosh on it and triple how much I can charge for it and still get more people to buy it, then you can measure the strength of the brand by the difference in price between the commoditized version of it and the branded version of it.
1:12:43
And that translates into tremendous profits from a from a capitalistic perspective.
And so if you're trying to build something really valuable, then you make many associations that are positive for specific audience.
Because I think Black Rifle coffee, right.
They're kind of like politically charged.
Ish, right.
1:12:59
So Black rifle coffee is going to be really positive for people who are probably right leaning in terms of their associations with that brand.
It'll probably be kind of negative for the the people who are more left-leaning and that's OK because they're like we can sell to half the population whatever.
And so I'm I'm kind of agnostic to the direction of it and obviously Nazis negative on that.
1:13:20
But like for for most of these things, I'm just looking at what is, what is the percentage likelihood that people will to hear or comply with the requests that the brand makes of them, buy my thing, go to this thing, whatever.
And so that is the that's why you can have somebody has a huge brand in terms of the amount of people who are aware of it but have very low ability to direct or change behavior.
1:13:41
And so you probably, I'm sure you know this better than anyone with Quest.
You guys were one of the first ones getting in the influencer space like way back, way back when the term influencer was a new term and you probably saw some people with million person accounts and they couldn't drive any sales.
And then you saw somebody with 15,000 and crushed it because they had a stronger brand for a narrower audience.
1:14:03
Even if it was just like a girl cop who has an audience of all girl cops, they might have lots of positive associations with that person and then be more likely to, you know, comply with whatever request they have.
And so I know this is a branding discussion, but the reason that I think many people wanted to come to the event is because they were rewarded in the past for consuming content for reading my last book.
1:14:28
And so they felt like the likelihood that I was going to reward them again at this event would be high.
And I try to like, I'll tell you a secret, I try to make many promises and keep all of them.
And the more times you can make promises and keep promises, the higher the likelihood people will ascribe to you for being somebody who is predictable in a good way.
1:14:49
If he said this will happen, this is what's going to happen.
If he said it's going to be worth it, it's going to be worth it.
And so that was woven in for the 24 months from the time I released offers to the time we did leads.
Was trying to actively build up the goodwill so that we could set records and do something really cool and demonstrate the concepts in the book in the real world so that people could know that it would work for them too.
1:15:11
I mean, it's incredible.
It's breathtaking what you guys were able to do.
What was a record that you broke?
So the Guinness Book World Records for a Business Virtual Conference Live was 21,000 for business.
Conference so you absolutely.
Demolished, yeah.
That.
1:15:27
Which is really cool.
That's awesome.
But I will say this as an aside.
I think the, the, the, the fanfare about the launch will decrease soonish.
And I think that the actual contents of the book is going to be the thing that that can that people that is that machine will start spinning.
Because inside of the book referrals is always the one that I always try and drive the most in any business I have because it's the lowest cost to acquire customers.
1:15:48
Not that it's a customer acquisition thing for me, but or sorry, not a money making thing for me.
Books are not the best way to make money, just throw that out there.
But it can create a viral effect so that you can get more customers every month without paying a cost to acquire.
And so the mission of acquisition.com is to make real business education accessible for everyone.
1:16:05
And so in order to do that, I can't do it alone.
And so that is why I have to have other people help me.
Yeah, you're only going to scale as much as you can get high quality people to help you, that's for sure.
There was something fascinating that happened during your launch, which I would love to hear from a guy who did not in the beginning consider himself a salesperson, somebody that has gotten very good at sales.
1:16:30
And as I was saying in our first interview, which The funny thing is, I ended up taking you on a side tangent before you answered it, But I said the world does not think you're creepy.
Why aren't you?
Creepy when it comes to.
Sales.
But there there was a a moment, which you did on purpose, but I want to know what you're going to say.
1:16:46
It doesn't matter.
It's all about behavior.
But I want to understand what you think about this.
So you intentionally took people on an emotional roller coaster ride where you start, I'm going to give you this for free and I'm going to give you this.
But if I asked you or sorry, I'm going to give you this normally goes for this much and this normally goes for this much, but you're crossing it out.
1:17:02
Classic thing where you didn't ask for money.
Now you could see the comments coming through at the time and people turned on you.
And I'm assuming they were saying something akin to I knew it, this guy's just after money, whatever.
If there's nothing wrong with sales, why did they turn on you?
Actually, so I don't know why they turned on me.
1:17:22
I can make a guess, but at the end of the day like I'm never going to know what the main.
Reason was you knew they were going to you.
I did that on purpose.
I had AI had AI.
Don't know why I knew that.
So when people see this thing, there is an aversive reaction to it in a certain percentage of the population.
1:17:38
That being said, I got a zillion messages to be with me.
Like, dude, I was ready to give you my credit card at 5K.
And so sure, like, we could have taken $50 million at the event, but what I wanted was, you know, $500 million of value to many people that later will come through companies that get started and scaled using the stuff and then they want to partner with us.
1:17:57
But the reason that I did it was, or at least this was my hope for doing it, was that I wanted people to remember it.
And so memory is driven by emotion.
And so I I took this roller coaster approach because I also wanted to subvert the audience.
If I just said, hey, it's all free, it's all amazing.
1:18:14
Here it is.
I don't think nearly as many people would have talked about the thing.
I also don't think they would have perceived the value as high.
So I wanted to sell them on the value of this thing and then give it to them rather than just saying if I got on and said, hey guys, there's a free course with eight different things in there that are, you know, I spent a lot of time on go enjoy them.
1:18:33
I mean, it would have been fine.
People would be like, you're amazing.
But doing it this way, it becomes like, I think a lot about this is like, what is that person going to tell the next person?
Like, what words are they going to say?
They're probably going to be like, dude, he did this like fake pitch and he like and he like everybody was going left and then all of a sudden he made it all free.
1:18:50
He was unreal, like the like, the place went nuts like that.
They will remember.
And that was what I was going for.
I figured there was a higher likelihood that they would remember it if I did it that way.
Yeah, I think you are very correct about that.
Talk to me more about your mission.
So, and I I would I like to put this big disclaimer out up front.
1:19:11
I am a a ruthless capitalist.
I am absolutely here to make money.
I am not a St.
I have no like many nice things were said about me after the event.
And I also remember that the same people also threw stones at me 30 seconds earlier.
So like that doesn't sway me a ton, but I'm letting everybody know I'm here to make money.
1:19:31
I'm just measuring how I make my money over a longer time horizon.
That's all it is.
And so I could have taken $50 million, you know, from from the event.
I think that's a really realistic number.
But if I do one deal from somebody of the now probably million something people who have just even just seen the event recording or where they're live, I will probably make more than $50 million and also get a brand that continues to compound at a faster rate.
1:20:04
And so to be clear, I don't think there's anything wrong with monetizing an audience.
I don't think there's anything wrong.
It really comes down to keeping promises.
So like for example, like I, I will probably be launching some product at some point in the in the future, whatever could that be.
1:20:20
Yeah.
And I don't think that I will have any negative response to it.
And so it really just comes down to like what have you promised or what expectations have you set and then are you meeting those expectations.
And so I think my my view on this has shifted a little bit over time is I used to think like you have to exceed expectations, but now I think that it's really just like can you perfectly meet the expectations the person has.
1:20:41
Now somebody might have really high expectations, but you try and set them and meet them and you do that cycle as many times as you can.
So that their predictive measure of trust with you, if you want to operationalize that, is that you are trustworthy because you keep your promises.
And so I think that's a lot more like the the other reason is that within the, unfortunately within the the course creation world, this is one man's two cents.
1:21:05
All right.
Now, I want to be really clear about this because people get their pennies in a bunch.
You can choose to feed your family whatever way you need to.
I have zero judgment on it.
What I do acknowledge is that people make associations and so I could find the most ethical porn business in the entire world.
1:21:21
As soon as I stand on stage and talk about our porn company, I will forever be associated with porn.
Is there anything wrong with that?
Yes or no?
I don't know.
For me, I think that there is.
There are other businesses that I would like to do that I would like to do a deal with that might view that negatively.
1:21:38
And so it might prevent me from doing a much bigger deal in the future by having that.
And so I won't do it not out of principle, but out of pure dollars and cents, materialism, if you want to call it that.
And so the course world, to that point, has a lot of charlatans and a lot of people who make promises and break promises and a lot of people who set bad expectations or unrealistic expectations, and then people get really frustrated and upset over what they get.
1:22:11
And so for me, even if I had the best course in the world, I wouldn't want to sell the information because it would associate me with that group.
And so I've taken a lot of time to disassociate myself with that category.
1:22:28
And it was because I I mean I was a brick and mortar owner, but like I learned a lot of direct response marketing in that world.
So I made a lot of friends in that world who then make, make commentary and then put me on stages.
And so I had a really strong associations earlier on with that community.
Now again, nothing wrong with that community I'm saying, but the associations that I would prefer to have with my brand are the ones that I said earlier which might seem in direct conflict with that which is like long term oriented enterprise value, being patient, giving first.
1:22:53
Like these are all things that many people in that community, not all, but many people.
And in that instance, especially with branding, in my opinion, the good apples do get thrown out with the bad.
So I do absolutely think that there are amazing education businesses that exist.
Absolutely, like bar none, period.
1:23:11
End of statement.
There are just so many that aren't that it's very difficult to make the association.
And so that's why I think if if I had let's say a no strip that I was going to come out with or I had a dessert company that I was going to come out with, I don't think anyone would have any issue supporting that or me saying like hey, I want to want to build this with you guys and put this in public.
1:23:29
I think these are all things that people will be totally fine with.
But why?
It's because of the expectations that I said at the beginning and so acting in accordance with that over a long period of time.
And to 1 sub note on that is that I do believe that brands can change over time.
And so the concept we were talking about earlier with like successive approximation, we're like if you are one shade to the right, one shade to the right, one shade to the right, you can slowly move a brand.
1:23:52
Now whenever you make that move, you will lose some people who liked the thing that you had before and you will gain some people that like the new thing.
And the idea of repositioning or you know, directing a brand is making sure that that trade off is positive.
It's like it's like the local band that you know has that local, you know, vibe, whatever.
1:24:11
And then they they go a little bit more mainstream and then all their early fans are like they sold out.
But what they really did was they trade a small group of people for a much larger group of people and more people like this brand than the old brand because if they like the old brand, they would have already been big.
And so it's really just a calculated trade on what you're willing to associate with that more people will have a positive strong association with to make it increasingly likely that they will do what you would like them to do that helps you with your long term goal.
1:24:40
So zooming in on your the mission of your company, which is to make entrepreneurship accessible or business accessible to everyone, you have a quote which I think is really, really interesting.
Businesses solve problems.
Businesses make the world better.
1:24:56
There are too many problems for any one person to solve.
I want to help create as many businesses as possible so we can solve as many problems as we can.
What are some of the problems that you think business can solve?
I mean, I would probably have a shorter list of problems that businesses can't solve.
